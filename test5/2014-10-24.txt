Top 10 Most Unbelievable Excuses for Calling in SickTop 10 most unbelievable excuses for calling in sick
Ben Popken TODAY
Email
Video: Career Builder offers a roundup of the craziest excuses employees have given for calling out sick, including one who said they had a casserole in the oven, and another who reported that they accidentally got on a plane.
Faking a cough sounds so boring compared to these sick day excuses. CareerBuilder released its 2014 roundup of the year's most unbelievable excuses bosses have heard from employees. If they're to be believed, American workers got into some serious hijinks this year.
Here are the top excuses from their representative sample of 2,203 hiring managers and HR professionals across companies:
10. Employee just put a casserole in the oven.
9. Employee’s plastic surgery for enhancement purposes needed some "tweaking" to get it just right.
8. Employee was sitting in the bathroom and her feet and legs fell asleep. When she stood up, she fell and broke her ankle.
7. Employee had been at the casino all weekend and still had money left to play with on Monday morning.
6. Employee woke up in a good mood and didn't want to ruin it.
5. Employee had a “lucky night” and didn’t know where he was.
4. Employee got stuck in the blood pressure machine at the grocery store and couldn't get out.
3. Employee had a gall stone they wanted to heal holistically.
2. Employee caught their uniform on fire by putting it in the microwave to dry.
1. Employee accidentally got on a plane.

While these could give you a stitch in your side from laughing, faking a sick day is no joke. One in four employers have caught an employee faking a sick day by checking his or her Twitter or other social media feeds. And one in five have fired a worker caught in a lie.

More than half of middle-class Americans say they plan to save more for retirement "later" to make up for not saving enough now.When it comes to retirement savings, 'later' is a bad word
Kelli B. Grant CNBC
Email
Procrastination can pay for last-minute sports tickets or 11th-hour holiday  bargains. But when it comes to retirement savings? Bad idea.
More than half of middle-class Americans say they plan to save more for  retirement "later" to make up for not saving enough now, according to a new  Wells Fargo survey. Worse, many aren't saving at all—34 percent of the 1,001  adults surveyed aren't currently setting money aside for retirement and 20  percent have no retirement savings. The median balance among savers is $20,000,  down from $25,000 last year.

Don't procrastinate when it comes to saving for retirement. Save early, save often.
"That's a big problem," said Joe Ready, director of institutional retirement  and trust for Wells Fargo. "You're already not saving enough, so you're kicking  this empty can down the road."
Postponements can make a big difference in your final account balance. By  Ready's calculations, a 25-year-old who saves $100 per month until he retires at  65, with a 6.5 percent annual return, would have accumulated more than $225,000.  Wait until age 40 to start those contributions, and the balance would be a much  slimmer $75,000.
"I don't know how much of this is survival and [how much is] the mindset that  they'll be able to catch up over their career trajectory," said Lazetta Rainey  Braxton, a certified financial planner in Baltimore, Md. Of course, the basic  advice is to save more, but strategies can vary depending on which of those two  categories you fall into. 
Video: TODAY financial editor Jean Chatzky offers advice on how to live comfortably in retirement, suggesting waiting until you’re 70 to collect Social Security benefits.
Consumers who don't feel like they have any wiggle room in their budget to  save for retirement will benefit from analyzing their cash flow and looking for  areas to cut back. "It's pretty basic. Either you increase your income or  decrease your expenses," said Rainey Braxton. Even small amounts can add  up over years of compounding—especially with advantages like a 401(k) employer  match.
Although consumers expressed concerns over balancing savings and regular  monthly bills, survey results indicate there's some fat to be cut: 56  percent said that "later" they would cut splurges such as spa treatments and  jewelry to save more for retirement, and 55 percent would dine out less  frequently. Half also said they would postpone big purchases like a home  renovation or car.

Consumers who have concrete expectations of having more disposable  income in a few years—say, after a college-bound child's final tuition payment  or once they've moved up the career ladder—still need to plan. Later  contributions have less time to grow, meaning you'll need to contribute more to  have the same ending balance as if you'd started today. Freezing current  expenses can help capitalize on those raises and windfalls, said Rainey Braxton.  
In either case, it can help to have a written plan, something as simple as  "I'm currently saving $X per month, and want to get to $Y," said Ready. The 28  percent of survey respondents who had such a plan were setting aside a median  $250 a month, compared with $100 among those who didn't.

Feder: New CBS channel turns back timeThat’s the way it was: New CBS channel turns back time

Walter Cronkite
Walter Cronkite will be back on TV. And I for one couldn’t be happier.
That’s the headline as far as I’m concerned out of news this week that CBS is launching a new digital network called Decades in partnership with Chicago-based Weigel Broadcasting.
Set to debut this spring on a digital subchannel of WBBM-Channel 2 and 15 other CBS-owned stations nationwide, Decades will feature news and entertainment programming culled from the network’s vast library and organized around theme and dates. It will mark the first time CBS 2 is utilizing its digital tiers.
Neal Sabin, vice chairman of Weigel Broadcasting and the programming genius behind MeTV, Me-Too, The U and the just-launched Heroes & Icons, among other channels, said he hopes to air as many of Cronkite’s vintage broadcasts as possible, including perhaps nightly runs of the “CBS Evening News” from the Cronkite era. Way to go, Neal.
Revered by millions as “The Most Trusted Man in America,” Cronkite stepped down as anchorman of the “CBS Evening News” in 1981 and died in 2009 at age 92. But his archive of work represents an unparalleled record of the second half of the 20th century.
Neal Sabin
“The overall concept of Decades is to create a daily time capsule of historical events of all types — hard news, pop culture and entertainment,” Sabin said. “Our relationship with CBS News will enable Decades to tell these stories via legendary journalists such as Walter Cronkite. Viewers will relive — or for younger viewers, experience for the first time — how events large and small were first brought to the attention of the American public.”
A centerpiece of the network will be “Decades Retrospectical,” a daily one-hour program that will be produced around the news events and cultural touchstones of a specific day, week or theme. Shows presented each day will reflect that day’s theme or commemorative event, according to CBS.
Entertainment programming will be drawn from among more than 100 classic series going as far back as “I Love Lucy,” which debuted in 1951.
“Decades is the most ambitious and creative subchannel programming service that has ever been created,” Peter Dunn, president of CBS Television Stations, said in a statement. “We are thrilled to partner with Weigel Broadcasting, the leaders in this space, to make smart use of our stations’ spectrums and our companies’ considerable programming assets. This service will be a tremendous new business for CBS and all of the other stations across the country that participate, regardless of their primary network affiliation.”
Added Sabin: “In a video marketplace filled with more and more trivial information and exploitation, Decades will showcase substance and class, and have some fun in doing so.”

Should Retailers Be Scared of the Amazon Storereddit
In 2003, founder and CEO of Amazon, Jeff Bezos coined the word 'unstore' to describe what made Amazon unique. It's a philosophy he has run his business by over the last 20 years; limitless shelf space, always on, reviewable, and cheap. Seemingly no longer content with dominating online retail, Bezos has moved away from his founding philosophy to launch a physical store, just in time for Christmas. Situated in the heart of New York, the shop will let customers purchase Amazon branded products and take advantage of a same day click and collect service.
I'm just not feeling it. Although it might be a growing trend for online retailers to exploit the frenzied xmas market with a pop up presence on the high street, I just don't think Amazon can live up to its own expectations when it comes to the bricks and mortar store. Amazon has perfected the art of ecommerce, taking away the risk of buying stuff online, and making it seamless, accessible, and low priced. While it does ecommerce exceptionally well, retail experience it does not.
As Amazon has done for online, a store such as Selfridges has refined the art of the department store. The experience is just that - an experience. People flock to Selfridges, not just to shop but to socialise and be entertained, making Selfridges a place to be. Of course I shop online all the time, but I don't get excited by it in the same way I do when I see the lavish displays to celebrate Halloween or of course Christmas. It's sometimes just good to potter and be part of the store, be part of the experience of consuming.
Amazon's store as it stands is never going to excite me.  Whilst the store will I'm sure bring the online retail giant some benefits, it just doesn't sit well with the Amazon brand - the 'unstore'. The store in New York ultimately will only be granting access to a smaller range of their products slightly sooner than they offer online - how is this better than what they are currently offering?
As bricks and mortar retail becomes more about the customer experience, it naturally follows that it is the brand stores that are delivering. Take Nike for example, or Apple. They both ensure that retail experience reflects the brand and all it stands for. Their product is their holy grail, and the stores focus on the product, not the cost. A cluttered store centred around bargains and money off will reduce the experience. Simple.
If Amazon was to build a store around its brand, it would be a store that is always open, has huge amount of product and is cheap. I just don't see how, on the basis of where Amazon is coming from; never having created a physical store before, never having built a brand beyond online, never having looked at the physical experience of the customer; they will be able to execute a store that will be any better, or any different to anyone else.
The store in New York has built the hype around Amazon once again, and in its twentieth year of trading, Amazon knows the best way to be talked about is by being forward thinking, just look at the announcement of the 30 minute delivery by drone.
Bezos is a smart guy. I mean really smart. He is an exceptional individual. With his intellect and business philosophy, if Bezos really did decided to take Amazon to the high street, then that store would also be exceptional. And it is at that point, and that point only, that retailers should take note.
Now? This store is about hype, not retail.

12 retail chains that are closing stores12 retail chains closing stores the fastest

AP/Sears
Sears stores continue to be even more of an endangered species as the retailer closes more locations.
And Sears isn’t alone.
There are 12 retailers in the very broad Russell 3000 index, including Sears (SHLD) , apparel seller Christopher & Banks (CBK) and toy builder Build-A-Bear Workshop (BBW) that have fewer stores now than they had two years ago, according to a USA TODAY analysis of data from S&P Capital IQ.
Keep in mind that this analysis only evaluated retailers that reported the number of stores they had open in the most recent quarter and two years ago. Many retailers only disclose their number of stores on an annual basis, so they were excluded due to the lack of data. Sears disputes recent reports of store closures , but the company’s financial reports show the chain has been shrinking.
Investors are certainly not pleased when retailers shut stores. That’s almost guaranteed to cut revenue. Shares of the 12 retailers that have closed stores over the past two years are down an average of 3.7% this year as investors shift their retail money to companies that are growing.
Sears is the fastest shrinking retailer — by far. It reported 2,302 stores as of its latest quarter, S&P Capital IQ says, which is down 40% over the past two years. Just this year the stock is down 27%.
Women’s apparel seller Christopher & Banks has reduced its store footprint by 16% over the past two years. It reported 545 stores as of its most-recent quarter. The stock is down almost as much as Sears’ this year: 25.8%.
But closing stores isn’t always bad news. Build-your-own teddy-bear shop Build-A-Bear Workshop has taken its store count down 11.4% over the past two years. But it’s been focusing on high-traffic areas mostly in tourist areas. The stock has doubled this year as the company’s cash flow has improved as it drives more profit from fewer stores.

EBOLA STOCKS IN PLAY

Bigger not always better for 26 companiesBigger not always better for 26 companies

Earnings season is a chance to see which companies are dominating their industries. But investors are currently trying to figure out if size is an edge, or a disadvantage.
There are 26 stocks in the broad Russell 1000 index, including shoemaker Nike (NKE) , Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) and online retailer Amazon.com (AMZN) that dwarf the competition in terms of revenue, according to a USA TODAY analysis of data from S&P Capital IQ.
To make the list, the companies need to post at least triple the revenue of their nearest competitor in the same industry classification. To make it a fair fight, the industry also must have more than one company in it. The list shows the companies that have gained enormous revenue leads over their industry peers.
But here’s where things get complicated in today’s market. Investors might think that bigger is better. And in some ways it is – in terms of giving the titan companies resources and reach. But so far this year, having a big size advantage over the competition hasn’t automatically translated into stock market gains. The opposite is actually the case.
These 26 biggest-in-class stocks are up 0.4% on average this year, which is underperforming the S&P 500’s 4.3% increase. Investors are closely watching these companies to see if size ends up as an advantage as the economic recovery ages, or if there’s a shift going on where smaller companies win out by being able to more quickly change and adapt.
There’s good reason for the confusion. Warren Buffett has long preferred industry giants — as they have massive size to conquer rivals. But consider one of Warren Buffett’s picks that isn’t working out so well this year: International Business Machines (IBM) , is the leader in the IT Consulting industry. It’s 225% larger than the No. 2, Accenture (ACN) . But shares of IBM are down 14% this year. Accenture is down too, but not nearly as much: 5.8%.
Here’s another example of an industry titan struggling. Amazon.com’s revenue of $145.7 billion over the past 12 months is 979% higher than the next biggest player: Priceline.com. This huge lead over competitors gives Amazon the luxury to experience with money-losing propositions it hopes will pay off in the future. Investors will be paying attention to how the company is using its lead when it reports quarterly results Thursday. But shares of Amazon — despite the company towering over any of its online rivals — are down 22% this year.
But that’s not to say size has universally been a detriment. Buffett, the king of looking for companies with defensible positions, crushes the competition himself. His Berkshire Hathaway posted revenue of more than $342 billion over the past 12 months, which is 1468% greater than the closest rival in the Multi-Sector holdings industry, Leucadia (LUK) . And shares of Berkshire are well ahead of the market this year, gaining 16.1%.
Investors, too, know that size can give companies advantages in purchasing and distribution. Nike is a classic example of a company that’s pulled ahead like a nimble rival. Despite efforts by rivals to challenge the company’s dominance of the shoe business, Nike posted 1,714% more revenue over the past twelve months than the second biggest player in the footwear industry – Ugg boots maker Deckers (DECK) . Nike is up 14% this year, making it one of the year’s stand-out big companies in all the S&P 500.
This year has shown that just because a company is ahead of its rivals by a mile in terms of revenue doesn’t mean it will be a winner for investors. Part of the complication is that it’s increasingly common for leaders in one industry to poach at rivals in other industries. Amazon and Google, for instance, are swiping at each other’s mobile businesses even though they’re not in the same industry. There’s also the danger that Staples (SPLS) faces – – dominating an industry, selling office supplies in physical stores, that’s in decline.
But it at least helps to know where companies stand.

When you are a newlywed, you have all sorts of hopes and dreams in your mind. But, if you and your husband are staying away from his family (and yours too), you also have a countless number of responsibility on your shoulders, like decorating the home, managing the budget, and so on. 
Well, during festivals, your responsibilities and duties will increase even further. You would have to organise and perform all the puja and rituals according to the proper traditions, without any help from the elder family members. Especially during the time of Lakshmi puja for Diwali, one can get easily confused as to how to perform this major tradition in the right manner.
All you women out there, here is all that you need to know about performing a traditional Diwali puja at your home. As for newlywed women, who are living with their in-laws, you all can use these tips to impress your mothers-in-law with your knowledge of traditions and rituals.

Clean your home
Diwali puja is done to worship Goddess Lakshmi, who is considered to be the Goddess of wealth. It is largely believed that Goddess Lakshmi likes to shower her blessings on those homes that are neat and clean, and where people are warm and welcoming. So, get on the job along with your husband and clean your entire house properly. You will be surprised as to how much waste and junk you will throw after the cleaning is done. After this, clean your mandir with a fresh cloth and decorate it with lights and flowers.
Tip: If you don’t have a mandir then place a raised platform (Chowki) in a corner of the room, preferably North-East, and spread a red cloth on it to perform the puja.
Things needed for the Diwali puja
Here are a few specific items that you will need for the puja:
A kalash (a metal or earthen pot), a thali (a plate), diyas (clay lamps), ghee, uncooked rice, kumkum (vermillion), turmeric, incense sticks, sweets, and a bell to ring during the aarti.
Idols of Lakshmi and Ganesha (you can also keep an idol of Goddess Saraswati).
Flower garlands and rose petals.
Paan leaves or mango leaves.
Betel nut (supari), fruits, dry fruits, kheel and batasha.
Silver coins.
Panchamrita (a mixture of milk, curd, honey, sugar and ghee. Can be easily prepared at home)
Milk, curd, honey, coriander and cumin seeds.
Gangajal (If not available, then use rose water).

Steps to do the Diwali puja
In front of your mandir, spread some rice making a flatbed. Place a kalash, filled three-fourth with water, on this rice bed.
Place your money, jewellery and other valuable items next to it on a clean cloth for it to be blessed by Goddess Lakshmi.
Into the kalash, put a clean gold or silver coin, few flowers and a betel nut.
Now arrange the paan or the mango leaves around the mouth of the kalash in a neat circle.
Before placing the idols, purify the puja items by sprinkling Gangajal or rose water on them.
Take the idol of Goddess Lakshmi and Ganesha and bathe it with water, curd, honey and milk.
On a thali, draw a swastika with turmeric, and place Lord Ganesha, Goddess Lakshmi and Goddess Saraswati idols on it.
Put kheel in all the diyas and light the diyas.

Offer fresh flowers, sweets, betel nut, nutmeg, coriander and cumin seeds, rice, kheel, batasha, some dry fruits and fruits to the deities.
Put tilak (a mixture of kumkum, rice and water) on all the deities. Thereafter on each other's forehead.
Tie a mouli (sacred red thread) on your and your husband's wrist.
Light the incense sticks, dhoop and perform the aarti of Lord Ganesha and Goddess Lakshmi (if you don’t remember it by heart, read it out from a booklet).
Lastly, offer parsad to everyone in the house.

These are the complete steps that you need to know to perform a Diwali puja at home. Although the basic steps remain the same, but some elements may differ from family to family. So, do not shy away from asking for help and advice from the elder members of your family.
 
With this guide in hand, and blessings from your family members, you are all set to perform the traditional Lakshmi Puja all by yourself. BollywoodShaadis.com wishes all its readers a happy and a safe Diwali.

Equity Firm Says Twitter Bailed on Share Sale
By LORRAINE BAILEY 
Tweet
 
     (CN) - A Cayman Islands-based private equity firm says Twitter backed out of a deal to sell it $100 million in pre-IPO shares in order to sign a similar deal with BlackRock, an investor the equity firm originally recruited.
     1 Oak Private Equity Venture Capital, serving as manager for Bluebird Access 1 LP, sued Twitter, Inc. in New Castle County, Delaware on October 22.
     1Oak manages money for high-net worth individuals and institutional investors. Its New Digital Age Fund invests in late stage, pre-IPO internet and mobile investments.
     "In around early 2012, 1OAK began discussions with Twitter about an arrangement under which 1OAK would assemble and vet a group of sophisticated investors who would invest a minimum of $100 million to purchase pre-IPO Twitter shares from Twitter employees or Series A and/or B early stage investors," the firm says.
     This deal would allow Twitter employees to immediately profit on their shares, avoiding post-IPO restrictions, and give Twitter a new set of shareholders with whom it had already negotiated share restrictions, such as proxy voting rights, according to the complaint.
     Twitter drafted an Approved Buyer Agreement in April 2012, after vetting 1Oak's qualifications as an eligible purchaser. It allegedly encouraged 1Oak to raise the $100 million as quickly as possible.
     "1OAK proceeded to spend substantial time, effort, money and reputation assembling an investor pool to acquire Twitter pre-IPO employee shares - a pool which ultimately far exceeded the minimum $100 million that Twitter said would be required. In September/October 2012, 1OAK provided Twitter with documents reflecting that 1OAK had obtained investor commitments for $500 million," 1Oak claims.
     1Oak returned the Approved Buyer Agreement to Twitter on April 8, 2012, but Twitter never signed it. However, the social media website continued to assure 1Oak that it was committed to the deal for the next six months.
     In October, 1Oak recruited BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world, to invest in Twitter through 1Oak's Fund. BlackRock entered into a non-disclosure agreement with 1Oak on October 17, 2012.
     Five days later, "Twitter abruptly informed BlackRock that Twitter would terminate 1OAK's status as an 'approved buyer,' which predictably caused BlackRock to cease working with 1OAK. Twitter began to work with BlackRock directly.
     "In January 2013, Twitter and BlackRock announced an $80 million pre-IPO share purchase transaction with Twitter employees, which was the type of investment that Twitter agreed that 1OAK would develop and for which: (1) 1OAK had been designated the approved buyer by Twitter; (2) 1OAK developed and procured BlackRock's interest in an investment to be made through 1OAK; and (3) 1OAK disclosed BlackRock's interest to Twitter under a non-disclosure agreement that precluded Twitter from using confidential customer information except for a potential business transaction involving 1OAK," the firm says.
     Twitter denied 1Oak's demand that it be permitted to participate in its deal with BlackRock, 1Oak claims.
     The social media site set its IPO price at $26 a share. It now trades at $50 a share.
     1Oak seeks punitive damages for breach of contract, breach of implied covenant of good faith, promissory estoppel, and interference with prospective business advantage.
     It is represented by Theodore Kittila with Greenhill Law Group in Wilmington, Delaware, and Jeffrey Makoff with Valle Makoff in San Francisco.

Buddha Trail: Great Stupa at SanchiBigg Boss 8
Centuries of Faith: The Great Stupa at Sanchi
The Great Stupa at Sanchi, in modern-day Madhya Pradesh, was commissioned by the great Mauryan emperor Ashoka in the third century BC, and is the oldest stone structure in India. The hemispherical brick structure in the center is built over the relics of the Buddha. There are also palaces, monolithic pillars and sanctuaries. Construction of the Stupa and abutments to it continued under the reign of the Sunga empire and later under the Satavahana kingdom of Andhra, which had extended its hold northward to the Malwa plateau. Further, Sanchi came under the control of the Kushanas, Khatrapas and the Guptas, during which period Sanchi became a site where Hinduism and Buddhism coexisted in harmony. Addition of temples and other stupas continued until the 14th century, after which the site fell into disrepair and neglect. Sanchi remained forgotten to the world until 1818, when a British officer General Mark Taylor discovered it. Archaeologists further excavated the ruinous remains and restored some of the structures. Today, the Great Stupa at Sanchi and the accompanying monuments comprise a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is also protected by the Archaeological Survey of India.

Rani ki Vav: Brimful of a queens loveBigg Boss 8
Centuries hence, Rani ki Vav still wells up with a queen's love
Rani ki Vav, an 11th century stepwell in Patan, Gujarat, was among the most recent additions to India’s growing collection of UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The World Heritage Committee, at its recently concluded convention in Doha, Qatar, approved the structure to be added to the list.
Stepwells are an integral part of the arid landscape of northwestern India. Known as bawdi or baoli in Hindi or barav (in Maharashtra) and vav in Gujarati, stepwells consist of ponds or wells for water catchment accessible by a rungs of steps. Often, vavs are covered and protected. Stepwell architecture is a subject that inspires volumes. While some are simple in design, others are ornate, multistoried structures with viewing areas and galleries where the scions of feudal families could enjoy the monsoon.
Rani ki Vav — literally, the Queen’s Stepwell — is symbol for Queen Udaymati’s undying love for her husband King Bhimdev I of the Solanki dynasty. She commissioned the construction of the stepwell as a memorial to her husband in 1063 AD. The stepwell is built on the banks of the now-extinct Saraswati River in the acclaimed Maru-Gurjara architectural style. It is built as an inverted pyramidal temple in four deepening stories with seven levels of stairs. Its sculptural panels are of fine artistic quality. When the vav was excavated in late 1980s by the Archeological Survey of India (ASI), the carvings were found in pristine condition.

Best ways to take care of your jewelleryBest Ways to Take Care of Your Precious Jewellery
Bollywoodshaadis.com –  Wed 1 Oct, 2014 1:20 PM IST
Share 0
We all know the love women have for jewellery. Be it family heirlooms or trinkets collected from the streets, you cherish every piece of your collection. But, isn’t it heartbreaking when you find out that your diamonds have begun to lose their lustre, or your gold jewellery is losing its sheen? If you investigate the root of the problem, you will realise that your jewellery needs some tender care in order to have a longer life.
So, here are a few simple tips which will help you to take care of your jewellery better.
#1. Pearl jewellery
Pearls are really sensitive and they can get easily scratched or discoloured. So keep in mind, various points to take care of them.
Do's:
Always wipe your pearls gently with a damp cloth, dry them off and store them in an airtight container. Keep your pearls in a pouch or a box that has soft lining.
Always wear your pearl jewellery only after applying makeup.
Keep your pearls away from perfumes, makeup and hairsprays as they can cause discolouration.
Don'ts:
Never use baking soda or bleach to clean them.
Do not make the mistake of using a tooth brush for cleaning; even the softest one can cause abrasions on the pearls’ surface.
Never bathe or swim with your pearl jewellery as chemicals in the water may erode it.
Never use plastic pouches to store your pearls.

#2. Silver jewellery
It does not take much for your silver jewellery to tarnish. That is why, you must be extra careful while storing it.
Do's:
To clean your silver jewellery, use a phosphate-free detergent or just soap water. Rinse it off, and wipe it with a soft and clean cloth.
Always use warm water to rinse off silver.
Always keep your silver in airtight containers or zip lock bags.
In India, jewellery is not just something to enhance the beauty of a woman, but also has some values attached to it. Read this to know the  Significance of Bridal Jewellery for Indian Women
Don'ts:
Like pearls, silver jewellery too should be kept away from cosmetics and perfume because it speeds up the process of discolouration and tarnishing. 
Do not store it with any other metal as it tends to tarnish faster.
Never keep your silver jewellery in paper, cardboard or wooden boxes.
Never store away your silver jewellery until and unless it is completely dry.

#3. Gold jewellery
Though gold does not tarnish as easily as silver, it does tend to lose its sheen over a period of time. Unlike silver, water does not have an adverse effect on gold.
Do's:
You can clean your gold jewellery twice a week with a mild detergent, lukewarm water, and a soft cloth. 
Keep your gold chains and bracelets in separate boxes, as they can get entangled easily.
Recommended Read: 6 Everyday Essentials That Most Brides Forget to Pack in Their Trousseau
Don'ts:
Chlorine has a very harsh effect on gold. When it comes in contact with your gold jewellery, it tends to weaken it. So keep your gold away from chlorine water.
Do not use any alcohol-based cleaning liquid if your gold jewellery is studded with precious stones. This is because such liquid tends to dilute the gum that holds the stones in place.
#4. Diamonds and precious stones
Do's:
You can clean your diamonds with a good quality jewellery cleaning solution that is easily available with leading jewellers. You can also simply mix some ammonia and water to clean your diamonds.
Always use a soft brush to clean it and dry it off with a soft cloth.
Always check the prongs that hold your gemstones in place. If they are cracked or you find them to be loose, rush to a jeweller to get them repaired.
Don'ts: 
You may hate to remove your wedding ring, but that does not mean you should wear it even when you are in the kitchen. Many women make the mistake of wearing their diamond rings while kneading dough or cooking. The result- your diamonds start losing their lustre. So it goes without saying, remove your solitaire while cooking.
We all love our jewellery, but that ‘love’ alone is not capable of making it last for longer. So, make use of these tips, and let your jewellery take care of adding wonders to your looks everytime you wear it.

12 retailers closing stores the fastest12 retail chains closing stores the fastest

AP/Sears
Sears stores continue to be even more of an endangered species as the retailer closes more locations.
And Sears isn’t alone.
There are 12 retailers in the very broad Russell 3000 index, including Sears (SHLD) , apparel seller Christopher & Banks (CBK) and toy builder Build-A-Bear Workshop (BBW) that have fewer stores now than they had two years ago, according to a USA TODAY analysis of data from S&P Capital IQ.
Keep in mind that this analysis only evaluated retailers that reported the number of stores they had open in the most recent quarter and two years ago. Many retailers only disclose their number of stores on an annual basis, so they were excluded due to the lack of data. Sears disputes recent reports of store closures , but the company’s financial reports show the chain has been shrinking.
Investors are certainly not pleased when retailers shut stores. That’s almost guaranteed to cut revenue. Shares of the 12 retailers that have closed stores over the past two years are down an average of 3.7% this year as investors shift their retail money to companies that are growing.
Sears is the fastest shrinking retailer — by far. It reported 2,302 stores as of its latest quarter, S&P Capital IQ says, which is down 40% over the past two years. Just this year the stock is down 27%.
Women’s apparel seller Christopher & Banks has reduced its store footprint by 16% over the past two years. It reported 545 stores as of its most-recent quarter. The stock is down almost as much as Sears’ this year: 25.8%.
But closing stores isn’t always bad news. Build-your-own teddy-bear shop Build-A-Bear Workshop has taken its store count down 11.4% over the past two years. But it’s been focusing on high-traffic areas mostly in tourist areas. The stock has doubled this year as the company’s cash flow has improved as it drives more profit from fewer stores.

Home prices in 70 Chinese cities fell year over year in September for the first time in nearly two years, and developers are cutting prices to lure new buyers.
Berkshire Hathaway has sunk $15 billion into renewable energy  and may double that amount via Berkshire Hathaway Energy, run by Greg Abel, a 52-year-old Canadian and candidate to succeed Warren Buffett as CEO.
Speaking of Berkshire Hathaway, Charles Munger, Buffett’s longtime partner and sidekick, is giving $65 million to Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of California, Santa Barbara. “Physics is vitally important,” Munger says. “Everyone knows that.”

Dionne Miller scores ABC 7 sports jobDionne Miller scores ABC 7 sports job

Dionne Miller
It’s official: Dionne Miller is joining WLS-Channel 7 as weekend sports anchor — and the first woman on the ABC-owned station’s sports staff.
Confirming a report here earlier this month, ABC 7 announced Miller’s hiring Thursday in a memo to the staff. She starts Monday.
Miller, a native of Chardon, Ohio, and former host and reporter for Fox Sports Ohio and Big Ten Network, most recently was weekend sports anchor at Fox-owned WFLD-Channel 32. She signed off last month after more than two years at Fox 32.
“Dionne Miller has won over tough Chicago sports fans in the 2½ years she’s worked in this city,” said Jennifer Graves, vice president and news director of ABC 7. “She knows sports inside and out, is passionate about the teams she covers and has earned a great reputation in the market. We are thrilled she’s coming to ABC 7 and know she’ll make an already fantastic sports team with Mark Giangreco and Jim Rose even better.”
Mark Giangreco
Giangreco, the station’s veteran sports director and No. 1 sports anchor, said: “We were so lucky to have the opportunity to hire such a personable and professional reporter/anchor from within our own market. It’s hard to find an established talent who is so well liked and respected by players, coaches, colleagues, competitors and of course, viewers. This is a great get for us!”
A graduate of Houghton College, a Christian liberal arts college in southwestern New York State, Miller worked earlier for WCMH-TV, the NBC affiliate in Columbus, Ohio, the Columbus Sports Network, WWSB-TV, the ABC affiliate in Sarasota, Florida, and XETV-TV, the Fox affiliate in San Diego. Miller’s husband, Ray Crawford, covers college football and basketball for Chicago-based Campus Insiders.
“Thrilled to begin an exciting new chapter,” Miller tweeted Thursday night.
At ABC 7 Miller succeeds Rafer Weigel, who left to become a news anchor at KTVI-TV, the Fox affiliate in St. Louis. Weigel, son of the late Chicago sportscaster Tim Weigel, was a sports anchor for HLN’s “Morning Express with Robin Meade” when he auditioned to host “Windy City Live,” ABC 7’s local talk show. That job eventually went to Ryan Chiaverini, whom Weigel replaced as weekend sports anchor in March 2011.

How Chipotle Has Revolutionized The Way We EatOne Way Chipotle Has Completely Revolutionized How We Eat
Posted:
reddit
Judging by our eating habits, we've become a nation of adult babies eating pre-cut food out of bowls.
Instead of sitting in highchairs toying with our cooked beef and rice, we shovel our lunches into our mouths while typing at computers in open-plan offices or robotically scrolling through our News Feeds.
Always an option at home and some restaurants, the bowl meal truly launched a decade ago when Chipotle first introduced its burrito bowl, a diners’ choice of rice, beans, meat, salsa and other fixings mixed up in a bowl. Chipotle now sells more bowls than burritos, according to Chris Arnold, a spokesman for the chain. Though Chipotle doesn't break out revenue by menu item, its success overall has been meteoric -- with revenue rising about 11 percent from $2.73 billion in 2012 to $3.04 billion so far this year.
Sales of so-called Mexican bowls at fast-casual restaurants went up 14 percent over the past two years, according to data from Technomic, a food research firm. The number of chains offering "Asian bowls" with ingredients like noodles, chicken, rice and vegetables grew 8 percent over the same period, according to Technomic. Chipotle’s Asian-themed spinoff, ShopHouse, exclusively sells bowls comprised of a base of rice, noodles or salad mixed with a protein like grilled chicken satay, vegetables and a choice of curry and tamarind sauces.
A Chipotle burrito bowl.
Besides just tasting good, the bowls play into some recent dining trends: the rise of gluten-free eating and the popularity of protein over carbs as people turn away from bread-heavy sandwiches. We're also increasingly picky, and a setup with a base of grain or lettuce and a choice of toppings allows us to dictate our meals to our exact preferences.
Perhaps more importantly, bowls are also perfect for workers looking for meals they can eat easily at their desks.
“No one is sitting down and eating a meal you have to cut up into little pieces,” said Kira Fisher, who runs the blog Sad Desk Lunch , which succinctly sums up the bowl trend. “It takes a lot of space to eat like a proper person.”
Some industry observers dismiss the bowl meal as trend. But it hints at more troubling concerns, said Marlene Schwartz, the director at Yale’s Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity.
Part of the recommended treatment for obesity and eating disorders is to “sit at a table without the television on and actually eat your food with a knife and fork,” Schwartz said. “The fact that that’s part of the treatment means that we’ve really moved away from it” as a society, she added.
Forking a mixture of rice, vegetables and meat into your mouth while looking at email or making phone calls isn’t an ideal way to eat, according to Schwartz. “People do tend to eat more and not realize how much they’re eating” if they’re distracted by another task, she said.
It’s true that in some cultures, people regularly eat stews, noodles and sushi without a knife and fork, and those meals are often unrushed family or even community events. But the elimination of the knife and the move towards the bowl at fast food and fast-casual restaurants is largely a Western invention of convenience.
Traditional fast food restaurants are on trend, too. The number of fast food restaurants offering a "bowl meal" grew by 5.6 percent between 2010 and 2014, according to research from Dataessential, a Chicago-based firm that tracks food industry trends.
Taco Bell launched a Cantina Power Menu earlier this year, which includes a selection of steak, chicken and veggie bowls featuring lettuce, guacamole, pico de gallo, cheese, sour cream and rice. KFC has offered its “famous bowl” line -- a mix of mashed potatoes, bite-sized crispy chicken pieces, gravy and cheese -- since 2006.
Many of the submissions coming into Fisher’s blog celebrate the old-school bowl meal: leftovers of a meat and rice stew or lasagna that were better the night before. “There’s always been casseroles and one-dish meals,” said Mary Chapman, senior director of product innovation at Technomic. “How it’s positioned is new.”
A sampling of the classic one-dish bowl lunch:
Part of the appeal of the bowls offered in fast-casual and fast food restaurants is that they can stand in for many of the standard lunch items, Chapman said. They’re “a way to have a big giant sandwich without having to hold it in your hand” or “a healthful alternative without having to be a salad,” she said.
But the rise in restaurants offering a bunch of ingredients mixed up in a bowl is “pure trend” that’s liable to go out of fashion, said David Just, a behavioral economist at Cornell University who has studied why people eat what they do.
“It’s trying to play to a modern idea of what’s beautiful and attractive,” Just said, noting that bowls also allow restaurants to rein in portion sizes because it takes less food to make a bowl look full.
And customers seemed convinced. A group of 16-year-old boys having their first-ever off-campus lunch at a Manhattan Chipotle one recent afternoon bragged about their ability to game the system by ordering bowls. “They give you more if you get the bowl,” one said. “I got it literally every day this summer,” another noted. An 18-year-old NYU student having a quick lunch by himself cited similar reasons for choosing a bowl instead of a burrito. “It’s more calories, more bang for your buck,” he said.
(That may be more perception than reality. According to Chipotle’s calorie calculator, burrito bowls typically have about 300 fewer calories than burritos.)
Out of 13 people who went through the line in about a 15-minute period during the lunch rush at the restaurant, just four ordered burritos. The other nine opted for bowls.
Even Mitt Romney gets a burrito bowl at Chipotle.
Eating without a plate, knife and fork has become so ubiquitous, we may have actually reached peak bowl. While the number of bowls on the menus of fast food and fast-casual chains grew between 2010 and 2014, it declined in fine dining restaurants, according to research from Datassential, a Chicago-based firm that studies food industry trends.
Once a trend starts to fall off in more expensive eateries, that typically means it’s saturated the market as much as it’s going to, according to Christin Groh, a senior manager on the MenuTrends team at Datassential. “It may end up tapering off,” Groh said. “In recent years, penetration has really remained flat.”
Still that doesn’t mean bowls are disappearing from restaurants like Chipotle any time soon. As Cornell's Just said, diners "are looking for things that are easy to eat and go without much thought.”

The Tragic Reality Of Americans  Vacation DaysAmericans Are Taking Fewer Vacation Days Than At Any Point In Nearly 4 Decades
Reuters
reddit
WASHINGTON, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Americans took the least  amount of vacation time in almost four decades last year,  forfeiting billions of dollars in compensation without scoring  points with their bosses, according to an industry group  analysis released on Tuesday.
The report for the U.S. Travel Association said the average  American with paid time off (PTO) used 16 of 20.9 vacation days  in 2013, down from an average of 20.3 days off from 1976 to  2000. It added that 169 million days of permanently forfeited  U.S. vacation time equated to $52.4 billion in lost benefits.
"By choosing to work instead of taking PTO, employees are  essentially working for their employers for free," the analysis  said.
The report did not give a reason for the drop in vacation  time but the fall coincided with the 2007-2009 recession and a  slow economic recovery. An Ipsos/Reuters survey in 2010 found  that only 57 percent of Americans used all their vacation time.
Wealthier workers tend to earn more vacation days, and also  leave more of it on the table, according to the study. People  with an annual income of more than $150,000 failed to use an  average of 6.5 vacation days last year, while those with less  than $29,000 did not use 3.7 days on average.
Employees who foreited paid time off do not get more raises  or bonuses than those who take all their vacation time. They  also report higher levels of stress at work, the survey said.
"America's work martyrs aren't more successful. We need to  change our thinking. All work and no play is not going to get  you ahead - it's only going to get you more stress,"  Roger Dow,  president and CEO of the U.S. Travel Association, said in a  statement accompanying the report.
The analysis was prepared by Oxford Economics, a forecasting  group. It used Labor Department data and a June survey of 1,303  workers by GfK Public Affairs and Corporate Communications in  conjunction with Oxford Economics.

Models say Gujarat must be wary of brewing Arabian Sea cycloneModels say Gujarat must be wary of brewing Arabian Sea cyclone
Vinson Kurian
Tweet
Thiruvananthapuram, Oct 21:  
A day after its genesis, a rogue low-pressure area in the Arabian Sea is forecast to become a tropical cyclone by a number of weather models.
India Met Department appears to take the brewing cyclone to the northwest Arabian Sea for a likely landfall over the Yemen-Oman coast in another week’s time.
Likely target
But two other leading models suspect that the system may steer to the north-northeast and strike south Gujarat around Surat and adjoining Mumbai in a week’s time.
These are the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts and a Global Forecast Model of the US National Centres for Environmental Prediction.
India Met has located the low-pressure area to the southeast Arabian Sea and neighbourhood and has put it already under watch for intensification.
The ‘low’ would strengthen a round to a well-marked ‘low’ by tomorrow and further into a depression two days later, according to a bulletin issued this afternoon.
India Met watch
But wind field projections depicted on its site hint its onward intensification as a likely tropical cyclone tracking away from the Indian coast in a west-northwest direction towards the Arabian Gulf, along the Yemen-Oman coastline.
The two other models stick their neck out suggesting that the cyclone would actually steer mid-course towards north-northeast and hit South Gujarat-Mumbai.
The timeline for the landfall in this manner is also around the month-end, around October 29-30, according to the European and US model forecasts.
Drains moisture
Meanwhile, the brewing weather system in the Arabian Sea has drained the south peninsula of some moisture.
This morning, an upper air cyclonic circulation has formed once again off the Sri Lanka coast, which should bring rain to parts of Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Lakshadweep today.
There is also the presence of the rain-friendly Madden-Julian Oscillation wave in the higher levels over the tropical Indian Ocean/west Arabian Sea.
According to the Met, the heavy rain may lift from tomorrow as the away-looking ‘low’ in the Arabian Sea starts intensifying.
Outlook for a counterpart ‘low’ in the Andaman Sea is retained, but models are not very confident about it since the entire activity is now shifting to the Arabian Sea.

Microsoft Co-Founder Bumps Ebola Effort to $100 Millionmicrosoft co-founder bumps ebola effort to $100 million
Billionaire Paul Allen pledges at least $100 million to fight EbolaBillionaire Paul Allen pledges at least $100 million to fight Ebola
Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen calls Ebola 'unlike any health crisis we have ever experienced'
Paul Allen, billionaire owner of sports teams and mega yachts, on Thursday pledged at least $100 million to fight Ebola in what is believed to be the largest private foundation gift to combat the deadly disease and support healthcare workers in West Africa.
The co-founder of Microsoft — who regularly inhabits lists of the richest and most generous Americans — has already donated an estimated $26.5 million toward his pledge, including $12.9 million to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, $3.6 million to UNICEF, $2.8 million to the International Red Cross and $1.3 million to Doctors Without Borders.
It was an epidemiologist¿s worst nightmare: one of the world¿s deadliest contagious diseases loose in one of the world¿s most densely populated and sometimes chaotic megacities ¿ Lagos, Nigeria. ( Robyn Dixon )
“The Ebola virus is unlike any health crisis we have ever experienced and needs a response unlike anything we have ever seen,” Allen said in a statement. “I am committed to tackling Ebola until it is stopped.”
The disease, which has spurred worldwide panic, travel restrictions and a scramble by hospitals and health agencies to contain it and prepare for its possible spread, is generally transmitted through direct contact with bodily fluids of an infected person.

The deadliest Ebola outbreak in history is believed to have infected nearly 10,000 people and claimed more than 4,800 lives, with the highest death toll in Liberia, according to the World Health Organization. It pegs the cost of fighting the disease at $975 million.
WHO spokesman Daniel Epstein said his organization “welcomes all financial and technical support in our efforts to save the lives of those infected with Ebola in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, and to halt the spread of the epidemic as soon as possible. We need funds, and we need foreign medical teams most of all, to staff the 50 Ebola treatment centers now operating or under construction.”
With so many people possibly affected by this particularly deadly disease, funds have been hard to come by, especially from smaller donors who often step up to help in times of crisis.
“The small American donors are simply not there,” said Jack Shakely, president emeritus of the California Community Foundation. “It takes a wealthy donor to step up to the plate.”
Shakely is also a board member of Operation USA, a global relief organization that has sent medical supplies to Liberia, and he describes Ebola as “one of those horrible, horrible problems that can be fixed. [Allen] tends to be one of a group of social entrepreneurs who like to see results. This $100 million could, in fact, effect amazing results.”
How dare those .01%ers donate their money for a cause. This is a job for the gov't
Barry3

The $100-million pledge by the owner of the Super Bowl champion Seattle Seahawks and the NBA’s Portland Trail Blazers is the latest in a stream of donations by wealthy individuals and foundations, many with ties to technology.
Last week, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, donated $25 million to the CDC Foundation, noting on his Facebook page that the deadly disease “could infect 1 million people or more over the next several months if not addressed.”
In September, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation gave $50 million to support the emergency response to the disease, and the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation committed $5 million. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation gave $1 million in August.
Allen plans to partner with the University of Massachusetts Medical School to provide medical workers and laboratory equipment in Liberia, with a particular focus on making sure that local hospitals are outfitted with decontamination equipment.
He also will fund the development and manufacture of two medevac containment units to evacuate medical workers from West Africa, what Dune Ives, senior director of Allen’s Vulcan Philanthropy, calls “safety cocoons.”
“As we started looking early on at what it is going to take, we recognized we need more trained healthcare workers to go to West Africa,” Ives said. “Personally, unless I knew I had safety and support to get back home if I got infected, I would think twice.”
The medevac units fit into airplanes and carry the kind of equipment and staff seen in hospital rooms, Ives said, adding that “right now, there is one plane that can safely medevac infected healthcare workers back to their country of origin. We wanted to provide the assurance of safe transport.”
One goal of Allen’s is to urge others to donate — individuals of modest means, corporations, foundations, the super-rich. To that end he has set up an online donation platform at TackleEbola.com to allow individuals to give money to specific areas of need.
“Time is not our ally in this fight,” Allen said in a blog posted Thursday. “The time is now to do the right thing. So let’s do this.”

Microsoft Sales Beat Street Hopes  Cloud Profits UpYou are here: Home Corporates
Microsoft Sales Beat Street Hopes, Cloud Profits Up
Reuters | Updated On: October 24, 2014 08:04 (IST)
Aviation Regulator Acts Tough Against Troubled SpiceJet: Report
Seattle:
Microsoft Corp reported higher-than-expected quarterly revenue, helped by stronger sales of its phones, Surface tablets and cloud-computing products for companies, while keeping its profit margins largely intact.
The results on Thursday allayed fears of investors in recent days that the industry shift toward lower-margin cloud services was proving hard for established technology leaders to master.
Microsoft shares, which have climbed 33 per cent over the past year, rose another 3 per cent in after-hours trading to $46.36.
"In light of recent negative earnings results from tech bellwethers Oracle, IBM, SAP, VMware, and EMC, Microsoft is bucking the trend and we would label these September results as a solid accomplishment," said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets.
Investors were keenly watching Microsoft after harsh warnings from International Business Machines Corp and SAP about operating profits as they make tentative inroads into the cloud, which generally yields thinner margins than technology companies are used to.
Microsoft did not disclose its cloud-based revenue for the fiscal first quarter, but said commercial cloud sales rose 128 per cent, while sales of services based on its Azure cloud platform rose 121 per cent.
Perhaps more importantly, it said gross profit margin in the unit that includes Azure rose 194 per cent, despite rising infrastructure costs, which includes the huge expense of building and operating datacenters.
In the last four years, Microsoft's gross profit margin has drifted down to about 65 per cent from above 80 per cent, largely due to its move into the less profitable business of making tablets and phones, but accelerated by the move to the cloud.
Nomura analyst Rick Sherlund figures Microsoft is on track to hit $6 billion a year in cloud revenue soon, which would make it the industry's largest cloud vendor by his calculations. That represents only about 6 percent of overall expected revenue this fiscal year, but investors are highly sensitive to a business they see as key to the future.
"We're the only company with cloud revenue at our scale that is growing at triple digit rates," said Satya Nadella, on a conference call with analysts.
Nadella was keen to stress that Microsoft is more focused on selling higher-margin services via the cloud to its commercial customers rather than just storage and computing power. "Our premium services on Azure create new monetization opportunities in media, data, machine learning, fast analytics, and enterprise mobility," he said.
PROFIT FELL ON CHARGE
Microsoft's fiscal first-quarter profit actually fell 13 per cent, largely due to an expected $1.1 billion charge related to mass layoffs announced in July, which lopped 11 cents per share off earnings.
Including that charge, the world's largest software company reported profit of $4.5 billion, or 54 cents per share, compared with $5.2 billion, or 62 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter.
Still, it easily beat Wall Street's forecast of 49 cents per share, including the charge, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The charge resulted from Microsoft's plan, launched in July, to cut 18,000 jobs, or about 14 per cent of its workforce, with most of those cuts coming from its newly acquired Nokia phone business.
Revenue rose 25 per cent to $23.2 billion, helped by the phone business it bought from Nokia in April, handily exceeding analysts' average estimate of $22 billion.
Sales of its Lumia smartphones hit 9.3 million in the first full quarter since the close of the Nokia deal. Sales of the Surface tablet more than doubled to $908 million from $400 million in the year-ago quarter.

Police: Gunman Acted Alone In Ottawa Shootingreddit
Canadian authorities confirmed early Thursday that there was only one shooter in Wednesday's horrific attack in Ottawa, the Associated Press reported.
Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, 32, was shot dead after opening fire near the Canadian Parliament building, killing Cpl. Nathan Cirillo and wounding three other people.
An Ottawa police spokesman had previously told HuffPost that they were looking for multiple possible suspects, but would not confirm the news later in a press conference.
Witnesses say Zehaf-Bibeau shot Cpl. Nathan Cirillo near the National War Memorial at point-blank range on Wednesday morning before being chased inside the Canadian Parliament building, where he was killed by Kevin Vickers, a sergeant-at-arms.

Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper characterized the attack as an act of terrorism and vowed a renewed crackdown on terrorist activity.
"This will lead us to strengthen our resolve and redouble our efforts and those of our national security agencies to take all necessary steps to identify and counter threats," Harper said in a televised address late on Wednesday.

Officials told the Globe and Mail that the Canadian government had been monitoring Zehaf-Bibeau over potential suspicious activity. He was deemed a "high-risk traveler" and had his passport taken away.
The Associated Press reports that court records appear to indicate that Zehaf-Bibeau had a string of convictions for assault, robbery, drug and weapons offenses, and other crimes.
A friend told the Globe and Mail that Zehaf-Bibeau had experienced a religious reawakening of late. Senior U.S. officials confirmed to the New York Times that he had recently converted to Islam.
In a brief interview with the Associated Press on Thursday, Zehaf-Bibeau's mother said she was crying for the victim's of Wednesday's attack, not for her son.
"Can you ever explain something like this?" she said. "We are sorry."
Wednesday's shooting came just days after a similar attack in Quebec, where Martin Rouleau-Couture attacked two soldiers with his car, killing one, before being apprehended by police. Rouleau-Couture was also a recent convert to Islam who was being monitored by federal authorities.

How Ebola is fueling prejudice against gaysBy Ishaan Tharoor October 24 Follow @ishaantharoor

The victims of the Ebola epidemic gripping parts of West Africa aren't just the ones who contracted the virus. The infrastructure of whole nations is at a breaking point; hospitals and doctors are being pushed to their limits. Many Africans traveling to the United States, or at least intending to, have faced shameful racism from institutions and organizations that ought to know better. The virus has spread as a disease and a panic.
And, among other tragic effects, it has inflamed hatred toward gays.
That's right. According to a Reuters report , homosexuals in Liberia are facing threats and harassment after church groups linked the spread of the disease to their supposed sins.
"Since church ministers declared Ebola was a plague sent by God to punish sodomy in Liberia, the violence toward gays has escalated. They're even asking for the death penalty. We're living in fear," LGBT activist Leroy Ponpon told Reuters over the phone from Monrovia. The article elaborates:
Ponpon, an LGBT campaigner in the Liberian capital, says gays have been harassed, physically attacked and a few have had their cars smashed by people blaming them for the hemorrhagic fever, after religious leaders in Liberia said Ebola was a punishment from God for homosexuality.
The Liberian Council of Churches, as my colleague Terrence McCoy noted in August, released a statement saying "God is angry with Liberia, and that Ebola is a plague."  It went on:
Liberians have to pray and seek God's forgiveness over the corruption and immoral acts (such as homosexualism, etc.) that continue to penetrate our society. As Christians, we must repent and seek God's forgiveness.
"Voluntary sodomy" is a crime in Liberia and can lead to a year in jail. It is consistent with harsh anti-gay laws that exist in many African countries. According to Reuters, Ponpon is afraid to move around during the day -- local Liberian newspapers have printed his picture and phone number on their front pages. But a curfew imposed by authorities as a measure to deal with the epidemic means he can't go out at night either.
"All we want is protection," Ponpon told Reuters. "We want the government to come forward and say that this is a minority group and they deserve the same rights as anyone else and then people will stop attacking us."
Christian missionary and evangelical groups play a conspicuous role in parts of Africa, providing aid but also fanning bigotry and hate. In Uganda, American evangelicals have influenced the draconian anti-gay legislation being deliberated there.
And so it shouldn't be too surprising that some Christians across the Atlantic have imposed a similar narrative on the outbreak. In early August, Oklahoma conservative Christian radio host Rick Miles  appeared to echo the anti-gay Liberian clergymen, pinning the advent of the epidemic on a grab-bag of things loathed by American cultural conservatives.
"This Ebola epidemic can become a global pandemic, and that’s another name for plague," he said . "It may be the great attitude adjustment that I believe is coming. Ebola could solve America’s problems with atheism, homosexuality, sexual promiscuity, pornography and abortion."
In West Africa and the United States, it seems, such bigotry is one threat of the Ebola outbreak that is very real.
The number of people being monitored for symptoms of Ebola in the U.S. is growing. Here's how the virus spreads and how contact tracing works to stop outbreaks. (Gillian Brockell/The Washington Post)

Will Democrats cheer for record government revenueComments
By Ed Rogers October 24 Follow @EdRogersDC
Recently, the Obama Treasury Department announced that the government collected record revenue in 2014 . Is this a cause for celebration? If the government is taking in more money than ever, is it a sign of collective achievement or another sign that President Obama is driving us down? I would love to hear a Democrat campaigning for office cheer about how well the government is doing; how the government is collecting a record amount of money while the median household income for American families has dropped by about $1,600 since June 2009. Hooray!
Anyway, this raises the question of whether we are getting our money’s worth from this record revenue. A quick review of recent headlines – from the VA mismanagement to Obamacare costs to the Centers for Disease Control’s claim they need more money to combat Ebola – would suggest that we are not. And this highlights the management failures of this president. When a crisis confronts the White House, Obama feels compelled to appoint someone new, rather than delegate to his own Senate-confirmed Cabinet to address the problem du jour.
No doubt the White House is currently patting itself on the back for hiring Ron Klain as the Ebola czar; for “thinking outside the box” as The Post’s Juliet Eilperin and David Nakamura wrote this week. Well, maybe a little thinking inside the box is in order. It is remarkable that, despite the record government income and our skyrocketing national debt, Obama never seems to think the government is quite big enough or sufficient to handle the task at hand.
The Obama administration has collected record revenue this year, but the labor force participation rate has decreased to its lowest point since February 1978. Never have so many been dependent on so few. Even if it is not clearly in focus, part of what is on the ballot in November is the role of government and how big that government should be. Under Obama, we have seen record revenues, expenditures and deficits — not to mention a record number of people on food stamps, receiving disability payments, etc.  And, oh by the way, the debt under Obama has increased by $7.3 trillion in his six years in office so far.  For comparison, in the eight years under President George W. Bush, the national debt increased by $4.9 trillion.
The Obama administration is facilitating the uninhibited growth of government. It is fair to ask whether we have reached a tipping point in America, where more people want something from government than expect to be left alone by the government. The question of whether this trajectory is sustainable should be a bigger part of the political debate than it is. Our current path might be good for the government, but it is not good for American families.

Tweet
Dubai, Oct 24:  
Pakistan grabbed four wickets in the second session to eye a big first innings lead after David Warner’s aggressive hundred in the opening Test against Australia here today.
Warner, who made 133, was dismissed third ball after lunch as Australia fumbled to 282—8 at tea on the third day at Dubai stadium, still trailing Pakistan’s first innings total of 454 by 172 runs.
Mitchell Johnson (22) and Steve O’Keefe (four) were at the crease.
Debutant leg—spinner Yasir Shah (2—55) spun one sharply to bowl Warner, who by then had anchored the Australian innings in the first session.
It was the left—hander’s ninth Test century —— third consecutive in as many innings —— which took Australia to 207—4 at lunch after Pakistan fought back in the extended two—and—a—half hour morning session.
Warner hit 11 boundaries and two sixes during his 174—ball knock but his fall saw Australia slump against spinners.
Mitchell Marsh (27) and Brad Haddin (22) took Australia to 248—5 during their 42—run stand for the sixth wicket but Pakistan broke through with the new ball taken as soon it was due after 80 overs.
Debutant paceman Imran Khan had Haddin bowled off an inside edge while left—arm spinner Zulfiqar Babar had Marsh leg—before.

India Inc hails creation of Asia Infra Investment BankIndia Inc hails creation of Asia Infra Investment Bank
PTI
Tweet
Beijing, Oct 24:  
India Inc today welcomed the country’s participation in the newly—established Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) saying it will help to leverage badly needed funds for infrastructure development.
The moot point is that large economy like India really needs financing badly as it requires over a trillion USD for infrastructure development, A Didar Singh, Secretary General of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) said today.
India along 20 other countries signed the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to be its founding member.
“It is a very positive development in the sense that it opens up more borrowing opportunities. As another window of financing we welcome it,” Singh told PTI.
“There is tremendous requirement of funding in India for the a trillion USD infrastructure development. It is not possible for the Indian banking sector to manage that kind of investment,” despite the presence of Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other multilateral financing bodies.
“More is required beyond that. Therefore, if we get support from the BRICS Development Bank and AIIB offer further options and availability of finance which we need to tap into,” he said.
Singh, who is here to attend a separate event, said it will be mostly private sector which will access such funding.
“They will do it on terms favourable, transparent and good for them.”
But bank need to function on certain norms of governance, standards and transparency, he said.
Singh said India should access investments from China as it is plush with funds.
“China is a large economy with trade and manufacturing prowess. It also has funds which we have to recognise.
Therefore, businesses in India can leverage that funding also it will be one more addition to technology and market related relations.”
India along with 20 other countries today signed an agreement to become founding members of the China—backed AIIB to aid the infrastructure development in the Asian region and reduce the dependence on Western—dominated World Bank and IMF.

Sonia  Rahul should speak more; non-Gandhi can be Cong chief: Chidambaram'Black money embarrasses individuals, not party'
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, October 24, 2014

Amid speculation that the list of names of black money account holders could include a former UPA minister, ex-finance minister P Chidambaram on Friday said such individual transgressions should not embarrass the Congress as the party had not authorised him to keep that account.
“If there is a name of a former minister it will embarrass that person. He is not keeping that account for the party. These are individual transgressions, individual violations of the law, the individual should be embarrassed. Why should the party be embarrassed?” he told NDTV in an interview.
Chidambaram was responding to finance minister Arun Jaitley’s remarks that the Congress will be embarrassed once the names of people holding illicit foreign accounts are made public.
He also reiterated that Congress president Sonia Gandhi and vice-president Rahul Gandhi should “speak more” to the public and the media.
Asked if a non-Gandhi could become the Congress president, he said, “I think so. Someday yes”, but was quick to add, “I do not know” when asked about its timeline.
 Chidambaram also said the reorganisation of the party was due for the larger task of being an “effective, strong, robust and true opposition” to the government.

Democrats rebound in early vote countBy Philip Bump October 24 Follow @pbump
When we first looked at how early voting was evolving in states that allow the practice, we included an important caveat: these things shift quickly for a variety of reasons, including that we're often talking about fairly small numbers of votes. And, sure enough, our latest look at data from the United States Election Project -- including two new states -- shows a much better picture for Democrats than it did even earlier this week.
First, here's the graph. If you're new to this, dots above the diagonal line represent voting that's outperforming voter registration. Dots below the line, underperforming. The farther from the line the dot appears, the better (or worse) the effect. We've tracked the past two reports as well; they're shown on vertical lines connected to the current data.
Earlier this week, we released a version of this graph that showed red/Republican dots above the line more than blue/Democratic ones. We'd also noted a shift in how the vote in one state that looked good for Democrats -- Iowa -- had shifted negatively for the party. Now, particularly with the addition of the new states, the picture is more nuanced.
We've broken out that tight cluster in the middle to make it easier to see.
The vote in Iowa is about even, with Democrats and Republicans representing roughly similar portions ofn the early vote. The trend is largely the same: Democrats fading, Republicans rising. North Carolina has seen a dramatic turnaround, with Democrats bouncing back above the diagonal line in the newest set of numbers. In Louisiana and Oregon, the two newly added states, Democrats and Republicans are both outperforming registration -- but there are a lot more Democrats in each.
Which brings us to caveats that we should have been more explicit about earlier this week. Dr. Michael McDonald , the University of Florida associate professor of political science who does the thankless* work of compiling the data, explained to the Huffington Post four reasons that the metric we're using (namely: early turnout versus registration) might not be an effective tool for forecasting final results. Those four reasons, in short:
Registration isn't representative of turnout, even in high-turnout years.
Democrats and Republicans tend to differ in how they use different methods of early voting, meaning that there's some apples/oranges at play above.
Even winning the early vote doesn't mean you'll win higher-turnout Election Day votes.
Non-party voters tend to vote later -- meaning that "overperforming" as a function of the percentage of people who have early voted is skewed by lower turnout now in one of the three groups being tracked.
All valid points, of course. The first point, as befits the point that comes first, is perhaps the most important. Pollsters spend a lot of time considering who they expect to come to the polls so that they can weight survey results appropriately. Turnout doesn't reflect registration perfectly. But the fourth point is important, too: a big jump in turnout from non-Democrats and Republicans could shift the party's results significantly. All those yellow dots under the diagonal line could indicate apathy -- or an imminent surge.
That said, as with polling and as with many other things about political campaigns, trends are often revealing. Republicans in Iowa continue to increase the proportion of the early vote they represent while the Democratic proportion continues to decline. That doesn't mean that Joni Ernst (R) is guaranteed to win her Senate race, but it also doesn't mean that Democrat Bruce Braley's ground forces are winning the turnout battle.
* Thanks, Dr. McDonald!

Diego Costa might play against Manchester United: JoseMourinhoDiego Costa missed out Chelsea's 6-0 thumping victory in UEFA Champions League on Tuesday. (Source: AP)
London | Posted: October 24, 2014 7:40 pm | Updated: October 24, 2014 8:15 pm
Diego Costa, Ramires and John Mikel Obi could all return to the Chelsea squad for their Premier League clash with Manchester United at Old Trafford on Sunday, manager Jose Mourinho said.
But striker Loic Remy is definitely out.
The three all missed Chelsea’s 6-0 Champions League club record win over Maribor on Tuesday, but Mourinho said they all have “a little chance” of playing against United, and he would decide after Saturday’s training session.
Costa, joint top scorer in the Premier League with nine goals, has missed the last two matches with a hamstring injury and then a virus, while Ramires has missed their last six games with a groin injury and Mikel the last two with a bad foot.
Remy, though, will be out for two to three weeks after injuring his groin scoring the opening goal of the win over Maribor at Stamford Bridge.
Asked if he had any positive news about Chelsea, unbeaten in 12 matches in all competitions this season, Mourinho bounced back: “I only have positive news.
“We are playing well, we are confident, we are top of the league, we are in a good position to qualify for the Champions League, the camp is happy and we are ready for the game.”
CLOSE FRIENDSHIP
Matches between United and Chelsea have ranked among the most attractive in the league in recent seasons, and this one is extra special for Mourinho who comes up against his old Barcelona boss Louis van Gaal for the first time in a league match.
Mourinho worked under Van Gaal for three years at Barca, and the two have maintained a close friendship ever since but have only faced each other in one competitive match — the 2010 Champions League final when Mourinho’s Inter Milan beat Van Gaal’s Bayern Munich 2-0 in Rome.
Although United are down in sixth place with only three league wins from eight so far, Mourinho says going to Old Trafford is always special — and that his friendship with Van Gaal will be put on hold for 90 minutes.
“It doesn’t matter who the manager is, or the moment, or the league table, or the players, Man Utd is Man Utd and I always look at them through these factors.
“But tomorrow (Sunday) I don’t play against Louis, Chelsea plays against Man Utd and during the match I have no time, and he has no time to look around and to see who the opposing manager is.
“Before the match and after the match he is one of my big friends in football so I am always happy to see him.
“Everyone knows the respect I have for him but please on Sunday he is my opponent so don’t ask me to speak about him for half an hour now.”

Colt McCoy is not the Redskins starter  even if hes starting  Jay Gruden saysBy Dan Steinberg October 24 Follow @dcsportsbog
(Via NBC Washington)
Colt McCoy will start for the Redskins on Monday against the Cowboys unless Robert Griffin III is healthy enough to play, Jay Gruden has said this week .
Multiple times.
NBC Washington put together this little package of Gruden discussing his starter on Thursday. Looks like he said “the starter” eight times in 25 or so seconds. Here’s how it went.
1) Colt’s the starter.
2) We’re preparing for Colt to be the starter, you know what I mean?
3) We’re trying to get Robert some reps, get him ready, but right now, looks like odds are Colt will be the starter.
4) But we’re trying to work Robert into the lineup and trying to get him reps to get him ready to go, because ultimately, when it’s all said and done, when Robert’s healthy, Robert’s the starter.
5) We understand that? Robert’s the starter.
6) Colt is not the starter.
7) Colt could be the starter Monday night.
8) But when Robert’s healthy, he’ll be the starter, right?

Government considering changing protocols for aid workers who return to the U.S. after fighting EbolaBy Mark Berman and Juliet Eilperin October 24 Follow @markberman Follow @eilperin

The federal government is considering altering the protocols for doctors and health-care workers who return to the United States from West Africa, authorities said Friday.
“It’s one of the questions the federal government is thinking through,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) told Fox 5 in New York .
A federal official said that the idea of quarantining medical workers who participated in the Ebola response in West Africa was being considered, but said no decision had been made.
While the idea of a quarantine is being considered, Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, emphasized that officials are still determining whether it is medically justified.
“These kinds of policy decisions are going to be driven by science,” he said.

The possible change would come in the wake of Thursday’s diagnosis of Craig Spencer , a doctor who had treated Ebola patients in Guinea, one of the countries at the heart of the Ebola epidemic.
Spencer, 33, returned to the United States last week and began feeling ill on Tuesday. He was taken to Bellevue Hospital on Thursday after reporting a fever of 100.3 degrees that morning and gastrointestinal problems.
But as federal officials consider a possible change, authorities in the New York area announced that they would take more immediate action. Medical personnel returning to New York and New Jersey from the Ebola-riddled countries in West Africa will be automatically quarantined if they had direct contact with an infected person, officials announced Friday.
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) announced the decision at a joint news conference Friday at 7 World Trade Center.
“The steps New York and New Jersey are taking today will strengthen our safeguards to protect our residents against this disease and help ensure those that may be infected by Ebola are treated with the highest precautions,” Cuomo said in a statement.
They said that public-health officials at John F. Kennedy and Newark Liberty international airports, where enhanced screening for Ebola is taking place, would make the determination on who would be quarantined. Anyone who had direct contact with an Ebola patient in Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea will be quarantined.

In addition, anyone who traveled there but had no such contact would be actively monitored and possibly quarantined, authorities said.
Laurie Garrett, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, said in an interview that while it made sense for returning medical workers to take voluntary steps to isolate themselves upon their return to the United States, concern over Ebola’s transmission in the West had begun to interfere with volunteers’ ability to contain the outbreak at the source.
“For everybody that’s professionally trying to go to the three epidemic countries, the situation has become more difficult with each passing day and each Ebola case — or alleged Ebola case — named in the United States,” Garrett said. “We’re in a crisis actually that imperils the entire effort to stop the epidemic that is completely about the fear of countries that have no known epidemic.”
Not only have many airlines curtailed flights to the three countries most affected by Ebola, Garrett noted, but nearly every major insurance carrier has now canceled medevac coverage for individuals choosing to travel there.
“This whole right of return issue, and circumstances of return, is fluid,” she said. “We’ve hit the point where it is quite obviously affecting the recruitment of volunteer health workers.”
Experts say that the region needs roughly 19,000 health and logistics personnel to contain the epidemic; outside of military personnel, total foreign volunteers now number in the hundreds.
Still, Garrett added, any people traveling to a nation affected by Ebola should undertake efforts to isolate and monitor themselves for any symptoms of the disease for 21 days after returning to their home country.
“At this point it’s incumbent on anyone going over there to build into your plans the assumption that you will have to radically modify how you live and work upon your return for three weeks,” she said.
Spencer had gone to Guinea to work with Doctors Without Borders, the international relief group that has been on the front lines of the public health crisis.
On Friday, the group said Spencer had followed its protocols for people returning from Ebola work, which included regular health monitoring.

“Extremely strict procedures are in place for staff dispatched to Ebola affected countries before, during, and after their assignments,” Sophie Delaunay, the group’s executive director, said in a statement. “Despite the strict protocols, risk cannot be completely eliminated. However, close post-assignment monitoring allows for early detection of cases and for swift isolation and medical management.”
The precise nature of Spencer’s infection is being investigated, the group said. So far, two dozen people working for the organization have fallen ill while fighting Ebola, and 13 of them have died.
Tim Shenk, a spokesman for Doctors Without Borders, said Friday afternoon that quarantining all medical workers who return from West Africa “would be an excessive measure to take at this stage.”
“As long as a patient hasn’t developed symptoms, the risk of contamination is close to zero,” he said.
Spencer became just the fourth person diagnosed with Ebola in the United States and the first outside Texas, which has previously been the nexus of Ebola infections in the country. Thomas Duncan, a Liberian man who flew to Dallas, was diagnosed last month and died eight days later. Two nurses who treated Duncan were infected while caring for him. No one who had close contact with Duncan or the nurses has tested positive for Ebola so far.
The two nurses who contracted Ebola in Dallas were both declared virus-free this week. One was cleared on Wednesday , while Nina Pham, the other nurse,  left the National Institutes of Health on Friday morning after doctors determined she no longer had the virus.
President Obama on Friday wanted to meet with Pham “to thank her for her service,” Josh Earnest said at his daily White House briefing.
When White House officials found out early Friday that Pham would be released, Earnest said, they contacted the NIH “to let her know that the president was interested in meeting her if she felt up to it.”
The day after a doctor in New York City was diagnosed with Ebola, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said President Obama would have "no qualms about riding the subway...or taking a stroll on the High Line." (AP)
Pham did not undergo any additional medical testing before greeting—and hugging—the president, Earnest said, noting that she had been shown to be free of the virus on five separate occasions before being released.
Earnest also provided new details Friday about the coordination between federal and New York state officials after Spencer fell ill Thursday. President Obama ordered the Pentagon to provide an aircraft to transport a team of experts from the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta to New York City’s Bellevue Hospital so they could get there “as soon as possible,” he said.
The team, which helped supervise the protocols for treating Spencer, arrived “within a couple of hours” of his arrival, Earnest added.
“We certainly are pleased that so much of the planning that’s been done in recent days has proved to be useful,” Earnest said of how Bellevue’s handled Spencer’s admission.
While federal officials are discussing the idea of quarantining medical professionals upon their return to the United States, Earnest emphasized that officials are still determining whether it is medically justified.
“These kinds of policy decisions are going to be driven by science,” he said.
The administration is focused on protecting the American public, Earnest said. “But at the same time we don’t have to overly burden those individuals who are going to great lengths to stop this outbreak at the source,” he added.
Earnest also emphasized that these aid workers are aware of the public health concerns stemming from their service.
“Individuals who have spent time in West Africa certainly understand the seriousness of this disease,” he said, adding at one point of the precautions Spencer took upon his return to New York, “He is a highly trained medical professional [and] certainly had the capacity to take his own temperature.”
White House officials continued to emphasize the low probability of an Ebola outbreak in the U.S. Earnest said Obama would “have no qualms” about riding the New York subway, visiting the High Line or visiting a Brooklyn bowling alley even in the aftermath of Spencer’s diagnosis.
“The fact is, the risk facing the average New Yorker is exceedingly low,” he said.

Spencer works at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center. On Thursday, the hospital called him “a dedicated humanitarian” who “always puts his patients first.” The hospital said in a statement that he had not been to work and had not seen patients since returning from overseas.
On Tuesday, two days before he was hospitalized and diagnosed, Spencer went to a bowling alley in Williamsburg, rode three New York subway lines and used an Uber car. The bowling alley had closed after Spencer’s diagnosis, while Uber said that health officials had told them the car’s driver and any subsequent passengers were not at risk.
Spencer was is in stable condition Friday , authorities said, and he is talking to public-health workers as they try to trace his steps in recent days. Even as “disease detectives” work to determine who Spencer may have encountered and check the coffee shops and restaurants he visited, officials stressed that they felt they had the situation contained and urged calm among residents.

“New Yorkers who had not been exposed to an infected person’s bodily fluids are simply not at risk,” New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said during a briefing Friday afternoon. “There is no reason for New Yorkers to change their daily routine in any way.”
Spencer “poses no threat to others,” de Blasio said.
The ongoing treatment for Spencer at Bellevue Hospital involves giving him fluid and electrolytes and monitoring his vital signs, said Ram Raju, head of the city’s Health and Hospitals Corporation. Spencer remains in good enough shape to talk on the phone and tell the disease detectives from the health department about his steps so far this week.
Cuomo on Thursday had said that Spencer was a medical professional who had seen Ebola up close, adding that the doctor had been monitoring himself and immediately recognized the symptoms.
“He was familiar with the possibility and the circumstances, so he handled himself accordingly,” Cuomo said.
New York officials repeatedly emphasized on Thursday and Friday that they were prepared for Ebola’s arrival, having trained while also preparing Bellevue and other hospitals for handling patients with the virus.

Rep. Darrell Issa, a California Republican who chairs the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, urged the Obama administration on Friday to take steps to improve what he characterized as a “bumbling” response to the Ebola crisis.
“I think we all know that the system is not yet refined to where we could say it is working properly,” he said during a hearing on the U.S. government’s response to the disease.
Issa and other members of Congress questioned the measures taken by the administration to prepare for a possible pandemic before Ebola appeared in U.S. hospitals, as well as what officials have done since then to ensure the disease doesn’t spread.
Nicole Laurie, a senior official at the Department of Health and Human Services, said Friday that the risk of a significant Ebola outbreak in the United States was “remote.”
But health-care workers who will be the first to respond to Ebola cases in the United States were worried, particularly after two nurses contracted the disease through an exposure that has still not been explained.
Deborah Burger, co-president of National Nurses United, said these workers remain at risk. She said nurses have received inconsistent instructions, were often left to make decisions about proper precautions for themselves, and at times were forced to improvise their own protective gear because their medical facilities were unprepared. She said only new, legally required guidelines would ensure that medical facilities would provide workers the protection they need.
“The response to Ebola from U.S. hospitals and governmental agencies has been dangerously inconsistent and inadequate,” she said. “The lack of mandates and shifting guidelines from agencies and reliance on voluntary compliance has left caregivers uncertain, severely unprepared and vulnerable to infection.”

Diwali gift: Flats  cars  jewellery to `loyal staffersSurat-based diamond firm Hari Krishna Exports Pvt Ltd gave away gifts including Fiat cars to its employees at a function held on Sunday at the company's private lawns..
Ahmedabad, Oct 20:  
They all waited in their hundreds with bated breath in that sprawling lawn in Surat, awaiting the ‘divine’ announcement from the generous pauper-turned-diamond king and returned home as happy owners of cars, flats and gold-and-diamond jewellery worth a total of Rs 50 crore on Sunday.
In what was, perhaps, the most generous Diwali gift event anywhere in India in recent history, as Savjibhai Dholakia, a diamond worker-turned-merchant, gifted those valuables to the nearly 1,200 employees of Hari Krishna Exports Pvt Ltd who passed the ‘loyalty test’. The venue looked like a vast car mela as shining vehicles awaited their owners. Each rewardee returned with a Diwali gift worth Rs 4 lakh.
People recalled it like a Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL’s) AGMs held in a stadium in the past, as Savjibhai doled out jaw-dropping goodies as rewards to his ‘best performing’ employees.
“We don’t look at it as a bonus or incentive. But we call it a Loyalty Programme, under which we recognise our employees who have contributed great value to the growth of this company by constantly upgrading their skills over these years,” Dholakia told BusinessLine on Monday.
The company, which has over 6,000 employees in Surat alone and another 3,000 in Mumbai and across the world, had organised a grand celebration on Sunday at its huge private lawn inside Hari Krishna Complex on the outskirts of Surat. The 1,200 employees who were qualified for the ‘Loyalty Programme’ were given three options to choose from: a Fiat Punto car, part-payment for a 2-BHK flat or gold and diamond jewellery.
“We wanted our employee to live a complete life with own house and a car. Hence, the company offered Rs 4 lakh contribution for purchase of a 2-BHK flat. Those who already had a house, we offered them a Fiat car worth about Rs 4 lakh. And those who had both, we rewarded them with jewellery worth the same amount,” said Dholakia, who had bargained hard with Fiat dealer for a heavy discount.
Around 491 employees opted for cars, 207 preferred taking company’s contribution for new flat and the remaining over 500 employees chose to take jewellery.
Interestingly these employees hold job profiles ranging from diamond polishing worker to marketing executive and office executives - most of them drawing a minimum monthly salary of Rs 60,000. About 60 per cent of his total workforce is from Saurashtra, while many workers hail from North Gujarat and Rajasthan.
Dholakia had began Hari Krishna Exports in 1991 after 10 years of rigorous diamond polishing work. Today, he claims to achieve the sales turnover of Rs 6,000 crore from diamond exports for the fiscal 2014-15. Its jewellery vertical has a turnover of about Rs 700 crore.
As a recognition of the contribution of his employees to his company’s success, Dholakia introduced the Loyalty Programme two years ago. In the first year, three diamond polishing workers were gifted cars, while last year this number went up to 72.
Meanwhile, Dholakia has also set up an in-house institute, which runs one/two-year courses on diamond polishing and overall diamond polishing engineering for those interested to take up diamond polishing as a profession.
“We guarantee that trained at our institute, the person will surely get a job with starting salary of at least Rs 50,000 per month,” added Dholakia

Women wary of anti-poverty schemesWomen wary of anti-poverty schemes
Deepti KC
Incorporating women: Greater awareness and tangible results are factors to consider. AKHILESH KUMAR
They drop out on account of cultural taboos and lack of follow up efforts by implementing agencies
Despite opportunities and systematic community-driven handholding support from the Government and non-government bodies, women might still choose not to participate in the economic development process. Under the purview of the National Rural Livelihoods Mission, the world’s largest poverty alleviation initiative, the Government and NGOs are targeting women from the poorest households in the economic development process. One such project is the Bihar Rural Livelihoods Project (BRLP) or Project JEEViKA.
Implemented in select districts of Bihar, the project facilitates the formation of women-based self-help groups (SHGs) federated at the village level to form village organisations (VOs). VOs receive investments from the project and play a vital role in implementing livelihoods interventions. Additionally, village resource persons (VRPs) are engaged to provide technical assistance to SHG members.
To understand what influences women’s willingness to participate in economic development programmes, we interviewed 613 SHG women from 24 villages in three districts of Bihar, where the project was introduced more than four years ago. The sample is not representative; ; nevertheless, the challenges we have recognised in these 24 villages could work as lessons for all.
Missing links
Half the women we interviewed were from landless households, and amongst those who owned land, the average land size was not more than half an acre. Thus, the project has been exceptionally successful in mobilising women from the poorest households in its community structure. However, a majority of the women, despite being informed about the livelihoods intervention, were not engaged.
JEEViKA’s most promoted intervention, system of crop intensification (SCI), was adopted only by 27 per cent of women, of whom half had discontinued the service. For many, it was due to lack of adequate land (60 per cent). This casts a serious doubt on the concept of farm innovation alone being the right kind of innovation for women belonging to landless or near landless households. JEEViKA has acknowledged this concern and so it also promotes off-farm and non-farm interventions such as poultry farming, agarbatti-making and so on. However, the data implies that participation has been less than satisfactory. Firstly, cultural barriers and taboos discouraged women from participating. For example, despite being affordable, only 8 per cent took up poultry farming; 43 per cent reported they did not want to share their household space with chickens as it affected their social status within the caste system.
Another constraint was lack of time. The project started the kitchen garden initiative in order to enable women to grow a variety of vegetables in their own premises. The project provides free or subsidised seeds and other technical support. Despite this, only 4 per cent of women adopted the initiative, mainly because many perceived it as requiring extra time and energy, and not providing any immediate income.
At the same time, many women felt that enterprise-based intervention could help them generate immediate income. However, there were no active follow-ups provided. For example, 52 per cent reported that they had been waiting for the agarbatti-making enterprise to start, however, they had not heard about it from the resource persons. This clearly highlights the incongruity between the women’s needs and the opportunities being offered by the project.
Continuous support
We also found that participating women who frequently receive handholding support from resource persons were three times more likely to re-apply the technique. For example, 48 per cent of women who had previously adopted the SCI technique stopped re-applying. Of the women who were visited by the resource persons, 58 per cent re-applied, compared to 31 per cent who had not been visited. What is interesting is that 64 per cent of women who had adopted this technique reported an increase in the productivity of crops, yet this had no significant effect on the re-application.
Lastly, it has been observed that a woman who is in the SHG leadership position or receives support from the village organisations is more than twice as likely to participate in the intervention. The findings of the IFMR study clearly indicates that provisions of well-designed interventions do not guarantee participation. There are many factors that come into play that influence women’s decisions — cultural beliefs, perceived opportunity cost of the intervention, and handholding support they receive from the project’s stakeholders.
The implementers need to be aware of the factors. Failure to do so might not only affect its long-term success, but also systematically exclude the most disadvantaged women from participating in livelihood interventions.

Chicago revamps its SRO proposalChicago revamps its SRO proposal

Chicago's tweaked SRO proposal has more in it for developers
Tenants still to get cash in tweaked Chicago SRO proposal
Chicago has backed away from a proposal to regulate the redevelopment of single-room-occupancy hotels in the city, and instead will offer more options for building owners and developers while still requiring cash payments for displaced long-term tenants.
An ordinance that would make it more expensive to convert single-room-occupancy hotels in Chicago into market-rate housing moved closer to becoming law Monday with an endorsement from aldermen. ( John Byrne, Mary Ellen Podmolik )
Backed by Mayor Rahm Emanuel and introduced last month, the original proposal's long list of mandates would have barred the city from approving the demolition or conversion of an SRO to market-rate housing unless the owner set aside 20 percent of the units for low-income residents or paid the city $200,000 for each unit that should have been kept affordable.
That key requirement, deemed onerous by building owners who said they might mount a legal challenge, is gone from a revised proposal circulated among housing groups, building owners and developers.
However, the proposed substitute Single-Room Occupancy Preservation Ordinance still offers protections and cash payments that range from $2,000 to $10,600, depending on the circumstances, to displaced tenants who have lived in a building for at least 32 days.
8
Michael Negron, Emanuel's policy chief, said set-aside requirements were not needed to accomplish the city's goal, which is to preserve the stock of affordable housing in gentrifying neighborhoods. "The right-to-purchase section really gets at our concern, buildings that are housing vulnerable populations but are in areas that are growing," he said. "Now there's an early warning system."
0
Owners who choose to sell a building would have three options. They could  negotiate in good faith for at least 180 days with a representative of tenants like a nonprofit group that would keep the entire building affordable. If those talks produce no agreement, the owner could sell to another buyer within the next 90 days with no affordable-unit restrictions. If no sale occurs in those 90 days, the owner would have to again start the process of finding a buyer that would keep the building affordable.
Or, owners could bypass the first two options and sell the building to whomever they choose. In that case, the buyer would have to pay to the city $20,000 per unit in preservation fees. In that scenario, each displaced long-term renter would receive $10,600.
Long-term tenants who are not given the opportunity to return to their building would receive a relocation payment of $2,000 or three months' rent, whichever is greater.
Shorter-term displaced tenants would get back their security deposits plus interest and any unpaid rent.
The revised proposal could be taken up by the city's housing and real estate committee next week. In July, the city passed a six-month moratorium on issuing building permits for projects other than normal maintenance while it developed protections for Chicago's supply of housing for its very-low and low-income residents. In the past three years, more than 2,000 rooms of housing have been converted to market-rate apartments. The city has said it wants to preserve at least 700 SRO units during the next five years.
"We recognized the reality that we needed to compromise," said Mary Tarullo, a community organizer with ONE Northside, a group working with the city to draft regulations. "We still think we have a strong ordinance. The goal is for these developments to be put into the hands of developers who are going to improve them and also keep them affordable."
Fees collected under the ordinance would be set aside in a fund from which SRO owners could seek forgivable loans for building rehabs.
Owners say the proposal still needs more tweaks. They say the 180-day sale negotiation period is too long and the potential $10,600 payment is too high and unfairly based on the Keep Chicago Renting ordinance when SROs, by their definition, house only one person in a unit.
"Before, the city said take it or leave it," said Eric Rubenstein, an owner of three SROs and executive director of the Single Room Housing Assistance Corp., which represents 75 properties. "The city is understanding better that the original version was lopsided and unfair and would drive these properties out of business. We still have a lot of work to do on this."

Amazon Fire Phone Proves To Be an Expensive Flopamazon fire phone proves to be an expensive flop
Cloud  lifts Microsoft earnings above expec...'Cloud' lifts Microsoft earnings above expectations
By Reuters | 24 Oct, 2014, 07.22AM IST
Revenue rose 25 percent to $23.2 billion, helped by the phone business it bought from Nokia in April, easily beating analysts' average estimate of $22 billion.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
SEATTLE: Microsoft Corp reported higher-than-expected quarterly revenue, helped by stronger sales of its phones, Surface tablets and cloud-computing products for companies, while keeping its profit margins largely intact.
The results on Thursday allayed fears of investors in recent days that the industry shift toward lower-margin cloud services was proving hard for established technology leaders to master.
Microsoft shares, which have climbed 33 percent over the past year, rose another 3 percent in after-hours trading to $46.36.
"In light of recent negative earnings results from tech bellwethers Oracle, IBM, SAP, VMware, and EMC, Microsoft is bucking the trend and we would label these September results as a solid accomplishment," said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets.
Investors were keenly watching Microsoft after harsh warnings from International Business Machines Corp and SAP about operating profits as they make tentative inroads into the cloud, which generally yields thinner margins than technology companies are used to.
Microsoft did not disclose its cloud-based revenue for the fiscal first quarter, but said commercial cloud sales rose 128 percent, while sales of services based on its Azure cloud platform rose 121 percent.
Perhaps more importantly, it said gross profit margin in the unit that includes Azure rose 194 percent, despite rising infrastructure costs, which includes the huge expense of building and operating datacenters.
In the last four years, Microsoft's gross profit margin has drifted down to about 65 percent from above 80 percent, largely due to its move into the less profitable business of making tablets and phones, but accelerated by the move to the cloud.
Nomura analyst Rick Sherlund figures Microsoft is on track to hit $6 billion a year in cloud revenue soon, which would make it the industry's largest cloud vendor by his calculations. That represents only about 6 percent of overall expected revenue this fiscal year, but investors are highly sensitive to a business they see as key to the future.
"We're the only company with cloud revenue at our scale that is growing at triple digit rates," said Satya Nadella, on a conference call with analysts.
Nadella was keen to stress that Microsoft is more focused on selling higher-margin services via the cloud to its commercial customers rather than just storage and computing power. "Our premium services on Azure create new monetization opportunities in media, data, machine learning, fast analytics, and enterprise mobility," he said.
PROFIT FELL ON CHARGE
Microsoft's fiscal first-quarter profit actually fell 13 percent, largely due to an expected $1.1 billion charge related to mass layoffs announced in July, which lopped 11 cents per share off earnings.
Including that charge, the world's largest software company reported profit of $4.5 billion, or 54 cents per share, compared with $5.2 billion, or 62 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter.
Still, it easily beat Wall Street's forecast of 49 cents per share, including the charge, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The charge resulted from Microsoft's plan, launched in July, to cut 18,000 jobs, or about 14 percent of its workforce, with most of those cuts coming from its newly acquired Nokia phone business.
Revenue rose 25 percent to $23.2 billion, helped by the phone business it bought from Nokia in April, handily exceeding analysts' average estimate of $22 billion.
Sales of its Lumia smartphones hit 9.3 million in the first full quarter since the close of the Nokia deal. Sales of the Surface tablet more than doubled to $908 million from $400 million in the year-ago quarter.

Google is expanding its artificial intelligence initiative, hiring more than half a dozen leading academics and experts in the field and announcing a partnership with Oxford University to "accelerate" its efforts.
Google will make a "substantial contribution" to establish a research partnership with Oxford's computer science and engineering departments, the company said on Thursday regarding its work to develop the intelligence of machines and software, often to emulate human-like intelligence.
Google did not provide any financial details about the partnership, saying only in a post on its blog that it will include a program of student internships and a series of joint lectures and workshops "to share knowledge and expertise."

#google #oxford university #artificial intelligence
Google, which is based in Mountain View, California, is building up its artificial intelligence capabilities as it strives to maintain its dominance in the Internet search market and to develop new products such as robotics and self-driving cars. In January Google acquired artificial intelligence company Deep Mind for $400 million according to media reports.
The new hires will be joining Google's Deep Mind team, including three artificial intelligence experts whose work has focused on improving computer visual recognition systems. Among that team is Oxford Professor Andrew Zisserman, a three-time winner of the Marr Prize for computer vision.
The four founders of Dark Blue Labs will also be joining Google where they will be will be leading efforts to help machines "better understand what users are saying to them."
Google said that three of the professors will hold joint appointments at Oxford, continuing to work part time at the university.

More on Clarence Thomas and KorematsuBy Ilya Somin October 24
Drake Law School Professor Mark Kende has posted a response to my critique of his argument that Justice Clarence Thomas supports the Supreme Court’s infamous decision in Korematsu v. United States, which upheld the World War II-era internment of over 100,000 Japanese-Americans.
In my previous post, I emphasized that Thomas’ occasional positive citations to Korematsu are limited to a largely uncontroversial part of its holding: that racial classifications are subject to strict scrutiny national security is a “compelling” government interest that might sometimes justify racial discrimination in extreme circumstances. By contrast, he has never said that the Korematsu Court correctly applied that rule to the facts of the case before it. Kende responds as follows:
[I]n the Fisher v. Texas affirmative action [case], Justice Thomas cites to Korematsu as supporting the forcible relocation of Japanese-Americans on the west coast even under strict scrutiny. Thomas in Fisher said that Korematsu found the internment “had a definite and close relationship to the prevention of espionage and sabotage.” But Ilya then says that Justice Thomas is only “summarizing” Korematsu without necessarily approving it (despite Thomas’s recitation of the facts). This is odd. For example, at the end of his essay Ilya says that Justice Thomas is “usually among the justices least willing to suppress his own views for the sake of consensus.” By that logic, one would suspect Justice Thomas cited Korematsu approvingly in Fisher. Thomas could have cited other cases.
There is no contradiction here. I did not claim that Thomas, in this passage, suppressed his view on Korematsu for the sake of consensus. He simply chose not to give a comprehensive analysis of the rightness (or lack thereof) of Korematsu, because he didn’t need to do so to make the very limited point this passage was devoted to. All he did was 1) cite Korematsu for the mostly uncontroversial proposition that national security is a compelling state interest (the supposed threat of espionage and sabotage is of course a national security interest), and 2) summarize its holding in a passage whose main function is to summarize past cases where the Supreme Court held that a particular interest is important enough to qualify as compelling for strict scrutiny purposes. He could perhaps have cited a different case for the former proposition. But, as Thomas himself explained, he cited Korematsu because it was both the first case to hold that strict scrutiny applies to racial classifications and the first to conclude that national security was an important enough interest to pass strict scrutiny.
Kende also argues that Thomas’ dissent in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld can’t be distinguished from Korematsu on the basis that the former involved alleged enemy combatants, whereas the latter involved civilians who were not enemy combatants or even claimed to be such. Kende suggests that “[t]he alleged grave national security concerns asserted by American military leaders and by the President regarding Japanese-American loyalty on the west coast, and regarding the supposed danger of invasion, would have likely created far greater national security worries for Justice Thomas than a single enemy combatant.” Obviously, the issue in Hamdi was not just the status of a single enemy combatant, but the way alleged enemy combatants should be handled in the War on Terror more generally (just as the rule in Korematsu was not limited to Fred Korematsu himself). Moreover, there are a obvious differences between alleged enemy combatants and ordinary civilians distinguished from the rest of the population only by race or national origin. The latter both have stronger legal rights and are less likely to be threats to national security than the former.
Kende also suggests that Thomas’ deference to racial classifications by prison officials in Johnson v. California would require him to deter to the government in Korematsu because “Japanese-American internment camps were… the essential equivalent of prisons.” The camps were certainly prison-like in the sense that their inmates were not free to leave at will. But, as I noted in my earlier post, the camps were not legally equivalent to prisons because the Japanese-Americans interned in them had never been convicted of any crime, or even charged with one. Thus, they are not covered by various precedents holding that convicted criminals incarcerated for their crimes have much weaker constitutional rights than ordinary citizens. As I also pointed out, this distinction is likely the reason why Justice Scalia joined Thomas’ dissent in Johnson, but also opposes the Korematsu decision .
Finally, Kende argues that Thomas’ failure to cite Korematsu in his dissent in Hamdi is somehow an indication that he agrees with the former. He suggests that Thomas chose not to cite it, despite its potential relevance, because he did not want to reveal the fact that he agreed with it. If Thomas really were intent on hiding his supposed agreement with Korematsu by avoiding citation to it, one would think that he would also avoid citing it in other opinions. Yet, as Kende emphasizes he did cite it in at least two other cases. Moreover, Thomas’ omission of Korematsu from the discussion of precedents supporting his position in Hamdi could just as easily be construed as due to disagreement with the case. Unlike in Fisher, where the relevant part of Korematsu was largely uncontroversial, in Hamdi the relevant part was the Court’s deference to the executive on the question of whether the Japanese-Americans really posed a serious enough threat to justify racially-based internment. Quite possibly, Thomas chose not to cite the Court’s analysis on this point because he thought it was wrong.

Euro dips ahead of banks  stress test results  sterling firmDollar surges on strong U.S. jobs data, more room to rise
By Daniel Bases, Reuters
Finance Federal Reserve Mario Draghi Stanley Fischer European Central Bank
The U.S. dollar reached fresh multiyear highs on Friday after a stronger-than-forecast November U.S. jobs report increased expectations the Federal Reserve may begin raising interest rates sooner than previously thought.
Employers added the most workers in nearly three years in November and wages rose, the latest U.S. employment report showed. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 321,000, better than forecasts for an increase of 230,000. The unemployment rate held steady at a six-year low of 5.8 percent.

Earlier this week U.S. central bank officials such as New York Fed President William Dudley and Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer made comments that pointed toward rate increases in response to stronger U.S. economic figures, maintaining a focus on what the data showed.
"The Fed already indicated that they were shifting. The comments from Dudley and Fischer earlier this week suggested they were beginning to think seriously about normalizing (policy) and this would make them think even more seriously, that they should be thinking about H1 (first half of the year) versus H2," said Steven Englander, global head of G10 foreign exchange strategy at CitiFX.

Friday's jobs data pulled market expectations for the Fed to start tightening monetary policy back toward mid-2015 from September.
Interest rate futures contracts now show that traders see about a 53 percent chance for a July 2015 hike, based on the CME FedWatch program. That is more in line with last month's Reuters poll of economists who see the first rate increase in June of next year.
"The trend is pretty good. Now comes the second-guessing in the market. It brings concerns that the Fed might look to raise earlier than some people had expected. I don't think anyone should fear the Fed right now," said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida. Brown said the increase could be seasonal but there is optimism heading into 2015.
Rising U.S. interest rates would be in stark contrast to the euro zone and Japan, where monetary policy is moving in the opposite direction. The pattern would increase the yield advantage for investors holding U.S. dollar-denominated assets.
"We think dollar/yen could hit 125 yen before the end of 2014. But then it is going to stabilize. We think that the good news will be priced in at that stage," said Englander, who added the euro has more to fall, perhaps reaching $1.20 before the end of the year and plumbing lows of $1.12 to $1.15 in 2015.
In late afternoon New York trade, the dollar traded at 121.42 yen, a gain of 1.37 percent but off a high of 121.68 yen, the strongest level since mid-2007.
The euro fell 0.70 percent to $1.2290. In the immediate trading after the payrolls data the euro slid to $1.2271, its weakest since mid-August 2012.
On Thursday, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said the central bank would decide early next year whether to take fresh action to revive the economy. Draghi also said any decision by the bank's Governing Council need not be unanimous to begin quantitative easing measures, including buying of sovereign bonds in an effort to spur borrowing and investment.
Some in the market were disappointed Draghi did not find an even more explicit way of moving the bank closer to outright quantitative easing.
But his language, and a veiled warning that opposition from German policymakers would not stand in the way of the governing council acting if need be, pointed towards the launch of bond-buying in the first quarter.
"Taking on board likely further falls in headline HICP (inflation), Draghi's comments give succour to the idea that further policy moves are coming at the next couple of meetings," said London-based Gavin Friend, senior markets strategist at National Australia Bank.
The U.S. dollar index hit a peak of 89.467 <.DXY>, its highest since early March 2009, up 0.86 percent on the day.
The slide in crude oil prices to below $66 a barrel  continued to undermine the Norwegian crown. At one point the dollar advanced 1.75 percent to 7.1793 crowns , its strongest since March 2009. It traded late at 7.1263 crowns, for a 1 percent gain on the day.

Does the air umbrella actually workComments
By Tuan C. Nguyen October 24
The air umbrella is a novel idea, but blasting away raindrops with air is going overboard. (Chuan Wang)
Umbrellas have been around seemingly forever. But if there were ever to be a second coming, it wouldn’t be a stretch to assume it would resemble the air umbrella.
Conceived in the form of a sleek wand, the device is both minimalist and high-tech. Push a button and a stream of jet air flows out from the motorized tip, generating an invisible barrier against the rain. It’s almost too perfect.
Of course, then, we have the big question of whether an actual product will ever materialize.  
For now, specifics are spare. The inventor’s fundraising campaign site on Kickstarter features a promotional video that, using a series of graphics-rendered mock-ups, details various models currently under development. Backers can choose from a compact women’s version, which measures a foot long, weighs just over a pound and is limited to 15 minute of operation on a single charge, as well as two other models that are longer and can run for 30 minutes. Near the end, there’s a brief lab demo of the latest prototype.  
With that, the air umbrella easily blew past its goal of $10,000. As of this writing, it’s raised just over $100,000, with funding set to close Friday morning.
To its credit, the air umbrella aims to solve some of the most pervasively glaring flaws of umbrella design. For one, the folding mechanism that enables canopies to collapse down also tends to give way to gusts that get caught along the inside, causing it to invert. Even when functionally intact, some parts can still poke passerbys. There’s also that annoying “wet umbrella” problem.   
A handful of start-ups have tried tackling these deficiencies through clever redesigns, though all fall short in some way. Alternatives include the redrawn Rainshader , with a canopy that’s curved downward, away from nearby pedestrians and the Senz umbrella , a variant that’s aerodynamically-formulated to channel wind flow fluidly across the surface to prevent the kind of resistance that can flip an umbrella inside-out. In Japan, inventor Hiroshi Kajimoto introduced the UnBRELLA , which, ironically, is designed to fold inside-out to allow excess droplets to drain out. 
The air umbrella design isn’t besieged with any of these complications because, well, there’s no actual physical canopy, so to speak. Simply put, as raindrops fall, a continuous stream of fast-moving air catches and blows them sideways. The physics is somewhat similar to how a leaf blower works.
“Rain falls at a terminal velocity or steady speed of 7 mph, which is reasonably slow,” explains Louis Bloomfield, a physics professor at the University of Virginia and author of How Things Work: The Physics of Everyday Life. “So with a consistent wind force, you can conceivably redirect their path away from the person below.”
While Bloomfield, who has no connection to the project, deems the technology to be fundamentally sound, he did question the practicality of a high-priced (starting at $88) gadget that weighs up to two pounds and takes at least an hour to recharge.
“With jetted air, you have only a fraction of a second to get it going sideways very quickly and that’ll require a lot of power to produce forces that strong,” he adds. “I imagine if you’re going for a walk, it’s likely the battery will run out on you.”
And though no one is in danger of getting poked, sharing a sidewalk with an air umbrella will likely mean enduring another kind of annoyance. 
“For people nearby, it might feel like walking in a windstorm because they’ll definitely feel a breeze,” he says. “It’ll probably be worse for the person next to you because they’ll also be sprayed by the drops that are being blown aside.”
His recommendation? Stick with a standard, unpowered $5 umbrella. 
“Even if you have a fancy, high-tech device, you’re still going to end up needing a regular umbrella anyway.” he says. “That kind of defeats the purpose, I think.”

What was fake on the Internet this week: Banksys arrest  Red Velvet Oreos and exploding bongsBy Caitlin Dewey October 24 Follow @caitlindewey
A screenshot from the satirical Facebook page “Christians for Michele Bachmann.” (Facebook)
There is so much fake stuff on the Internet in any given week that we’ve grown tired of debunking it all. Fake Twitter fights . Fake pumpkin-spice products . Amazing viral video? Nope — a Jimmy Kimmel stunt !
So rather than take down each and every undeservedly viral story that crosses our monitors each week, we’re rounding them all up in a quick, once-a-week Friday debunk of fake photos, misleading headlines and bad studies that you probably shouldn’t share over the weekend.
Ready? Here’s what was fake on the Internet this week:
1. Banksy was not arrested in Bristol. This is not the first time that Paul Horner has tricked the Internet into thinking he’s Banksy. This latest hoax, spurred by a (fake) story that Horner wrote for the (fake) news site National Report, was read by nearly 5 million people — and shared more than 3 million times. Of course, as we discovered in a long chat with Horner this week , he’s a would-be comedian in Phoenix … not, you know, an elusive graffiti mastermind with a cult-like following. Incidentally, the real Banksy painted a new mural  just this Monday.
2. New York police did not stop and frisk two Muslim men for wearing traditional garments. Some 200,000 viewers were rightly disturbed by a video that surfaced on YouTube over the weekend, purportedly showing an NYPD officer confronting two Muslim men over their clothes. The officer in the video was, however, and actor — and the men in the video were forced to admit, after taking a bit of Internet heat, that the clip was “a dramatization … to raise awareness for Racial Profiling.” Unfortunately, that message seems to have gone right over some commenters’ heads: “These muhammadan seditionists need to be arrested for impersonating a police officer,” raged one popular comment. “[They] are abusing our laws to line their own pockets and to gain more islamic terrorists through their twisted lies.” The lies might be twisted, but they’re just trying to gain YouTube hits, bro.
3. There is no Red Velvet Oreo. Marketing students in San Marcos, Tex., should definitely get an A for this little stunt, wherein they Photoshopped a crimson cookie onto an Oreo package and claimed that Nabisco was launching the new flavor for Valentine’s Day. Nabisco has not, alas, chosen to weigh in on the issue. But a Facebook post on the “Red Velvet Oreo” page two days ago would seem to confirm that this weird novelty — like Butterbeer and Fried Chicken before it! — isn’t actually meant to be.
4. An exploding bong did not take off half a woman’s face. A Facebook PSA about the dangers of marijuana — captioned, scarily, “THIS COULD HAPPEN TO YOU” — claims that a young woman was gruesomely disfigured when her bong exploded. In fact, the woman pictured is an Internet-famous makeup artist dressed up for a zombie bar crawl … and “Christians for Michele Bachman,” the page that posted her picture, is satirical and has nothing to do with the politician. Alas, this has not stopped 21,000 people from sharing the post, and a whopping 49,000 from commenting.
“How did this dumb s*** get on my page?” One man wrote. “It’s an insult that they think we are this stupid. LOST MY VOTE.”
Did we miss any other notable fake stuff this week? E-mail caitlin.dewey@washpost.com — or stay tuned until next week, because surely some more shenanigans will go down in the meantime.

Partial solar eclipse: Stunning photos from D.C. and beyondStargazers in Florida gather to watch a partial solar eclipse near a pier in Naples on Thursday. (Jay Staton )
 
Considerable cloud cover meant Thursday evening’s partial solar eclipse often played hide and seek for D.C. area skywatchers.  Nevertheless, a number of photographers managed to capture magnificent views.  Not only do photos reveal the “pac-man”-like bite taken out of the sun, but several also show the prominent sunspot region AR2192, the largest observed since 1990 , some 80,000 miles across!
Here we share with you standout images from the D.C. area and other parts of the nation, collected from Flickr , Twitter , and Facebook , as well as shared with us via email.  Thanks to everyone who sent pictures to our attention!

Tata Motors to raise $600 mn through notes to service debt  fund capexTata Motors to raise $750 mn through notes to service debt, fund capex
BS Reporter | Mumbai Oct 25, 2014 12:44 AM IST
Tata Motors, India’s biggest automaker, is set to raise $750 million (Rs 4,600 crore) in what could be its second fund raising activity this year.
The Mumbai-based company will reportedly issue $750 million of senior unsecured notes, according to Bloomberg.
The $500-million 5.5-year issue is priced at 4.625 per cent while another $250-million issue is priced at 5.75 per cent for a 10-year period, stated the agency.
In May, the company’s wholly owned-subsidiary TML Holdings raised $300 million (about Rs 1,800 crore) through an issue of debt securities having fixed interest rate. Last year TML Holdings, which also owns Jaguar and Land Rover, raised $350 million through senior fixed notes.
When contacted the company did not comment.  Tata Motors intends to use a bulk of proceeds to refinance existing ECB debt with the balance to be used to fund capital expenditure plans and investment. Tata Motors would be spending about Rs 3,500-4000 crore on capital expenditure at the stand-alone level this year. Last year it spent Rs 3,094 crore on capex, design and development of products.
Jaguar Land Rover, the UK-based luxury brand, has announced a hike in capital expenditure plan this year to £3.5-3.7 billion from around £2.75 billion last year. This includes funding for the new China and Brazil plants, new power trains and technologies to meet regulatory requirements, capacity expansion at the existing UK facilities and also meeting new product development expenses.
“In the near term, funds are needed to support the Zest and Bolt launches as well as the inventory increase as overall activity picks up. We also expect further investment to be made in TMFL, which is integral to the marketing effort but which is experiencing a higher level of NPAs and lower margins resulting from the last two years of weak vehicle sales,” said a recent Moody’s report on Tata Motors which gave a Ba2 rating to the issue of notes with a stable outlook. The compact sedan Zest launched by the company in August met a lukewarm response from the market with just over 3,300 units sold in the first month (September) of the sale. Maruti Suzuki Dzire sold a little over 17,000 units and Honda Amaze clocked around 5,000 units in the same month.
The company had stated in September that it had got bookings for 10,000 units for the Zest. It is also simultaneously gearing up for the launch of the hatchback Bolt set for launch before March. The Bolt is built on the same platform as Zest and would be competing against the like of Hyundai Grand i10 and Maruti Celerio.
“The stable outlook reflects JLR's relative strength which continues to allow time for the core Indian business to recover and, despite the negative free cash flow overall, continues to support group credit metrics at an appropriate level for the Ba2 rating. However, FY2015 is a critical year as JLR's sales growth rate slows and execution risk rises both in terms of increased product development expenditure and the starting up of overseas manufacturing operations. At the same time, Tata's Indian operations need to regain some of their lost market share with success of new launches key to the passenger car business's long-term prospects,” stated the Moody’s report.

It is followed by Mumbai—based Tara India Fund envisaging investment of Rs 305.63 crore.
Under the defence sector, proposals of Bharti Shipyard Ltd and Solar Industries India will not lead to any fund flow.
Telecom player Verizon Communications India’s proposal for increase in foreign equity participation by its foreign parent from 74 per cent to 100 per cent was approved entailing investment of Rs 2.32 crore.
Meanwhile, FIPB rejected 5 proposals including Sistema Shyam Teleservices Ltd.
SSTL sought permission to increase FDI up to 100 per cent in the company and its downstream wholly owned subsidiary Shyam Internet Services Ltd, both engaged in the telecom sector, on account of conversion of redeemable preference shares into equity.

French filmmakers shoot secret documentary on Jarawa  FIR filedFrench filmmakers shoot secret documentary on Jarawa, FIR filed
PTI
Tweet
Port Blair, Oct 24:  
Two French filmmakers have been booked on the charge of trespassing into the protected Jarawa tribal reserve in the Andaman islands and filming a documentary on the threatened aboriginal tribe.
“We have filed an FIR against French director Alexandre Dereims and producer Claire Beilvert for violating the law of the land. Entering the Jarawa area is banned and so are making any contact with them or shooting any photo or video,” the union territory’s Tribal Welfare Secretary Theva Neethi Dhas told PTI today.
“The police are investigating the matter and gathering evidences against them. If the charges are proved, it could lead to three years of imprisonment, besides a fine,” the Secretary said.
He said two local inhabitants have been arrested for allegedly helping the filmmakers to enter the Jarawa area.
The case was registered on October 19 while the incident is said to have happened during March-April.
The matter came to light only when the Andaman Adim Janjati Vikas Samiti (AAJVS) reported the matter to the administration.
Dhas said they had already sent notices to the filmmakers, who have returned to their homeland, asking them to restrain from releasing any visual related to the Jarawas.
The administration will also ask the Ministry of External Affairs to take up the matter with the French government, he said.
Charges against the two French filmmakers include violation of Protection of the Aboriginal Tribes (Amendment) Act 2012, Foreigners Amendment Act 2004, and Information Technology Act.
Under post-production stage now, the film ‘Organic Jarawa’ is about Utchu, a two-year-old Jarawa boy, his family and friends.

Black money case: Jaitley hiding the truth to show PM Modi in poor light  claims Jethmalani in letter43
4
New Delhi: Former BJP member and Supreme Court advocate Ram Jethmalani has written a letter to Finance Minister Arun Jaitley accusing him of not taking effective steps to bring back black money.
Jethmalani in his letter to the Finance Minister slammed his argument that the names of black money account holders cannot be revealed beacuse it breaches double taxation avoidance agreement with other countries. The former BJP leader claimed that German authorities have agreed to share names with the Indian government without any cost or condition.
The senior lawyer said that he suspects Jaitley did not want the truth to come out, exposing PM Modi to allegations of misguiding the nation. He added that Jaitley had ambtions of becoming PM and it seemed he was trying to take revennge against Modi for taking office.
#ram jethmalani #arun jaitley #black money #bjp
"You are taking the nation to suicide and exposing Modiji to the charge of misguiding the nation. This might be your method of taking revenge for his snatching office which you thought belonged to you," Jethmalani wrote.
Earlier last week, the Centre had told the Supreme Court that it cannot disclose the names of people having black money stashed abroad. The government said that the names could not be made public as it violated the double taxation avoidance agreement.
The government, however, said that the names will be shared with the concerned agencies.
The apex court will hear the government's plea on October 28.

Delhi: Man acquitted of charge of gangrape2
0
New Delhi: A man, who was accused of gang raping a woman along with his two associates after giving her sedatives-laced drink, has been acquitted by a Delhi court which said the alleged victim has turned "hostile" and there was no evidence that she was raped at all.
Additional Sessions Judge Nivedita Anil Sharma freed Manpreet, resident of Ranhola in west Delhi, after the woman deposed that she has no grievance against him and she had established physical relations with co-accused Vipin Lakra, who was earlier acquitted in the case, with her own consent.
Co-accused Lakra and Satpal were acquitted by the court in May this year. The court said that the woman has not deposed an iota of evidence of her being intoxicated and raped at all.
The court said that the woman has not deposed an iota of evidence of her being intoxicated and raped at all.
#delhi #gangrape #delhi court #crimes against women
"She has not even mentioned the word 'rape' in her evidence nor has deposed anything incriminating against the accused Manpreet," the court said, adding that the woman has turned hostile.
"It is clear that the claim of the prosecution is neither reliable nor believable and is not trustworthy and prosecution has failed to establish the offence of intoxication and gang rape against accused. The evidence of the prosecutrix makes it highly improbable that such an incident ever took place," the court said, while acquitting Manpreet.
According to the police, on December 31, 2013, Manpreet along with Lakra and Satpal had given a sedatives-laced cold drink to the woman and thereafter, the trio raped her in a plot in Ranhola Extension.
A supplementary charge sheet was filed against Manpreet. The woman, however, deposed before the court that none of the accused persons had gangraped her after intoxicating her. She had developed friendship with Lakra on facebook and she had physical relations with him several times with her free consent, she told the court adding that he has never forced her in any manner to have physical relations.
She also said that she did not have any grievance against Manpreet and prayed that he may be acquitted. She also said that she did not know Manpreet and also failed to identify him in court.

Bank stocks and other sectors tied to the pace of growth led on the day, though continued weakness in crude oil weighed on energy shares. While major indexes ended off their highs of the session, both the Dow and S&P closed at records.
The state and city pensions would be solvent now if the state and city had put in there share and this sustained rise in the market.

Payrolls rose by 321,000 in November, way above the 230,000 estimated, while the unemployment rate held steady at 5.8 percent, a six-year low.
The report blew past forecasts, but also raised expectations that a rate hike from the Federal Reserve may materialize sooner than previously thought.
Ronald Sanchez, chief investment officer of Fiduciary Trust Company International in New York, said the number was "unambiguously strong," though it "could mean some changes to policy recommendations with the Fed. June 2015 is back on the table for when rates could rise."
Financials <.SPSY> rose 1 percent as higher interest rates would prop up earnings in the sector. Bank of America  rose 2.7 percent to $17.68 while Goldman Sachs  was up 1.8 percent to $195.45, boosting the Dow.
Utilities <.SPLRCU>, a dividend play, fell 0.8 percent as Treasuries yields rose. Energy <.SPNY> fell 1.2 percent alongside a 1.7 percent drop in crude  prices. Most sectors ended well off their highs of the session.
"The day's market action has to be seen in the context of the recovery we've had year-to-date. Payrolls confirm the strength of the economy, but that strength is reflected in stock prices," said Sanchez, who helps oversee $16 billion in assets.
Separate data showed new orders for U.S. factory goods fell for a third straight month in October, pointing to a slowdown in manufacturing activity.
The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> rose 58.69 points, or 0.33 percent, to 17,958.79, the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 3.45 points, or 0.17 percent, to 2,075.37 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 11.32 points, or 0.24 percent, to 4,780.76.
For the week, the Dow rose 0.7 percent and the S&P rose 0.4 percent. It was the seventh straight weekly gain, a streak not seen in a year for both. The Nasdaq fell 0.2 percent on the week.
American Eagle Outfitters  fell 13.8 percent to $11.91 after the teen apparel retailer forecast a current-quarter profit below analysts' estimates and reported its fifth straight drop in quarterly income.
About 5.81 billion shares traded on all U.S. platforms, according to BATS exchange data.
NYSE advancers outnumbered decliners 1,614 to 1,480, for a 1.09-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,809 issues rose and 927 fell, for a 1.95-to-1 ratio favoring advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 98 new 52-week highs and 10 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 168 new highs and 93 new lows.

Hudhud : NIO vessel capsizes off Vizag 
 
The coastal research vessel (CRV) -- Sagar Paschmi -- of the National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIO) capsized off Visakhapatnam coast on the day of cyclone Hudhud,  according to a press release issued by Forward Seamen's Union of India.
Abdul Sharieff, the union representative, said the vessel belonging to the Shipping Corporation of India was on hire to the NIO and on the day of the cyclone it sank near the fishing harbour. All the 12 crew members escaped unhurt. He said it was regrettable that neither the SCI nor the NIO had deemed it fit to report the capsize of the vessel with costly equipment worth crores. Nor did the authorities bother about the crew, he alleged.

Govt sets up think-tank to fine-tune IPR policyGovt sets up think-tank to fine-tune IPR policy
Our Bureau
Tweet
New Delhi, Oct 24:  
The Government has constituted an Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) think-tank to help draft a new National IPR Policy and to advice it on issues related to intellectual property.
The think-tank, headed by Justice Prabha Sridevan, will highlight anomalies in the present IPR legislations and advice the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) on possible solutions, according to an official release.
It will also provide views on the possible implications of demands placed by negotiating partners of proposed free trade pacts and other regional arrangements.
With several developed countries criticising India’s IP regime on grounds of laxity and the US carrying out a review to see if it should be black-listed as a `priority country’ for giving insufficient IP protection to its companies, the think-tank is expected to play an important role in helping the Government deal with international pressure.
Other members of the IPR think-tank include Narendra K Sabarwal, former Deputy Director General of World Intellectual Property Organisation, Rajeev Srinivasan, Director, Asian School of Business, Advocate Pratibha Singh, Advocate Punita Bhargava and Cadila Pharma’s Unnat Pandit.
The DIPP, which constituted the think-tank of Friday, will co-ordinate with it to identify areas in intellectual property where study needs to be conducted, an official release said.
It will also take inputs from it on the new IPR policy which has been proposed to bring clarity in existing laws and safeguard interests of Indian industry.
An inter-ministerial group, with representatives from Ministries and Departments including Commerce & Industry, Health, Information & Broadcasting and Telecom, will soon meet to discuss the new policy for India’s IPR.

Oil minister reviews readiness for re-launch of DBT in LPG schemeOil minister reviews readiness for re-launch of DBT in LPG scheme
BS Reporter | New Delhi Oct 25, 2014 12:40 AM IST
Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Friday reviewed the performance of oil marketing companies for the relaunch of Direct Benefits Transfer in liquefied petroleum gas (LPG)  scheme.
The Union Cabinet had, on 18 October, approved the launch of the scheme aimed at cutting LPG subsidies as well as getting rid of diversion of subsidised cooking gas for commercial purposes. The scheme would be launched in 54 districts across the country in mid November.
Pradhan spoke to a field officer of Indian Oil Corporation in Jalandhar district through video conferencing to understand the issues faced by consumers in implementation of the earlier version of the Direct Benefits Transfer in LPG.
“The oil marketing companies informed the minister about the roll-out plan, along with timelines for different activities to create awareness among LPG consumers about the scheme, the technological changes required and the processes to be put in place for the implementation,” the oil ministry stated.

Paswan meets FM; wants import duty on edible oils to be hikedPaswan meets FM; wants import duty on edible oils to be hiked
Press Trust of India | New Delhi Oct 24, 2014 07:02 PM IST
Food Minister Ram Vilas Paswan today met Finance Minister Arun Jaitley here and discussed the issue of raising import duty on crude and refined edible oils to restrict cheap imports and protect domestic farmers, among other matters.
Problems faced by sugar mills in availing of loans sanctioned through the Sugar Development Fund (SDF) and the issue of additional budget allocation for FCI were also discussed.
"The proposal on increasing import duty on edible oils, additional budget for FCI and loan issue under SDF, among others, were on the agenda of the meeting," Paswan told PTI.
The Food Ministry favours increasing the import duty on crude and refined edible oils from existing 2.5% and 10%, respectively, he said.
Industry body Solvent Extractors Association (SEA) has been demanding a duty hike in crude edible oils to 10% and on refined edible oils to 25% as local prices have fallen to historical lows due to cheaper imports from Malaysia and Indonesia.
On sugar sector issues, Paswan briefed the Finance Minister about the current impasse between the UP sugar mills and the state government over cane price policy, sources said.
Private sugar mills in the state have threatened to suspend operations in the current season beginning this month.
Paswan also discussed about relaxing certain norms so that sugar mills can avail of loans easily from SDF, sources said, adding that he also sought additional budget allocation for state-run Food Corporation of India (FCI) for giving food subsidies this fiscal.
A budget allocation of Rs 92,000 crore has been made against the requirement of Rs 1,47,700 crore for this fiscal.

Ebola vaccine doses could reach Africa by mid-2015: WHOEbola vaccine doses could reach Africa by mid-2015: WHO
AFP | Geneva Oct 24, 2014 06:50 PM IST
Ebola vaccine trials could start in west Africa as early as December, with hundreds of thousands of doses potentially being rolled out by mid-2015, the World Health Organisation said Friday.
"All is being put in place to start efficacy tests in the affected countries as early as December," said WHO assistant director general Marie-Paule Kieny, adding that several hundred thousand doses could be available in the "first half" of next year.
Kieny spoke after the UN health agency held closed-door talks yesterday on potential vaccines with medical experts, officials from Ebola-affected nations, pharmaceutical firms and funding agencies.
Two experimental vaccines are seen as the leading candidates to beat Ebola.
Supplies of Canadian-discovered experimental vaccine rVSV are arriving in Geneva for a new round of trials. Hopes are also centred on ChAd3, made by British company GlaxoSmithKline.
There are five other potential vaccines in the pipeline, Kieny said.
WHO hopes to deploy huge numbers of doses of whichever vaccine proves its mettle in trials to Africa for "real-world" tests.
"Vaccine is not the magic bullet, but when ready, it may be a good part of the effort to turn the tide of the epidemic," Kieny said.

Queen Elizabeth sends her first TweetBy Frances Stead Sellers October 24 Follow @FrancesSSellers
Queen Elizabeth II sent her first tweet Friday - and she signed it “Elizabeth R.” The 88-year-old monarch tried her hand at Twitter as she opened a new gallery in central London’s Science Museum. (AP)
It looked as if there was a little sleight of hand today at 11:35 a.m. GMT when the Queen opened a new gallery at London’s Science Museum and launched herself into the Information Age by sending her first tweet.
Her Majesty walked over to a tablet perched on a podium, removed a glove, and …  a tweet appeared from @BritishMonarchy, an account with about 725,000 followers that is usually managed by Buckingham palace officials.
It is a pleasure to open the Information Age exhibition today at the @ScienceMuseum and I hope people will enjoy visiting. Elizabeth R.
But it didn’t look as if she actually typed.
The text prizes accuracy and formality over the usual conventions of 140-character missives.
There was a little redundancy in this construction: “at the @ScienceMuseum,” but the Queen made up for it with her characteristically abbreviated signature: “Elizabeth R.”
When you are the monarch, after all, you don’t need a last name — and you probably don’t need to compose your own tweet. You can just press “post.”
Still, it was enough to send a twitter of approval among 600 or so guests including such members of Britain’s IT glitterati as  Sir Nigel Shadbolt and Mo Ibrahim who gathered Friday morning to celebrate the opening of the new gallery in one of London’s most popular museums.

Pakistan in command despite Warners centuryPakistan in command despite Warner’s century
PTI
Tweet
Dubai, Oct 24:  
Pakistan’s spin bowlers shared six wickets between them to take control of the first Test against Australia despite a brilliant hundred by David Warner on the third day today.
Warner smashed 133 for his ninth Test century and his third in as many innings to match the indomitable Donald Bradman.
But Pakistan hit back to dismiss Australia for 303 in their first innings, for a first innings lead of 151, after they had made 454.
By the close, Pakistan had made 38—0 in their second innings with Ahmed Shehzad (22) and Azhar Ali (16) at the crease, stretching their lead to 189.
Debutant leg—spinner Yasir Shah (3—66) led the spin attack while left—armer Zulfiqar Babar (2—81) and Mohammad Hafeez (1—54) also chipped in as, apart from Warner, none of the other batsman made big scores.
Michael Clarke failed with a 13—ball two and so did Alex Doolan (five).
It was Warner who anchored the innings, becoming seventh Australian batsmen to score three consecutive hundreds, the feat last achieved by Adam Gilchrist (2005) and Bradman (1948).
But with his third ball after lunch, Shah spun sharply to bowl Warner, who had hit 11 fours and two sixes during his 174—ball knock, but his fall saw Australia slump against spinners.
Mitchell Marsh (27) and Brad Haddin (22) took Australia to 248—5 during their 42—run stand for the sixth wicket but Pakistan broke through with the new ball, taken as soon it was due after 80 overs.
Paceman Imran Khan (1—54) had Haddin bowled off an inside edge while Babar had Marsh lbw.
Warner saw Australia lose Chris Rogers (38), Doolan and Clarke in the space of just 30 runs before he and Steven Smith (22) added 48 for the fourth wicket.
Warner drove Khan to cover boundary for his eighth four to complete his hundred off just 128 balls.
The left—hander had hit a century in each innings against South Africa at Cape Town in Australia’s last Test in March this year.

Government rejects SSTL s FDI proposalGovernment rejects SSTL's FDI proposal
Press Trust of India | New Delhi Oct 24, 2014 06:34 PM IST
The Finance Ministry has rejected Sistema Shyam Teleservices' (SSTL) proposal to increase foreign stake to 100% due to conversion of redeemable preference shares into equity.
SSTL, controlled by Russian conglomerate Sistema JSFC, had applied in May to increase the total FDI in the company beyond 73.95%.
Increases in FDI up to 100% in M/s Sistema Shyam Tele Services Limited and its downstream WoS M/s Shyam Internet Services Limited, both engaged in telecom sector, on account of conversion of Redeemable Preference Shares into equity have been rejected, the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB), a multi-department panel headed by Finance Secretary, said in a statement.
The meeting of FIPB took place on September 16.
Sistema JSFC holds 56.68% in SSTL, Russian government 17.14% and 0.13% other foreign entities.
The government in July 2013 had allowed 100% FDI in telecom companies.
SSTL, which offers services under MTS brand name, has presence in 9 telecom circles.

CIL trade unions caution against de-nationalisation of minesCIL trade unions caution against de-nationalisation of mines
Press Trust of India | New Delhi Oct 24, 2014 06:30 PM IST
Cautioning against any attempt to de-nationalise coal mines, the five operating trade unions of Coal India Ltd (CIL) have said they will meet shortly to decide the future course of action.
"The senior leaders of 5 CTUs will meet shortly to decide future course of action to combat the menace of gradual de-nationalisation of coal mines besides various other policy related decisions of Government of India.
"(These have been) resorted arbitrarily without associating or ascertaining the views of one of the most important stake-holders i.E. The coal workers and the CTUs," S Q Zama, secretary-general, Indian National Mine Workers' Federation said in a letter to Coal and Power Minister Piyush Goyal.
The e-auction of coal blocks for private companies has been approved through an ordinance promulgated recently. This comes in the backdrop of Supreme Court order quashing 214 coal blocks to companies since 1993.
The letter further said that notwithstanding merit/de-merit of the ordinance, the coal workers and the 5 CTUs of Coal India Limited (CIL) are concerned with the enabling clause to allow commercial mining by private firms in future.
Although government says that CIL's interest will be fully maintained and protected, it is "absolutely untenable and unacceptable as it amounts to gradual and indirect de-nationalisation of coal mines," the letter said.
Coal India workers are represented by five unions including Indian National Trade Union Congress (INTUC), Hind Mazdoor Sabha (HMS) and All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC).
The Cabinet, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, had earlier recommended to the President promulgation of ordinance in order to resolve the pending issues particularly the situation arising out of the Supreme Court judgement quashing the allocation of the coal blocks.
Following this Ordinance, state sector requirements including those of the Central and state governments would be met through government dispensation route and coal mines would be allocated to PSUs like NTPC or state electricity boards.
Government will put sufficient coal blocks on e-auction for the private sector players who are into the cement, steel and power sectors.
Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had earlier said that that the e-auction process will be "transparent" and completed in "three to four months" with proceeds going entirely to the state governments where the mines are located.
The biggest beneficiaries would be the eastern states like Jharkhand, Odisha, West Bengal and Chhattisgarh. States like Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh would also benefit.

Burdwan blast probe: NSA-led high level delegation to visit WB on Monday125
0
New Delhi: A high-level delegation led by National Security Advisor Ajit Doval will be visiting West Bengal on Monday to take stock of the progress in the Burdwan blast case. The high-level delegation will include NIA, RAW and Intelligence Bureau (IB) officials.
On Friday, NIA Director General Sharad Kumar visited the blast site in Khagragarh, Burdwan. He said the NIA was "developing strategies to arrest those accused who are absconding". The officer refused to divulge any further information in the case.
Earlier this month, two suspected Indian Mujahideen terrorists were killed in a bomb blast in Burdwan. They were making bombs in a house owned by TMC sympathiser Nurul Hasan Chowdhury.
#nia #raw #nsa #ajit doval
Ever since it took charge of the Burdwan probe, the NIA has unearthed various others hideouts of the terror module and recovered sophisticated explosives from Burdwan and its adjoining districts of Murshidabad, Nadia and Birbhum.
Opposition parties have slammed the Mamata Banerjee government for fanning terror modules in the state and suggested a link to the Sarada chitfund scam.

Sonia  Rahul Gandhi should speak more  saysChidambaramPrint
Former Union minister P Chidambaram (Source: PTI)
By: Express News Service | New Delhi | Posted: October 24, 2014 8:18 pm | Updated: October 25, 2014 1:04 am
Former Finance Minister P Chidambaram on Friday said the Congress morale was “pretty low” at the moment and that both party president Sonia Gandhi and vice-president Rahul Gandhi needed to “speak more”. They should show the “urgency” to reorganise the party and lead the Congress to play the role of the “true opposition”, Chidambaram told NDTV news channel. He also agreed a non-Gandhi could lead the party “some day”.
On the land deal between Sonia’s son-in-law Robert Vadra and real estate firm DLF in Haryana, he said, “I don’t know the facts. Whether they (the Haryana government) were helping him or whether they were taking a routine decision, I don’t know the facts. So how can I comment on that.”
“Without knowing the facts, I don’t think it is fair to comment on any particular transaction. Unless I have the papers in front of me, unless I have the facts in front of me, I can’t comment on any transaction,” he said. Asked if he was distancing himself from the issue, he said, “If I am obliged to comment, if I am authorised to comment, I will, provided I have before me the fact and the papers.”
Asked whether the Vadra issue created a perception problem for the Congress, he said, “May be it did. I don’t know.” Asked whether the party handled it effectively, he said, “I don’t know. May be it did, but these are questions which must be answered by people who were there in the field in Haryana, people who were contesting elections. I don’t know.”
Chidambaram said he was concerned about the lack of visibility of Sonia and Rahul Gandhi. “I would urge the Congress president and the Congress vice-president to speak more. I would urge them to come and address more rallies, I would urge them to meet the media. I would urge them to do that,” he said.
He said Sonia continues to be “the most acceptable leader of his generation” and Rahul has wide acceptance among the younger members of the party. Asked whether a non-Gandhi could become the Congress president, he said, “I think so. Some day, yes.”
He agreed that the Congress morale was pretty low but said it can be lifted. “I agree that the Congress morale is pretty low. But I don’t agree that the morale cannot be lifted, that a direction cannot be given… It’s a matter of time, more accurately a matter of timing. I am sure that the Congress leadership has its own timetable. I would urge again that the timetable be shortened and get on with the job of reorganising the party and getting on with the job of being true opposition.” Asked whether he felt the Congress leadership need to respond with a little more urgency, he said, “I think so.”
“I have, not only I, others have urged that the reorganisation that was promised in continued…

I also applied for additional shares. But I don`t think we will get 90%. The issue oversubscribed by 1.14 times and not 0.14 times. So those who applied for 21400 additional shares may get only 10000 shares. Also they may give preference to big investors like RJ.

Kochi, October 24:  
SmartCity Kochi has received environmental clearance for the entire project covering 246 acres, even as the construction of the first IT building is fast nearing completion.
Gigo Joseph, CEO, said the environmental clearance was received in July last year for the 6.5 lakh sq ft first IT building (SCK01), and later the company applied for the rest of the project, which has now been cleared.
According to him, not less than 8.8 million sq ft built-up area will be developed, with substantial area left for greenery and open spaces, attracting companies from within India and abroad.
Joseph said the environmental clearance was given at the meeting of State Environment Impact Assessment Authority Kerala (SEIAA-K) followed by the State Expert Appraisal Committee’s (SEAC) recommendations.
He said SEAC appreciated SmartCity’s effort in presenting a clear-cut master plan of the project. Now, as the decks have been cleared for the entire project, the company will speed up the construction of infrastructure.
SmartCity has entered into agreements for joint development of infrastructure with leading IT, hospitality, realty and education companies to make the hub an integrated township.

Wipro Fails to Impress in Q2, Falls 5% in Muhurat Trade
NDTV | Updated On: October 23, 2014 19:43 (IST)
IVRCL Allots First Tranche of Shares to CDR Lenders
The 50-share Nifty ended at one-month high in Muhurat trading on Thursday, but shares in IT major Wipro fell as much as 5 per cent. Wipro, which had missed its earnings estimate in the September quarter, was also the top loser in the 50-share Nifty. ( Track stock )
In the September quarter, Wipro's IT services revenues grew just 1.8 per cent sequentially to $1.771 billion lagging its peers Infosys (3.1 per cent) and Tata Consultancy Services (4.6 per cent).
For most IT services companies, analysts and investors track the dollar sales numbers as clients overseas get billed in dollars. Revenue guidance for the third quarter is expected in the range of $1.81 billion to $1.84 billion, implying a sequential revenue growth of 2-4 per cent, Wipro said.
India's third largest outsourcer also missed estimates on the profit front, with Q2 profit rising 8 per cent to Rs 2,085 crore against Reuters estimate of Rs 2,109 crore.
Wipro said it continued to face "headwinds" in key accounts, particularly European clients.
Wipro and its larger peer Infosys have underperformed companies like TCS and HCL Tech in revenue growth over the last few quarters. Infosys managed to beat Street estimates in the September quarter and the announcement of a bonus issue has acted as a strong support for the stock. But Wipro seems to have failed to impress the Street with Q2 numbers.
"Infosys has now laid out their plans, so we know what the idea is. Wipro has talked about plans for some time, but it does not show on results," Ankita Somani, analyst with MSFL Research said.
Wipro closed 4 per cent lower at Rs 560.25 on the NSE. It underperformed the IT index on the BSE, which ended 0.14 per cent higher. ( Track stock )

The U.N. says water is a fundamental human right in DetroitBy Emily Badger October 23 Follow @emilymbadger
Detroit residents address members of the United Nations during a UN Fact-Finding Town Hall Meeting, Sunday, Oct. 19, 2014, at Wayne County Community College in Detroit. (AP Photo/Detroit News, Jose Juarez)
Representatives from the United Nations spent a few days in Detroit earlier this week looking into the spate of utility shutoffs that left thousands of poor households in the city this year without water to bathe and cook by.
The two special rapporteurs — one on "the human right to water and sanitation," the other on "adequate housing" — were invited to town not by the city, but by community groups that have been advocating for the poor. And their conclusion reinforces what concerned on-lookers have been saying since this summer: "When people are genuinely unable to pay the bill," the U.N. says, the state is obligated to step up with financial assistance and subsidies. "Not doing so amounts to a human rights violation."
The ensuing narrative is provocative, representing a kind of rock bottom for the Motor City (and the U.S. by implication): The U.N. just condemned an American city for violating the fundamental rights of its own residents — rights that families in much more impoverished countries should be able to expect, too. As a reminder, the rapporteurs add in their statement, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights "is fully applicable to the United States," too.
"We were deeply disturbed," their statement says, "to observe the indignity people have faced and continue to live with in one of the wealthiest countries in the world and in a city that was a symbol of America’s prosperity."
This is an important conversation for American cities to have, even outside Detroit: whether water should be a right, and if so, how we plan to ensure that. But the problem in Detroit is also much more complicated than the U.N.'s scolding relays.
What makes the situation there so terrible is not that city officials have decided some people don't deserve water, or that they have blithely disregarded anyone's rights; it's that the city has many problems, this one included, and each one complicates the task of resolving all the others.
The city must figure out how to restore water to people who can't pay, while distinguishing them from people who simply won't pay (because that's a problem the city has, too). It has to figure out how to cover the costs of subsidizing water for the poor without further raising rates for households of more modest incomes (because water bills in Detroit are already well above the national average). Detroit has to find the resources to serve one of the most impoverished populations in the country — all while that very poverty has helped sap the resources the city once had.
Perhaps it's the UN's job to preach that water is a human right. But the logistics of making that a reality are much, much more complicated than saying it should be so.

Why are so few women on the business side of tech companiesBy Brigid Schulte and Jena McGregor October 23 Follow @BrigidSchulte Follow @jenamcgregor
Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer of Facebook, speaks during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Thursday, Jan. 24, 2013. Photographer: Simon Dawson/Bloomberg
The conventional explanation for why there are so few women in high tech has hinged on a simple statistic: Only about 18 percent of computer science and engineering degrees go to women every year.
Yet tech companies have experts in finance, marketing, sales — not just programming. And women account for nearly 40 percent of all MBA graduates. Moreover, many financial services companies hire equal numbers of men and women at the entry level. So Catalyst , a nonprofit research organization focused on the advancement of women, wanted to figure out if women are faring better on the business side of the fast-growing tech world.
They aren’t.
Among MBA graduates, fewer women than men choose to go into tech-intensive fields, Catalyst found in a report  released Thursday. And when women with MBAs do opt in, they tend to start out in lower-paying, lower-level positions than their male counterparts do. They also are significantly more likely to leave — not the workforce, as many assume, but the tech industry itself.
Catalyst  analyzed  the career paths of nearly 10,000 MBA graduates from 2007 to 2014 in the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia. It found that 53 percent of the women left tech-intensive professions for other work, compared to 31 percent of the men.
“These industries have reputations for being exclusive — the 'brogrammer' culture in high tech, the Old Boys’ Club is really typical in oil and gas, automotive and manufacturing. And it turns out, these reputations are really well deserved,” says Anna Beninger, the report's author and Catalyst’s research director. "The tech industry has some significant culture issues, and it’s really damaging their ability to attract the best talent.”
Companies like Google , Facebook and Twitter  are not only male heavy on the tech side, but they have few women in business or in leadership. "Women coming out of business schools, looking to advance their careers, look at these industries and realize they’ll be the only woman in the room," Beninger says. "So they’re looking elsewhere.”
Or, put more bluntly, female MBA graduates see these testosterone-fueled tech cultures, Beninger says, and “they run screaming.” One female technology executive, who has worked for several major tech firms but requested anonymity to speak freely, recalled that in the late 1990s she would see lines in the ladies room at the companies where she worked. "Now they're empty. The women have gone somewhere."
In the report, “ High Potentials in Tech-Intensive Industries: The Gender Divide in Business Roles ,” Beninger found that women with MBAs felt like outsiders even on the business side of technology companies. In tech, compared with other industries, they were more likely to work on a team with 10 percent or fewer women. They had fewer female supervisors and role models. And they were less likely to say they had a clear sense of how they were being evaluated.
The research not only compared women's experiences across fields, it looked at the difference in outlooks between female and male MBA grads within the same technology sector. The women were more than twice as likely to say that having no role models was a significant barrier to their advancement (18 percent to men's 7 percent). Fewer aspired to the C-suite (84 percent to men’s 97 percent). And they were more likely to downsize their aspirations (37 percent to men's 25 percent).
This expands on what other recent surveys and studies have shown: Corporate cultures, not just education, are a big reason behind the low number of women in high tech. The Center for Talent Innovation , a research think tank, published a report in February which found that U.S. women are 45 percent more likely than their male peers to plan to leave such "lab-coat, hard-hat and geek workplace cultures" within one year.
It doesn't help that some people running tech firms don't think these female MBA graduates could ultimately lead them. CTI's study found that nearly a third of senior leaders — both men and women — in science, technology and engineering fields don't believe a woman would ever reach the top position in their companies.
"Women MBAs work incredibly hard in whatever industry you put them in," says Laura Sherbin, director of research for CTI. "This is not about shying away from hard work. This is more about bias, whether you see it to be conscious or unconscious, that we don't see women in this industry to be intrinsically as capable."
More recently, Kieran Snyder, the CEO of analytics startup Textio, published the results of a survey of women who had left the tech industry. Of the 716 women she queried, 625 said they had no plans to return to the field. Women told her about the discrimination they faced, about being the first person to ever use their company's maternity leave policy, and about how tired they were of being asked to represent the female perspective just because they were the only women around.
Those stories, Snyder says, didn't just come from programmers or industrial engineers, but from women in business jobs at tech companies who had few role models to emulate. "There's this sense of alienation from being the only woman in the room," she says.
But what of Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg? Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer? Meg Whitman, Carly Fiorina, Anne Mulcahy, Marillyn Hewson — all who have served as CEOs of high-power tech companies?
“They are definitely a great face, and it’s very encouraging to see them there,” Beninger says. “But as a statistician, when you look at the full sample, they are definitely outliers.”
In the course of her research, Beninger asked for advice from some successful women in the field. “One said she tells young women to use a black coffee mug, because it doesn’t show lipstick marks. I was floored, but she was dead serious,” Beninger says. “Another highly-placed chief technology officer said she tells young women not to bring notebooks to meetings, because everyone will assume they’re secretaries. That kept happening to her, even as she got more senior."
In the Catalyst report, Beninger noted that male-dominated tech companies can change the dismal gender equation by having top leaders sponsor promising women, by making performance criteria transparent, and by promoting flexible work environments for both men and women. The report found that although 75 percent of the male and female MBA grads they studied had technical backgrounds, only 36 percent chose to return to tech-intensive fields. “The pipeline is leaking both men and women,” Benninger says. “Men want flexibility, too.”
Snyder, who has worked at Amazon and Microsoft in the past, advises women not to assume their requests for more flexibility will be deemed unreasonable. "I’m a single mom, and one thing I got really good at doing was drawing boundaries around my time," she says. She acknowledges, however, that she felt more comfortable doing so because of her seniority. When flexibility is "not a thing that most people you're working with care about," Synder says, "it's easy to not ask the question."
For some women, striking out on their own seems like the better option. Until she had her first child, Desiree Lehrbaum worked in Silicon Valley in what industry observers have dubbed the "pink ghetto" of high-tech firms — that is, their marketing and human resources departments. She left her marketing job to start a consulting firm, Lumen Consulting, doing largely the same work but gaining a measure of control over her schedule by choosing her own projects and setting her own hours.
Advancing in the tech culture, she says, still has a lot to do with subtle factors like being an insider, knowing someone or finding the right boss. “[Leaders] may like a woman and give her tons of work, but will she advance in the same way? It depends,” Lehrbaum says. “And if women find themselves not advancing, figure they’re going to be on the treadmill forever, a lot are going to opt out and find something else. It’s a shame. These companies are vastly underutilizing this amazing pool of talent because they’re caught in such an old paradigm.”
Lehrbaum recalls attending panel discussions with the handful of women who had made it to the top in high tech. Each one had a spouse who either stayed at home or who had a flexible or part-time schedule. “Not one was dual-career, dual-income,” she says. “You got the message that that was the sort of price someone in the family would have to pay to make it.”

The Rise of Xtremepreneurs: Today s World-Changersreddit
"Personal drive without ego, dedication beyond failures and conviction above circumstances. This describes the spirit of an Xtremepreneur." -- Val Jon Farris
What is an "Xtremepreneur?" Allow me to answer in an extreme way. I was recently invited to a cave dive in the Yucatan Peninsula with Guillermo de Anda , one of National Geographic's Global Explorers . We rappelled 100 feet underground to the surface of a "sacrificial cenote," or subterranean lake. ("Sacrificial" because human sacrifices actually took place there.) Equipped with underwater torches and a video camera we descended into the darkness of what the Maya call "Xibalba, the Underworld Goddess of Death."
After traversing ancient limestone catacombs we emerged into a grand underwater cavern, when suddenly my buoyancy compensator filled with water and I sank uncontrollably. By the time the dive team noticed, I had plummeted 120 feet to the cavern floor! I literally had to pry my mask from my face to equalize it, and as I did my nose and throat flooded with water.
Guillermo appeared in front of me with his hand raised cautioning me to not panic. On my knees in the darkness among scattered animal and human remains, and unable to breathe, I was about to find out who I was with respect to my opening quote of, "conviction above circumstances."
Before I tell you what happened next I want to discuss Xtremepreneurs and World-Changers for a moment. Xtremepreneurs are a hybrid between extreme sports enthusiasts and philanthropic entrepreneurs. And while the sports they engage in, (kiteboarding, base jumping, heli-skiing, cave diving, etc.) possess varying degrees of risk, those who participate in them share a common philosophy of using extreme challenges to access extraordinary capabilities.
How this extreme breed of entrepreneurs evolves into World-Changers is by shifting their attention off themselves and onto being a contribution to others. World-Changers exist at all levels of entrepreneurial success, from the likes of Richard Branson , Elon Musk and Guy Laliberte , all the way to professions like you and me who know we make a difference in the world and are striving to expand that difference. We do this by pressing ourselves beyond our limits, learning from our failures and moving forward with conviction, which brings us back to the challenge I faced on the underwater cavern floor...
On my knees, staring at Guillermo's raised hand, two waves of energy roared through me. First was sheer terror and second was some urgent advice from deep within my core, "Val Jon, you can't make the surface, you need to work with what you've got. If you don't, you will die right here, right now."
What happened next was a testament to the power of the Human Spirit and Greater Self which I believe dwells within all of us. Rather than panicking or trying to force a solution, I literally surrendered my Will over to the Greater Self Within Me to know what to do. And what was that? To simply wait until I could swallow the water blocking my airways and take tiny breaths until I could regain my composure. I did just that and by doing so it saved my life.
You might conclude it was remaining calm that saved me, but I say this to you. The moment "I" got out of the way, the Greater Self Within Me knew exactly what to do. It is this same Greater Self within us that always knows what to do, not only in life and death situations, but in business dealings and with respect to realizing our greatest dreams and aspirations.
Neither equipment failure nor personal threat was going to stop me from succeeding with our cenote dive. We surfaced, repaired my gear, added an additional proximity safety protocol and submerged again. Our willingness to reengage as a team, learn from our mistakes and persevere beyond fear yielded both an extraordinary experience and some extreme underwater footage. (To experience our actual dive, click here for the YouTube clips .)
I have a profound admiration for those who persevere and use life's challenges to better themselves and at the same time support others in doing the same. And obviously I have a special appreciation for the extreme crowd. To me, Xtremepreneurs like pro-kiteboarders Susi Mai and Bill Tai , founders of Mai Tai Global are an example of real World-Changers. And while I run the risk of appearing promotional, I want to mention a remarkable mentoring project Richard Branson and Kym McNicholas are spearheading in partnership with MaiTai Global called the Extreme Tech Challenge, XTC . I pay tribute to them here because it's my way of giving back to the spirit of mentorship that was so instrumental to my own entrepreneurial success many years ago.
These kinds of extreme mentoring projects develop something extraordinary within us, something greater than thrill seeking or even fame and fortune. There is a need today for bringing greater purpose and contribution into the world of commerce. And while it may sound Pollyanna to some, what I see happening is an "evolution of self" in which our egos are learning how to step aside so our Greater Selves can step forward into our lives and into our world. This spirited movement is The Rise of Xtremepreneurs, Today's World-Changers.
To learn more about a wide range of mentoring programs, log onto SuperSummit . You'll find a host of world-class talent gathering there. I also personally invite you to learn about our growing Global Xtreme Team at www.whowithinyou.com . And finally, true to my extreme spirit I encourage any and all Xtreme expedition invites!

California s Fracking Controversyreddit
Will a "Yes" or "No" vote on Measure P (the measure that bans all forms of enhanced drilling techniques, including steam injection and fracking) have an impact on Santa Barbara County's property values? This may be one of the biggest concerns for this California County's voters in November.
With nearly 7,000 new wells proposed locally, there is concern for the loss of property values - on top of environmental concerns related to fracking and other high intensity petroleum operations.
A Calgary and Duke University study of property values near shale gas wells notes a ten percent drop in values, but with fracking operations in place, values dropped some 22 percent. "Whether or not fracking causes groundwater pollution, people fear the risk enough that property values have dropped for homes with drinking-water wells near shale-gas pads, according to new research," writes Forbes in an article entitled Pollution Fears Crush Home Prices Near Fracking Wells.
"Real estate brokers say they see more signs of prospective home buyers worrying about the health and environmental effects of living close to a well," Reuters_News@reuters.com writes. "'For the most part, it renders those houses unsellable,' said Phyllis Wolper, a Denton, Texas, realtor who has several clients who live near oil and gas wells and have been unable to sell their homes."
These well sites impact individuals and developments. "When Gary Gless bought his sleek, modernist house in Los Angeles in 2002, he thought he had hit a "gold mine," reuters.com notes. "The world's largest inner-city park - featuring a lush, 18-hole golf course - was about to get built across the street. Gless's balcony was set to overlook the clubhouse and first tee....Today, instead of golf carts and fairways, Gless looks out on to drilling wells and oil pads. The park plan was ditched, and Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas LLC now operates 700 wells there - and 400 more are on the way. All the drilling, Gless says, has caused house foundations to crack and swimming pools to start to slide down hills."
And fracking operations are non-stop, thanks to the "Halliburton Loophole", a 2005 amendment to the Clean Air and Water Acts that VP Dick Cheney, former Halliburton CEO, pushed through Congress exempting fracking operations from almost all Environmental Protection Agency regulations.
"Coupled with existing exemptions to a variety of pollution laws like the Clean Air Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Superfund Act, and the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act, the 2005 carve-outs gave the fracking industry seven total exemptions from important environmental regulations," reported a recent truthout.org article.
California already has a thriving fracking industry. The majority of the state's new and active wells are concentrated in Kern and Los Angeles counties, said a National Resource Defense Council report entitled Drilling in California: Who's at Risk? However, expanded fracking in the large Monterey Formation is projected to bring the oil and gas industry into more communities, especially in Ventura, Monterey, Fresno, and Santa Barbara counties . According to http://ecowatch.com in Fracking the American Dream,
"In Pavilion, WY, where the EPA has linked groundwater contamination with fracking, Louis Meeks saw the value of his 40-acre alfalfa farm all but disappear completely. In 2006, his land and home were appraised at $239,000. Two years later, as ProPublica reported, "a local realtor sent Meeks a coldly worded letter saying his place was essentially worthless and she could not list his property."
"Last July, Nationwide Insurance spelled out specifically that it would not provide coverage for damage related to fracking. According to an internal memo outlining the company's policy, 'After months of research and discussion, we have determined that the exposures presented by hydraulic fracturing are too great to ignore. Risks involved with hydraulic fracturing are now prohibited for General Liability, Commercial Auto, Motor Truck Cargo, Auto Physical Damage and Public Auto (insurance) coverage," notes ecowatch.com.'
One little noticed side effect of this property value impact is that the secondary mortgage market hasn't caught up with the risk of loaning on properties affected by fracking and extreme oil production methods. As they do, these properties could be harder to finance. Housing Wire has reported on a webinar entitled, Oil and Gas Exploration for Mortgage Bankers, in which Daniel McKenna, with the Ballard Spahr's Mortgage Banking Group said, "The loans are actually low risk. But Fannie, Freddie, the FHA, and the VA prohibit gas leases on their loans. There are a ton of different regulations that impact selling these loans on the secondary market."
Even Exxon CEO and Board Chairman Rex Tillerson, is suing to stop construction of a water tower that would supply nearby drilling operations because of the nuisance of, among other things, heavy truck traffic, noise and traffic hazards from the fracking operations the tower would support.
So the CEO of the single largest drilling company in the world acknowledges the "constant and unbearable nuisance" that would come from having "lights on at all hours of the night...traffic at unreasonable hours... noise from mechanical and electrical equipment." And Tillerson's lawsuit - filed in 2013 with other plaintiffs, including former House Majority Leader Dick Armey - claims the project would do "irreparable harm" to his property values, in papers filed for the Denton County, Texas lawsuit.
Then, there's the real danger of earthquakes from injecting waste water back into the ground, which have been occurring with increasing frequency in some Oklahoma fracking fields, as reported on NPR Radio in a July 2014 broadcast by Linda Wertheimer.
Denver, Colorado had the same problems with so-called natural gas injection wells back in the 1960s, and played a critical role in discovering the link between forced injection wells and induced earthquakes.
There are currently more than 1.1 million active oil and gas wells in the United States, and more than 15 million Americans now live within a mile of the hundreds of thousands that have been drilled since 2000, according to the Wall Street Journal. Made possible by the advent of fracking, drilling is taking place in shale formations from California to New York and from Wyoming to Texas. And there's no indication that this "unprecedented industrialization" shows any signs of slowing. Almost 47,000 new oil and natural gas wells were drilled in 2012, and industry analysts project that pace will only continue.

The Case for a Sustainability Plan in Business: Short-Term Savings and Long-Term Opportunitiesreddit
We live in a world plagued by extreme weather events. Yet, as a general rule (and there are some outstanding exceptions), the world of business still hasn't woken up to the threat of climate change. All too often the sustainability team or programme is a side-lined function and very much seen as a 'nice to do.'
I can see why it happens. There is a perception (an incorrect one!) that going green costs more and therefore balance sheet pressures dictate going with the status quo of doing business.
Our view couldn't be more different. We believe that sustainability is both a moral and commercial imperative.
There is a business case for going green, and after seven years of following our own sustainability programme, we have a good case study to share.
In the short-term, it is about insulating your business from cost pressures; in the longer-term, a more sophisticated business case has emerged, predicated on opportunity, innovation and new revenue streams.
Seven years ago we set aside a massive £200 million for a five year initiative called Plan A, an eco and ethical programme that pledged to transform M&S by changing the way it did business. The environment and the right way to do business would be built into every decision made at the company and we set 100 bold targets to be achieved by 2012 including becoming carbon neutral, sending no waste to landfill and ensure that key raw materials come from the most sustainable sources available.
In only its second year, it became clear that Plan A was delivering significant cost benefits. To add to that it was opening up new revenue streams that were taking off. In year three it returned a net benefit to the business, or profit if you like, and has delivered one every year since. Last year the net benefit was £145 million and over the seven years in total, the benefit is £435 million.
That's £435 million that M&S would either have had to find from elsewhere or simply would not have had in the first place. The savings we're making include being more energy efficient, using less fuel, recycling and reusing clothes hangers, reducing waste, using less packaging etc etc.
But it's not just financial savings; we are seeing many other benefits such as increased staff motivation, brand enhancement and supply chain resiliency to name a few.
We're not the only company with a great business case story to tell. Companies like Walmart, O2, Unilever and Nike also understand the green imperative commercially and have embarked on their own eco-ethical journeys.
And, if you're reading this and thinking, that's all well and good for M&S, but what about small and medium sized companies? It's not the preserve of big businesses like us.
Our suppliers -- many of them small businesses -- are also getting involved in Plan A and making their businesses more efficient and more profitable. Take West Mill, a hosiery factory in Belper, Derbyshire, which was on the brink of closure a few years ago. Now it has turned its fortunes around by controlling its energy use, slashing £2 million from its annual bills. It was awarded eco-factory status by M&S meaning that every product produced at the factory can be labelled as having a Plan A attribute -- boosting the marketing power of the factory's products.
Going forward, as a consequence of interconnected opportunities and risks, business models will be disrupted by sustainability for the first time. We can't monetise the long-term business benefit but our use of the word 'disruption' highlights just how crucial we believe the business case for sustainability will become in the future. At M&S we're very clear the purpose of our business is to enhance lives everyday. And by doing this we will prosper.
That's why we've developed the next stage of our plan -- Plan A 2020, which aims to help accelerate our sustainability efforts. It's organised around four pillars -- Inspiration, In Touch, Integrity and Innovation, and supports our aspiration to become the world's most sustainable major retailer.
I call on every other business to not wait for the future to happen, but to proactively create it -- developing their own sustainable business plan, setting out, amongst other priorities, how they will promote wellbeing, sustain nature, take account of environmental and social impacts and be transparent.
Each plan needs to be adapted to their specific industry challenge and opportunities. It needs to inspire and mobilise everyone in the organisation. There are clearly huge challenges and headwinds ahead, but a sustainable business plan is the first step to realising opportunities and shifting to a new way of doing business, fit for the future.

Water Tower Place CNBC (tv network)
Craving a Crumbs cupcake? They're back.
Crumbs Bake Shop reopened its location in Water Tower Place on Thursday, ending a three-month absence of the colossal cupcakes in Chicago.
In July, Crumbs was delisted from the Nasdaq and soon after closed its remaining locations. Marcus Lemonis and Fischer Enterprises stepped in to buy the chain and said they would reinvent Crumbs as more of a sweets and snacks shop, rather than just focusing on cupcakes as the chain had since it opened in 2003.
0
Along with its well-known cupcakes, the chain is now selling items such as the Crumbnut, a cross between a doughnut and a croissant, and a Baissant, which it said is a combination of a bagel and a croissant.
The new owners previously said they planned to reopen about two dozen stores of the 50 or so that abruptly closed July 7.
The Water Tower Place location, at 835 N. Michigan Ave., reopened Thursday.
Lemonis, known for his CNBC show "The Profit," is expected to be at a grand reopening event at 6 p.m.
Along with the Chicago store, two stores have reopened in New York, along with one store each in California, Delaware and Washington, D.C., according to the chain's website.
The company said this week that it plans to open a store at 469 Central Ave. in Highland Park in the next 30 days. It also plans mass market products such as a new cookie line, ice cream products and a chocolate bar.

Labor Secretary:  We Suckreddit
Labor Secretary Tom Perez said Thursday the United States' current federal minimum wage is an international embarrassment, specifically calling out New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) for fighting attempts to raise the wage floor.
Speaking at a breakfast hosted by Bloomberg News , Perez noted the U.S.'s dismal standing among the 34 countries who belong to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development . The current federal minimum wage of $7.25, when compared to the median wage of full-time workers, ranks among the lowest of all member countries.
“I mean, we suck,” Perez said . “We really do.”
Last year, President Barack Obama threw his support behind a Democratic proposal to raise the federal wage floor to $10.10 an hour . In January, Obama announced he would raise the minimum wage for federal contractors to $10.10, pushing Congress to do the same on a national level.
“A majority of Americans – not just Democrats, not just independents, but Republicans too – support raising the minimum wage,” Obama said after signing the executive order. “It’s the right thing to do. So that’s something Congress should keep in mind this year.”
Republicans, however, have pushed back on the proposal. In April, Senate Republicans blocked a bill that would have gradually increased the wage, citing concerns over the impact on businesses and job growth. Democrats have used the GOP opposition as midterm campaign fodder, and hope that ballot measures in states like Arkansas and South Dakota will help boost turnout in November.
During the Bloomberg event, Perez called out Christie, who earlier this week said he is " tired of hearing about the minimum wage ."
“Chris Christie’s got his head in the sand if he’s getting tired about the minimum wage,” Perez said. “Chris Christie needs to talk to his economists, who will tell him that 70 percent of GDP growth is consumption.”
Perez, who is reportedly under consideration to replace outgoing Attorney General Eric Holder, spoke earlier this week on the country's " dismal " record on paid parental leave, saying that policies like paid leave and a higher minimum wage are the path to "shared prosperity."
"This is a family issue and an American issue," Perez said . "We need to lead on leave. We can't simply leave talent on the bench."

FORT COLLINS, Colo. (AP) — Some people are urging the Colorado burrito chain Illegal Pete's to change its name because of the way the word "illegal" has been used to describe immigrants.
The Coloradan (http://noconow.co/1wpoTne ) reports that about 30 people gathered in Fort Collins Wednesday to ask owner Pete Turner to change the name of the chain, which is about to open an outlet there.
It's part of a bigger campaign nationally against what critics refer to as the "I-word." They think using the word to describe a person is dehumanizing.
Turner said the name is a reference to novel he read in college and the "Pete" part refers to his name and his father's. He told the crowd that he is committed to an "inclusive" business and has helped pay for some employees to become citizens.
"This is all very near and dear to me," he said.
But those at the meeting likened the name to a racial slur used against African-Americans or hanging a Confederate flag in the restaurant's window.
"Social context is hugely important," Fort Collins immigration attorney and meeting moderator Kim Medina said. "We'll never get to big issues, such as immigration reform, until we can solve these smaller issues of language."

This picture tells you everything you need to know about global inequalityBy Matt O'Brien October 23 Follow @ObsoleteDogma
This handout picture released on Oct. 22, 2014, by local humanitarian group Prodein shows golfers playing while African migrants try to climb the fence into the Spanish North African enclave of Melilla (Jose Palazon Osma/AFP Photo/Prodein)
It's hard to believe looking at this amazing picture of African migrants trying to enter the Spanish enclave of Melilla, but global inequality has actually been falling the past 20 years.
It's a story about Brazil and India and, most of all, China joining the global supply chain and enjoying the wealth that comes with it. Indeed, it's this "emerging global middle class," as economist Branko Milanovic calls them, who have done better than anyone, relatively-speaking. Their incomes increased almost 80 percent, adjusted for inflation, between 1988 and 2008. As point of comparison, lower and middle class workers in already-rich countries, like the United States, have fared the worst over this period, with basically flat real wages.
This is great news for the billions of people who live in these countries, but what about the ones who live in places that are still disconnected from any real opportunities?
Well, their best bet is immigration, legal or otherwise. Not to belabor the obvious here, but where you live determines how much you can make. The same person with the same education and the same skills can make seven times more working in the United States than in Haiti, according to economists Michael Clemens, Claudio Montenegro, and Lant Pritchett . Or, to give another example, you can make more than 10 times as much for doing the same job in an American McDonald's as you can in an Indian one . That's why looser immigration laws are actually one of the best things we could do to fight global poverty.
But more than any facts or figures, all you really need to know is in this picture. You can see the chasm that, despite its shrinking size, still exists between the global haves and have-nots, as these migrant workers try to scale the fence into Spain's North African territory — and on to a very well-watered fairway, especially for that climate. The stakes are everything for them: potential European Union asylum and a chance to earn a better living.
But don't let that interrupt your game of golf.

Arabian Sea storm starts reorganising  eyes Gujarat for landfallArabian Sea storm may develop into a cyclone, target Gujarat
Vinson Kurian
Tweet
Thiruvananthapuram, Oct 24:  
After the Arabian Sea storm started rebuilding ending a brief pause, weather models have started re-plotting charts for the likely track for a developing tropical cyclone.
At least five leading models, including early projections by India Met Department, indicate that the cyclone might veer towards northwest Gujarat and adjoining Sindh coast in Pakistan for a landfall.
The Canadian Meteorological Centre subscribes to this view saying that the system would take a turn to the east over northeast Arabian Sea, but without suggesting an exact area of landfall.
The 21-member ensemble from the Global Forecast Model is more forthcoming, suggesting northwest Gujarat to be the area of landfall.
The UK Met model is the most forthright among all, with projected growth of the system as a very severe cyclone (wind speeds ranging between 177- 209 km/hr) and heading for northwest Gujarat.
The shift in cyclone track will take place under the influence of a western disturbance moving across the Arabian Gulf and towards Afghanistan, Pakistan and northwest India.
Westerly notified
India Met has said in its evening bulletin on Friday that a western disturbance would start affecting the western Himalayan region from October 28. Being computer-simulated models, these projections can change over time. This makes it imperative that the evolving weather system is tracked on a real-time basis, say experts.
Available indications indicate that it can grow to considerable strength. The month of October is known for vulnerability of the peninsular seas to these types of ‘disturbances’ from change in meteorological conditions associated with the monsoon transition.
Heavy rains
Meanwhile on Friday, heavy rains continued to lash parts of Kerala and Tamil Nadu, which are the two States with excess rainfall thus far during this northeast monsoon season.
Tamil Nadu falls in the rainfall excess category (+32 per cent) while Kerala followed (+18 per cent, ‘normal’ category).
Coastal and south interior Karnataka will start receiving meaningful showers as easterly flows from the Bay of Bengal head across the peninsula to feed the building cyclone in the Arabian Sea.

Morning Plum: Democrats strike careful balance on EbolaA new case of Ebola has emerged in New York City. Jonathan Cohn brings us up to speed, noting that the government response underway is dramatically different than what happened in Texas . This is the key takeaway:
What was true yesterday is true today. Experts expect isolated cases of Ebola to show up here and there, but they don’t expect outbreaks, because the U.S. has the resources and infrastructure to contain the spread and treat those who get it.
Democratic strategists had actually been privately relieved that Ebola appeared to be receding from the news. They think the GOP strategy of laying Ebola on top of ISIS and the border, to stoke generalized fear and anxiety, has been successfully nationalizing Senate races in favor of GOP candidates, helping explain recent gains in polls.
If anything, polls have actually shown public confidence in the government’s ability to handle Ebola, though to read the media coverage, you’d think the only thing polls are indicating is generalized fear of the disease. In truth, it’s hard to quantify Ebola’s political impact. It could be just adding unseen weight to a broader sense that the country is veering off track — which probably helps Republicans (who are doing all they can to feed that impression). But it’s also possible that — even with the new case — it could be receding as an issue at just the right time.
Nonetheless, Democrats have hastily embraced a travel ban, despite the counsel of experts. And they are criticizing the Obama administration for being too slow to deal with initial cases. Alex Roarty caught up with Senator Kay Hagan, whose opponent Thom Tillis has been pushing a travel ban, and she said this :
“It seems to take a period of time before it’s recognized that it’s a very important issue that needs more time and attention,” Hagan says during a brief interview when I ask how she feels about the president’s apparent slow-footed response to the VA scandal and Ebola. It’s more a carefully worded slap-on-the wrist than searing indictment, but this close to Election Day, with a liberal base to motivate, it counts as real criticism.
Note the balance Hagan (who also came out for a travel ban) is striking. As I’ve reported before , Democrats are using Ebola to achieve distance from the President, who continues to be deeply disliked by constituencies who still are populated by voters who remain undecided, and could be tipped towards Republicans by a feather-push from something like Ebola remaining in the news. At the same time, this sort of criticism is unlikely to alienate the core Democratic voters whose turnout will be crucial, and who might feel less motivated if candidates break with Obama on core Democratic issues. Either way, the politics of Ebola may now be back.
Of course, not all Democrats are embracing a travel ban. But that brings us to our next item.
* IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, A CLASH OVER EBOLA: Senator Jeanne Shaheen and Scott Brown held their final debate last night, and the clash over Ebola was remarkable . Shaheen said we shouldn’t institute a travel ban if experts say it’s a bad idea: “My opponent and I aren’t infectious disease experts. I think we need to listen to the experts. We should not be fear-mongering on this issue.”
But Scott Brown reiterated his call for a ban: “We don’t need to be experts to deal with this issue. It’s common sense. She calls it fear mongering. I call it rational fear.” We don’t need no stinkin’ experts…
* SCOTT BROWN CALLED OUT ON EBOLA: Democrats are circulating video of another interesting moment : Moderator Wolf Blitzer repeatedly pressed Brown on his claim that we wouldn’t be worrying about Ebola right now if Mitt Romney were president. Brown kept complaining he was being taken out of context. When Blitzer read his actual words back to him, Brown replied: “Thank you for repeating it for the fourth time.”
* MICHELLE NUNN HAS A SHOT IN GEORGIA: A new CNN poll finds Michelle Nunn leading David Perdue in Georgia by 47-44, within the margin of error. And:
In a hypothetical runoff, Nunn still holds a small margin over Perdue, 51% to 47%. But the poll’s likely voter model can only estimate the November electorate, as a runoff election can draw a smaller and different crowd than the general election.
The average still has Perdue up 1.7 points, but that margin is shrinking fast, and Nunn has led in the last five polls. The runoff is a big unknown, because it’s hard to anticipate what the electorate will look like. But it appears Nunn may have a real shot.
 * CORY GARDNER LEADS IN COLORADO: A new Quinnipiac poll finds Cory Gardner leading Senator Mark Udall among likely voters in Colorado, 46-41. Ominously for Udall, who is betting it all on his ground game, Gardner is leading among early voters, 49-37.
The polling average has Gardner up by 2.1 points. Udall has trailed in at least nine of the last nonpartisan public polls.
* ARE POLLS GETTING COLORADO ELECTORATE RIGHT? Mark Murray reports on a new Democratic-leaning poll that surveys Colorado voters who cast ballots in 2012, but did not vote in 2010:
This poll, conducted by the Democratic-leaning group Project New America, finds that 82 percent of these so-called “drop-off” voters have received a ballot in the mail. And a combined 83 percent say they’ve already voted (22 percent of them) or are planning to vote (another 61 percent).
If Democrats are going to overcome their deficit in the polls, they will have to bring in non-2010 voters who are not showing up in polls’ “likely voter” samples. Dems hope the new all-mail balloting will help them do that. But Udall is plainly trailing by a non-insignificant margin at this point.
* SENATE STILL UP FOR GRABS: Politico details the ways that Obama remains a drag on many Senate Democrats , but adds this key context:
Even as the map looks ripe for a GOP Senate takeover, at least 11 battleground states remain within or right at the margin of error, according to an average of public polling. That means if Democrats succeed in driving up turnout as they’ve vowed to do all year — particularly in states like Colorado, Iowa and North Carolina — they could tilt the electorate by one or two points in their direction and win enough races to hold the Senate.
Republicans are favored to take the Senate, but much uncertainty remains . If the polls are a bit off in a few races, the map gets easier for Dems. Of course, the polls could be off in a way that favors Republicans, leading to far more GOP gains than we expect.
* REPUBLICANS ATTACK DEMOCRATS FROM LEFT: Lori Montgomery has a good rundown of one of this cycle’s key subplots: Republicans are widely attacking Democrats from the left on entitlements, casting themselves as the real defenders of social insurance from the elderly .
As I’ve noted before , this shows that the politics of the safety net are perilous for Republicans even in red states, and gets at the GOP’s long term problem of over-dependence on older voters.
* ‘PLUTOCRATS AGAINST DEMOCRACY’: Paul Krugman’s column indicts the American right’s preoccupation with “voter fraud,” rooting it in a desire to prevent the “unwashed” from voting and protect the rich from redistributive policy :
Now you understand why there’s so much furor on the right over the alleged but actually almost nonexistent problem of voter fraud, and so much support for voter ID laws that make it hard for the poor and even the working class to cast ballots. American politicians don’t dare say outright that only the wealthy should have political rights — at least not yet. But if you follow the currents of thought now prevalent on the political right to their logical conclusion, that’s where you end up. The truth is that a lot of what’s going on in American politics is, at root, a fight between democracy and plutocracy. And it’s by no means clear which side will win.
What else?

Abbas incites  State Department acts as character witnessThe  Times of Israel reports :
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, right, chairs the first meeting of the new Palestinian unity government with Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah in Ramallah in June. (Majdi Mohammed/Agence France-Presse via Getty Images)
The day after an East Jerusalem man with ties to Hamas drove his car onto a light rail platform, killing a three-month-old baby and wounding eight, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu lashed out at the international community for failing to criticize Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas.
The Palestinian leader “both glorifies the murderers and also embraces the organization to which the terrorists belong, Hamas,” Netanyahu said during a briefing with security officials in Jerusalem’s national police headquarters. “And faced with these actions of the Authority chairman, we find only a flaccid [response] internationally. [World leaders] are unwilling to say two words, even one word of criticism of him [Abbas]. We do not share this weakness. We will stand firmly for our rights and obligations to defend our capital.”
Well, certainly he is exaggerating, right? Afraid not. Here is the mind-boggling exchange at the State Department daily briefing Thursday :
QUESTION: I’m not making any relation, but there’s been some concern over the last week or two about comments by President Abbas that believe to have incurred incitement. And are you concerned about that? You haven’t really spoken out about that. Do you in any way feel that this is inciting Palestinians to take actions into their own hands?
MS. [JEN] PSAKI: Well, I think, Elise, one, I mean, we obviously believe that the act last night warrants condemnation evidence by the statement we released last night. I’m not going to characterize the comments made or not made by President — Prime Minister Netanyahu or the response from President Abbas.
QUESTION: Well, if you haven’t really received a condemnation from President Abbas, then don’t you think you should offer one?
MS. PSAKI: I think our view of it is clear by — evidenced by our statement last night. I would point you to him on any comments that they would like to make.
QUESTION: But what about his comments, like, over the past — I mean, there has just been several comments that people have remarked about that seem to be incurring incitement. Is that not concerning?
MS. PSAKI: I don’t think that’s — as you know, President Abbas has renounced violence and consistently sought a diplomatic and peaceful solution that allows for two states. I don’t have any other analysis for you to offer.
Why is this administration — which greets any building permit in Jerusalem as a personal insult — so averse to condemning incitement to terrorism? One can chalk it up to the “bigotry of low expectations,” in this context, the assumption that the Palestinian Authority can’t behave in accordance with its obligations. It might, alternatively, reflect the president’s view that Israel is responsible for the failure of the “peace process”; incitement to terrorism therefore messes up the narrative.
Whatever the reason, it is logical to assume that Abbas continues to do this in part because there are never any consequences for objectionable behavior. Recall that Abbas spoke at the United Nations recently, wherein he accused Israel of genocide. Former deputy national security adviser Elliott Abrams summarized : “Abbas said not one word of criticism of Hamas, nor did he acknowledge what is obvious: that Hamas started this war by its ceaseless bombardment of Israel with mortars and rockets. Presumably he decided that Palestinian domestic politics required him to avoid that truth and blame Israel for the conflict. . . . The accusation of genocide is particularly vile when thrown at Israel. The word has a meaning, and it is obviously absurd to claim that Israel’s actions in the Gaza war last summer were aimed at killing every Palestinian or a very large number of them or at eliminating the Palestinian people.”
Now, it is one thing to acknowledge that the PA is preferable to Hamas in Gaza. But there is no justification for praising Abbas because he purportedly “renounced violence and consistently sought a diplomatic and peaceful solution that allows for two states.” That is false, as is the assertion that he is a partner for peace. Abbas has walked away from the table and threatens again to go to the UN for a declaration of statehood and continues to praise and reward terrorism. Accusing the Jewish state of genocide does not suggest he is dedicated to the “peace process.”
When John Kerry declares that “my hope is that it will be possible to get back to a negotiating table because that is the only way to resolve the issues” between Israel and the Palestinians, he embarrasses himself and reflects the double standard that the Obama administration maintains whenever Israel is involved. The way to resolve the conflict is for the Palestinians to recognize the Jewish state, give up the dream of eradicating it and stop inciting those who murder Jews.

China to open more sectors to investment for...China to open up more sectors to private investment to spur growth
By Reuters | 24 Oct, 2014, 07.53PM IST
Premier Li Keqiang chaired a meeting of the council, China's cabinet, which decided that China would "open the door" to more areas for social investment.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
BEIJING: China's State Council will expand the scope of private investment in key sectors, including telecoms and transport, it said on Friday, as part of measures to support the slowing economy.
China's economy, the world's second largest, grew at its slowest pace since the global financial crisis in the September quarter and risks missing its official target for the first time in 15 years, stoking worries about global growth as well as the risk of social discontent.
Premier Li Keqiang chaired a meeting of the council, China's cabinet, which decided that China would "open the door" to more areas for social investment, particularly private capital, a statement on the government's website said.
China will "support essential telecommunications enterprises in attracting private strategic investors", the statement added.
It said it would also seek to spur investment in rail, port, river transport, airport, and water projects, and guide private capital investment in broadband Internet construction and national civil space infrastructure.
China's economy is expected to expand 7.4 percent this year, narrowly missing the government's 7.5 percent annual target, as Beijing tries to derive more future growth from consumer demand rather than exports.
China will open up more state-dominated sectors to private investors to help boost the economy, the State Council said.
Smashing unreasonable monopolies and market barriers, and building a fair investment environment "will be beneficial to stimulating vital market forces and latent development potential", it said. The statement did not mention foreign investment.

Outside groups and political parties are driving judicial campaigningScreenshot from an ad in the Tennessee Supreme Court campaign this year.
Even judicial races aren’t immune from the influence of outside spending.
Nearly 63 percent of the TV ads bought in state supreme court campaigns this year were paid for by political parties and outside groups, worrying advocates for integrity in the judicial branch who fear all that spending could lead to distorted rulings. The TV ad data comes from an analysis of Kantar Media/CMAG data by Justice at Stake and the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law, both of which work to uphold the integrity of the judicial system. All told, more than $9.1 million has been spent nationwide on TV ads, according to a new analysis by the groups.
“This high level of spending is consistent with the spending we saw in 2010 midterm judicial races,” Alicia Bannon, counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice, said in a statement. “Special interest groups continue to dump money into state Supreme Court races in an attempt to stack the deck in their favor. Voters should feel like our courts are fair and impartial, not political playgrounds where business interests and lawyers can tilt the scales of justice with their pocketbooks.”
Political parties, outside groups, and judicial candidates themselves have spent more than $6.1 million on TV ads for the general election. Toss in primaries and off-cycle elections and that total surpasses $9.1 million, according to government filings and Kantar data. Michigan has seen $2.9 million spent to date, the highest level of ad spending on judicial races of any state this year. Illinois, Montana, Missouri and North Carolina have also seen significant judicial campaign spending this year.
Recent studies have shown that the influx of spending on such races has been associated with a shift in judicial decision-making. Just this week, a review of thousands of state supreme court criminal appeals found that an increase in TV ads was associated with less-favorable rulings for criminal defendants. Advocates for the integrity of the judicial branch fear that an increase in attack ads accusing justices of being soft on crime may be nudging them to increasingly rule against criminal defendants.

Of course, with two weeks remaining until the election, TV ad spending is far from over.

Beyonce  Jay Z renew wedding vows after six years ofmarriageBy: Press Trust of India | London | Posted: October 24, 2014 8:29 pm
Hollywood star couple Beyonce Knowles and Jay Z have reportedly renewed their wedding vows, six years after their marriage.
The ceremony, which took place during their tour of Europe where they were playing their On The Run tour, was said to be tiny and low key, reported the Daily Mirror
“Things have been difficult for them but they have worked hrough it. Now things are better than ever for them,” a source said about the Beyonce, 33, and Jay Z, who have a
two-year-old daughter, Blue Ivy.
“Their friends and families are now delighted that there has been a very happy ending to this whole sorry scenario. Both Beyonce and Jay-Z have put a lot of work into their
marriage and it has paid off. They are both over the moon,” the source added.
The pair’s marriage found itself in trouble when a video of Beyonce’s sister Solange attacking rap king Jay Z, 44, in a New York lift back in May went viral.
Footage of them arguing was leaked, but things became so nasty, Solange also tried to kick and hit her brother-in-law.
Fans were shocked and R’n’B’s golden couple found their marriage under staunch pressure. Rumours became rife that they would split following the end of their tour last month, however in public the pair always maintained their relationship was strong.

Panasonic launches 4K Varicam and Varicam HS production cameras inIndiaPanasonic has developed a next generation of P2 solid-state recording for these Varicam series products.
By: Tech Desk | New Delhi | Posted: October 24, 2014 8:28 pm | Updated: October 24, 2014 8:34 pm
Panasonic India has launched two new variants under its Varicam series of film production cameras – the Varicam HS and Varicam 35. The company has developed a next generation of P2 solid-state recording for these Varicam series products.
Specifically designed to capture 4K or high speed HD images, the expressP2 card offers transfer speeds (up to 2.4Gbps). The expressP2 card (AU-XP0256A) provides 72 minutes recording time in 4K/25p mode with high data reliability by containing a flash memory error correction system, equivalent to a RAID system, to recover from a failure.
Inherited from original Varicam series, the Varicam 35 features a V-Log gamma covering wide latitude 14+ stops. The camera also has the ability to simultaneously record in two different formats and codecs together with its in-camera colour grading function. The Varicam 35 incorporates a newly-developed super35mm MOS image sensor and images can be handled in variable frame rates up to 120 frames per second (fps). It can deliver a variety of recording formats, including 4K and UHD in AVC-ULTRA 4K, and 2K and 1080p HD in AVC-Intra 100.
Varicam HS provides smooth slow motion effects, by recording in 240fps HD, without a cache memory. With high speed 1080p image capture at up to 240fps, the Varicam HS camera is aimed at the production of extraordinary high-definition imagery, for the most demanding documentaries, sports or SFX slow-motion applications.

Jackie Chan wants to be better father after sonsarrestJackie Chan has pledged to become a better father after his son Jaycee was arrested on drug charges.
By: Associated Press | Beijing | Posted: October 24, 2014 8:26 pm
Jackie Chan has pledged to become a better father after his son Jaycee was arrested on drug charges.
The film star said in his first comments in person after the arrest: “I am always a father. I used to be an unqualified father. Now, after this event, I want to be a qualified father.”
Jaycee Chan was detained in August and was formally arrested the following month on suspicion of allowing other people to consume drugs, a charge that carries a maximum sentence of three years’ imprisonment.
Chan apologised in a statement soon after his son’s arrest and pledged to work with him on his recovery.
He spoke to reporters Thursday while promoting his latest movie, “Skiptrace,” in which he plays a Hong Kong detective.

'Government aims at 50th position in ease of doing business ranking'

Direct Tax
(The Commerce and Industry…)
NEW DELHI: The government is aiming to improve India's ranking in ease of doing business index to 50th position in the next two years from the current 134th.
The Commerce and Industry Ministry has already taken several measures and has proposed series of steps, including drastically reducing the time for registration of business to one day, single registration of all labour laws and cut in number of taxes to improve ease of doing business in India.
"Aim is to improve the ranking to 50th position in two years from 134th at present. Different government departments have already started consultation and deliberations on steps to improve India's ranking," sources said.
They added that meetings would continue to remove all the barriers and simplify the cumbersome procedures related to approvals and clearance mechanism for business activities.
According to a World Bank report, India has slipped three positions to 134th spot in the latest 'ease of doing business' list, which is topped by Singapore.
The Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP), has identified sectors and specific reforms that are urgently required to substantially improve India's ranking in ease of doing business.
The department has listed as many as 46 action points for different central government ministries and state governments for improving the business climate.
For Corporate Affairs Ministry, it has suggested that the time taken in registration of business from existing 27 days be reduced to only one day as in Canada and New Zealand.
It has also called for doing away with the requirement of company seal and removal of minimum paid up capital for starting a business.
It has suggested introduction of Bankruptcy Law, Unified Insolvency Code, speedy constitution of benches under National Company Law Tribunal and fixing of a definite and predictable timeframe for rehabilitation and liquidation process.
Similarly, it has recommended reduction in number of taxes and permitting online payment of taxes; simplification of complex tax processes; expediting implementation of Direct Tax Code , Goods and Services tax besides abolition of minimum alternate tax for SEZ developers and units.
Further, it has called for a uniform policy and procedure for all states for a single window clearance along with combined application form and single registration for VAT and other state taxes.
The DIPP has also proposed timelines to implement these initiatives, aimed at attracting investments as part of the Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 'Make In India' campaign.
During the last three years, India received an average of USD 30 billion annual foreign direct investment.
India needs huge investments to give a boost to its manufacturing sector and to create million of jobs.

Sonia  Rahul should speak more; non-Gandhi can be Congress chief: Chidambaram'Black money embarrasses individuals, not party'
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, October 24, 2014

Comments
Amid speculation that the list of names of black money account holders could include a former UPA minister, ex-finance minister P Chidambaram on Friday said such individual transgressions should not embarrass the Congress as the party had not authorised him to keep that account.
“If there is a name of a former minister it will embarrass that person. He is not keeping that account for the party. These are individual transgressions, individual violations of the law, the individual should be embarrassed. Why should the party be embarrassed?” he told NDTV in an interview.
Chidambaram was responding to finance minister Arun Jaitley’s remarks that the Congress will be embarrassed once the names of people holding illicit foreign accounts are made public.
He also reiterated that Congress president Sonia Gandhi and vice-president Rahul Gandhi should “speak more” to the public and the media.
Asked if a non-Gandhi could become the Congress president, he said, “I think so. Someday yes”, but was quick to add, “I do not know” when asked about its timeline.
 Chidambaram also said the reorganisation of the party was due for the larger task of being an “effective, strong, robust and true opposition” to the government.

The top 13 Senate races of 2014By Chris Cillizza , Aaron Blake and Sean Sullivan October 24 Follow @thefix Follow @aaronblakewp Follow @WaPoSean
For an election very few people are paying attention to, it's turning into a pretty exciting one. There are at least 11 Senate races where the outcome is far from certain with just 11 days left before voters go to the polls on Nov. 4.
That's an unusually high amount of uncertainty this late in an election. Typically, the playing field winnows with every passing week as party committees (and candidates) are forced to make fish-or-cut-bait decisions on races that just don't look winnable. There were 10 races rated as toss-ups by the  Cook Political Report in their final ratings before the 2012 election, but only seven such races in 2010 and six in 2008.
So far, the only race that has fallen by the wayside this cycle is the Michigan open seat contest, where national Republicans pulled their advertising earlier this month  in the face of poll numbers that suggested Rep. Gary Peters (D) was very likely to beat former secretary of state Terri Lynn Land (R).
But aside from Michigan, there haven't been any races that have totally collapsed for either side and, in fact, South Dakota, Kansas and Georgia -- all Republican-held seats -- have come on the map, in varying degrees, over the past six weeks (or so). There are currently eight races that the  Real Clear Politics polling average shows are within five points, a remarkable level of competitiveness this late in an election.
While that is welcome news for political junkies -- the more the merrier! -- it does put the national party committees in a tough spot. Money is finite, and that means making decisions about how it should be spent is of critical importance in the waning days of any race. Because there are so many competitive Senate contests, the where, how and when of cash distribution in the final days matters even more. And the closeness of so many races means that second-guessing of whichever side comes up short is inevitable.
Below are our rankings of the 13 most competitive Senate races in the country. The No. 1-ranked race is the most likely to flip parties.
13. Kentucky (Republican-controlled): Two things are true about this race. 1) Mitch McConnell has not been able to pull away from Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes despite massive spending. 2) This is Kentucky in a midterm election that looks bad for Democrats nationally. McConnell is a slight favorite  but both sides are engaged in this race and spending (after the DSCC momentarily stopped running ads), which suggests the outcome isn't quite decided. (Previous ranking: 13)
12. New Hampshire (Democratic-controlled): Former senator Scott Brown (R-Mass.) and Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D) debated twice this week, but there were no big momentum-shifting moments. Polls show Shaheen is popular and has a very small lead, inside the margin of error. This race is making Democrats more nervous than it was a couple of months ago, but Shaheen has at least avoided stumbles. (Previous ranking: 12)
11. North Carolina (D): Sen. Kay Hagan (D) got a boost this week from the environmental community when the League of Conservation Voters announced a $4.2 million effort on her behalf. If Hagan pulls this one out, it will be thanks to the barrage of attack ads the senator and her allies have launched. Tillis has faced a whopping $26 million in negative ads -- more than any Senate candidate and about twice as much incoming as Hagan has faced (though that excludes plenty of "issue ads" that were run against Hagan over the summer). (Previous ranking: 10)
10. Georgia (R): Democrat Michelle Nunn clearly has the momentum -- a new CNN poll Friday morning has her up three points  -- in the wake of Republican David Perdue's outsourcing problems , but it's probably likely now that we're headed for a Jan. 6 runoff. The prospect of that runoff has prevented us from moving up on our list, because runoffs are very unkind to Democrats . But it's also looking increasingly possible that Nunn could win outright on Election Day, with a majority of the overall vote. (Previous ranking: 11)
9. Iowa (D): Republican state Sen. Joni Ernst's decision to snub the Des Moines Register editorial board got lots of attention -- both in Iowa and nationally. You simply can't cancel on the state's biggest paper without getting heat.  Recent polling shows Ernst and Rep. Bruce Braley (D) at or within the margin of error of one another. Every little thing counts at this point. (Previous ranking: 8)
8.  Kansas (R): Both sides think this one remains very close. Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) was looking like he might have some momentum there for a while, but a couple automated polls have shown independent Greg Orman up by a small margin in recent days . It doesn't look like anybody will pull away here. (Previous ranking: 7)
7. Colorado (D): All of the movement here is in Rep. Cory Gardner's (R) direction. Gardner has led Sen. Mark Udall (D) in the last eight polls and, according to the Real Clear Politics polling average , Gardner is up by four points. If Udall does lose -- Democrats insist their ground operation and that's new vote-by-mail system are their aces in the hole --  expect his relentless focus on reproductive rights  to be blamed. (Previous ranking: 9)
6. Alaska (D): Republican Dan Sullivan has led Sen. Mark Begich (D) by two to six points in every public poll out this fall . Democrats are keeping the faith because of their well-oiled ground game and early vote operation. If the election ends up being really close, we may not know the outcome until well after Nov. 4 because of the  lengthy period of time to tally absentee ballots. (Previous ranking: 6)
5. Louisiana (D): We're moving this down a spot, from No. 4, just because Arkansas (now No. 4) is looking pretty tough for Democrats, and at least in Louisiana, they have some time to try and right the ship, given this is headed for a runoff. This runoff would be held Dec. 6 -- a month before Georgia's. Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.) would still be an underdog, but unlike in Georgia, she has actually won runoffs -- both that she's faced, in fact. (Previous ranking: 4)
4. Arkansas (D): Rep. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) has led by between three and eight points in the last five polls here , and Sen. Mark Pryor's (D-Ark.) days are looking increasingly numbered. Cotton overcame some early rumblings that he wasn't the great candidate that he was billed as to run a solid campaign. Republicans are counting on this one, at this point. (Previous ranking: 5)
3. South Dakota (D): Former governor Mike Rounds continues to suffer from some pretty tough headlines, the latest being this . And he's hardly looked like a world-beating candidate this year. But while there was some indication he was in trouble in a three-way race with independent former GOP senator Larry Pressler and Democrat Rick Weiland, Republicans released an internal poll this week showing Rounds up 24 points . Even if that's a little rosy, it suggests Rounds has benefited from the cavalry coming to South Dakota. But we'll await more data before moving this back into the "done deal" category. (Previous ranking: 3)
2. West Virginia (D): National Journal's Alex Roarty made a great point in a piece earlier this month: Rep. Shelley Moore Capito (R) is, quietly, running one of the best campaigns in the country . Capito has made zero mistakes, which has left no opening for Secretary of State Natalie Tennant (D). This is pretty much over. (Previous ranking: 2)
1. Montana (D): Sen.-elect Steve Daines (R). (Previous ranking: 1)

This is the best way to handle Twitter Question Time, in my opinion. Never change, Bryce Harper.
If we’re being real, though, Harper probably doesn’t have time to answer questions anyway. Dude has sharkskin tuxedos to design .

New quarantine rules considered for aid workers returning to U.S. from Ebola-stricken regionBy Mark Berman and Juliet Eilperin October 24 Follow @markberman Follow @eilperin

The federal government is considering altering the protocols for doctors and health-care workers who return to the United States from West Africa, authorities said Friday.
“It’s one of the questions the federal government is thinking through,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) told Fox 5 in New York .
A federal official said that the idea of quarantining medical workers who participated in the Ebola response in West Africa was being considered, but said no decision had been made.
While the idea of a quarantine is being considered, Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, emphasized that officials are still determining whether it is medically justified.
“These kinds of policy decisions are going to be driven by science,” he said.

The possible change would come in the wake of Thursday’s diagnosis of Craig Spencer , a doctor who had treated Ebola patients in Guinea, one of the countries at the heart of the Ebola epidemic.
Spencer, 33, returned to the United States last week and began feeling ill on Tuesday. He was taken to Bellevue Hospital on Thursday after reporting a fever of 100.3 degrees that morning and gastrointestinal problems.
But as federal officials consider a possible change, authorities in the New York area announced that they would take more immediate action. Medical personnel returning to New York and New Jersey from the Ebola-riddled countries in West Africa will be automatically quarantined if they had direct contact with an infected person, officials announced Friday.
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) announced the decision at a joint news conference Friday at 7 World Trade Center.
“The steps New York and New Jersey are taking today will strengthen our safeguards to protect our residents against this disease and help ensure those that may be infected by Ebola are treated with the highest precautions,” Cuomo said in a statement.
They said that public-health officials at John F. Kennedy and Newark Liberty international airports, where enhanced screening for Ebola is taking place, would make the determination on who would be quarantined. Anyone who had direct contact with an Ebola patient in Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea will be quarantined.

In addition, anyone who traveled there but had no such contact would be actively monitored and possibly quarantined, authorities said.
Laurie Garrett, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, said in an interview that while it made sense for returning medical workers to take voluntary steps to isolate themselves upon their return to the United States, concern over Ebola’s transmission in the West had begun to interfere with volunteers’ ability to contain the outbreak at the source.
“For everybody that’s professionally trying to go to the three epidemic countries, the situation has become more difficult with each passing day and each Ebola case — or alleged Ebola case — named in the United States,” Garrett said. “We’re in a crisis actually that imperils the entire effort to stop the epidemic that is completely about the fear of countries that have no known epidemic.”
Not only have many airlines curtailed flights to the three countries most affected by Ebola, Garrett noted, but nearly every major insurance carrier has now canceled medevac coverage for individuals choosing to travel there.
“This whole right of return issue, and circumstances of return, is fluid,” she said. “We’ve hit the point where it is quite obviously affecting the recruitment of volunteer health workers.”
Experts say that the region needs roughly 19,000 health and logistics personnel to contain the epidemic; outside of military personnel, total foreign volunteers now number in the hundreds.
Still, Garrett added, any people traveling to a nation affected by Ebola should undertake efforts to isolate and monitor themselves for any symptoms of the disease for 21 days after returning to their home country.
“At this point it’s incumbent on anyone going over there to build into your plans the assumption that you will have to radically modify how you live and work upon your return for three weeks,” she said.
Spencer had gone to Guinea to work with Doctors Without Borders, the international relief group that has been on the front lines of the public health crisis.
On Friday, the group said Spencer had followed its protocols for people returning from Ebola work, which included regular health monitoring.

“Extremely strict procedures are in place for staff dispatched to Ebola affected countries before, during, and after their assignments,” Sophie Delaunay, the group’s executive director, said in a statement. “Despite the strict protocols, risk cannot be completely eliminated. However, close post-assignment monitoring allows for early detection of cases and for swift isolation and medical management.”
The precise nature of Spencer’s infection is being investigated, the group said. So far, two dozen people working for the organization have fallen ill while fighting Ebola, and 13 of them have died.
Tim Shenk, a spokesman for Doctors Without Borders, said Friday afternoon that quarantining all medical workers who return from West Africa “would be an excessive measure to take at this stage.”
“As long as a patient hasn’t developed symptoms, the risk of contamination is close to zero,” he said.
Spencer became just the fourth person diagnosed with Ebola in the United States and the first outside Texas, which has previously been the nexus of Ebola infections in the country. Thomas Duncan, a Liberian man who flew to Dallas, was diagnosed last month and died eight days later. Two nurses who treated Duncan were infected while caring for him. No one who had close contact with Duncan or the nurses has tested positive for Ebola so far.
The two nurses who contracted Ebola in Dallas were both declared virus-free this week. One was cleared on Wednesday , while Nina Pham, the other nurse,  left the National Institutes of Health on Friday morning after doctors determined she no longer had the virus.
President Obama on Friday wanted to meet with Pham “to thank her for her service,” Josh Earnest said at his daily White House briefing.
When White House officials found out early Friday that Pham would be released, Earnest said, they contacted the NIH “to let her know that the president was interested in meeting her if she felt up to it.”

Pham did not undergo any additional medical testing before greeting—and hugging—the president, Earnest said, noting that she had been shown to be free of the virus on five separate occasions before being released.
Earnest also provided new details Friday about the coordination between federal and New York state officials after Spencer fell ill Thursday. President Obama ordered the Pentagon to provide an aircraft to transport a team of experts from the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta to New York City’s Bellevue Hospital so they could get there “as soon as possible,” he said.
The team, which helped supervise the protocols for treating Spencer, arrived “within a couple of hours” of his arrival, Earnest added.
“We certainly are pleased that so much of the planning that’s been done in recent days has proved to be useful,” Earnest said of how Bellevue’s handled Spencer’s admission.
While federal officials are discussing the idea of quarantining medical professionals upon their return to the United States, Earnest emphasized that officials are still determining whether it is medically justified.
“These kinds of policy decisions are going to be driven by science,” he said.
The administration is focused on protecting the American public, Earnest said. “But at the same time we don’t have to overly burden those individuals who are going to great lengths to stop this outbreak at the source,” he added.
Earnest also emphasized that these aid workers are aware of the public health concerns stemming from their service.
“Individuals who have spent time in West Africa certainly understand the seriousness of this disease,” he said, adding at one point of the precautions Spencer took upon his return to New York, “He is a highly trained medical professional [and] certainly had the capacity to take his own temperature.”
White House officials continued to emphasize the low probability of an Ebola outbreak in the U.S. Earnest said Obama would “have no qualms” about riding the New York subway, visiting the High Line or visiting a Brooklyn bowling alley even in the aftermath of Spencer’s diagnosis.
“The fact is, the risk facing the average New Yorker is exceedingly low,” he said.

Spencer works at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center. On Thursday, the hospital called him “a dedicated humanitarian” who “always puts his patients first.” The hospital said in a statement that he had not been to work and had not seen patients since returning from overseas.
On Tuesday, two days before he was hospitalized and diagnosed, Spencer went to a bowling alley in Williamsburg, rode three New York subway lines and used an Uber car. The bowling alley had closed after Spencer’s diagnosis, while Uber said that health officials had told them the car’s driver and any subsequent passengers were not at risk.
Spencer was is in stable condition Friday , authorities said, and he is talking to public-health workers as they try to trace his steps in recent days. Even as “disease detectives” work to determine who Spencer may have encountered and check the coffee shops and restaurants he visited, officials stressed that they felt they had the situation contained and urged calm among residents.

“New Yorkers who had not been exposed to an infected person’s bodily fluids are simply not at risk,” New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said during a briefing Friday afternoon. “There is no reason for New Yorkers to change their daily routine in any way.”
Spencer “poses no threat to others,” de Blasio said.
The ongoing treatment for Spencer at Bellevue Hospital involves giving him fluid and electrolytes and monitoring his vital signs, said Ram Raju, head of the city’s Health and Hospitals Corporation. Spencer remains in good enough shape to talk on the phone and tell the disease detectives from the health department about his steps so far this week.
Cuomo on Thursday had said that Spencer was a medical professional who had seen Ebola up close, adding that the doctor had been monitoring himself and immediately recognized the symptoms.
“He was familiar with the possibility and the circumstances, so he handled himself accordingly,” Cuomo said.
New York officials repeatedly emphasized on Thursday and Friday that they were prepared for Ebola’s arrival, having trained while also preparing Bellevue and other hospitals for handling patients with the virus.
The office of New York Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) posted images of him riding the subway on Friday morning in an attempt to show residents that they had nothing to fear from public transportation:

Rep. Darrell Issa, a California Republican who chairs the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, urged the Obama administration on Friday to take steps to improve what he characterized as a “bumbling” response to the Ebola crisis.
“I think we all know that the system is not yet refined to where we could say it is working properly,” he said during a hearing on the U.S. government’s response to the disease.
Issa and other members of Congress questioned the measures taken by the administration to prepare for a possible pandemic before Ebola appeared in U.S. hospitals, as well as what officials have done since then to ensure the disease doesn’t spread.
Nicole Laurie, a senior official at the Department of Health and Human Services, said Friday that the risk of a significant Ebola outbreak in the United States was “remote.”
But health-care workers who will be the first to respond to Ebola cases in the United States were worried, particularly after two nurses contracted the disease through an exposure that has still not been explained.
Deborah Burger, co-president of National Nurses United, said these workers remain at risk. She said nurses have received inconsistent instructions, were often left to make decisions about proper precautions for themselves, and at times were forced to improvise their own protective gear because their medical facilities were unprepared. She said only new, legally required guidelines would ensure that medical facilities would provide workers the protection they need.
“The response to Ebola from U.S. hospitals and governmental agencies has been dangerously inconsistent and inadequate,” she said. “The lack of mandates and shifting guidelines from agencies and reliance on voluntary compliance has left caregivers uncertain, severely unprepared and vulnerable to infection.”

Rural job scheme has tremendousimpact on womens lives: Study60% of workers in Alappuzha district depend on the scheme for daily bread
Kochi, October 24:  
The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee (MGNREG) Scheme has helped improve the social and economic status of women and to alleviate poverty in rural areas, according to a study.
The study, conducted in Alappuzha district by Kerala University of Fisheries and Ocean Studies (KUFOS), showed that 97.3 per cent of workers under the scheme are women.
Empowerment
The study was funded by the Kerala State Institute of Rural Development (SIRD) to assess the impact of the scheme on poverty eradication and empowerment of women and marginalised groups.
It found that 60 per cent of workers earned their daily bread through the scheme and that it was a source of additional income for the remaining 40 per cent.
According to the study, 27 per cent of respondents believed that the scheme had helped boost their saving habits and that it brought a kind of financial literacy necessary for financial inclusion.
Impact on wages
The scheme also resulted in wage raise in other sectors, especially in fisheries, construction, coir and agricultural sectors. The study has recommended disbursing the wages within seven days and inclusion of agriculture related works such as harvesting of paddy and works in fish farms under the scheme.
According to V Ambilikumar, Head, Department of Business Administration and Management, KUFOS, and principal investigator of the project, the scheme had made a huge impact on women’s lives and this would reflect on the socio-cultural dynamics of the State.
Kerala has a higher density of population, very limited land holdings and shortage of agricultural land. Hence the list of permissible works under the scheme should be reviewed accordingly, he said.
MS Raju, Director, School of Management and Entrepreneurship, KUFOS, and Mathew Sebastian, Associate Professor, KUFOS, were the co-investigators.

Here Comes Honey Boo Boo canceled after reports about Mama Junes connection with convicted child molesterBy Emily Yahr October 24 Follow @emilyyahr

“Here Comes Honey Boo Boo” has been officially canceled by TLC, the network confirms, after disturbing reports that star Mama June is in a relationship with a convicted child molester.
“TLC has cancelled the series ‘Here Comes Honey Boo Boo’ and ended all activities around the series, effective immediately,” a network spokesman said. “Supporting the health and welfare of these remarkable children is our only priority. TLC is faithfully committed to the children’s ongoing comfort and well-being.”
On Thursday, TMZ reported that Mama June — mother to nine-year-old Alana Thompson, the inspiration for the series — is dating Mark McDaniel, a Georgia man convicted of aggravated child molestation (reportedly against one of June’s relatives) who spent 10 years in prison. He was released in March, about six months after Mama June split with her long-time partner Sugar Bear. TMZ posted pictures of Mama June and McDaniel together in a hotel room.
Mama June took to Facebook and denied that she was seeing McDaniel, saying they broke up a decade ago. She wrote: “It isnt true i promise my kids r #1 priority over anything else and I would never put them in danger period over this or anything else they r my life this is my past I left him 10 yrs ago for it and I wouldn’t go back.”
On Friday morning, she posted a Facebook video again denying the story: “The statement of me dating a sex offender is totally untrue. I would not ever ever ever put my kids in danger, I love my kids too much. That is my past. I have not seen that person in 10 years and don’t seem to want to see that person,” she said.
Her daughter Pumpkin told Radar Online her mother “left Mark 10 years ago.” McDaniel’s son Michael echoed the same thing to E! News, adding that he believes the molestation charges were false and the hotel room pictures were Photoshopped.
This is a very abrupt end to what’s been a controversial — and highly-rated — TV series for TLC since 2008, chronicling the low-income family as they became stars. TMZ reported that the network has already shot all of the episodes for the upcoming fifth season and will have to shelve them.
“Here Comes Honey Boo Boo” is off the air as reports surface that the mother on the show, June Shannon, was dating a convicted child molester. (AP)
The series was a spin-off from “Toddlers & Tiaras” after young Alana (“Honey Boo Boo”) was so charismatic on camera that the network decided to build a whole show around her and her quirky mother and siblings from Georgia. Alana’s many lines were instantly quotable — and often subtitled — while Mama June became famous for her extreme couponing and low-cost recipes for things like “sketti.”
In a story before the show’s second season, The Post’s TV critic Hank Stuever wrote about a fascination with the family that horrified so many:
Even if it were entirely scripted, “Here Comes Honey Boo Boo” feels as real to me as the Great Depression images shot by the WPA photographers. Okie refugees of the 1930s appear so stoic in sepia photographs because we can’t hear them fight about a spilled jar of puffed cheese balls. Hard as this might be for “Honey Boo Boo’s” detractors to stomach, I think the show is a fitting document for our times, good or bad.
He also said that while Alana may have started as the star of the show, Mama June stole the spotlight:
Anyhow, it’s not really Alana’s show anymore. The real find was June Shannon, Alana’s 33-year-old mother. Although she has been mocked far and wide, there is pleasure in encountering someone so comfortable being herself. At its heart, “Here Comes Honey Boo Boo” is a show about a family that enjoys being with one another.
At the end of the day, he wrote, the show is really about family over everything else:
The more we hang around the Boo Boo clan, the less they seem like ogres and the more they serve as a fascinating entree into America’s most pressing concerns: economy, employment, equality, health, community. “Here Comes Honey Boo Boo’s” producers have a keen eye for the class indicators that smart observers love to deconstruct. The camera is continually glancing at anything it considers a cultural cue — passing trains, litter, rust, copulating animals, a chicken perched on a pile of laundry, a shack selling “peches.” The show lives for opportunities to follow June and her brood deeper into redneck-land (a go-kart track, a pro-am wrestling match), but finds its best material in the warm, sectional-sofa center of home.
In her Facebook video Friday, Mama June urged that although TLC told them to stay quiet over the last several months, this is not the last you’ve seen of the family. She promised to update the many fans of the show all about their lives.
“This experience has been awesome to us, the girls have been able to do things they would not normally get to do,” she said of her four daughters. “And we just want to thank y’all from the bottom of our heart.”

Sell for a final target of 1rs in march.New Member
6 Followers
I will tell u the reasons why tci will be trading at 1 rs next march..
1. Tci was holding 1.33 cr shares of gati in 2012 but now only 82 lakhs and the remaining 51 lakh shares have bee sold by the lenders.. Of the 81 lakh shares 41 lakh is pledged. The agarwals r notorious for not releasing the pledged shares. So the fair value of tci even if gati trades at 200 rs ( it will come back to 30 levels soon ) is only 24 rs.
2. As long as gati infra is not listed there will be no gain for tci finance from the power plant. All the positive boarders here hide the fact that tci has only 10% stake in amritjal. It was a negative boarder who informed this board that tci is holding only 10% stake in amritjal. ( i dont know why those giving 500 targets doesnt know how much stake tci has in amritjal ).
3. Tci has no office or even a mail id.
4. Tci posted good results only because of revenue from other operations. A company can grow only if it has good operating income. This time onwards the other operating income will be a big zero. So tci will post very poor results.
5. Tci is only a paper company. They says they r in finance business but they do not have their own office or even a mail id.
Does any one can point out even a single reason why one should buy tci ?

Getting a Grip on Ebolareddit
We have to get a grip. Ebola is not a crisis in the United States. One person has died and two people are infected with his body fluids.
The real crisis is the hysteria over Ebola that's being fed by media outlets seeking sensationalism and politicians posturing for the midterm elections.
That hysteria is causing us to lose our heads. Parents have pulled their children out of a middle school after learning the school's principal had traveled to Zambia. Zambia happens to be in Africa but it has not even had a single case of Ebola.
A teacher at an elementary school has been placed on paid leave because parents were concerned he might have contracted the Ebola virus. When and how? During a recent trip to Dallas for an educational conference.
Are we planning to quarantine Dallas next?
Some politicians from both parties are demanding an end to commercial flights between the United States and several West African countries. But there are no direct flights to the U.S. from Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea, where Ebola is taking its biggest toll.
So do they want to ban all commercial flights that might contain someone from any of these countries, who might have transferred planes? That would cover just about all commercial flights coming from outside the United States.
The most important thing we can do to prevent Ebola from ever becoming a crisis in the United States is to help Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea, where 10,000 new cases could crop up weekly unless the spread of the virus is slowed soon.
Isolating these poor nations would only make their situation worse. Does anyone seriously believe we could quarantine hundreds of thousands of infected people a continent away who are infecting others?
The truth is quite the opposite. If the disease is allowed to spread in these places, the entire world could be imperiled.
These nations desperately need medical professionals in the field, more medical resources, isolation facilities, and systems in place to detect early cases.
Even at this stage, that's not an impossible task. Nigeria is succeeding in checking the spread of the disease. It has not had a new case of Ebola in over a month.
But I'm worried about America. I'm not worried about Ebola. I'm worried about our confidence and courage.
Every time a global crisis arises these days -- the drug war in Latin America, terrorism in the Middle East, climate change that's straining global food and water supplies and threatening many parts of the world with flooding -- the knee-jerk response of some Americans is to stop it at our borders.
As if we have the option. As if we live on another planet.
What's wrong with us? We never used to blink at taking a leadership role in the world. And we understood leadership often required something other than drones and bombs.
We accepted global leadership not just for humanitarian reasons but also because it was in our own best interest. We knew we couldn't isolate ourselves from trouble. There was no place to hide.
After World War II, we rebuilt Europe and Japan. Belatedly, we achieved peace in Kosovo. We almost eradicated polio. We took on tuberculosis, worldwide.
Now even Cuba is doing more on the ground in West Africa than we are. It's dispatching hundreds of doctors and nurses to the front lines. The first group of 165 arrived in Sierra Leone in the past few days.
Where are we?
We're not even paying attention to health crises right under our own noses.
More people are killed by stray bullets every day in America than have been killed by Ebola here. More are dying because of poverty and hunger.
More American kids are getting asthma because their homes are located next to major highways. One out of three of our children is obese, at risk of early-onset diabetes.
We're not even getting a flu shot to all Americans who need one.
Instead, we bicker. For the last eight months, Republicans have been blocking confirmation of a Surgeon General.
Why? Because the President's nominee voiced support for expanded background checks for gun purchases, and the National Rifle Association objected.
We've got to get our priorities straight. Media outlets that are exploiting Ebola because they want a sensational story and politicians using it to their own ends ought to be ashamed.
Public fear isn't something to be played with.
There's a huge job to be done, here and abroad. Let's roll up our sleeves and get on with it.

Barack Obama extends Diwali greetings to people across the worldBy: Press Trust of India | Washington | Posted: October 23, 2014 6:28 am
US President Barack Obama greeted Hindus, Jains, Sikhs and Buddhists across the world on the occasion of Diwali, saying it was a chance to remember that even in the midst of darkness, light will ultimately prevail.
“I want to wish a Happy Diwali to all those who are celebrating the festival of lights here in the United States and around the world,” Obama said in his Diwali message yesterday.
In 2009, Obama became the first US president to celebrate the festival, a time of rejoicing for many in the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) community and across the world.
“For Hindus, Jains, Sikhs and Buddhists, lighting the lamp – the diya – is a chance to remember, even in the midst of darkness, that light will ultimately prevail. Knowledge will defeat ignorance, and compassion will triumph over despair,” he said.
“Diwali is also a reminder that we must each do our part to achieve that victory, by dedicating ourselves to service to others. If we affirm our commitments to one another and strive to lift each other up, then together, we will continue moving closer to that brighter future we all seek,” he said.
America is a great and diverse nation, strengthened by the contributions of its entire people, he said, adding, he was proud to host the first Diwali celebration at the White House in 2009.
“Since then, we’ve continued to mark this holiday to honour the rich traditions that define the American family. And I know Michelle and I will never forget the wonderful time we had celebrating Diwali in Mumbai with food, dancing, and the company of friends,” Obama said.
“So, to all the families gathering together this Diwali to reflect on all the blessings of the past year, I wish you a joyous celebration and Saal Mubarak,” said the US President.
This year Secretary of State John Kerry would host the annual Diwali celebration of the Obama Administration.
It would be held at the historic Benjamin Franklin Room of the Department of State.
Kerry will be joined on stage by the Indian Ambassador to the United States S Jaishankar, the State Department said yesterday.
Following their remarks, Kerry and Jaishankar will light a traditional Diwali oil lamp.
A local Hindu priest from the Sri Siva Vishnu temple will preside over the ceremonial lighting and will drape Kerry with a traditional shawl.
In his remarks Kerry will celebrate the important contributions Indian and South-Asian Americans have made to the United States, and highlight the State Department’s commitment to human dignity, compassion, and service – a commitment that is at the heart of all great faiths, a media release said.

Concern for Washington real estate: declining Metro commutersBy Jonathan O'Connell October 23 Follow @OConnellPostBiz

For 15 years, more and more people rode Metro. Ridership increased an average of 3 percent annually, going from 150 million trips in 1996 to almost 225 million trips in 2009, according to the agency.
Growth came not only from the job gains Washington enjoyed during that period but rapid development near stations along the Green Line in the District, the Orange Line in Arlington and the Red Line in Montgomery County, among other places.
The growth came to a halt during the recession, but many assumed that it would restart once the economy recovered.
Instead, after plateauing, ridership resumed dropping  the past two years even as public transit usage nationwide reached record levels . Metro rail ridership is now almost at its 2005 level.

Such declines concern Metro as it pushes for funding for its long-term improvements. What’s causing ridership to wane?
The agency’s staff raised a bathtub full of possible concerns for the drop-off in a recent report to the board , among them cuts to federal jobs, slow economic growth, a possible rise in teleworking, increased alternative work schedules, more bike commuters and the increased fares and track work that have driven some longtime Metro riders up the wall and maybe back into their cars.
In the report, Metro staff pointed out that recent surveys of federal workers found that more than 10 percent telecommute at least once a week. “Changing commute patterns, particularly in the form of telework and alternative work schedules, are an area of continuing investigation for Metro,” the staff wrote.
Declining ridership is also troubling for the real estate firms and developers that build and own offices near the stations, and of particular concern is a drop in the number of commuters who are taking Metro downtown in the morning.
The real estate services firm JLL looked at the number of morning passenger arrivals (pre-9 a.m.) at the system’s busiest stations, most of which are in or around downtown D.C. All but two of the stations saw declines in 2014 and the drop in Foggy Bottom, of 13.6 percent, was dramatic.

Total arrivals at downtown stations were still up slightly, at 1.7 percent, but JLL’s Brian Sullivan said that from a real estate perspective there is concern that teleworking policies — which have been talked about for a decade or more — are finally taking hold.
Walking, biking or driving to work is one thing, as those employees still need offices. But if you own an office building, employees not coming to work at all is quite another because their employers may decide they don’t need to lease as much space. Sullivan said it’s possible the drop-off “signals that the federal telecommute policies are taking hold, as fewer federal employees take Metro to work on a daily basis.”
“Real estate east of 15th Street caters more to supporting federal offices and we’ve been seeing steady declines in federal employment, so that would explain some of the changes,” Sullivan said.
Richard Barkham, chief global economist at the real estate services firm CBRE, said he sees a societal shift but toward the tech industry, not toward teleworking.
Workers at technology companies are pushing the growth in residential density that cities such as Washington have experienced in recent years, he said. More of them are walking or biking to work and fewer are clocking in from 9 to 5 at the office the way previous generations did.
“The big story in U.S. cities is densification,” Barkham said. “People are moving downtown because it’s very fashionable and very popular. I don’t think it’s threatening suburban living at the moment but it’s what young workers want to do.”
“I don’t think you should overstate teleworking,” he added. “People have talked about this for more than 15 years. When I was doing my PhD in the early ’80s … we were talking about it then. While people are more location-flexible, the more creative industries actually need more face-to-face time.”

Health minister: Mali confirms its first Ebola caseA volunteer receives the Ebola vaccination "cAd3-EBO-Z" at the vaccine center in Bamako, Mali, on Oct. 9. (Alex Duval Smith/EPA)
Mali's health minister confirmed Thursday  that the West African country has its first Ebola case.
Health Minister Ousmane Kone told state television Thursday that the patient is a 2-year-old girl in the Kayes region in the west of the country, Reuters reported. The girl recently came from Guinea, the minister added, which neighbors Kayes to the south.
"The condition of the girl, according to our services, is improving thanks to her rapid treatment," the minister said, according to the Reuters report. He added, "the sick child and the people who were in contact with her in Kayes were immediately identified and taken care of." 
According to the health minister, the patient's blood tested positive for Ebola after she was admitted to a hospital Wednesday evening, the AP notes .
Although the World Health Organization recently declared neighboring Senegal Ebola-free after a single case of the virus there, Guinea is one of three West African countries hit hard by the outbreak.
Since the beginning of the outbreak, the World Health Organization has counted 9,936 confirmed, probable and suspected cases of Ebola in seven countries: Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Spain, the United States, Nigeria and Senegal.
The vast majority of those cases are in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. Along with Senegal, the WHO has also determined that Nigeria is now Ebola-free.
There have been 4,877 confirmed deaths in the current outbreak.
Guinea alone has 1,540 cases of the disease and 904 deaths, according to the latest available figures from the WHO.

E-commerce Industry to Touch $90 Billion by 2021 in IndiaIndian Realty Market Sees $4.5 Billion Investment During January-September: CBRE
Mumbai: The e-commerce industry is worth $13 billion (Rs 79,300 crore) today and is expected to touch $90 billion (Rs 5,49,000 crore) by 2021, according to eTailing India Founder Ashish Jhalani.
This 700 per cent growth will change the way organisations allocate internet advertising budgets in India, eTailing India's Jhalani said in a statement here today.
"E-commerce is a full-fledged industry today, from being ancillary part of the retail industry less than a few years ago. Much like Apple changed the music industry, e-commerce will not only impact retail, but also the advertising industry, Mr Jhalani said.
Shoppers in India are increasingly using smartphones to buy products; sites such as Flipkart, Snapdeal and Shopclues have reported that that up to 35 per cent of their traffic comes from the mobile phone. With the high penetration of phones in India and improving internet connectivity, e-commerce firms are expected to reach millions of new users in the coming years, he said.
In line with the growth of e-commerce, one-third of the world's advertising revenue is also expected to go digital by 2018, Mr Jhalani said.
At a recent conference, Google India declared that Indian internet users will surpass the number in the US by the end of 2014 and around 500 million people will be online by 2018.

Oil Slips to $86 on New York Ebola Case, Slowing Growth
Reuters | Updated On: October 24, 2014 15:48 (IST)
Gold Weakens on Global Cues, Silver Falls on Reduced Offtake
London:
Brent crude oil fell to around $86 a barrel on Friday after a confirmed case of Ebola in New York raised fears that travel restrictions could trim jet fuel demand, and poor economic growth expectations weighed on projected oil demand.
European equities and US stock futures fell sharply on news that a doctor in New York City had been diagnosed with Ebola.
The doctor, who had worked in West African countries afflicted by the deadly virus, was diagnosed after returning to New York.
"Such news is not good for risk assets, with investors looking for a flight to safety. This could curb travel and that's how it could feed through to the oil markets," said Ben Le Brun, market analyst at OptionsXpress.
Brent crude for December fell $1.02 a barrel to a low of $85.81 before recovering slightly to around $86 by 0835 GMT. US December crude fell 70 cents to $81.39 a barrel.
Economists anticipate subdued growth in China and the euro zone next year, though signals from India are more positive, according to a Reuters poll released on Friday.
The gloomy outlook in two major oil consuming markets added to fears of slowing oil demand at a time of global oversupply.
Manufacturers in China and the euro zone performed better than expected, according to purchasing managers' surveys released on Thursday, but industrial growth in the United States fell to its slowest rate since July.
Brent was on track to end the week flat, after four straight weeks of steep losses. The global benchmark rose $2.12 on Thursday on news that Saudi Arabia supplied less to the market in September.
But many analysts thought that the market had overreacted to the news, given that overall Saudi production rose month-on-month, with unsupplied oil being placed in storage.
"The reaction to the Saudi news was surprisingly high, and we may see a correction today," said Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodity analyst at SEB in Oslo.
Saudi Arabia, the world's top exporter, has previously sent signals it is comfortable with markedly lower oil prices and willing to maintain high supply levels to compete for market share.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, of which Saudi Arabia is a leading member, will meet on Nov. 27 to review its output target for the first half of 2015. So far, only a minority of members have called for an output cut, including Libya.

DHS morale problem What DHS morale problemBy Jerry Markon October 24 Follow @JerryMarkon

Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson got right to the point Thursday afternoon after handing out distinguished-service awards to more than 300 department employees. A recent government survey has shown DHS morale plunging to new lows, but Johnson was having none of it.
“There’s a survey that says your morale is low,’’ he said at the start of his address to an auditorium crowded with DHS personnel. His voice rising, he called out: “How is your morale today?’’
The crowd answered with a series of loud whoops.
Johnson’s pep talk was part of the department’s latest effort to tackle the entrenched morale problems that have plagued it for years – and that Johnson has vowed to fix. It came during his “Secretary’s awards’’ ceremony, during which top DHS officials handed out awards to employees for actions ranging from responding to tornadoes and other natural disasters to investigating Russian counterfeiters.
At the event, held at DAR Constitution Hall in the District, Johnson and his deputy, Alejandro Mayorkas, presented the honors to 312 employees from a range of DHS agencies, including the Secret Service, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. A large U.S. flag fluttered overhead at the ceremony, attended by more than 600 DHS employees.
The government’s 2014 Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey recently showed that even as the vast majority of DHS employees are dedicated to their mission to protect the homeland, many say the department discourages innovation, treats employees in an arbitrary fashion and fails to recruit skilled personnel.
The survey has long been a measure of federal job satisfaction and a guide for government leaders, and it forms the basis of the widely read annual Best Places to Work in the Federal Government report.
In issuing the awards, Johnson revived an annual tradition that had been dormant since 2008. He clearly relished the task.
“This is probably the best thing I’ve done in months on my job,’’ he told the DHS employees. “Keep up the good work.’’

Washington vs. Dallas: A telling tale-of-the-tape on 3rd downsBy Liz Clarke October 24 Follow @lizclarketweet

Among the statistical contrasts between Washington (2-5, 0-2) and Dallas (6-1, 1-0) heading into Monday night’s game at AT&T Stadium, the one that leaps out as most telling is third-down conversion.
Dallas leads the NFL in its success rate on third downs, converting 54 of 94, or 57.4 percent.
Washington ranks 31st, better only than Tennessee, converting 26 of 82 third downs, or 31.7 percent.
Cowboys Coach Jason Garrett credits his squad’s enviable percentage to a collective effort that starts, not surprisingly, with getting in good position on first and second downs.
“Anytime you do that, you’re obviously giving yourself the best chance to convert those,” Garrett said in a conference call this week.
The fourth-year Cowboys coach pointed in particular to the team’s stout offensive line, which has protected well in the tougher third-down situations, and the array of receiving options at quarterback Tony Romo’s disposal — wide receivers Dez Bryant, Terrance Williams and Cole Beasley; tight ends Jason Witten, Gavin Escobar and James Hanna; and running back Lance Dunbar among them.
“We feel good about where we are right now,” Garrett said of his team, which brings a six-game winning streak onto its home field. “But it’s very much a collective effort and has a lot to do with what we’re doing prior to third down. We’ve just got to keep that going because it’s a big part of the game.”
Washington free safety Ryan Clark points to the Cowboys’ draft-day strategy as the foundation of the success of Dallas’ offense this season.
“They did good by making the unsexy first round picks — but not getting the big name guys; by not chasing people they thought would put butts in the seats,” Clark said. “They went out, they got first-round [offfensive] linemen. Now that’s paying dividends because now DeMarco Murray has a lot of space to run the football. Now, Tony Romo can use the play-action, and now you get one-on-one coverage with Dez every now and then, who’s a guy you really can’t cover man-to-man.”

CIC devising system to keep tab on defaulting PIOsCentral Information Commission devising system to keep tab on defaulting PIOs
Gangadhar S Patil, ET Bureau Oct 24, 2014, 07.06PM IST

CIC
(The IMS which is awaiting DoPT’s approval…)
NEW DELHI: Keeping in view increasing numbers of cases of non-compliance of orders, the central information commission is working on an information management system (IMS) to keep a tab on the defaulting public information officer (PIO).
The IMS which is awaiting DoPT's approval would enable officials to prepare list of defaulting PIOs and also status of other orders passed by the commission, which is the apex body for RTI complaints at the centre. This would help commission take action against frequent erring officials and help applicant get needed information. This apart, the system would send SMS alert to complainants as soon as their complaints gets registered. It would also keep them updated on the progress of the complaint.
In June, the commission sent the proposal to the department of personnel and training, nodal agency for implementation of the RTI act and subsequently held discussions over it. "DoPT has sent us some queries pertaining to implementation of the system which we have replied. We are now waiting for the approval," said a senior official with commission. The commission has already designed the system.
Several orders passed by the commission are not implemented and there is no system to track them to punish the defaulting PIO . This has resulted in increasing number of rejection of RTI applications in recent past. At present, the commission does not maintain any register for non-compliance cases. Thus, the total number of such cases are unknown. However, officials say that it could run in thousands. The commission decides on nearly 60-70 cases every day and during 2013-14 it registered more than 20,000 complaints.
RTI experts opine that such system would put pressure on the officials to comply with orders leading to strengthening of the transparency law. The purpose of the act fails if the applicant does not get information sought even after getting a favorable order from the commission, said Hyderabad based RTI expert CJ Karira. "Commission needs to digitize its work as several cases of complaints missing and getting lost have come up," he added.
The CIC is the second level of appeal for RTI petitioners who are dissatisfied with responses provided by the public information officer and subsequently, the first appellate authority, who is usually the senior officer in the same department. The time limit for responding to both the petition and appeal is 30 days.
The problem of non-compliance of orders was discussed by the commission in its meeting held last month. "A proposal for additional staff may be sent to the DOPT for its consideration as the present staff strength is grossly inadequate to deal with such cases in the registry," said the minutes of meeting.

The evolution of Islamism since the Arab uprisingsBy Quinn Mecham October 24

The Arab uprisings of 2010-2011 provided a major shock that led to the rapid evolution of Islamism in the Arab world. While it was clear at the outset that the shock to Islamist movements would be large, how Islamist movements would internalize that shock and the direction in which they would evolve were highly contingent on the evolution of the Arab political systems. Since the initial uprisings, Islamist movements have evolved dramatically due to a several key trends that have defined and redefined their experience in the new Arab political (dis)order. These trends must be understood in the context of the opportunities Islamist movements faced in initial uprising period.
Although most Islamist movements, such as the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, were initially slow to lead popular mobilization against autocratic Arab regimes, they recognized that they could benefit from changes in the post-uprisings political landscape. As it became apparent in many Arab countries that new elections could translate popular support for Islamist movements into political power, many Islamist groups supported the electoral process and launched aggressive campaigns to define society’s needs and capture votes.
These visions, championed by diverse Islamist groups such as Ennahda in Tunisia, Muslim Brotherhood and Salafi groups in Egypt, Islah in Yemen and the Justice and Development Party (PJD) in Morocco, as well as Islamist groups in Libya, Jordan and Kuwait, saw the 2011-12 period as a potential renaissance for Islamist participation in governance. They clumsily entered into political competition with other actors who also sought to redefine the emerging political order. In a large number of countries experiencing political turmoil (Tunisia, Egypt, Morocco, Yemen and Kuwait) Islamist groups found new levels of political prominence. Importantly, however, they were actively repressed by the state in Syria, and often had only limited access to key domains of state power (in Libya, Egypt and the monarchies).
Since their initial experience with mass mobilization and the political openings in 2011-12, four main trends have affected Islamist movements in the Arab world that have dramatically shifted their perceived political opportunities. These trends have led to the rapid evolution and devolution of Islamist groups, often in deeply defining ways that will leave a long-term organizational legacy for Islamist groups far into the future. I discuss each of these trends in turn.
Trend #1: Repression of the Muslim Brotherhood
Though a long-standing actor of significance in Egyptian society and politics, as well as a leader among Islamist movements in the Arab world, the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood initially appeared to benefit significantly from the political opening after the fall of President Hosni Mubarak. The Brotherhood had wide-ranging internal discussions regarding its electoral strategy in the post-Mubarak period, but ultimately chose to compete aggressively for both control of the People’s Assembly and the Egyptian presidency. In the Egyptian elections of 2011-12, the Brotherhood’s Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) won both the Assembly elections and the presidency, leading many in Egypt to fear Brotherhood dominance of the institutions of government.
In retrospect, the Brotherhood’s move to reverse its initial decision not to contest the presidency was a fateful one. After its candidate, Mohamed Morsi, narrowly won the election and became president of Egypt, he sought to challenge existing centers of power in Egypt, and was unable to resolve the deep economic and social challenges faced by Egyptians in the wake of political turmoil. Widespread popular anger at governmental ineptitude, combined with military concerns over potential threats to its economic and political prerogatives, led the Egyptian military and courts to disband the Brotherhood-dominated Assembly and subsequently forcibly remove Morsi from office in 2013.
Although a case could be made that the Brotherhood-dominated government had squandered its extensive popular support, the military decision to forcibly remove an elected Islamist government had enormous consequences for the incentives of Islamist groups to compete in popular elections. Furthermore, the military and judicial decision to aggressively pursue the Muslim Brotherhood as an organization, regardless of its political positions, cast a long shadow over Islamist political calculations that has only darkened over time. Beginning in 2013, the Egyptian state launched a massive campaign to brand the Brotherhood a terrorist organization, to systematically imprison leadership and to destroy the organization’s capacity as a political and social organization. In the process, human rights protections dramatically receded in Egypt, forcing remaining members of the Brotherhood underground or into exile. Simultaneously, the Brotherhood was pursued outside Egypt, particularly in Saudi Arabia and a number of Gulf countries, as Gulf leaders provided the new military regime in Egypt with budgetary support.
This dramatic turn of events, which took the Arab world’s most prominent and popular Islamist group from the heights of governance to a position where it was forcibly and irremediably excluded from normal politics, has deeply affected the organization’s capacity and incentives to participate in regular political processes. A similar process occurred with the Islamist Salvation Front (FIS), which won elections in Algeria in the early 1990s, and triggered a long and brutal civil war in that country. While there are as of yet no strong signs that civil war looms for Egypt, it is clear that perceptions of injustice coupled with exclusion from the political process have altered the incentives for Islamists in Egypt in a way that could produce militancy.
Trend #2: State Failure and the Rise of Islamist “State-Building”
A second trend that has become more pronounced in the Arab world since 2011 is state failure. This has been most prominent in Syria, Iraq, Libya and Yemen. State failure is marked by the inability of the state to provide security and basic state goods such as sanitation, transport, education and health facilities. As central governments have lost control over territory and have lost their monopoly over the use of violence, Islamist groups have been the most prominent of those who have stepped in to fill the breach. Islamists have competitors in the form of tribes and ethnic groups, but they have found it easier than these groups to secure external funding, weaponry and fighters, many of which have come from abroad and have rallied around a pan-Islamic identity.
Since 2013, a number of militant Islamist groups have begun to transition away from strategies that seek primarily to destroy or destabilize the state (e.g., in Syria and Iraq) to groups that seek to monopolize violence over territory that they control. While they still see existing states as rivals to be challenged, they have discovered that they have the ability to build organizational and economic capacity to rule territory and to distribute patronage to their political clients. These militants have both rejected the participatory political norms of groups like the Muslim Brotherhood as well as the anarchic tendencies of the al-Qaeda franchise in favor of norms based in militia-based governance. This brand of militancy requires the development of broader ideology of governance than al-Qaeda possesses, as well as resources that can be managed to produce a regular income.
Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in the Gaza Strip provided early territorial-based models of militant Islamist governance, but it has now spread through large parts of the Levant and Mesopotamia, as well as into parts of Libya and Yemen. The rise of the Islamic State that crosses the traditional Syrian and Iraqi border territory is the most expansive of these new models, governing at present close to 8 million people and commanding large economic and military resources. The Syrian conflict has led other Islamist groups to adopt a similar model on a smaller scale. Likewise, large parts of Libya and Yemen are now controlled by Islamist militias.
What distinguishes these groups from other Islamist groups is their ability to incentivize populations living under their control (through good governance, extortion or fear) to submit to their authority and often to participate in providing security or governance. They reject the Westphalian state system in favor of often unorthodox models of “Islamic” state governance, borrowing many of the tools of modern state systems but rejecting the legitimizing norms of these states. As these new political orders increasingly challenge international norms and the states in which they operate, their ability to maintain resource flows and territorial control will remain an open question.
Trend #3: Islamists as Actors in Sectarian Proxy Wars
The enormously destructive conflict in Syria has become a catalyst for a new level of proxy conflict between Middle Eastern actors, most notably between the dominantly Sunni countries of the Arab Gulf and Shiite Iran. This international conflict using local proxies has shaped how Islamist groups are funded and behave, leading to increasing Islamist militancy and to the development of sectarian ideologies.
As the Syrian opposition to the regime of Bashar al-Assad evolved from a dominantly non-violent campaign to a militant one, arms and resources to Sunni combatants flowed into the country from the Arab Gulf. When the competition between fragmented rebel groups for external funding intensified, they often sought to distinguish themselves from competing groups through their ideology, which in many cases came to mirror the anti-Shiite tendencies of dominant private and government funders. Active Iranian funding for the Assad regime gave the Syrian conflict an increasingly sectarian cast, which had been the case for some time in Iraq. By 2013, as the Iraqi and Syrian rebellions began to overlap in their organization, Islamists on both sides began to view the civil wars in these countries as existential sectarian conflicts. The Islamic State’s dramatic territorial gains in Iraq during 2014 have further aggravated the sectarian tendencies of Iraq’s Shiite-dominated government, and Shiite militias have been deployed throughout much of the country to counter the real and urgent threat from Sunni militants.
Sectarianism in Syria has led to Islamist violence across sectarian lines in neighboring Lebanon, as Sunni militants have targeted Hezbollah positions. Yemen has also seen violent clashes between mainstream Sunni Islamists (Islah) and the Shiite Zaydi Houthi movement, which have spread into the capital, Sanaa. Both countries remain at risk of civil war, which would likely fall along Sunni-Shiite lines. The ongoing funding of militants with highly sectarian ideologies by sympathetic external actors leaves Islamist groups in many parts of the Arab world more militant, well-funded, diverse and sectarian in their ideology than prior to the Arab uprisings. This is a trend that has already led to deep polarization across Islamist groups and will take many years to reverse.
Trend #4: Political Learning Continues
Despite the increasing levels of government repression, militancy and sectarianism experienced by Islamist groups since 2012, a number of Islamist groups have adjusted their strategies to limit their exposure to these trends and to remain relevant in their political systems. Just as the initial Arab uprisings created a large demonstration effect for protest movements throughout the Arab world, the deeply negative political developments in many Arab countries have led to increasing caution and political learning among Islamist groups in neighboring countries.
Islamist groups in countries such as Algeria and Jordan have chosen not to lead a major challenge against their governments, in part because of the negative lessons of Islamist activism from the 1990s civil war in Algeria and the contemporary civil war in Jordan’s neighbor Syria. Likewise, Islah in Yemen is operating in a context where al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula plays a militant role. As a result, Islah has sought to frame its ideology in a way that will avoid charges of militancy and allow it to capture some of the spoils of the post-Ali Abdullah Saleh political transition.
Perhaps the most interesting political learning has been demonstrated by the Islamist Ennahda party in Tunisia. Although Egypt watched Tunisia’s uprising against then-President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali closely, which then led to mass protests in Egypt that unseated Mubarak, Tunisians have observed the military’s removal of Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood with great interest. Morsi’s unwillingness or inability to offer significant concessions to his political opponents helped to trigger a military intervention with profoundly negative consequences for the Egyptian group. When public protests subsequently began in Tunisia against the Ennahda government and led to political deadlock, the Islamist government chose to resign in favor of a technocratic government. This helped to preserve the democratic system as well as the movement’s ability to participate within that system. As a result, Ennahda maintained its political reputation and organization within the Tunisian system. In Morocco, a similar process has unfolded since the Islamist PJD won elections in November 2011. While the party was criticized by many Islamists for being too conciliatory to the palace in a system that clearly favors the institutions of monarchy, it has maintained influence within that system in part due to its political conservativism.
As Islamist militancy leads to increasing conflict, and as the consequences of increased government repression become more apparent, many mainstream Islamist groups in functioning states are likely to exercise increasing caution in their political behavior in the near term, learning from the current political disorder in the Arab world.
These four trends have been deeply influential on the evolution of Islamist movements in a short period, and they are likely to be lasting in their effects. Unlike the fragile political transitions of 2011-12, which were subject to a range of political forces that worked against their success and stability, the destructive trends in large parts of the Arab world since 2012 are much harder to reverse.
This is primarily because they have led to the dismantling of important forces that take a long time to build. These earlier, but fragile, forces include the democratic interest and participation of Islamist groups, cross-sectarian coalitions that support state governance, and even state capacity itself. Both state and nation have fractured in many parts of the Arab world since 2012, and neither will be reconstituted except in the long-term. This has led many Islamist groups to face permanent exclusion from their states and societies, or to try to re-create state and society on their own terms by force.
Neither of those scenarios augurs well for the future of Islamist groups in the Arab world, and will lead many Islamist leaders to make difficult choices in the near term. If Islamists can continue to play a constructive role in Tunisia, Morocco or even Iraq by channeling Islamic norms of justice on behalf of national interests, then they may yet play a role in the urgent task of nation building. If, however, either narrow ideological interests or exclusion from the political process prevent Islamist groups from contributing to the processes of nation, state, or regime-building in the region, they will likely remain but one more contribution to the ongoing dissolution of the Arab world’s political order.

Amreicas Markets with John Waggoner on the Social Security cost of living raise. USA TODAY

00:06  Yesterday the government announced the annual cost of living increase
00:09  in Social Security benefits. A whopping one point 7% hike or
00:13  about 22 bucks a month for the average beneficiary Hulu. But
00:17  there are three other thing can he do about Social Security.
00:19  I'm John Wagoner and this is America's markets. First Social Security
00:24  isn't all that generous. The average Social Security pay out as
00:27  1294. Dollars a month you know can be spending a lot
00:31  of time on the Love Boat on that. Second a lot
00:33  of people live off Social Security alone. For about 23% of
00:37  all Mary beneficiaries. Social Security represents 90% or more of their
00:41  income. Net source to 46%. For single beneficiaries. Third it's valuable
00:48  if you wanna replace Social Security in the private market leading
00:50  more than 300000. Additional retirement savings according vanguard. That's without benefits
00:56  to survivors or disability benefits with Social Security also provides. Sure
01:01  you might say people should pay their retirement out of their
01:03  own pockets but they go the average middle class workers say
01:06  just 20000 dollars towards retirement. Even with a really good and
01:10  that's returns that won't get too far and with your retirement
01:13  hobby is confusing and exploded bombs. Social Security is designed to
01:17  supplement your retirement income to keep save. And it can be
01:20  fixed reasonably easily at this point but for many people it's
01:24  their most valuable retirement nest it.

Social Security recipients will get a 1.7% cost-of-living raise starting in January, the Social Security Administration announced Wednesday.
For the average retired person receiving Social Security, monthly payments would rise $22 to $1,328 from $1,306. The average couple's benefits would rise to $2,176 from $2,140. Average annual payout: $15,936.
The maximum monthly Social Security benefit for a single worker at full retirement age will rise to $2,663 in 2015 from $2,642.
The increase will affect nearly 64 million Americans.
The cost-of-living increase was determined by the change in the government's Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) from the third quarter 2013 compared with the third quarter of 2014.
Retirement planning with Social Security's 'annual report'
Those who pay Social Security taxes will pay a bit more as well. The maximum amount subject to Social Security tax will rise to $118,500 from $117,000. Of the estimated 168 million workers who will pay Social Security taxes in 2015, about 10 million will pay higher taxes because of the increase in the taxable maximum, Social Security says.
Employees pay Social Security taxes at a 7.65% rate, with employers paying an equal amount. The self-employed pay the full 15.3% rate.
Although the raise is small, it's important, says Christopher Jones, chief investment officer for Financial Engines. "The main thing is that payments do, in fact, go up with inflation," Jones says. Social Security recipients got a 1.5% raise this year and a 3.2% increase in 2012.

Ford CEO Mark Fields says the company has the expertise and ability to build a Tesla-style full-size, high-tech, high-performance, long-range electric vehicle.
Fields stopped short of saying Ford will do so, but did say, "It's consistent with our product philosophy."
Ford's only all-electric is the small Focus electric. Ford also sells plug-in hybrids.
Fields made the Tesla comment Friday during a conference call with Wall Street investment analysts and reporters discussing Ford's third-quarter earnings announcement.
Ford said it has no plan to copy the Tesla Model S -- a big, four-door hatchback sedan. But a larger vehicle of some kind, with greater range and better performance than the Focus electric, would fit Ford's lineup and its emphasis on technology, the automaker said.
In the conference call, Fields said Ford has the engineering and manufacturing sophistication to do such a model, with the range and quickness that characterize the Model S.
Ford bought a Tesla Model S and, Fields said, "We drove it. We took it apart. We put it back together and we drove it again."
One possibility, though Ford didn't bring it up: Inject some verve into the flagging Lincoln luxury brand by having it offer a large, fast, long-range electric car. Lincoln already enjoys some success with its mid-size MKZ hybrid sedan.
Lincoln's big sedan, a derivative of the Ford Taurus, is the MKS. So if Lincoln were to electrfy that one, it, too, would have an "S" model battery car.
Tesla was supportive.
It opened its patents in June to hurry the development of high-performance electrics by other makers. The company said Friday it believes that automakers "and the world would all benefit from a common, rapidly-evolving technology platform."
Tesla could benefit financially, because it's planned "giga-factory" would be a main source for the high-capacity battery packs such cars would require.
In its earnings report Friday, Ford ( F ) said it had pre-tax profit of $1.2 billion the quarter and net income of $835 million, both well down from a year ago on higher costs, lower sales volumes.

New Yorkers and others further afield took to social media to criticize New York City Ebola victim Dr. Craig Spencer for going out and about in the city — including on the subway, in an Uber car and visiting a bowling alley — despite reportedly feeling unwell , though apparently before full symptoms exhibited themselves.
"Dr. Craig Spencer returned from treating Ebola patients in Guinea on Oct 17 and didn't think to at least self quarantine?!" wrote Twitter user @DodieClouse about the case.
Meanwhile, tweeter Jake Nyborg vented:
Have Ebola? Feel free to take planes, trains, taxis (hell, even lick a few light posts) but stay away from the bowling lanes, man...
— jake nyberg (@jakenyberg) October 24, 2014
And New Yorker Melissa Stetten (@MelissaStetten) asked: "How did you get ebola? You rented some bowling shoes on Wednesday night and had a scratch on your toe? That's bad luck, man."
Spencer returned to New York from Guinea, where he had been working with Doctors Without Borders treating Ebola patients, and was declared asymptomatic at a New York City-area airport. He flew out of the West African nation on Oct. 14, traveling via Europe, and arrived in New York on Oct. 17.
Twitter users said he should have thought more about others' safety.
"#EbolaNYC doctor had overwhelming evidence he must self quarantine. Use common sense! Should be tried for manslaughter if he infects anyone!" tweeted Orlando, Fla., resident Nick Egoroff.
Others were just as vociferous, such as:
And Staten Island native and former Jersey Shore star Vinny Guadagnino was forthright in his criticism: "ABSOLUTELY NO SYMPATHY for a doctor who knows he's been in contact w/Ebola, goes bowling, takes 2 subways, has contact with girl, Uber. none"
In typical New York style, some used gallows humor to highlight their thoughts:
The ballwasher at that Brooklyn bowling alley suddenly hates his job even more than usual. #EbolaNYC

“Did you inexplicably lick the subway poles that Dr. Craig Spencer used?” A+ @ddiamond . pic.twitter.com/51MxC40loQ

@evanengel that doctor selfishly put his city at risk to go bowling...and p.s. subway sweat is highly unavoidable #CraigSpencer #ebola
— Court Jester (@courtjesterias) October 24, 2014
But mostly there was a sense of outrage on display.
@Dsr2 I wonder if he was working in West Africa with a group of physicians called #DoctorsWithoutBrains . #BowlingEbolaDoctor
— Evan Van (@MadAnter) October 24, 2014
Doctors Without Borders? How about Doc without a brain? Why the hell did this guy go bowling & take subway if fatigued on 10/21? #NYCEbola
— Todd Schnitt (@toddschnitt) October 24, 2014
Also, a call for common sense:
Any doctor returning from treating Ebola patients overseas might oughtta wanna be quarantined out of caution, no? http://t.co/QqbJz6c7wk
— Bill Green (@mtlb) October 24, 2014
All New Yorkers need to stay calm and not cause unneeded panic with regards to #NYCEbola . Don't let the media scare you! Think for yourself!

Sorry  Madeleine Albright dont play thatBy Helena Andrews October 24 Follow @helena_andrews
Well that escalated quickly.
The next time you decide to tweet a seasonal (and teeny bit sexist) punchline at a former secretary of state, just… don’t. Especially if the woman in question is one Madeleine Albright, who recently put Conan O’Brien (nay, the world) on notice: Don’t come for me, boo.
It all started rather innocently. O’Brien, host of “Conan” on TBS, tweeted Thursday that he’d finally figured out what he was going to be for Halloween. Things went downhill from there.
I picked out my Halloween costume. I’m going as “Slutty Madeleine Albright.”
— Conan O’Brien (@ConanOBrien) October 23, 2014
Instead of ignoring O’Brien and giving her Presidential Medal of Freedom its daily spit shine, Albright shot back with a perfectly executed burn of her own.
. @ConanOBrien I’m considering going as hunky Conan O’Brien – but that might be too far fetched. — Madeleine Albright (@madeleine) October 23, 2014
And…. boom goes the dynamite.
Fortunately for us, the lesson didn’t stop there. Albright, who has more than 70,000 followers on Twitter (O’Brien has 12.5 million), schooled the talk show host about her mettle.
. @ConanOBrien Never get into a word war with a diplomat. We talk even more than comedians.
— Madeleine Albright (@madeleine) October 23, 2014
And the comedian capitulated.

Watch: Frank Mankiewicz on Walter Cronkite  political adviserBy Erik Wemple October 24 Follow @ErikWemple
As The Post’s Adam Bernstein writes in a wonderful obituary , Frank Mankiewicz plowed a classic Washington career toggling between the adjacent worlds of media and politics: aide to Robert F. Kennedy and George S. McGovern, NPR president, PR exec at Hill & Knowlton.
In an archival interview with C-SPAN’s Brian Lamb , Mankiewicz unspooled a telling anecdote about just how closely these worlds can intermingle in Washington, or at least the Washington of Mankiewicz’s time. Lamb and Mankiewicz discuss the Washington operator’s suggestion that CBS News/American legend Walter Cronkite serve as McGovern’s running mate in the 1972 contest against Richard M. Nixon. That idea didn’t fly, obviously.
As to why Mankiewicz thought Cronkite would be a good guy to tap, he recited the particulars of a meeting years before. In Mankiewicz’s own words:
I knew he was very much opposed to the Vietnam War because he had come back from Vietnam and immediately called me and asked to see Sen. Robert Kennedy. And the two of them met — I was there. And he began by saying, ‘Senator, you’ve got to run for president because this war’s got to end,’ and went on to say how unwinnable it was. He said we’d win a village in the daytime and we’d have to give it back at night. He said the Vietnamese in the south may not like the north, but they like us less. So I knew — and Kennedy said to him, he said, ‘Walter, I’ll run for president if you’ll run for the senate in New York.’ And Cronkite laughed and said ‘Well, I can’t because in the first place I don’t live in New York; I live in Connecticut. And secondly I’m not a Democrat. I’m registered as an independent.’
Mankiewicz told the same story in an op-ed in The Washington Post after Cronkite’s death . He noted that the “meeting was understood to be off the record, and no one else was present.” Correct: When a media big shot morphs into a political adviser, best to keep it quiet.

India s warning on pro-Pakistan group s rally on Kashmir in London15

New Delhi: Two days ahead of a planned rally in London by a pro-Pakistan group on Kashmir issue, India on Friday warned that forces inimical to Indo-UK relations may utilise such opportunity in open societies.
However, it appreciated Britain's stand that the Kashmir issue was to be resolved only by India and Pakistan and said that with this reassurance the government was "quite comfortable" of any march being organised.
External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Syed Akbaruddin downplayed the 'Million March', being organised on Sunday, saying India was a country of more than a billion and millions don't "overawe" it.
External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Syed Akbaruddin downplayed the 'Million March', being organised on Sunday, saying India was a country of more than a billion and millions don't "overawe" it.
#india #pakistan #uk #syed akbaruddin
"Now it is possible that forces inimical to India-UK relations may utilise opportuinities of this sort and it was in this context that we discussed with UK and we were reassured repeatedly that the UK's view is very clear and that it is for India and Pakistan to resolve any issue that they have by themselves.
"With that reassurance, we are quite comfortable of any march being organised, be it the so-called million march because we, as I said, are country of a billion. Millions do not overawe us....," he said.
External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj had raised with Deputy Prime Minister of Britain Nick Clegg organisation of the planned anti-India march during her visit to London last week. The "Million March" is planned on October 26 from London's Trafalgar Square to highlight the Kashmir issue.
Asked about Pakistan parliament passing a resolution yesterday against the alleged "unprovoked and indiscriminate" ceasefire violations by India and seeking UN intervention to resolve the Kashmir issue, the Spokesperson said it was aimed at the domestic audience and that India opposed the option of involvement of any third party on the matter.
"Resolutions passed by Parliaments are... internalisation processes. Therefore, why should we have any problem with any internalisation process in any country? This is for that country to take a view on," he said, adding India was strongly opposed to internationalising the issue.
"As regards to any issue of international nature, we have given our views on that we do not see any option of any third party be involved in this. Therefore, as far as internationalisation is concerned, we are against it. As far as internalisation is concerned, this is for Pakistan to sort itself out," the Spokesperson said.
The Spokesperson said India was ready for talks with Pakistan under the provisions of Shimla Agreement and Lahore Declaration but it was for that country to create a conducive atmosphere for dialogue.
"Our view is that it is for Pakistan to enter into a situation where we can have an atmosphere conducive for talks. Therefore, our view is very clear that we are ready for a bilateral dialogue under the Shimla agreement and the Lahore declaration. But that requires an atmosphere which is conducive for talks.
The ball, therefore, is in Pakistan's court," he said. To another question on information on the blast in Burdwan, as was sought by Bangladesh government, the MEA Spokesperson said the ministry has requested concerned agencies to collate information and was awaiting a report in this regard.
Once the Ministry receives the report, it will be factored-in in the response to Bangladesh government, he added. Earlier, the Spokesperson had confirmed that the Bangladesh government has requested India's assistance in the case.

Demand concerns put pressure on base metalsDemand concerns put pressure on base metals
G Chandrashekhar
:  
The global base metals market is currently facing strong headwinds that impact price performance.
In 2012 and 2013, a combination of expanding liquidity, weakening dollar, China’s voracious appetite for consumption and slowly improving growth prospects helped a strong uptick in demand. Although selective, investor interest in base metals was healthy.
Things are different now. This year has not been a great one for metals market.
In recent months, some of the important drivers have reversed direction while new challenges have emerged. Shrinking liquidity following the US Fed’s tapering programme, a steadily firming dollar, slowing industrial production in some of the major economies and lower inflation expectations have combined to cap the upside and force market prices down.
Currently, macroeconomic risks are casting a shadow – concerns over growth being the most important.
There is apprehension of demand slowdown. As the mover and shaker of the world commodity market, China’s import and consumption of metals exert a profound impact.
With construction activity in the Asian major slowing, there are fresh concerns over metals’ demand growth.
Another reason is the high level of corporate debt in China.
Although inflation is under control and employment healthy, the Chinese government seems to be worried about corporate debt and has, therefore, asked State-owned enterprises to fund purchases through cash flow rather than on credit.
According to experts, the metals and mining sector in China is not in a good shape. Declining investment growth and falling property prices have generated fears that the 2015 GDP growth target may be lowered. There are demand concerns is other regions too. Although US recovery is back on track, global growth is still uneven. Demand in Europe and Japan is still fragile.
Of course, many emerging markets show signs of stabilising with activities being adjusted to global realities. The US Fed’s monetary policy normalisation is seen as another uncertainty as expectations differ about the timeframe. Geopolitical tensions may have somewhat receded, but the Russia-Ukraine stand-off and insurgency in Syria and Iraq can potentially create a turmoil.
Simply put, the global environment is full of strong pulls and pressures.
As a result, many commodities are trading close to their cost curve.
Some of the less-efficient producers have shut down. It has also prompted a cut in capacity expansion.
Collapsing metal prices deter fresh investment while investor risk appetite wanes.
Supply demand fundamentals have begun to assert themselves.
Exception
An exception to the general trend of falling base metals prices is nickel whose price surge has been triggered by Indonesian ban on export of unprocessed raw material. Zinc is another exception because of tightening supplies.
Despite all the uncertainties surrounding the base metals market, on current reckoning, nickel will turn out to be a winner next year followed at a distance by zinc.

Gridco may earn Rs 700 cr from power tradingGridco may earn Rs 700 cr from power trading
Jayajit Dash & Sadananda Mohapatra | Bhubaneswar Oct 24, 2014 08:20 PM IST
State-run power trader Gridco Ltd said, it is at a comfortable position to earn Rs 700 crore in the current fiscal by trading power on energy exchanges and selling to other states as better post monsoon rainfall has increased chances of higher hydro power production.
“We have so far managed to trade power worth Rs 350 crore both on exchanges and via short-term trade with other states such as Uttar Pradesh. We hope the trading revenue could go upto Rs 700 by end of 2014-15,” said an official of Gridco. The state has generated around 750 Mw hydro power in the current month out of total 3200 Mw power available from different thermal power and renewable energy generators, compared with less than 500 Mw hydro power generated a month ago.
The hydro power output has got a major boost in last couple of weeks due to better post monsoon rainfalls. Between October 1 and 22, Odisha received 18 per cent excess rainfall than normal, against 31 per cent deficit recorded for all India. In the July-September monsoon period, it had recorded 4 per cent deficit than normal rainfall. Due to ample supply of water, major hydro power stations have reported better performance in October, data from Odisha Hydro Power Corporation (OHPC) said. All the major reservoirs have water levels either at the maximum level or a little below the upper limit, it said.Hydro power rates are much cheaper compared with electricity available from coal-fired thermal sources. Gridco usually buys around 15 per cent of its total power requirement of 3000 Mw from hydro power generators.
Officials said, due to ample hydro power availability, Gridco wants to keep cheaper power for the state and sell costlier thermal power outside to earn profit. However, due to poor demand and lack of transmission facility for supply of power, the trading has remained rather dull for some time now.“Gridco can sell 400 Mw power everyday provided there is corridor (power supply path) for us to do that. Due to power traffic issues, the rates have dropped to below Rs 3 per unit and hence, we hold our power sales some days,” said the Gridco official.However, with the winter season approaching, Gridco is expecting better demand and hopes to generate Rs 350 crore more, the official added.
Cost of power purchase is one of the highest expenditure incurred by Gridco, roughly eating away around 83 per cent of each rupee earned by the power trader, as per financial data provided by it for 2013-14. However, due to better rainfall last year, hydro power generation met as much as 35 per cent of total requirement, pushing Gridco’s profit by 51 per cent to Rs 48.25 crore.  In 2012-13, total revenue earned from power trading stood at Rs 413.55 crore, including Rs 14.8 crore income via trading through power exchanges. Gridco mostly sells power through bilateral agreements, which are long term power supply commitments.

HDFC Life eyes Rs 100 cr premium from online salesHDFC Life eyes Rs 100 cr premium from online sales
Jayajit Dash | Bhubaneswar Oct 24, 2014 08:19 PM IST
Leading private sector life insurer HDFC Standard Life Insurance Company Ltd is targeting Rs 100 crore premium from online sales of its insurance products in the current fiscal.
The company is betting big on the online platform to push growth, having launched an array of 15 online products in the last couple of months.
“Our mantra here is to Sell Online, Deliver Online, Service Online. Our Click2Invest plan is a best in class ULIP (Unit Linked Insurance Plan) available exclusively for online customers. It is a low cost plan that delivers everything that customers asked of us in terms of features. We also recently launched a new online term plan Click2Protect Plus that has richer features than its previous avatar Click2Protect”, Sanjay Tripathy, senior executive vice president (marketing, product, digital and e-commerce) said in an e-mailed response.
The company plans to roll out more products shortly, exclusively for its online customers.“To leverage the true disruptive potential that the digital medium offers, it becomes crucial to adapt your systems, processes and personnel to best suit its unique demands. This has led to many insurers to adopt, and rightly so, a vertically integrated SBU (strategic business unit) like structure to ensure a dedicated focus that allows for agility, responsiveness and efficient scale up. We were the first ones to do this”, said Tripathy.
Commenting on HDFC Life's premium growth, he said, “Total premium (in April-September period) grew by 21 per cent compared to the previous year, aided by all-round growth in first year individual premium (28 per cent), individual renewal premium (17 per cent) and group premium (21 per cent). The company maintained a balanced product mix during this period”.
In 2013-14, total premium collected by the company grew by seven per cent over the previous year to Rs 12,063 crore.HDFC Life has wiped off its accumulated losses in the first quarter (April-June) of 2014-15 and has posted a net profit of Rs 454 crore in the April-September period and an accumulated surplus of Rs 220 crore by the end of September.The life insurance industry in the country is projected to increase at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12-15 per cent in the next five years and insurance penetration levels are expected to rise to five per cent of the GDP (Gross Domestic Product) by 2020 from the current level of 3.2 per cent.
HDFC Life has ranked among the top three players in the private sector since 2009-10 on individual new business basis. The company's market among private sector life insurers has gone up from nine per cent in FY 10 to 14 per cent in FY 14.
The company recently forayed into the health insurance segment with the HDFC Health Assure Plan.

Six Assam men held in Burdwan blast case sent to judicial custodyNSG commandos investigates Burdwan blast case at Badshahi Road, in Burdwan on Friday. (Source: PTI)

Six men who were arrested by the Assam Police two weeks ago for their alleged connection with the explosion in Burdwan, West Bengal were sent to judicial custody by the Chief Judicial Magistrate (CJM) here on Friday.
The six men, Shaikhul Islam @ Abdullah (20), Rafikul Islam (39), Md. Shiraj Ali Khan (53), Jahuruddin (60), Golam Usmani (23) and Sarbesh Ali (35), hail from three different villages in Barpeta district. Among them, Shaikhul Islam alias Abdulla of Kahikuchi village in Barpeta is said to be an important member of the Jama’atul Mujahideen Bangladesh (Party of the Mujahideen) sleeper cell in Assam, the police said.
While the police had sought remand for two of them – Shaikhul Islam and Rafikul Islam – the CJM’s court rejected that plea and remanded all of them in judicial custody for two weeks. They will be required to be produced before the court again on November 5. Both Shaikhul Islam and Rafikul Islam are also said to have been a close associate of Shakil Ahmed, a JMB operative who was one of the two persons killed in the Burdwan blast on October 2.
Meanwhile, Assam Police director-general Khagen Sarma has said that the police have information that some youths from Assam were visiting Bangladesh at the instance of the JMB. “We have received information against some youths who have been visiting Bangladesh for getting training under the Islamic terror networks such as the JMB to carry out terror attacks,” Sarma said on Thursday. He also said the police have evidence against the six persons arrested in Barpeta and had kept them under surveillance till they were arrested on October 10.

Itd be crazy to do Harry Potter spin-off: Daniel RadcliffeActor Daniel Radcliffe says he cannot imagine at the moment about working on 'Harry Potter' spin-off trilogy as he finished the last instalment of the original just four years back.
By: Indo-Asian News Service | Los Angeles | Posted: October 24, 2014 8:36 pm
Actor Daniel Radcliffe says he cannot imagine at the moment about working on ‘Harry Potter’ spin-off trilogy as he finished the last instalment of the original just four years back.
Radcliffe, 25, who starred in the titular role in the ‘Harry Potter’ films, said it will be too much for him to sign on the three films, based on JK Rowling’s Potter book series ‘Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them’, reported Us magazine.
“At the moment the thought of signing on to another three would be crazy to me. It’s a lot to take on again so soon after he’s finished (Potter),” Radcliffe said.
The first instalment of this new spin-off is set for a November 2016 premiere. ‘Fantastic Beasts’ is set 70 years  prior to Potter’s story.

Beyonce  Jay Z renew wedding vows after six years of marriageBy: Press Trust of India | London | Posted: October 24, 2014 8:29 pm
Hollywood star couple Beyonce Knowles and Jay Z have reportedly renewed their wedding vows, six years after their marriage.
The ceremony, which took place during their tour of Europe where they were playing their On The Run tour, was said to be tiny and low key, reported the Daily Mirror
“Things have been difficult for them but they have worked hrough it. Now things are better than ever for them,” a source said about the Beyonce, 33, and Jay Z, who have a
two-year-old daughter, Blue Ivy.
“Their friends and families are now delighted that there has been a very happy ending to this whole sorry scenario. Both Beyonce and Jay-Z have put a lot of work into their
marriage and it has paid off. They are both over the moon,” the source added.
The pair’s marriage found itself in trouble when a video of Beyonce’s sister Solange attacking rap king Jay Z, 44, in a New York lift back in May went viral.
Footage of them arguing was leaked, but things became so nasty, Solange also tried to kick and hit her brother-in-law.
Fans were shocked and R’n’B’s golden couple found their marriage under staunch pressure. Rumours became rife that they would split following the end of their tour last month, however in public the pair always maintained their relationship was strong.

Panasonic launches 4K Varicam and Varicam HS production cameras in IndiaPanasonic has developed a next generation of P2 solid-state recording for these Varicam series products.
By: Tech Desk | New Delhi | Posted: October 24, 2014 8:28 pm | Updated: October 24, 2014 8:34 pm
Panasonic India has launched two new variants under its Varicam series of film production cameras – the Varicam HS and Varicam 35. The company has developed a next generation of P2 solid-state recording for these Varicam series products.
Specifically designed to capture 4K or high speed HD images, the expressP2 card offers transfer speeds (up to 2.4Gbps). The expressP2 card (AU-XP0256A) provides 72 minutes recording time in 4K/25p mode with high data reliability by containing a flash memory error correction system, equivalent to a RAID system, to recover from a failure.
Inherited from original Varicam series, the Varicam 35 features a V-Log gamma covering wide latitude 14+ stops. The camera also has the ability to simultaneously record in two different formats and codecs together with its in-camera colour grading function. The Varicam 35 incorporates a newly-developed super35mm MOS image sensor and images can be handled in variable frame rates up to 120 frames per second (fps). It can deliver a variety of recording formats, including 4K and UHD in AVC-ULTRA 4K, and 2K and 1080p HD in AVC-Intra 100.
Varicam HS provides smooth slow motion effects, by recording in 240fps HD, without a cache memory. With high speed 1080p image capture at up to 240fps, the Varicam HS camera is aimed at the production of extraordinary high-definition imagery, for the most demanding documentaries, sports or SFX slow-motion applications.

Microsoft drops Nokia name from Lumia smartp...Microsoft drops Nokia name from Lumia smartphones

US software giant Microsoft today said it will now start selling Lumia smartphones as 'Microsoft Lumia' device instead of calling them Nokia Lumia.

WASHINGTON: US software giant Microsoft today said it will now start selling Lumia smartphones as 'Microsoft Lumia' device instead of calling them Nokia Lumia.
"Our global and local websites are going through a transition as we speak and in the coming days our social channels will get a new name too - they will be called Microsoft Lumia," Microsoft's Senior Vice President of Marketing for Phones Tuula Rytila said on a blog.
"We have now started the transition from Nokia Lumia to Microsoft Lumia," the company said.
The move comes within 6 month of Microsoft acquiring Finnish telecom company Nokia's mobile device business for about $7.5 billion. The deal was completed on April 25, 2014.
Rytila did not share timeline for launching Lumia device without Nokia brand name but said "we are looking forward to unveiling a Microsoft Lumia device soon. This is of course a natural progression as all devices that once came from Nokia now come from Microsoft."
Microsoft, however, will retain Nokia brand name for entry level phones.
"Microsoft will continue to sell Nokia-branded, entry-level category of phones, such as the Nokia 130. We have licensed the Nokia brand for such devices," Rytila said.
Microsoft has a 10-year license to use the Nokia brand on current and subsequently developed mobile phones from the date it acquired Finnish mobile devices company.

At least 824 000 displaced by Ukraine crisis...At least 430,000 people had been displaced within Ukraine as of Thursday, according to the UNHCR refugee agency, up 170,000 since early September.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
ENEVA: The conflict in Ukraine has driven more than 824,000 people from their homes, but the real number could be far higher, the United Nations said on Friday, as it scrambled aid to offset the impact of winter.
At least 430,000 people had been displaced within Ukraine as of Thursday, according to the UNHCR refugee agency, up 170,000 since early September.
"With the crisis in Ukraine entering its first winter, UNHCR is racing to help some of the most vulnerable displaced people cope with expected harsh winter conditions," UNHRC spokesman Adrian Edwards told reporters.
But he said the real picture is still emerging. "Ongoing fighting in the east, and the resulting breakdown of basic services, continues to drive more people from their homes," Edwards said.
Most are living in rented accommodation or staying with family or friends, but up to 18,700 are in improvised shelters which need weather-proofing, Edwards said.
Ukrainian government troops have been battling pro-Russian separatists since they rose up in April, after mass protests in the ex-Soviet republic ousted Moscow-friendly president Viktor Yanukovych.
More than 3,700 people have been killed since April, according to UN figures. In addition to people displaced within Ukraine, another 387,000 have fled to Russia, Edwards said, citing official figures from Moscow.
The actual number in Russia may be far higher, given that Ukrainians do not need visas to travel there, Edwards said. Many Ukrainians have also headed westwards, either to the European Union or former Soviet republics such as Belarus.
In addition, an estimated 17,000 people have fled Crimea, the strategic Black Sea peninsula mainly populated by Russian-speakers which was annexed by Moscow in March.

The Democrats midterm turnout problem -- in 6 chartsThe Post's graphics team has a great new tool allowing you to compare turnout between presidential election and midterm elections among a whole bunch of different demographics.
We encourage you to play with it here, and below we'll offer a few observations.
This chart, better than just about anything, shows Democrats midterm problem -- specifically how their party base, while good for presidential elections, isn't exactly conducive to winning the non-presidential elections in-between.
Let's compare the midterm drop-off among the key parts of the so-called "Obama coalition" to more GOP-friendly groups.
Young people (who President Obama won by 23 points)...
... compared to senior citizens (who went for Mitt Romney by 12 points).
Now, switching to race, here are African Americans (who are almost exclusively Democratic voters)...
... compared to white voters (Romney +20).
And, lastly, here's another key portion of the so-called "Obama coalition" -- unmarried women (Obama +36)...
... compared to the inverse (and Romney +22), married men.
 
The differences in some of these cases (particularly race) are slight, but they are real and consistent. And in tight elections that are decided by a few points, a couple points in turnout difference in a key demographic or two can make the difference between winning and losing.
This is Democrats' big challenge come Nov. 4.

The top skills people list on their LinkedIn profiles  mapped out by cityBy Hunter Schwarz October 24 Follow @hunterschwarz
The top skill sets by city, according to LinkedIn. (via LinkedIn )
Using data from its users in the United States, LinkedIn mapped out the top skill sets uniquely found in cities across the country.
The map reinforces some commonly held notions about certain cities. In New York, the top skill is trading and investment, in Los Angeles, it’s TV and video production, and in the San Francisco Bay, it’s cloud and distributed computing.

Skills further down the list are also revealing. As the center of country music, Nashville, Tenn., is well represented by music production, it’s also a hub for health-care management and theology. Provo, Utah’s top skill is SEO marketing, but as home to BYU and a large Mormon population, some of whom served as foreign-language missionaries for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, foreign language translation also ranks high. And Atlanta’s reputation as a corporate headquarters shows through with its laundry list of business skills.

Hero MotoCorp plans to launch 2 new models in next one year
PTI
Tweet
New Delhi, Oct 17:  
Seeking to cash in on the fast growing scooter segment in the domestic market, the country’s largest two-wheeler maker Hero MotoCorp plans to launch two new models in the next one year.
The company is also considering to scale up its monthly scooter production capacity to 1 lakh units by January 2015 and 1.5 lakh units in the mid-term.
“In the next one year, there will be two new scooter models in the market,” Hero MotoCorp Senior Vice-President & CFO Ravi Sud told analysts in a conference call.
While he did not elaborate on the segmentation of the new scooters, Sud said it would add to the company’s existing models — Pleasure and Maestro — to accelerate growth in the scooter segment.
Domestic sales
Scooter sales in India grew 32.11 per cent during the April-September period at 21,90,351 units this fiscal against 16,57,920 units in the year-ago period.
In the first half of the ongoing fiscal, Hero MotoCorp had posted a growth of 5.52 per cent in scooter sales at 3,52,330 units against 3,33,889 units in the same period last fiscal.
Sud said that the company’s domestic scooter sales did not reflect the actual growth as Hero MotoCorp had committed its capacity to execute a one-time export order of 45,000 units by the beginning of November.
Production capacity
Seeing further growth in the scooter segment, the company would be enhancing its scooter production capacity.
“Currently we have a capacity to produce 80,000 units per month, which we are scaling up to one lakh units by January 2015. The consideration is to take it to 1.35-1.5 lakh units in the mid-term,” Sud said.
He said the one lakh scooters capacity would come from the existing plants of the company.
“When we increase it to 1.5 lakh units a month, it could also include the scooter capacity from the upcoming plant in Gujarat,” Sud said.
Currently, Hero MotoCorp produces its scooters from Gurgaon and Dharuhera plants.
Sales growth
He said scooter penetration in India is expected to increase to around 32-33 per cent from the current 27 per cent. Scooter sales growth has been urban-led where the penetration is 40 per cent, which can go up to 45 per cent.
The company has a total two-wheeler production capacity of 7.65 million units annually from its plants at Gurgaon, and Dharuhera in Haryana, Haridwar in Uttarakhand and Neemrana in Rajasthan. By next year, it would add another 1.8 million units annually when its fifth plant at Halol in Gujarat becomes operational.
The company is planning to set up its sixth plant in Andhra Pradesh.

Luxury brands prefer to stay away from e-commerce sitesLuxury brands prefer to stay away from e-commerce sites
Purvita Chatterjee
Cutting edge Being a bridge-to-luxury crystal brand, Swarovski cannot risk being a discounted brand.
Believe discounts will erode image
Mumbai, October 23:  
Even as pure play e-commerce sites bend backwards to offer deep discounts, some brands have been keeping away from the action, refusing to mark down their products.
Luxury and bridge-to-luxury brands such as Celio, Swarovski and Zegna are willing to jump onto the e-commerce bandwagon, but on their own terms. These brands feel that discounting would erode their premium image among consumers.
Calling the shots
“We should be in a position to control our prices so there will be no third-party sites. There are plans to start online transactions under our own site like we do worldwide, but there will be no discounts. Prices will be similar to our brick-and-mortar outlets,” says Sukanya Dutta Roy, MD, Consumer Goods Business, Swarovski India.
Being a bridge-to-luxury crystal brand, Swarovski cannot risk being a discounted brand. Its managers feel the brand should not be seen on pure play e-commerce sites.
Reliance Brands, too, has decided to stay away from selling most if its luxury brands on third-party Websites. “Mainstream consumers do not shop from luxury sites. We have limited e-commerce operations to just two of our brands like Quicksilver and Steve Madden. We have not yet taken a decision to bring the rest of our portfolio of brands on the e-commerce platform” says Darshan Mehta, CEO, Reliance Brands.
None of Reliance Brands’ iconic brands such as Timberland, Diesel, Ermenegildo Zegna and Paul & Shark are available on any Indian e-commerce sites as of now.
Given their premium offering, luxury brands insist that they do not like the idea of being treated like commodities. However, there are some international brands present on e-commerce sites. They do not have a choice, and are not allowed to go it alone because of the laws governing single-brand retail.
“We resort to third-party online sites to sell some of our products. We have to be FDI approved to start our own e-commerce operations,” explains Rajiv Nair, CEO, Celio Future Fashions. Though the brand is present on some leading Websites, Nair says: “Ideally, we would like to bring down discounts to a minimum. Once we have our own site, it will reflect the prices are offered at our brick-and-mortar stores.”
Touch and feel
Says Anjana Sharma, COO and Fashion Director, Stylista, a fashion portal: “Luxury brands are about experience, customisation, touch and feel… unlike the rest of the brands, which prefer to go online to get volumes.
Incidentally, most brands having their own e-commerce portals prefer to have similar prices as their offline counterparts. As Nair says: “Even the website belonging to Madura Garments has similar prices as their brick-and-mortar stores.”

Three House Dems  three proposals for net neutrality. Heres what they look like.By Brian Fung October 23 Follow @b_fung
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Rep. Anna Eshoo  join Yelp CEO Jeremy Stoppelman for a tour and policy discussion at Yelp Headquarters in San Francisco. ( speakerpelosi )
Rep. Anna Eshoo is urging federal regulators to oversee Internet providers using Title II of the Communications Act — a move that would give the Federal Communications Commission more latitude to prevent the sort of traffic discrimination net neutrality advocates say would hurt the open Internet.
In a letter to the FCC  this week, the California Democrat said the agency could selectively apply only those parts of the law that deal with reasonable rates and unjust discrimination — what are known as Sections 201 and 202. The rest of the law, she said, could be waived under a process known as "forbearance." (My colleague Nancy Scola has a good overview of what that means .)
"It is true that some of these laws do apply only to telephone services," said Eshoo, referring to Title II's historical role in regulating phone companies like AT&T. "But others are the source of timeless principles that can and do apply to all two-way telecom services, including broadband."
Eshoo's proposal tracks closely with one by her colleague, Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.). In an earlier letter to the FCC, Lofgren also called for a mix of Title II and forbearance — while leaning on another part of the law that could help the FCC make a stronger case for forbearance. In striking down much of the FCC's original net neutrality rules this year, a federal court granted the agency a little more authority under what's called Section 706.
Section 706, found under Title I of the FCC's congressional charter, is how the agency could regulate broadband under new net neutrality rules. Some advocates have been pushing for the FCC to rely primarily on its Section 706 authority to draft the new regulations, but consumer groups argue that won't be enough.
A third proposal by another California Democrat, Rep. Henry Waxman , also relies on Title II, but advances an alternative that waives the very provisions  of the law that Eshoo's letter says are the most important — the language against "unjust discrimination." This may sound counterintuitive, but Waxman appears to agree with industry officials' arguments that the phrase "unjust discrimination" actually could still allow Internet fast lanes — if broadband providers can claim that the discrimination is a "just" and reasonable practice.
"Indeed, section 201(b) expressly permits the creation of 'different classes of communications' with different charges so long as they are deemed 'just and reasonable' by the Commission," Waxman wrote in a letter to the agency, adding that the FCC has already "permitted tiered pricing structures based on volume and term discounts, different levels of quality of service" and other factors that could set a precedent for Internet fast lanes.
So, Waxman is proposing regulating broadband under Title II, but waiving Sections 201 and 202, along with much of the rest of Title II. But why does he even bother with Title II in the first place if he throws so much of it out?
To understand, we have to go back to this year's court decision. The D.C. Circuit said the FCC's old net neutrality rules were invalid because they imposed rules on Internet providers that could only be applied to "common carriers" regulated under Title II (remember that Internet providers are currently regulated under Title I). The wall between Title I services and Title II services is pretty strong, but Waxman's idea would knock down that wall for broadband providers, technically putting them under Title II. Then, rather than actually regulating the Internet providers using Title II requirements, the FCC would draw up new requirements based on Section 706.
That's a lot to digest. But we now have three House Democrats all promoting variations on the same idea: Use the most well-worn part of the FCC's authority to deal with a relatively novel problem.

10 Money Things You Must Know After 50reddit
Birthdays that mark a new decade tend to prompt personal reassessment: In your 20s, starting your career may have been your focus. In your 30s and 40s, maybe it was the big goals you wanted to reach with your family.
But by 50, you may already feel like you've got it figured out. You make a good salary, you've reached many of your life goals and your kids are on their way to independence.
But there are still a lot of money truths left to learn, especially as you're approaching your retirement years. Plus, times are changing: What was a financial truism in your youth may not be the reality now.
So we asked several CFPs to reveal 10 crucial things that could affect your money once you enter your 50s, both the bright spots and the potential pitfalls. Read on to see where you might need to be better prepared.
1. The cost of long-term care insurance
While it may not be the most pleasant thing to think about, how you plan to cover potential eldercare costs like a nursing home or a home health aide should be on your radar, stat. Long-term care insurance can help pay for so-called "custodial care" services like those, which are often not covered by Medicare -- but the longer you wait to buy a policy, the more expensive it's likely to be.
"It's something to start thinking about even prior to age 50," says Chuck Roberts, CFP®, founder and C.E.O. of Financial Freedom Planners in Richmond, Virginia. "It becomes more expensive as you grow older."
According to 2012 data from the American Association for Long-Term Care Insurance, a couple taking out a policy at age 55 will pay an average of $2,466 a year, while a couple who waits until they're 60 will pay $3,381. But some health conditions -- a stroke or metastatic cancer, for example -- can make you ineligible to purchase such a policy in the first place. So it can be wise to look into a policy now, while you're in good health.
2. You're likely not going to stay an empty nester
Got grand plans to build a wet bar in your basement? Not so fast. "Unless [your child] is a shark on Wall Street, he may need some help from his parents," says Brian Mahany, CFP®, principal at Sustainable Financial Planning in Toledo, Ohio. "I am definitely seeing some parents converting their basements for their kids to live in."
Pew Research data reveals that the percentage of 25- to 34-year-olds living in "multigenerational" households rose from 11 percent in 1980 to 21.6 percent in 2010. And only 48 percent of these so-called Boomerang kids pay rent to their parents. "A great many parents feel honor-bound to help their children," says Mahany. "They're not giving their kids any kind of lease."
3. And you may still have to pay for your children's health insurance
Recent grads are having a hard time in the job market:  One study by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York estimates that 44 percent of recent grads are underemployed, meaning that they work in jobs that don't require a college degree -- which also likely means they aren't getting the perks that a good job normally brings, like insurance.
On top of that, they are graduating with a lot of debt, which tends to leave little money left to cover their bills, let alone health care. "With the student debt load kids are carrying, I have seen more instances of parents bringing kids back into the family health plan," says Mahany.
According to Healthcare.gov , children under 26 may be eligible for coverage under their parents' health insurance plan even if they're married, not living at home and attending school. Keeping your kids on your insurance may only amount to a few extra dollars a month for you, but it's still an extra cost that you'll have to budget for -- on top of the fact that they've taken over the basement.

4. You should consider making credit card debt a thing of the past
"By the time you're 50, you should be out of revolving debt, such as credit card purchases," Roberts says. That money would probably be better off helping you prepare for retirement -- plus, when you're ready to enter your golden years, you don't want a debt burden during a time when you're no longer earning a salary.
Unfortunately, debt has been steadily rising amongst people of retirement age: According to recently released  research by the National Center for Policy Analysis, in 1989 the average credit card balance for people ages 65 to 74 was $2,100, compared with $6,000 in 2010.
If paying down credit card debt is something you still need to work toward in your 50s, you can use our checklist to help you get started.

5. It's a good time to start thinking about where you want retire
Especially if you don't plan on staying in your current home, you should ask yourself where you might want to settle down, whether it's a ranch house in Tucson or a condo in Miami Beach.
That's because where you eventually relocate will likely have an impact on how you're saving for retirement now. For example, you may need to ask yourself, "Do I really have enough to take on a new mortgage 15 years down the line? Does my current savings plan take into consideration a change in cost of living? How retiree-friendly -- or not -- is the state I'm thinking of moving to?"
And get as granular as you need to, even down to the type of home. "People should [even] think about what kind of house they want to live in: Is it a single story or multiple story?" Mahany says. All those details may help you determine what you'll end up paying for housing in your dream retirement locale.
6. Your life insurance needs may change
If your children are grown and independent, and if you have enough savings to provide for a spouse in the event of your death, you may decide that you no longer need as much term-life insurance coverage as you used to have, or you may need it only for a shorter period of time.
"In [your 50s], some of the heavy living expenses that life insurance provides for families in case of a premature death are lessened at that age," Roberts says, so it may be a good time to reassess what costs you'd need insurance to cover.
That's for term life insurance. Permanent life insurance -- like a whole life policy, for example -- has an added investment component that could potentially grow in value, and which you may be able to borrow against. Whether you decide to keep that type of policy will probably depend on whether you still see value in it as an investment vehicle, says William Bregman, a CFP® who practices in New York City.
For most people, however, term life insurance may be sufficient, and you can get coverage up until age 80. Whole life insurance generally is more often used if you're concerned about estate taxes or want to leave behind a legacy for your family. Because permanent life policies are often more difficult to understand -- and usually carry higher premiums -- it's important to consult with your insurance agent or a CFP® to determine whether a permanent life policy makes sense for you.

7. You don't have to worry about Social Security collapsing
Yes, the Social Security Administration has stated that , by 2035, taxes will be able to cover only 75 percent of scheduled benefits. But older Americans have a brighter Social Security future than their younger counterparts. "Confidence that Social Security will continue to provide benefits that are at least equal to today's value is higher among workers ages 45 and older than among younger workers," according to EBRI's 2014 Retirement Confidence Survey .
Why? Because even small tweaks to Social Security [policies] could secure it well into the future, according to Sylvia Allegretto, a labor economist with the Institute for Research on Labor & Employment at University of California, Berkeley. "Before the first Social Security check went out, people called for its demise, said it would fail," says Allegretto. "Yet not one person has ever had a missed Social Security check."
RELATED: Will Social Security Be Gone Before I Retire?
8. Retirement doesn't mark the end of your career
Even when you call it quits from your current job, your knowledge and experience could still be in demand -- and help earn you some additional money in your later years.
"I've had some nice good-news conversations with a client in his 60s, who found out he could retire right now if he wanted," says Roberts. "He's in the engineering profession and could easily do some additional consulting, which could add to savings."
Indeed if you've had a long career in the knowledge sector -- accounting, medicine, law, etc. -- you could very well extend your working years with a consulting side gig. According to 2013 data from the Associated Press NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, 82 percent of Americans over the age of 50 expect to work in some capacity after retirement.

9. You can contribute more to retirement than you used to
Feel a little behind in your retirement savings? The good news is that turning 50 means you're eligible to make a "catch-up contribution" of $5,500 to your 401(k) plan. That's over and above the $17,500 that the IRS allows anyone younger than 50 to contribute to a 401(k) now.
You also get to play catch-up with your IRA too -- you can contribute an extra $1,000, for a total of $6,500.
10. It's never too late to save for retirement
"At 50 you can still take great advantage of compounding interest" in your retirement portfolio, says Roberts. He notes that while you may have a different asset allocation than you would have had at, say, 30, the fact is that  compound returns  take effect no matter when you start.
In fact, many financial planners complain about clients who don't seek help mapping out their retirement until they reach their 60s. "When anyone comes to me thinking about retirement by their 50s," says Mahany, "I'm very happy."

India  Aus must take initiative to set WI house in orderWest Indies' decline has a bit to do with the ineptitude of their management.
Written by Harsha Bhogle | Posted: October 24, 2014 10:43 am
Scorn-worthy as some of their actions might be, it helps no one at all to heap further scorn on West Indies cricket administration. Nor would it help saddling them with a huge financial liability for that would only end up earning their players lesser and driving them away from West Indies cricket and towards a pay-as-you-go form of cricket. I believe it is time to hold hands and show West Indies cricket the way ahead and it is imperative that India and Australia lead this initiative.
West Indies cricket has always been very poorly managed. Their decline as a cricketing power on the field has at least a bit to do with the ineptitude of their management off it. Products go through bad times but weak managements hasten that process. We always got the feeling that West Indies cricket was sitting on a tinderbox, that a strike or a revolt was round the corner. It would be interesting to ask their players how often, in the last fifteen years, they were genuinely happy playing for the West Indies. Mistrust might be the dominant theme of their cricket in recent years. It cannot produce strong teams.
That is why I believe this is a localised flare-up, unlikely to spread to any other part of the cricket world. The implications though are wider, immediately affecting India but in the short term likely to impact South African cricket and the World Cup. Post their reduced income last year from a shortened India tour, a weak West Indies team or, in the worst case, a no-show would hit South Africa further and I won’t be surprised if someone in the cricket administration there isn’t already working on a Plan B. And while few would give the West Indies a healthy chance of winning the World Cup, they provide decent opposition in limited overs cricket. For what is essentially a small sport, losing a team isn’t an option.
While the rest of the world cannot help make the West Indies a better cricket team, they can help them manage their administration better. I believe the West Indies have a decent product and if the game does move towards shorter forms, the product they offer would become more valuable.
Similar problems
In the world of business it is not unknown to have someone from outside come in and help streamline processes and managing sport is a business like any other. Hence, my suggestion that India and Australia help out with the administration; specifically with things like handling players, valuing their abilities, sharing wealth and negotiating contracts. Australia, in recent times, have had their players and administration arrayed against each other too, both sides have been feisty and determined, a strike has been whispered about loudly enough for people to hear but inevitably a solution continued…

Ericsson s India revenue grows 56% as telcos ramp up data networksEricsson's India revenue grows 56% as telcos ramp up data networks
Our Bureau
Hans Vestberg
New Delhi, Oct 24:  
Swedish telecom equipment maker Ericsson has reported a 56 per cent growth in revenues from India, making it the highest growing region for the company worldwide. Sales in India grew to 2 billion (SEK) Swedish Kronor or Rs 1,685 crore in the third quarter of 2014 from 1.28 billion SEK in the corresponding quarter last year. India, which accounts for 4 per cent of the company’s global revenue, now ranks number four behind the US, China, and Japan.
“Since the end of last year, sales in the region has recovered, mainly driven by an increase in operator capital expenditure spending in response to greater data uptake. The year-on-year growth in support solutions is driven by OSS and BSS and TV & media,” the company said.
(OSS and BSS are software solutions that enable telecom service providers to manage their networks, their business and their customer relations.)
Ericsson’s Chief Executive Hans Vestberg said the investment climate in India continues to improve.
The performance in India, China, West Asia and Russia helped Ericsson to grow its global revenue to 57.6 billion Swedish kronor ($7.94 billion) in the quarter, up 9 per cent from 53 billion kronor a year ago.

Suicide bomber threat to Air India flights  four major airports on alertBomb threat puts India's airports on alert
HT Correspondents , Hindustan Times  New Delhi/Thiruvananthapuram: , October 24, 2014
First Published: 13:16 IST(24/10/2014) | Last Updated: 00:59 IST(25/10/2014)
Comments
Airports across the country have been put on high alert after the Airport Authority of India (AAI) received a letter saying the Kochi- Mumbai and Ahmedabad - Mumbai flights would be attacked on October 25 and 26. Reports suggest suicide bombers could board the planes in the early hours of the morning.
Security at Kochi, Mumbai and Ahmedabad airports has been tightened with enhanced screening of passengers and rigorous anti-sabotage checks. Ground staff of AAI have been sensitised about the threat and aircraft are being more meticulously sanitised.
At Kochi airport, Rapid Action Force personnel have been deployed with extra policemen frisking passengers and checking luggage. Access to the airport has also been restricted.
 “We received information from Kolkata that there is a threat to the Mumbai-Kochi flight on Oct 25. We are on high alert,” said Kochi airport director A K C Nair.
A security source said the letter – most likely an act of mischief --- was received about a week back at one of AAI’s offices and led to elaborate security arrangements.
“All such threats are taken seriously, even if it is the act of some mischief monger,” said a security official.

Martha Coakley is in deep trouble in Massachusetts (again)By Jose A. DelReal October 24 Follow jdelreal
Massachusetts gubernatorial candidate Democrat Martha Coakley is trailing GOP rival Charlie Baker by 9 percent, a new poll finds. (AP Photo/Steven Senne)
Democratic gubernatorial candidate Martha Coakley is trailing GOP rival Charlie Baker by 9 percentage points in the deep blue Bay State, raising memories of her deeply flawed 2010 Senate bid just a week and a half before Election Day.
A new Boston Globe poll released Friday suggests Baker is pulling 45 percent support to Coakley's 36 percent among likely voters, the widest margin any poll has shown for either candidate since September. A poll released last week had the two neck-to-neck, with 41 percent support each.
“There is just positive movement in every single metric we can ask around Baker,” SocialSphere executive John Della Volpe, who conducted the poll, told the Globe. “The more voters have gotten to know him, the stronger he performs.”
The Democratic establishment in Massachusetts largely threw its support behind Coakley's gubernatorial bid. Both Hillary Rodham Clinton and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) are slated to appear with Coakley this morning in Boston.
The survey of 500 likely voters in the Bay state was conducted by telephone between Oct. 19 and 22. The margin of error for the poll is plus or minus 4.4 percentage points.

PMs flood-relief package draws flak from Kashmir political partiesPolitical parties in Kashmir slammed Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Rs. 745-crore relief package for the flood-hit state on Friday, saying it was a “cruel joke” and fell way short of expectations after the worst flooding in decades.
Advertisement
Kashmiris were expecting a Rs. 44,000 crore-package during Modi’s Diwali visit to help rehabilitate thousands of people who lost their homes in the devastating floods, but the prime minister earmarked a far lower Rs. 570 crore for renovation of flood-hit houses. The rest was to rebuild six hospitals in the state.
``I have come to the state today to show solidarity with people of the state. I  have always maintained that the calamity is not only for the people of the state, it is a calamity for the entire country. The nation stands with the people of the valley,'' the prime minister said on Thursday when he met delegations of flood-affected people, traders, Sikh and Pandit groups as well as representatives of various political parties.
But political parties were not impressed, with the Congress party describing the package as “a cruel joke”.
"Modi's announcement is like adding insult to the injury. It showed his casual approach to give a helping hand to the people ravaged by the severest flood in their recorded history," said Jammu and Kashmir Pradesh Congress Committee chief Saifuddin Soz.
The ruling National Congress and chief minister Omar Abdullah were also disappointed with the relief package.
“If it's the final relief amount, then we are disappointed. We are hopeful to get Rs. 44,000 crore as proposed by us. Besides the housing sector, our private sector and infrastructure need impetus," said National Conference spokesman Junaid Azim Mattu.
The BJP hit out at the Congress and the National Conference, saying they were trying to politicise every issue.
“The two parties do not understand the pain and grief of those who have lost their family, homes and what not. The PM went there to share their grief, but the Congress had problem with that as well. This shows their negative state of mind,” said BJP spokesman Anil Baluni.
“Our government is committed to proper and adequate relief and rehabilitation exercise there, irrespective of the cynicism of our political opponents.”
Separatists, who organised a shutdown during the prime minister’s trip, described the visit as "politically motivated" and aimed at assembly elections due by early next year. The Bharatiya Janata Party is hoping to expand its support beyond the Hindu-majority region of Jammu to the Muslim-majority Valley and is aiming for 44 seats in the 87-member assembly.
"The real aim of the visit to Kashmir was to further his political interests in the wake of the sham assembly elections. He was not even remotely concerned about the sufferings and hardships faced by the Kashmiris," said moderate Hurriyat chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq.
Muslim Conference head Shabir Ahmad Dar, a constituent of the moderate faction of the Hurriyat led by Shabir Ahmad Shah, said the prime minister's visit was intended to only meet the armed forces in Siachen.
"The relief amount is so small that it cannot rehabilitate even a mohalla, forget Kashmir," he said.

Peace with China not at cost of honour: RajnathComments
Home minister Rajnath Singh on Friday said that India wants peace with China but that cannot come at the cost of honour.
"We want peace with honour. Peace cannot come at the cost of honour," he said, referring to the recent border row with China.
"Pride is the ultimate accomplishment of a human being, of mine and yours," he said, addressing the 53rd raising day function of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) , which guards the Sino-Indian border.
Singh said Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made it clear that New Delhi wants to maintain peaceful relations with all its neighbouring countries and wanted to resolve border issues peacefully.
"Our Prime Minister has told the Chinese president and requested him that if there is a dispute we should talk," he said.
The home minister said China often raises question over the border and even had raised objections when India wanted to improve border infrastructure within its own territory.
Referring to Pakistan, the home minister said the neighbouring country should stop firing on border posts and civilian areas.
He said Pakistan had fired upon the civilian areas along the border in Jammu and Kashmir just a day before Diwali.
"When we get to know about ceasefire violations done by Pakistan or there is some dispute in the context of India-China border, we feel hurt and we feel angered.
"Pakistan fired on civilians even on the eve of Diwali festival and they did not even spare our festival. Pakistan should be wary of this. I want to tell Pakistan to stop this continuous violation of ceasefire," he said.

Boko Haram may have kidnapped more girlsBy Adam Taylor October 24 Follow @mradamtaylor
People demonstrate in Abuja, Nigeria, on Oct. 14, calling on the Nigerian government to rescue girls taken from a secondary school in the Chibok region. (Olamikan Gbemiga/AP)
While it captured the attention of the world six months ago, #BringBackOurGirls  — the online campaign to free 200 Nigerian school girls kidnapped by the extremist Boko Haram group — has faded from view almost as fast as it appeared. Here's just one depressing chart illustrating this (there are many more):
There are many reasons for this, but one important one was that it was tough to keep the public interested in the protracted, messy and ultimately complicated negotiations that  the Nigerian government entered into to free the girls, who were kidnapped from their school in the northeastern town of Chibok.
For a good example of the messy nature of these negotiations, look no further than the events of the past week.
First, there was a glimmer of hope: Last Friday, Nigeria said that Boko Haram had agreed to a cease-fire , and that there could soon be talks to free some or all of the girls. “I can say with some optimism, cautious optimism, that were are moving toward a situation where we’d be able to, in the very near future, to be able to get back our girls," Nigeria’s Foreign Minister Aminu Wali told reporters.
However, less than a week later, things appeared to have soured. Not only were there reports that Boko Haram was still fighting past the cease-fire, there were also multiple reports that Boko Haram militants had pulled off another large-scale kidnapping.  On Thursday, the BBC reported  that "dozens" of women and children from two villages in Nigeria's northeastern Adamawa state had been kidnapped. Other reports put the number of those kidnapped at 60.
The reported kidnapping has led to further skepticism about the Nigerian government's talk of a cease-fire and hopes for the release of the original Chibok girls. "We are confused that hours after the so-called cease-fire agreement has been entered between the federal government and Boko Haram insurgents, our girls were abducted by the insurgents," John Kwaghe, a witness to the attack who lost three daughters, told Reuters .
Some explanation was offered Friday by officials from Chad, the neighboring nation that was mediating the talks between Boko Haram and the Nigerian government. Moussa Mahamat Dago, the No. 2 official at Chad's foreign ministry, said that he believed that while some Boko Haram factions were refusing to abide by the deal, he saw no reason to believe that the broader talks had collapsed.  "What I can say is that those that negotiated with the Nigerian government did so in good faith," Dago told Reuters . "We are waiting for the next phase, which is the release of the girls."
It means further anguish for relatives of the original girls kidnapped, who have frequently complained about a lack of communication from Nigeria's government. It may also be a worrying sign for the talks. Dago disclosed to Reuters that Boko Haram was seeking the release of its fighters imprisoned by the Nigerian state in return for the girls. But if all Boko Haram factions won't agree to the deal, what hope is there?

Sonia  Rahul should speak more; non-Gandhi can be Congress chief  saysChidambaram'Black money embarrasses individuals, not party'
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, October 24, 2014

Amid speculation that the list of names of black money account holders could include a former UPA minister, ex-finance minister P Chidambaram on Friday said such individual transgressions should not embarrass the Congress as the party had not authorised him to keep that account.
“If there is a name of a former minister it will embarrass that person. He is not keeping that account for the party. These are individual transgressions, individual violations of the law, the individual should be embarrassed. Why should the party be embarrassed?” he told NDTV in an interview.
Chidambaram was responding to finance minister Arun Jaitley’s remarks that the Congress will be embarrassed once the names of people holding illicit foreign accounts are made public.
He also reiterated that Congress president Sonia Gandhi and vice-president Rahul Gandhi should “speak more” to the public and the media.
Asked if a non-Gandhi could become the Congress president, he said, “I think so. Someday yes”, but was quick to add, “I do not know” when asked about its timeline.
 Chidambaram also said the reorganisation of the party was due for the larger task of being an “effective, strong, robust and true opposition” to the government.

What does the candy you give out for Halloween say about youBy Joe Heim October 24 Follow @JoeHeim
My favorite book about candy came out 10 years ago. “Candyfreak,” by Steve Almond — a byline in search of a subject if there ever was one — is a must-have hymnal for anyone who worships confection in all its forms. For a story a few years back, I asked Almond about what the candy you give out for Halloween says about you. He agreed to muse on this as long as I made clear that he was a “professional candyfreak, not a therapist.” Fair enough. Here’s what Almond, whose most recent book is “Against Football: One Fan’s Reluctant Manifesto,” had to say about candy brands and what they say about the people who hand them out to trick-or-treaters.

Forecasting the Brazilian electionComments
By Francisco Cantú and Marco Morales October 24
“Aécio” — a poster for presidential candidate Aécio Neves in Lapa, central Rio de Janeiro, with posters for allies Luiz Paulo and Otavio Leite. (Dom Phillips for The Washington Post)
Joshua Tucker: The following is a guest post from political scientists  Francisco Cantú (University of Houston) and Marco A. Morales (Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México) as part of our continuing series of Monkey Cage Election Reports .
*****
The runoff in the presidential election in Brazil will take place this weekend between the incumbent President Dilma Roussef (PT) and challenger Aécio Neves (PSDB). According to the conventional wisdom, the runoff is supposedly too close to call. Even the endorsement of Neves by the third-place candidate on the general election, Marina Silva (PSB), did not change that.
But in an all-too-familiar scenario, the accuracy of the polls has been questioned . Even the British weekly the Economist was quick to point to the difficulty of predicting the outcome of the general election in Brazil. In their view, the few (roughly 40) surveys published during the three months of the presidential campaign and the limited number of elections (six in total) since the return of democracy in 1989, make forecasting of Brazilian elections particularly hard.
Final polls on the eve of the vote gave a slight edge to incumbent Dilma Rousseff, who is in a tight race against Aecio Neves, a 54-year-old former state governor. (Reuters)
In our view, with only four polling firms publishing their survey estimates during the campaign, we should not so much be concerned with ease of forecast but with the extent of potential biases in public poll estimates. Having fewer pollsters might raise the stakes for presenting skewed numbers, but it also provides fewer opportunities for each pollster to “check” their numbers against their peers’. But on the positive side, a healthy competition among pollsters might just be the necessary ingredient to foster good polling.
All of this becomes particularly relevant in the context of the “polling crises” that have been reported recently in various countries, including in other recent Latin American presidential elections such as Mexico in 2012, Honduras in 2013, or El Salvador, Costa Rica and Colombia in 2014.
This, then, begs the question: How did Brazilian pollsters perform in the first stage of the election? To answer that question, we deployed a statistical model that allows us to estimate the true vote intention throughout the general election, and use this information to calculate the systematic bias of each pollster. This is similar to what Simon Jackman used in his analysis of “house effects” for the 2004 Australian federal election, or what Drew Linzer used to forecast the Electoral College votes in the 2012 U.S. presidential election. In our case, we used all polls published in Brazil starting in early February of this year and ending with the last published surveys before the election. (Full details of the model can be found here .)
Brazilian electoral legislation requires pollsters to publish vote estimates for all candidates, as well as null and don’t-know votes. It also compels pollsters to publish a brief methodological summary and file it with the electoral authority. Having this information readily available allowed us to separate signal from noise and track true vote intention for each candidate throughout the campaign and its associated 95 percent credible interval. Our task is facilitated by the fact that we know the actual result of the general election.
Looking at these estimates, it would be hard to make the case that either the World Cup (June 12–July 13) or even the strident defeat of the Brazilian national team before Germany (July 8) had any noticeable effect on vote intent for Roussef. But we can say that the tragic death of PSB candidate Eduardo Campos and the entry of Marina Silva to substitute for him was a game changer in the election for a brief period.
Figure: Francisco Cantú and Marco A. Morales/The Monkey Cage; Data: Datafolha, Ibope, Vox Populi and MDA.
Since we have a very good idea of how vote intent for each candidate moved throughout the campaign, we can also compute the systematic error with which each pollster estimated each candidate throughout the campaign. Results appear in the graph below, which shows the distributions of systematic error throughout the campaign that is independent from sampling error. Distributions appearing on the positive (right) side of the graph imply that a pollster tended to overestimate a candidate throughout the campaign, and distributions on the negative (left) side imply underestimation.
Figure: Francisco Cantú and Marco A. Morales/The Monkey Cage; Data: Datafolha, Ibope, Vox Populi and MDA.
Now we can answer the initial question: How did Brazilian pollsters do in the general election campaign? In general terms, we see a mixed bag. Vote intent for Dilma Roussef seems to have been systematically overestimated, although some firms performed better than others. Curiously enough, despite the candidate change for the PSB, most pollsters seem to have estimated both Eduardo Campos and Marina Silva rather accurately, although with a very similar direction and magnitude of error. Perhaps most interesting is that most polling firms seem to have consistently underestimated Aécio Neves, who ended in second place on the general election.
Now that we know that no candidate got the necessary majority to win the election outright, we will have two very different moments that will be interesting to contrast: the general election, which was strictly multipartisan, and the runoff, which will be strictly bipartisan. It shall be interesting to see how pollsters performed when this next round is over.

In government-wide survey  feds faith in their senior leaders plummetsBy Lisa Rein October 24 Follow @Reinlwapo
Federal employees protested the government shutdown last November in Detroit. (Steve Perez/AP).
Federal employees’ satisfaction with senior leaders at their agency hit a five-year low last year, according to a survey of the workforce released Friday.
The Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey, administered annually by the Office of Personnel Management, also found a workforce that overall was more unhappy with life in government in 2013 than in 2012. Employees still believe in their agencies’ missions, feel the work they do is important and said they put in extra effort to get the job done.
But their morale continues to plummet after a year of turmoil that included furloughs and a disruptive government shutdown.
“It is encouraging to see that federal employees remained committed to their jobs regardless of the difficulties our workforce has faced in the last few years,”  OPM Director Katherine Archuleta said in a statement. Her agency ” is committed to helping all federal agencies to implement agency-specific programs that will continue to foster employee engagement and better serve the American people,”  she said.
Almost 400,000 civilian employees responded to the survey, which was conducted from April through June. Results came from 82 federal agencies. Employees were asked to weigh in on almost every feature of their work lives, from their immediate supervisors to how well their agency helps them balance work with family life.
Across the government, the percentage of positive responses to 32 of 77 questions fell last year over the previous year. And the most significant slide came in a serious of questions about employees’ views of their senior leaders.
Employees had relatively high marks for their immediate supervisors. But when it comes to trusting senior leaders to maintain “high standards of honesty and integrity,” just 49.5 percent agreed, down from 53.6 percent in 2012. Just 38 percent of employees agreed that their senior leaders inspire a high level of motivation and commitment to their jobs.
This year’s survey results provide data on individual agencies; at some big ones, poor morale appears to have dragged down averages across the government. The Department of Homeland Security, for example, has suffered from low morale and high turnover for years, particularly among senior executives.
On Wednesday, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson gave a pep talk to his employees after handing out distinguished-service awards to more than 300 of them. It was part of the department’s latest effort to tackle the problem, which Johnson has vowed to fix.
Colleen Kelley, president of the National Treasury Employees Union, said in a statement that the 2014 survey “should serve as a wakeup call for federal managers to find creative ways within existing constraints to improve morale and employee retention.”
 

Gruden educates players on rivalryBy Mike Jones October 24 Follow @mikejoneswapo
(John McDonnell/The Washington Post)
Prior to this season, Jay Gruden had knowledge of the Redskins-Cowboys rivalry, but he felt like he could learn about it, and he believed that many of his players needed a more thorough education on the series.
So, this week, he showed his players a video on the history of the rivalry and what makes Dallas Week so special to Redskins fans.
“I just think the history — a lot of guys haven’t been in this organization, myself included. This is my first year,” Gruden explained. “It’s always good to see the history of this rivalry and how important it is to the fans, the ex-players, the alumni and the organization in general. This is a huge game for a lot of people, and we’re going to make sure it’s known that this is a big rivalry for the new players and coaches.”
Monday’s meeting will represent the 107th regular season meeting between the teams, dating back to 1960. Dallas owns a 64-40-2 advantage.

The Redskins’ younger players said they came away from the viewing of the video with an improved understanding of the significance of this week’s meeting.
“Obviously, it seems like a long-lasting, strong rivalry,” rookie guard Spencer Long said. “It was kind of eye-opening how serious they do take it, and it’s kind of cool.”
Long added: “I haven’t been a Redskins player for very long, but I’m sure it means something to the players. But I know it must mean something to the fans, who have been watching for many, many years. But I’ve always disliked the Cowboys. … I just don’t like them. Seems like everybody who was a Dallas player tries to stick their noses up in the air. Same with the [Texas] Longhorns. But that’s just me because I’m from Nebraska.”
The more senior players, particularly those who have been with the team for a significant amount of time, already understood the importance of the game beyond division and win-loss implications. But they said the video served as a good reminder and source of motivation.
“It was good to let people know that this was 50-plus years in the making – Redskins-Cowboys,” said defensive end Kedric Golston, who has spent his entire eight-season career with Washington. “It’s a huge game because it’s an NFC East game, but it’s [also] a huge game for our fan base. You know that when you do things in this game, it’s going to forever echo through history. That’s what I kind of took out of it.”
Few of the recent games have carried great significance. But the matchup in December 2012, won by Washington 28-18, determined the winner of the NFC East and sent the Redskins to the postseason.
The rivalry seems to have lost its luster as a result of Washington and Dallas being at opposite ends of the spectrum for a number of years. Free agency also has diminished the animosity between teams: Washington has two former Cowboys on the roster, in defensive linemen Jason Hatcher and Stephen Bowen.
But the players still understand the sense of urgency, Golston says.
“Obviously, now, with people living in different cities, it’s a different nature,” Golston said. “But the intensity is still there because of being division rivals, and it’s still Washington and Dallas, and you feed off the energy of the fans.”

WHO sends expert team to Mali after first Ebola diagnosis in the West African countryBy Abby Ohlheiser October 24 Follow @abbyohlheiser

The World Health Organization is preparing to send a team of experts to Mali after the country announced that it had its first Ebola case, a WHO spokesperson said Friday.
Mali's health minister said Thursday night that a 2-year-old girl who recently traveled from Guinea with her grandmother was admitted to a hospital in Kayes this week and tested positive for Ebola.
On Friday, WHO spokesperson Fadéla Chaib told The Post in an e-mail that four experts would travel to Mali as soon as possible to provide help with clinical management, epidemiology, contact tracing and social mobilization. "These functions need to be deployed within the next 24 hours," Chaib said.
The group will join a team of three WHO workers already in Mali, where they have been working on outbreak preparedness in the country since Oct. 19.
According to the WHO's statement on the case, the toddler's symptoms included a 102.2-degree fever, a nose bleed, bloody stools and a cough.
Chaib said the child first saw a health-care worker in Kayes, in the western region of Mali, on Monday. The next day, she was moved to the Fousseyni Daou Hospital and admitted to the pediatric ward.
Officials took samples from the patient on Wednesday, which were analyzed at the Bamako University Lab on Thursday. (An earlier statement from Malian officials said that the patient was admitted to a hospital on Wednesday.)
The WHO said that 43 contacts of the child have been isolated, including 10 health-care workers in Kayes. Local authorities are in the process of contact tracing and training personnel at the isolation site treating the child, the organization added.
In a second statement Friday, the WHO said that, based on an initial investigation, officials believe the grandmother traveled to a funeral in southern Guinea. The grandmother then returned to Mali on Oct. 19 with the child. The pair used public transportation.
"The case history revealed that bleeding from the nose began while both were still in Guinea, meaning that the child was symptomatic during their travels through Mali," the statement said. "Multiple opportunities for exposure occurred when the child was visibly symptomatic."
WHO officials are "seeking confirmation of media reports that the funeral was for the child’s mother, who is said to have shown Ebola-like symptoms before her death."
The number of people being monitored for symptoms of Ebola in the U.S. is growing. Here's how the virus spreads and how contact tracing works to stop outbreaks. (Gillian Brockell/The Washington Post)
Mali is now the sixth West African country to record an Ebola case during the deadliest outbreak in history . The epidemic, whose death toll is rapidly approaching 5,000, has been centered in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia; Nigeria and Senegal have also recorded cases.
Just hours before Malian health officials announced the diagnosis, WHO assistant director general Keiji Fukuda said to reporters that the organization had "reasonable confidence right now that we are not seeing widespread transmission of Ebola into the neighboring countries," including Mali, Guinea Bissau and the Ivory Coast.
However, WHO hadn't ruled out the possibility of an Ebola case in Mali, as it was one of 15 countries identified as a "priority" by the WHO as the outbreak spread -- due in part to its proximity to the most severely affected regions. That's why, Chaib said, there was already a small WHO team in Mali before the first case was identified.

The Kayes region of Mali, where the first case was diagnosed, borders Guinea, one of three countries hardest hit by the Ebola epidemic. Guinea alone has recorded 904 Ebola deaths and 1,540 total cases of the disease, according to the latest figures available from the WHO .
In all, there are 4,877 confirmed deaths and 9,936 confirmed, probable and suspected cases of Ebola in seven countries: Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Spain, the United States, Nigeria and Senegal.
Two of those countries are now considered Ebola-free: Nigeria and Senegal. Senegal, which also neighbors Mali, had a single case of Ebola, also imported from Guinea.
Also on Friday, the WHO announced that "several hundred thousand" doses of an experimental Ebola vaccine will be available by the first half of 2015.

Socialist Party Pushing $20 Minimum Wage Defends $13-An-Hour Job Listingreddit
The Freedom Socialist Party has right - wing bloggers seeing red over a job listing that paid less than the group advocates for a minimum wage.
Earlier this month, the nonprofit posted listings on Craigslist and Indeed to advertise an opening for a part-time web designer. It offered to pay $13 an hour or more, depending on the designer's experience. That's well below the $20 minimum wage the party pushes for in its platform , and lower than the $15 wage it helped pass this year in Seattle. Right-leaning sites promptly seized on what they saw as hypocrisy.
But Doug Barnes, the party's national secretary, told The Huffington Post on Saturday that the group relies heavily on donations from low-wage workers and could not afford to pay much to an inexperienced designer.
"We're practicing what we're preaching in terms of continuing to fight for the minimum wage," Barnes said, making his first public comment on the controversy. "But we can't pay a lot more than $13."
He said the party's revenues would increase if the minimum wage were raised to $20 -- and he'd even prefer $22, at least in Seattle. The city will begin phasing in a $15 minimum wage in April.
"Our donor base would all be affected, and the low-wage workers who support us with $5 to $6 a month would be able to give more," he said. "That would affect our ability to pay higher wages as well."
But Barnes said he removed the $13 starting wage from the Craigslist ad on Friday in response to the online criticism.
"The right-wing attack is very hypocritical," he said. "These are the same people who fought against the minimum wage and support companies like Walmart."
He said the Freedom Socialist Party, which was formed in 1966 as a revolutionary feminist breakaway group from the United States Socialist Workers Party, does not accept donations from corporations.

Nifty Ends at 1-Month High Above 8 000 in Muhurat TradeYou are here: Home Market
BSE Sensex, Nifty Move Higher in Muhurat Trading
NDTV | Updated On: October 23, 2014 18:59 (IST)
IVRCL Allots First Tranche of Shares to CDR Lenders
The BSE Sensex and Nifty moved higher today in the special 'Muhurat trading' session to mark the festival of Diwali.
The Sensex rose over 100 points to 26,930 while Nifty jumped to 8,031.The gains were broad-based today with all the sectoral indices on the BSE rising in today's session. The broader markets outperformed with all the BSE midcap and smallcap indices rising over 1 per cent. ( Track shares )
Shares of IT major Wipro fell as much as 5 per cent. Wipro, which had missed its earnings estimate in the September quarter, was also the top loser in the 50-share Nifty. ( Wipro falls sharply after lacklustre Q2 )
Indian markets have rallied in the past four sessions, buoyed by gains in global markets and energy sector reforms announced by the government.
From last year's Diwali to this Diwali, India's bluechip indices Sensex and Nifty ended with more than 25 per cent gain. Buying by foreign funds, a stable government at the Centre and hopes of big bang reforms are the three big triggers that have lifted domestic stock markets to record highs during the period.
The gains have been bigger in broader markets with midcaps and smallcap indices surging 48 per cent and 75 per cent.
Analysts expect the gains to continue in Indian markets but not to that extent compared from last Diwali.
Nilesh Shah, MD & CEO of Axis Capital, says the handsome returns from the previous Diwali are unlikely to be repeated till the next Diwali but investors can still expect double-digit returns. The polarisation between the largecaps and midcaps are likely to narrow down, he added.
Brokerage firm Karvy Stock Broking has put out a Sensex target of 29,300 by next Diwali, a gain of nearly 10 per cent.

India firmly on the radar for HyundaiIndia firmly on the radar for Hyundai
Murali Gopalan
Hot seller The i20 elite has caught the fancy of the market and is a heavy contributor to Hyundai's sales.
The company clocked domestic sales of 4.44 lakh units for January-September
It was at the 1998 Delhi Auto Expo when Hyundai first made known its India intent with the unveiling of the Santro hatchback. This was the year when all eyes at Pragati Maidan were on the Tata Indica.
It was also the time when Suzuki Motor Corporation and its partner, the Indian Government, were locked in a bitter war-of-words.
There was a sense of enormous excitement coupled with fierce nationalism. This was thanks primarily to Tata Motors which was keen to show that India could also make its own car even while it had thrown open its gates to multinationals. The Indica was naturally the cynosure of all eyes at the Expo but nobody could ignore Hyundai either which, apart from the Santro, also had the Accent on display.
The numbers
Many Expos have come and gone at Pragati Maidan since then, but the Korean automaker is perhaps in the most exciting phase of its India tenure. Its recent launches comprising the Grand i10, Xcent and Elite i20 have caught the fancy of the market and are clocking over 20,000 units between them each month.
The entry model, Eon, has settled to a routine of nearly 7,000 units while the old warhorse, Santro, comfortably does around 4,000 cars.
On Thursday, Hyundai declared its third quarter results in Seoul where India clocked sales of 4.44 lakh units for the January-September period.
The i10 was the largest selling model with 2.12 lakh units followed by the i20 with 82,000 and the Eon with 74,000 units. Other models including the Santro, Xcent etc chipped in with the balance 76,000 units.
Sure, Maruti continues to be the market leader with monthly numbers averaging over one lakh units thanks to a host of successful models such as the Alto, Wagon R, Swift, Dzire and the more recent Celerio. It is equally true that the company has faced no threat to its numero uno status for many years now.
Yet, what is interesting about Hyundai is a new sense of energy and determination within its system. The new products (i10, Xcent and i20) have been loaded with features which have caught the attention of the market in a big way. “In terms of styling and design, Hyundai is making a strong statement which young buyers are finding incredibly hard to resist,” a top auto executive says.
Will this be enough to upset the Maruti applecart during the course of this decade?
Very unlikely given that the Japanese automaker is not being remotely complacent even for a minute.
Aware that it is still associated with the small car imagery, Maruti has been working on ideas like AMT (automated manual transmission) on its Celerio and more recently, the Alto. The Ciaz will show if the company can make a strong mark for itself in the sedan segment.
Hyundai also has competition from Honda which has staged a strong comeback with the Amaze, new City and the Mobilio multipurpose vehicle.
“The Xcent has made a bigger impact than the Amaze and Hyundai will now have to replicate this with the Verna against the City,” an industry observer says.
Why is Hyundai making news now when it has already proved that it is Maruti’s closest rival?
After hitting paydirt with the Santro and Accent in the late-1990s, the Getz and Elantra did not quite set the market afire.
And even as numbers continued steadily, there was really no excitement on the product front.
Bad timing
As an entry-level option, the Eon was an interesting product from the Hyderabad R&D centre but was unfortunate to be launched when the country was in the mist of a diesel buying craze three years ago. With petrol back in favour now, the car has made up lost ground.
Global conundrum
Unlike Suzuki which, apart from Japan, has India and ASEAN as its key growth regions, Hyundai is well and truly a global company with a presence in the US, Europe, China and BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India and China) regions. In the process, it becomes doubly difficult for the company to focus exclusively on countries such as India when other parts of the world, especially the West, are far more profitable markets.
This is a challenge that Toyota also faces except that Hyundai has rediscovered its mojo a lot faster in India.
Going forward, the company will launch a compact SUV here while building the base for exports to West Asia and Asia-Pacific.
And even while it focuses on important global projects such as the electric vehicle (planned with Daimler) which debuts in Europe next year, Hyundai will now step up the gas in a big way in India.

The #1 Dumb Thing Businesses Do to Hurt Themselvesreddit
If you really want to hurt your business, ignore what your customers want. Let me give you a few examples of this stupid business trick in action.
If you're a seafood fan like me, chances are you've eaten at Red Lobster. A couple years ago, I noticed the quality of service sharply decreased. It turns out, in their never-ending quest to cut costs, the owners eliminated all busboy positions and demoted many of the servers. In addition to bussing their own tables, servers now had to take on four tables at a time instead of three. The leadership did so after convincing themselves, somehow, that both the wait staff and the customers approved. Actually, they didn't. People got sick of waiting for clean tables and meals, and started voting with their feet. Less than a year later, Red Lobster rescinded the policy, and business has picked up since.
Downsizing can be deadly, and not simply because it overworks the surviving employees, but because it can lower your ability to respond to customer needs. You may have read my previous discussions of Circuit City's suicidal decision to save money by replacing commission-based sales personnel with minimum-wage newbies who didn't know the difference between a USB port and an Ethernet plug.  People stopped buying, and Circuit City died an ignominious death. Leadership forgot that while labor is your biggest expense, your employees are your greatest asset.
Borders couldn't adapt to the e-book phenomenon customers were demanding, whereas Barnes and Noble embraced it wholeheartedly. Borders eventually went the way of the buggy-whip makers who thought horseless carriages were a passing fad. Speaking of passing fads, wasn't that what the old Bulletin Board Services called the Internet? When was the last time you dialed into a BSB? (Do you even remember them at all?)
Netflix also ignored customer desires to their peril. They started out by mailing DVDs to subscribers, then added online video streaming. Eventually, Netflix decided to split the services into different two companies, despite the outcry against it. They stuck to their guns, making ready to spin off the DVD mailing as Quickster. They even hiked their fees...then, just as Quickster was almost a reality, they killed it. Those who had gotten used to the idea were outraged again. Once the brouhaha calmed down, Netflix finally stopped reloading the gun they kept shooting themselves in the foot with.
Bottom line: keep your ear to the ground, do what your customers love, and make changes that follow their desires.

The Bottom Line on Climate Change Costsreddit
The recent  report published by the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate , an organization aimed at helping the world's societies to combat the effects of climate change, suggests that the costs of combating climate change are considerably lower than widespread opinion has suggested. This new analysis is considered to be a real game changer in how we perceive and act on remedies for polluting the planet.
The analysis cuts to the heart of climate deniers contentious arguments that an overhaul of the fossil fuel industry will cream our economy. Not so.
The study tells us that between 2015 and 2030, nations are expected to invest roughly $90 trillion in urban, land-use and energy infrastructure. The report suggests that implementing the fixes necessary to transition to entirely sustainable sources of energy would amount to  4 trillion.  So, this amounts to 5% increase of the total amount that is estimated to be spent on new power plants, transit systems, and other infrastructure over the same period. While economically feasible, the report's recommended changes are expected to face a tough political reception.
The report outlines the plunging costs of renewable energy and point to solar technology costs which have been cut in half since 2010. Meanwhile, it paints the compelling argument, known for quite some time that limiting urban sprawl and deforestation are essential steps in combating climate change.
It's going to require the cooperation of countries to cease subsidies for fossil fuels and transition to renewable sources of energy alongside the adoption of a wide variety of initiatives to encourage--for instance-- more efficient land use and fighting forest fires.  Add to this, consistent and credible government policies  signals, which  are essential for businesses and investors to create jobs, growth and spur innovation.
Additional specifics deal with the implementation of a carbon tax and enabling the growth of alternative energies.  An investment is required of public infrastructure and is key to moving forward successfully. Another aspect is increasing the encouragement of low carbon innovators thru patents, public spending, and alternative energy research and production.
Action suggested by the report will require long years of hard work and an optimistic vision for  the future, but its authors argue that these practices currently have real world proof in major metropolitan centers all over the world. So, a greener tomorrow is just on the horizon, but it's all dependent on how willing we are to embrace it now.

US Tech Firm Fined for Underpaying Indian Workers
Associated Press | Updated On: October 24, 2014 11:25 (IST)
Aviation Regulator Acts Tough Against Troubled SpiceJet: Report
San Francisco: A Silicon Valley company is paying more than $43,000 in back wages and penalties after labor regulators found eight employees brought from India were grossly underpaid and overworked while assigned to a special project in the US
The probe announced this week by the US Department of Labor uncovered several egregious violations at Electronics for Imaging Inc., a printing technology specialist that generated revenue of $728 million last year, when the misconduct occurred.
Among other things, Electronics for Imaging paid the eight workers far below California's required minimum wage - $8 per hour at the time - while they helped the company move its headquarters from Foster City, California, to Fremont, California, during a three-month period, according to the Labor Department.
While assigned to the project, some of the Indian workers logged as many as 122 hours in a week without being paid overtime. As result, they received as little as $1.21 per hour.
Electronics for Imaging says it "unintentionally overlooked" US laws requiring foreign workers to be paid at least minimum wage, with overtime for more than 40 weekly hours on the job. Instead, the company gave the Indians unspecified bonuses while paying the transferred workers the same wages they normally received in their normal jobs in Bangalore, India. The workers were even paid in rupees while in the US.
Michael Eastwood, a Department of Labor assistant district director, said the abuses at Electronics for Imaging were among the most outrageous he had ever seen - even worse than problems he had seen at garment factories in southern California.
"This is worse than anything that I ever saw in any of those Los Angeles sweatshops," Eastwood said Thursday.
The Electronics for Imaging case serves as a reminder of the economic divide between high-tech workforces in the US and less-developed countries. While engineers and other technology employees are paid more than $100,000 salaries and lucrative stock incentives, workers handling other jobs for the same employer often receive paltry pay if they are based in countries such as India, China and Mexico.
Although it is not among Silicon Valley's high-profile companies, Electronics for Imaging is successful. The company earned $109 million last year and awarded CEO Guy Gecht with a pay package valued at nearly $6 million, including more than $1.2 million in salary and bonuses.
Electronics for Imaging is paying more than $40,000 in back wages and damages to the eight Indian workers and a $3,520 fine.

GM Posts Higher-Than-Expected Profit on Strong North American DemandAviation Regulator Acts Tough Against Troubled SpiceJet: Report
Detroit: General Motors Co on Thursday reported a higher-than-expected profit in the third quarter on strong demand for its redesigned full-size pickup trucks in North America.
"Clearly, high transaction prices - the new trucks and SUVs are more profitable than the ones they replace - that certainly helps," GM Chief Financial Officer Chuck Stevens said at the company's Detroit headquarters.
The positive results provided a respite from the drumbeat of negative news this year surrounding faulty ignition switches that led to massive recalls and have been blamed for at least 29 deaths.
Shares in the No. 1 US automaker were off 13 cents at $31.18 in midday trade.
Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas lauded GM's "Audi-style" profit margins in North America that approach German luxury levels. However, he added investors should consider exiting the stock, citing a dial-down of European growth and increased pressures on the key US market.
"We believe no (automaker) with global exposure can confidently offer guidance for the 2015 period," he said. "This is not just a GM issue."
Higher pricing on GM's vehicles resulted in a $600 million profit gain in the quarter. It launched new versions of its full-size Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks last year and followed those with other updated SUVs on the same vehicle platform earlier this year.
Stevens said GM remained on or ahead of its financial forecast from January, when it said it would see a slight increase in pretax profit this year.
The quarter did not include any charges for costs related to the record number of recalls this year as GM has already booked them. Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra said GM has repaired more than 1.2 million of the cars recalled for the defective switch, and had enough replacement parts to service the rest.
Net income rose to $1.38 billion, or 81 cents a share, from $698 million, or 45 cents a share, a year earlier.
Excluding one-time items, GM earned 97 cents a share, 2 cents above what analysts expected, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The quarter included $300 million in special items for flood damage sustained at GM's Michigan technical center and the writedown of Russian assets.
Revenue rose slightly to about $39.3 billion from $39 billion. Analysts expected $39.8 billion.
GM reported a profit margin of 9.5 per cent in North America, the fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth.
GM said average transaction prices in the US market and vehicle sales in China reached record highs in the quarter. It is getting almost $4,000 more per full-size pickup than it was before the new model was introduced. Stevens expects GM's North American incentive spending to decline in the fourth quarter.
In North America, earnings rose 12 per cent to $2.45 billion.
Profit at GM's international operations, including China, fell about 20 percent to $259 million. However, GM's equity income in China rose 14 per cent to $484 million.
The loss in Europe, which included $200 million in restructuring costs, widened by about $150 million as the Russian market struggled.
GM posted a loss of $32 million in South America, and CFO Stevens said GM remained focused on cutting costs there.

After video controversy  senior Marine is now helping Chicago youthBy Dan Lamothe October 24 Follow @danlamothe
Now-retired Marine Sgt. Maj. Paul Archie is shown here in 2007 while receiving a Bronze Star with V medal for heroism while deployed in Iraq. He retired amid controversy earlier this year after getting in an altercation that was depicted in a viral video, and says he has moved on with life. (Photo by Lance Cpl. Aaron Rooks/ Marine Corps)
Sgt. Maj. Paul Archie was a well-respected senior member of the Marine Corps when he came across something at the gates of Parris Island, S.C., that infuriated him: a man protesting while wearing the iconic “campaign cover” hat meant for drill instructors who are on base training future Marines.
The ensuing June 5 incident escalated quickly — and was captured in a video that went viral online. It showed Archie, wearing his desert tan utility uniform, going toe-to-toe with Ethan Arguello, a former drill instructor who was protesting the controversial U.S. decision to exchange five Taliban leaders for Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who went missing in Afghanistan in 2009.
No punches were exchanged, but Archie could be seen getting close enough to Arguello to knock the cover off his head. Archie snatched it as it fell, and then stormed back to his black Jeep Sahara and drove away.
“You’re about to get locked up!” Arguello yelled.
As noted in this Checkpoint post at the time , Archie resigned a short time afterward and was charged with assault. Marines and veterans, meanwhile, debated whether Archie was wrong for confronting Arguello, and whether Arguello was violating the spirit of Marine Corps tradition by wearing the campaign cover out of uniform.
There’s more to the story, however. Archie, in his first comments since the controversy, said Thursday that he was asked to retire by the senior enlisted member of the Marine Corps within days of the incident.
Sgt. Maj. Paul Archie is shown in this Marine Corps photograph in February 2014, after taking over as the sergeant major at Parris Island, S.C.
He declined to use his name, but he is Sgt. Maj. Mike Barrett. Archie added that he did not feel like his chain of command at Parris Island was inclined to keep him, either.
“He told me, ‘Paul you know you were wrong. You need to step down and resign before your chain of command needs to decide,’ ” Archie said of Barrett’s direction. “I kind of figured that was coming. I’d been let down before, but this time I was really let down.”
Barrett could not be reached for comment. His spokesman, Gunnery Sgt. Chanin Nuntavong, said the contents of the conversation between the two sergeants major should stay between them, but he confirmed they spoke at the time of the video.
Brig. Gen. Lori Reynolds, then the commanding general at Parris Island, addressed the issue in an interview with the Island Packet newspaper in June. She said that Archie was a great Marine worthy of emulation by others, but that his leaving was “about a very high standard, and that’s what we’re looking for from all our Marines.”
Archie, who served more than 25 years and earned a Bronze Star with V for heroism in Iraq, has moved on. The charges against him were dropped earlier this month, and he has moved to Chicago with his family to take a job as a sergeant major with the Marine Leadership Academy , a public high school that has a military curriculum and a strong ROTC program.
“It’s a motivating environment, and you see kids grow daily,” Archie said. “I loved my time in the Marine Corps, but the writing was definitely on the wall that it was time for me to move on.”
Archie said that “it was a fall from a high-ranking billet” and that he wanted to serve a full 30 years before retiring, but that he won’t look back. He realizes he could have diffused the situation by stepping away when it escalated, he said, but felt that Arguello needed to be corrected.
“When I saw his temper going up, hindsight being 20-20, I should have just got in the vehicle and drove away before it just kept escalating,” he said. “That’s the only thing I would say. But I still stand behind, ‘I was doing something for the Marine Corps and the institution.’ I wasn’t doing something for my sole gratification. It was all about the Marine Corps, and what it stands for. I regret not cutting the conversation shorter, but I do not regret what I did.”

Power has been restored to most of IT units at Rushikonda hills
Visakhapatnam, Oct. 24:  
The IT sector in Visakhapatnam like the other sectors has suffered considerable damage due to Hudhud cyclone, but there is no need for any apprehensions on the long-term prospects and the State Government will extend full support to it in all forms, according to IT Minister P. Raghunadhra Reddy.
He said here on Friday that power had been restored to the IT units at Rushikonda hills and all the pending incentives and subsidies to the units would be quickly given. "We will also make efforts to get the insurance claims of the companies cleared as quickly as possible. We are in touch with the insurance companies," he said.
He said the IT signature tower would be built on the Rushikonda hill, as planned, and all efforts would be made to attract investments into the sector. "We invited several IT companies earlier this month and nearly 400 of them responded. Several of them are positive about setting up units and starting operations here. There is no blow to the brand image of Visakhapatnam as an IT destination," he said.
According to the IT entrepreneurs, power was restored to the units on the Rushikonda hills only on Deepavali night and still some units were waiting for it. B. Gopi, of the Sankhya Technologies, said power had been restored to his unit only on Thursday night. "We have resumed operations on a small scale on Friday. Still, some of the IT units are waiting for power restoration," he said.
He said his company had put up a claim for Rs 77 lakh and so far two surveys had been conducted and yet the damage had not been accurately assessed. "We are waiting for another qualified surveyor to arrive at the spot and make a final assessment. In spite of the Chief Minister's clear directive that the process should be expedited and multiple surveys avoided, it has not yet resulted in any concrete action," he complained.
He wanted the insurance companies to understand the gravity of the situation and respond quickly.

Google to Spend $1 Bn to Lease Office BuildingsAviation Regulator Acts Tough Against Troubled SpiceJet: Report
San Francisco: Google Inc said it is committed to spending $1 billion to lease office buildings over the next 13 to 14 years.
Google did not say where the office buildings were located in its disclosure as part of its quarterly regulatory filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday.
A source familiar with the matter, who was not authorized to discuss it publicly, said the Mountain View, California-based company was investing in new office space in Silicon Valley.
Google, the world's No. 1 Internet search company, has been looking to expand beyond its headquarters to accommodate its growing ranks of employees.
The company has acquired 24 office buildings near its campus, known as the Googleplex, in recent years, according to a July report in the San Jose Mercury News. Google hopes to transform many of the purchased buildings into taller, high-density office buildings, the report said.
It was not clear if the new leases were related to those buildings.
Google said the new lease periods will expire between 2027 and 2028.
In addition to the $1 billion lease obligation, Google noted that it was also "committed to pay a portion of the related operating expenses under these lease agreements which are not included in the total obligation amount."
The company said it was in the process of evaluating the impact of these lease agreements on its financial statements.
Google's staff grew by about 3,000 in the third quarter to more than 55,000 full-time employees worldwide.

Arunachal Pradesh
(Unfazed by China's objections…)
GREATER NOIDA: Unfazed by China's objections to development of border areas, Government today announced setting up of 54 new border outposts and a Rs 175 crore package for beefing up the infrastructure along the border in Arunachal Pradesh.
The announcement was made by Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh even as he made it clear that India wanted to solve the border dispute with China through dialogue, asserting "peace with honour" was most important requirement for building good friendly relations with that country and other neighbours.
"Today when I talk about the border, be it with Pakistan or China, I feel pained and anguished over reports of ceasefire violations by Pakistan or incursions by Chinese troops," he said at the 53rd raising day function of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) here, which guards the 3,488 km long border from Ladakh to Arunachal Pradesh.
"Humlog shanti chahte hai samman ki saath. Asamman ke saath shanti nahi ho sakti (We want peace with honour. Peace cannot come at the cost of honour," he said, referring to the recent border row with China.
"Pride is the ultimate accomplishment of a human being, of mine and yours," he added.
On development of areas bordering China, the Home Minister said the Government has started working on a plan for setting up of 54 border outposts(BoPs) for ITBP and also a Rs 175 crore package for building infrastructure along the border in Arunachal Pradesh.
All these posts will be set up in Arunachal Pradesh where there were large gaps at the Line of Actual Control(LAC).
China has been objecting to any development of infrastructure along the LAC and setting up of border outposts leading to instances of stand-offs with India including during the visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping to this country in September this year.
Singh also referred to Prime Minister Narendra Modi making it clear that India wants to maintain peaceful relations with all its neighbouring countries. "Our Prime Minister has told the Chinese President that if there is a dispute we should talk," he said.
"India wants to keep friendly relations with our neighbours whether it is China or Pakistan. We believe in the philosophy of 'Vasudaiva Kutumbakam' which means the world is one family and India has told the world about it," he added.
Singh also said the Government was looking into the demand for a dedicated air support for the ITBP personnel.

Latinos could affect crucial races by not showing upBy Max Ehrenfreund October 24 Follow @MaxEhrenfreund
Anti-deportation protesters chant in front of the White House on Aug. 28, 2014. (Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)
With the exception of Colorado, there aren't that many Latinos living in states with competitive Senate races -- and there are even fewer Latinos living in House districts controlled by Republicans.In a fascinating thought experiment earlier this week,  Nate Cohn  determined that Republicans could hold a majority in the House without a single Hispanic vote.
The Hispanic vote does not appear to be damaging congressional Republican candidates all that much. On the contrary, those voters might be hurting Democrats, who desperately need their enthusiasm and support in some races.
Hispanic voters are frustrated with continued deportations and with what they see as the Democratic Party's failure on immigration reform. Only a narrow majority of Latinos say they approve of the job President Obama is doing, according to Gallup . His approval ratings among Latinos have fallen by 20 points since his reelection in 2012.
Much of the election analysis has been focused on control of the Senate, where Hispanics do have less influence over the outcome. But this year's gubernatorial races are arguably more consequential . In Kansas, for example, Gov. Sam Brownback's tax cuts have left the state with an expanding budget shortfall , but  haven't obviously improved the economy .
In a dead heat like Colorado's gubernatorial race, Latino support is crucial for Democrats. A recent Quinnipiac poll put Gov. John Hickenlooper just one point ahead of his Republican opponent, former Rep. Bob Beauprez. Hispanics constitute fully 14 percent of eligible voters, so it's easy to see how a small change in turnout could sway the election. (About one in three eligible Hispanic voters have voted in past midterm elections, according to the Pew Research Center .)
Last month, one Latino advocacy group threatened to boycott the election , saying a program to issue driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants had been underfunded. All the same, Hickenlooper's campaign has had success in reaching out aggressively to the community, said Matt Barreto of Latino Decisions, a polling firm.
In Kansas, eligible Hispanic voters are only about 6 percent of the electorate, but the gubernatorial race might even closer.  The polls are split on whether Brownback will survive a challenge from Paul Davis, a state legislator.
Even in some crucial Senate races, Latinos could be influential, but by not showing up at the polls. Take Sen. Kay Hagan (D-N.C.), whom the advocacy organization Presente Action targeted in a radio spot . Hagan voted with Republicans in a filibuster of the Dream Act in 2010, and more recently, sided with Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) in a failed procedural vote supporting deportations.
Barreto argues that Hagan's decisions on immigration won’t deliver the kind of swing voters she may have been targeting. Those voters are moderate on immigration anyway, he said. Now, less than half of Latinos are planning on voting for Hagan, according to his firm's research -- despite months of hard work by Democratic organizers.
Well-informed Latinos are understandably frustrated with Hagan and other Democrats, Barreto said. If they don't vote, he added, "it’s because they’re paying attention." Most models give Hagan a comfortable, if narrow, lead , and Latinos are only about 3 percent of eligible voters in North Carolina, so she may well survive without the ardent support of the Hispanic community.
The Latino vote might not be decisive in North Carolina or in any other state, the way it could be in 2020, when as many as 25 million more Hispanics  will have joined the electorate.

Chart of the day:
Water in Seattle is about three times as expensive as it is in El Paso. No wonder farmers and households use the wet stuff so inefficiently, despite the historic drought in the Southwest. Rebecca Leber in  The New Republic .
1. Top story: Doctor isolated with Ebola in New York City
The physician, Craig Spencer, had recently returned from Guinea, where he was treating victims of the disease. Authorities have quarantined his fiancée and two friends, but do not believe that he was contagious before he was isolated with a fever on Thursday. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are conducting a second test to verify an initial positive result. Marc Santora in  The New York Times .
The virus has also arrived in Mali for the first time. A 2-year-old girl who traveled from Guinea has tested positive for the virus. Francois Rihouay and Simeon Bennett for  Bloomberg .
Two vaccines could be ready for large-scale trials early next year, but ethical and practical questions remain. At this point, immunization could be the best hope of controlling the epidemic in West Africa, but GlaxoSmithKline's vaccine has to be stored at -112 degrees Fahrenheit. And while early trials don't show any negative side effects, it isn't clear yet whether it can really prevent infection, and organizing a large-scale trial in a place like Liberia right now would be difficult. Brady Dennis in  The Washington Post .
One vaccine sat on the shelf for a decade after highly successful testing in monkeys. Fully developing and testing a vaccine in humans typically costs more than $1 billion. "There's never been a big market for Ebola vaccines," said one of the researchers. "So big pharma, who are they going to sell it to?" Denise Grady in The New York Times . 
In one of Liberia's poorest slums, neighbors are coming together to fight the disease. Shoes and socks, plastic bags for gloves, and buckets of bleach are volunteers' weapons against Ebola. The scene in the West Point district of Monrovia has changed from a few weeks ago, when residents thought the disease was a hoax and flouted quarantines. Heidi Vogt in  The Wall Street Journal .
GERSON: We are in collective denial about the horrific danger posed by Ebola in West Africa. As many as 10,000 new cases a week are expected by December, the global community hasn't begun to ask the most important questions: "Is Ebola containable? Will we see disease-related hunger? How will rice crops be harvested and transported? What effects will spiking food prices have on civil order? Might there be large-scale, disease-related migration? What would be the economic effects on all of Africa?"  The Washington Post .

The fact that the autopsy showed Brown had marijuana in his body says nothing about why he died. Marijuana is not correlated with violence and aggression.

Markets have calmed down since last week, but there are still reasons to be nervous. Oil and food prices are depressed, and investors are no longer sure that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next year, all signs of widespread pessimism. At the same time, indicators, such as unemployment, suggest the economy is still slowly recovering. Neil Irwin in  The New York Times .

Rejoinder to Sherif Girgis on sex discrimination and same-sex marriageBy Ilya Somin October 24
Political theorist Sherif Girgis has written a thoughtful response to my critique of his argument that laws banning same-sex marriage should not be subject to the same heightened scrutiny as other legislation that discriminates on the basis of gender. The response helpfully clarifies Girgis’ position, but fails to fix its shortcomings.
I. Sexism and the motivation for excluding same-sex couples from the institution of marriage
Early in his response, Girgis disclaims reliance on the common argument that laws banning same-sex marriage are different from laws banning interracial marriage because, while the latter are motivated by racism, the former are not motivated by a desire to promote “male supremacy.” I appreciate the clarification and am sorry if I misinterpreted his earlier reference to this argument as an endorsement of it. But if supposed lack of sexist motives does not distinguish laws banning same-sex marriage from other forms of gender discrimination, this weakens the case for exempting them from heightened judicial scrutiny.
Moreover, as I noted in my earlier post, the issue of motive cuts against Girgis’ position in another way: sexism was historically one of the reasons for excluding same-sex relationships from marriage recognition in the first place. Same-sex relationships were excluded from marriage and often subjected to persecution in large part because their participants did not conform to traditional sex roles and were seen as a potential threat to male dominance. The presence this motive does not by itself prove that discriminatory marriage laws should be struck down by courts. It also does not mean that everyone opposed to same-sex marriage is automatically a sexist. But it further undermines the case for subjecting legislation banning same-sex marriage to a lower standard of review than other sex-discriminatory laws. In modern jurisprudence, even laws that are formally gender-neutral or race-neutral are subjected to heightened scrutiny if they were enacted in large part out of racist sexist motives . This principle applies with even greater force to laws that are not gender-neutral at all, because, as Girgis himself puts it , they “involve.. treating sex as Virginia’s ban [on interracial marriage] in Loving had treated race.”
II. Is there a unique “conceptual” connection between between opposite-sex marriage and reproduction? Does it matter if there is?
Girgis also tries to clarify his central argument for exempting laws banning same-sex marriage from heightened scrutiny, its connection to reproduction:
When a policy’s form triggers extra scrutiny, again, judges pivot to examining its justifications: the state’s reasons for thinking that the classification is sufficiently linked to a legitimate interest….
But my point was that in the case of a law classifying by sexual composition—by male-female pairing—the law’s form itself already points to its own link to the common good, apart from mere social conventions, or merely contingent data about men and women. So the justification of this classification begins to appear at the first, “formal” stage of analysis….
neither (a) reproduction nor (b) its social value nor (c) its link to the male-female pairing is just a social construct….
Likewise, my argument isn’t undermined by Somin’s objection that “adoption and artificial insemination” make “same-sex marriage . . . also closely connected to reproduction.” Neither adoption nor reproductive technology weakens the conceptual link tying male-female union to reproduction. So they do not justify a judicial presumption against classifications based on the male-female pairing. Even finding ways to make children out of two ova or two sperm cells wouldn’t cut that link. It would only mean that, while male-female union has a conceptual link to reproduction, other groupings could have a contingent, technologically enabled link. The latter (unlike the male-female) link would require inquiry into empirical data; and it wouldn’t be limited to same- or opposite-sex couples, but any group of adults deciding to produce and rear children.
None of this provides a good reason to treat laws banning same-sex marriage differently from other laws that discriminate on the basis of gender. At the risk of belaboring the obvious, it is important to emphasize that an opposite-sex relationship is neither necessary nor sufficient for reproduction to occur. Many opposite-sex couples are unwilling or unable to reproduce by standard biological means (e.g.- because of age or sterility). Conversely, reproduction and child-raising can and do occur in same-sex relationships. Girgis makes much of the fact that “male and female are defined with respect to the physical potential for… reproduction.” But potential for reproduction is not the same thing as reproduction itself. The connection between potential and actuality is, in Girgis’ terms, a merely “contingent” one.
Moreover, legal status of marriage is not and never has been limited to those couples who are willing and able to engage in conventional biological reproduction. There is of course a high correlation between marriage and biological reproduction. But that connection, although strong and important, is also “social” or “contingent” rather than “conceptual.” Or, if it can be considered conceptual despite the fact that it is not an inevitable link, then the same goes for the connection between same-sex marriage and reproduction.
It is also worth noting that, as a social good, reproduction cannot be separated from child-raising. The latter is the main purpose of the former. And even if same-sex relationships had no direct connection to reproduction whatsoever, they still clearly can and do facilitate child-raising. Including them in the institution of marriage enhances same-sex couples’ ability to raise children in a variety of ways .
Finally, even if there was a conceptual connection between opposite-sex marriage and reproduction in some strong sense of the term that does not apply to same-sex couples, this still would not justify exempting laws excluding the latter from heightened judicial scrutiny. The whole point of heightened scrutiny is to ensure that the gender classification in question really is necessary to advance the interest in question, and that there is not a comparably effective gender-neutral way of achieving the same goal. The need to conduct that inquiry is not obviated by the existence of a “conceptual” connection. In this case, the ability of opposite-sex marriage to facilitate reproduction and child-raising is in no way impaired by extending marriage rights to same-sex couples. In states where same-sex marriage exists, opposite-sex couples can still reproduce and raise children, and the institution of marriage can still facilitate those activities.

Assam Muslims for speedy  unbiased probe into jihadiactivitiesPrint
Written by Samudra Gupta Kashyap | Guwahati | Posted: October 24, 2014 8:51 pm
With the Assam Police widening its net to apprehend persons having links to jihadi groups including the Jama’atul Mujahideen Bangladesh, a group of leading Muslim citizens of Assam today urged the government to carry out speedy but unbiased investigations into such activities in the state. It also asked the government to mete out stringent punishment to those found guilty.
“The Muslims of Assam do not support any kind of terrorist activity and strongly condemns any kind of terrorist activity carried out in the name of jihad,” a resolution adopted in a meeting of leading Muslim citizens of the state said here today. The group also called upon all right-thinking Muslims and such organizations to intensify public opinion against such anti-national and terrorist activities.
Presided over by veteran journalist Haider Hussain, the meeting also asked the government to take care so that the entire Muslim community was harassed due to suspicion as an outcome of anti-national activities carried out by a handful of persons who have gone astray. “The Muslim community should also remain alert against elements that might drag members of the community into anti-national and criminal activities by taking advantage of their socio-economic backwardness,” the group in an appeal issued here today said.
Interestingly, even as the Assam Police have arrested six Muslim persons from Barpeta district on October 10 for their alleged links with JMB, a section of All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) leaders have said that those arrested should not be labeled as terrorists until proven guilty in a court of law. They has also alleged that the Congress government in the state had hatched a conspiracy to brand Muslims as jihadis.

Six men who were arrested by the Assam Police two weeks ago for their alleged connection with the explosion in Burdwan, West Bengal were sent to judicial custody by the Chief Judicial Magistrate (CJM) here on Friday.
The six men, Shaikhul Islam @ Abdullah (20), Rafikul Islam (39), Md. Shiraj Ali Khan (53), Jahuruddin (60), Golam Usmani (23) and Sarbesh Ali (35), hail from three different villages in Barpeta district. Among them, Shaikhul Islam alias Abdulla of Kahikuchi village in Barpeta is said to be an important member of the Jama’atul Mujahideen Bangladesh (Party of the Mujahideen) sleeper cell in Assam, the police said.
While the police had sought remand for two of them – Shaikhul Islam and Rafikul Islam – the CJM’s court rejected that plea and remanded all of them in judicial custody for two weeks. They will be required to be produced before the court again on November 5. Both Shaikhul Islam and Rafikul Islam are also said to have been a close associate of Shakil Ahmed, a JMB operative who was one of the two persons killed in the Burdwan blast on October 2.
Meanwhile, Assam Police director-general Khagen Sarma has said that the police have information that some youths from Assam were visiting Bangladesh at the instance of the JMB. “We have received information against some youths who have been visiting Bangladesh for getting training under the Islamic terror networks such as the JMB to carry out terror attacks,” Sarma said on Thursday. He also said the police have evidence against the six persons arrested in Barpeta and had kept them under surveillance till they were arrested on October 10.

Elton John and David Furnish put LGBT community on notice in fight against HIV/AIDSBy Jonathan Capehart October 24 Follow @capehartj
Elton John and David Furnish (Timothy Clary/AFP/Getty Images)
There is this myth that marriage equality is the silver bullet for all the ails in the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community. As if having the right to say “I do” in all 50 states will solve everything. It won’t . Tomorrow night, Sir Elton John and his longtime partner, David Furnish, will remind everyone at the Human Rights Campaign’s annual national dinner that the HIV/AIDS epidemic still demands our attention. And they will challenge the LGBT community to act.
“This is the critical moment in our fight, and so many of us don’t seem to care. Even in our own community. Especially in our own community,” John will say, according to prepared remarks he shared with me Friday. This comes after he rattles off some startling statistics from the Kaiser Family Foundation, including how “only 30 percent of gay and bisexual men have had an HIV test in the past year. A majority of gay men don’t even talk about HIV with their friends or partners. More than 60 percent don’t even talk about HIV with their doctor.”
Musician and AIDS activist Sir Elton John said on Friday that his new partnership with PEPFAR, the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, will work to create an “AIDS-free society.” (Reuters)
John and Furnish will announce at the dinner a $300,000 grant to the HRC to assist in its HIV/AIDS prevention and advocacy around the root causes of the epidemic’s spread. “Our grant . . . is the beginning of a new initiative to refocus and reenergize the LGBT fight against AIDS,” Furnish told me in an email. And in his prepared remarks he will decry the lack of compassion for those who contract HIV/AIDS, which only serves to help spread the disease.
If a young gay man won’t get tested because he’s afraid of the stigma attached to HIV, that’s how the virus spreads. If a former prisoner can’t get the medicine she needs to bring her viral levels down, because no one cares about prisoners, that’s how HIV spreads. If a drug user won’t bother with rehabilitation or HIV prevention because he has been told time and again that his life is worthless, that is how HIV spreads.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about 50,000 people become HIV positive every year. Most of them are young African American men who have sex with men. Most of them live in the South. Compounding the impact of the silence in the gay community is the opposition to Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act. As I wrote last month, HIV/AIDS continues to rage in the South.

This devastating map and others like it were brought to my attention by Lauren Banks of AIDS Alabama. It turns out that her organization and many like it are supported by the Elton John AIDS Foundation (EJAF). According to Funders for LGBTQ Issues, not only is EJAF the largest funder of gay organizations in the South , it is also the No. 1 funder of black LGBT organizations .
“We now know that AIDS thrives where it’s ignored. So it’s no surprise that the South, for example, is the new American epicenter for AIDS. Or that African Americans are eight times more likely to contract HIV than whites. Many Southern states don’t provide proper treatment options for AIDS, or have LGBT-friendly health care policies. And the African American community has been neglected for too long,” John told me. “These failures have nothing to do with science, and everything to do with getting health care and information to the marginalized groups that need it most. That’s why we support organizations that help the people and communities that are being ignored. The real fight against AIDS is taking place in low-income communities, in the rural south, and in the inner-city. That’s where we need to get to work.”
In addition to the grant to the HRC, John and Furnish will soon announce another $1.1 million in grants to organizations battling HIV/AIDS. In D.C., where HIV/AIDS is an epidemic on par with West Africa , EJAF funding has gone to AIDS United , HIPS and the National Black Justice Coalition .
“Thanks to advancements in science and hard advocacy work, HIV is no longer a death sentence. Unfortunately, some members of the LGBT community have taken that to mean they can ignore the AIDS epidemic,” Furnish told me. “No one’s going to save us but ourselves. It’s on us to put an end to HIV.”

New Delhi: Despite the bitterness in Indo-Pak ties, Pakistan has sent 'Diwali sweets' to President Pranab Mukherjee and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The sweets, by Pakistan High Commissioner Abdul Basit and his wife, were also sent to External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj. According to sources, Basit sent the boxes to the Prime Minister's Office for Modi apart from the President and the External Affairs Minister and seemed an "initiative" taken totally at the High Commission level.
Significantly, Indian forces have not offered sweets to their Pakistani counterparts on Diwali in the wake of repeated ceasefire violations by Pakistan along the border.

The Border Security Force (BSF) in Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir did not exchange sweets and greetings, a goodwill gesture carried out during major occasions, especially festivals like Diwali and Eid.
"In the light of present scenario with Pakistan, this time India has decided not to offer sweets to Pakistan on Diwali," Jalandhar-based BSF IG, Punjab Frontier, Ashok Kumar told PTI over phone.
There were repeated ceasefire violations by Pakistan along LoC as well as International Border in Jammu and Kashmir recently, he said, adding, therefore, offering of sweets to Pakistani counterparts was "totally out of question."
"This Diwali we did not exchange sweets with the Pakistani side following the heightened tension along the International Border," a senior BSF officer said in Jammu. The Army also did not hold any function along the Line of Control and no sweets were exchanged with the Pakistani troops.

Govt aims at 50th position in ease of doing businessrankingThe Commerce and Industry Ministry has already taken several measures and has proposed series of steps. Reuters
By: Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: October 24, 2014 10:18 pm
The government is aiming to improve India’s ranking in ease of doing business index to 50th position in the next two years from the current 134th.
The Commerce and Industry Ministry has already taken several measures and has proposed series of steps, including drastically reducing the time for registration of business to one day, single registration of all labour laws and cut in number of taxes to improve ease of doing business in India.
“Aim is to improve the ranking to 50th position in two years from 134th at present. Different government departments have already started consultation and deliberations on steps to improve India’s ranking,” sources said.
They added that meetings would continue to remove all the barriers and simplify the cumbersome procedures related to approvals and clearance mechanism for business activities.
According to a World Bank report, India has slipped three positions to 134th spot in the latest ‘ease of doing business’ list, which is topped by Singapore.
The Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP), has identified sectors and specific reforms that are urgently required to substantially improve India’s ranking in ease of doing business.
The department has listed as many as 46 action points for different central government ministries and state governments for improving the business climate.
For Corporate Affairs Ministry, it has suggested that the time taken in registration of business from existing 27 days be reduced to only one day as in Canada and New Zealand.
It has also called for doing away with the requirement of company seal and removal of minimum paid up capital for starting a business.
It has suggested introduction of Bankruptcy Law, Unified Insolvency Code, speedy constitution of benches under National Company Law
Tribunal and fixing of a definite and predictable timeframe for rehabilitation and liquidation process.
Similarly, it has recommended reduction in number of taxes and permitting online payment of taxes; simplification of complex tax processes; expediting implementation of Direct Tax Code, Goods and Services tax besides abolition of minimum alternate tax for SEZ developers and units.
Further, it has called for a uniform policy and procedure for all states for a single window clearance along with combined application form and single registration for VAT and other state taxes.
The DIPP has also proposed timelines to implement these initiatives, aimed at attracting investments as part of the Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Make In India’ campaign.
During the last three years, India received an average of USD 30 billion annual foreign direct investment.
India needs huge investments to give a boost to its manufacturing sector and to create million of jobs.

Maria Sharapova loses No1 ranking to SerenaWilliamsMaria Sharapova lost the top ranking to Serena Williams after being eliminated from WTA Finals in Singapore. (Source: AP)
By: Associated Press | Singapore | Posted: October 24, 2014 9:46 pm | Updated: October 24, 2014 9:48 pm
Maria Sharapova failed to advance out of the WTA Finals groups and conceded the year-end No.1 ranking to Serena Williams despite a three-set victory over Agnieszka Radwanska on Wednesday.
Sharapova needed to win in straight sets to have a chance of progressing in the tournament, and had to win the title 10 years after her first time if she was to topple Williams from the top of the rankings.
Sharapova inexplicably collapsed from a set and 5-1 up, missing three match points and losing the second set in a tiebreak. The Russian ultimately prevailed 7-5,   6-2 in over three hours but she will go home while Radwanska qualified for the semifinals despite a 1-2 group-stage record.
Radwanska was helped by Caroline Wozniacki beating Petra Kvitova 6-2, 6-3. Kvitova would have progressed had she won.
Williams takes the year-end top ranking for the fourth time, beside 2002, 2009 and 2013.
Since the rankings began in 1975, only five players have held the No. 1 spot at year end four times or more. The others were Steffi Graf (eight times), Martina Navratilova (seven), Chris Evert (five) and Lindsay Davenport (four).
Wozniacki finished top of her group with Radwanska second. Their semifinal opponents would be known late Friday, after Simona Halep faced Ana Ivanovic.
Halep would finish top of her group and Williams runner-up, unless Ivanovic won in straight sets, in which case the Serb and Halep would advance, with the order to be determined by percentage of games won through the tournament.
Sharapova, the 2004 champion and two-time runner-up, was left to rue an unforeseeable collapse from a dominant position in the second set against Radwanska, who won five straight games.
The Russian converted only two of six break points in that set, against two of three by Radwanska, and said she became too hasty as she tried to close out the match.
“A little impatient, her doing a good job of retrieving balls — that is her strength — and going for a little bit more than I should have,” Sharapova said in explaining what went wrong in the second set.
“I know I’m not moving forward but I’m proud of that effort, and to finish the year in this way.”
For the match, Sharapova had a 61-12 advantage in winners, but committed 63 unforced errors against just 17 by the Pole.
Radwanska assumed she was going out in straight sets, so began to play looser tennis and it paid off in that second set.
“In that case you pretty much know that it’s over, so you are more relaxed and she got tighter a little bit,” Radwanska said. “It was easy for me to play, there are not so many nerves as early in the match.”

Top Jet Airways Officer Subodh Karnik Quits
Press Trust of India | Updated On: October 24, 2014 23:58 (IST)
New Delhi: Top Jet Airways' officer Subodh Karnik has quit the airline, becoming the latest in a spate of resignations from the premier private carrier after Gulf-based Etihad Airways picked up a 24 per cent stake in it.
Mr Karnik was appointed chief operating officer-designate, pending regulatory clearances, only in July this year.
A spokesperson for the airline said Mr Karnik left Jet for "family reasons".
There have been several other high-profile exits in the carrier over the past few months. They include two CEOs Nikos Kardassis and Gary K Toomey, chief commercial officer Sudheer Raghavan, chief financial officer Ravishankar Gopalakrishnan and vice president (investor relations) K G Vishwanath, after Jet and Abu Dhabi-based Etihad struck the deal in November last year.
"Subodh Karnik, Chief Operating Officer (Designate) will be leaving Jet Airways for family reasons and is returning to Atlanta to be closer to his wife and children who were unable to move to India," a Jet spokesperson said here.
"He will continue to work with Jet Airways in an advisory capacity on key strategic initiatives," she added.
Mr Karnik, who took over from Hameed Ali after the latter joined the airline's board, was given the task to oversee commercial and sales functions of the airline.
Mr Karnik had earlier worked for several global airlines like North West, Continental and Delta Airlines and was also the CEO of Global Aero Logistics, one of the largest provider of private air charter service to US military and corporates.
Cramer Ball, a former chief executive from Air Seychelles in which Etihad has a stake, is now the CEO of Jet Airways after receiving security and regulatory nod.

Study: Democrats are more likely than Republicans to believe in fortune-telling  astrology and ghostsBy Christopher Ingraham October 24 Follow @_cingraham

Human beings are, in general, a superstitious lot. Our tendency to see patterns where they don't exist, and to falsely apply cause to effect, may have helped keep us alive back when we were little more than a band of frightened critters scurrying about the savanna. Those tendencies linger to the present day, reflected in our stubborn belief in completely irrational things: Rabbit's feet. Horoscopes. A return to the gold standard.
The Chapman University Survey on American Fears , a comprehensive study of the fears, phobias and irrational beliefs of the American people, was just released this week and contains an interesting section on belief in the paranormal. The results are drawn from a nationally-representative sample of 2,500 American adults.
It finds that belief in certain paranormal phenomenon - like influencing the world with physical thought, and foretelling the future with dreams - are fairly widespread. On the other hand, few Americans actually believe in astrology.
 
It's instructive to compare Americans' belief in the paranormal with their understanding of scientific knowledge. For instance, a 2014 AP poll found that 51 percent of Americans said they were confident that childhood vaccines are safe and effective. This is roughly the same proportion of Americans who believe houses or rooms can be haunted by spirits.
Slightly over 40 percent of Americans believe in UFOs. This is considerably higher than the share of Americans who are confident that global warming is real, that life evolved through natural selection, or that the earth is 4.5 billion years old.
About as many Americans say they believe in Bigfoot as say they're confident that the universe began with a big bang.
The Chapman authors provided me with breakdowns by party affiliation. In general, Democrats were slightly and in some cases significantly more likely than Republicans to believe in paranormal phenomena: 75.6 percent of Democrats agreed that positive thoughts could influence the physical world, compared to 68.6 percent of Republicans.
Democrats were significantly more likely than Republicans to believe in fortune telling, and about twice as likely to believe in astrology.
 
On the other hand, Republicans were significantly more likely to say that Satan causes most evil in the world, a reflection of the higher degree of religiosity in the Republican party.
There were no significant partisan differences on belief in Atlantis, UFOs or Bigfoot.

Premature to talk of US troop cuts in Asia: JohnKerrySecretary of State John Kerry said on Friday that it was too early to discuss cutting the number of US troops.
By: Agence-France Presse | Washington | Posted: October 24, 2014 10:40 pm
Secretary of State John Kerry said on Friday that it was too early to discuss cutting the number of US troops stationed in Asia and South Korea, amid increased tensions on the heavily guarded peninsula.
The top US diplomat insisted before any such moves could happen North Korea must first show a serious commitment to rejoining six-party talks on ending its suspect nuclear program.
Asked after meeting his South Korean counterpart Yun Byung-se whether Washington would consider reducing its military presence in Asia if North Korea returned to the stalled nuclear negotiations, Kerry ruled out the idea.
“The mere entering into talks is not an invitation to take any actions regarding troops or anything else at this point. It would be way too premature to have any thought, or even discussion” along those lines, Kerry said.
“The only purpose of entering the talks is to come to an understanding regarding first the denuclearization and then following the denuclearization obviously whatever relationship might be appropriate.”
He also ruled out any idea of visiting isolated North Korea and meeting leader Kim Jong-un in the near term. Washington and Pyongyang do not have diplomatic ties.
Yun said South Korea was awaiting a “clear stance” on Pyongyang’s nuclear policy and “a halt to the sophistication of its nuclear weapons.”
“All of this has to be real. It has to lead to real solutions,” Yun said.

NorthEast United go past 9-man Mumbai2-0By: Press Trust of India | Mumbai | Posted: October 24, 2014 10:26 pm
NorthEast United struck twice in the second half in a remarkable turnaround to stun Mumbai City FC 2-0 in a Hero Indian Super League match which saw the home side reduced to nine men in the end on Friday.
The home side, who had thrashed Pune City FC 5-0 in their previous match, failed to score a goal despite dominating the proceedings early in the match in front of their home crowd at the D Y Patil Stadium.
The first half belonged to Mumbai City FC but the visitors came back in the second half with a superior performance as they scored two goals to run away winners in their first away match of the tournament.
Zambia’s Kondwani Mtonga grabbed the opener in the 57th minute when he collected Koke’s pass to work past the lone defender Tiago Ribeiro and custodian Subrata Paul.
NorthEast United FC doubled the lead in the injury time when James Keene, who came in place of Koke in the 69th minute, fed the ball to Guilherme Felipe who just had to beat the goalkeeper, to seal the issue for the visiting side.
The match also saw some bizarre moments as Mumbai could not send in a replacement for injured marquee player Frederik Ljungberg who pulled his hamstring in the 72nd minute as the home side have used all their substitutions by then, leaving them one man short.
Coach Peter Reid later said that Ljungberg has pulled his hamstring.
Making matters worse, Mumbai were reduced to nine men on the field when Czech defender Pavel Cmovs had to leave the field in the 75th minute after getting his second yellow card of the match.
Mumbai now have just three points from two matches while NorthEast have added three points to their kitty, taking their tally to seven from four games.
Mumbai now take on Chennaiyin FC on October 28 in an away encounter, while NorthEast play against Delhi Dynamos in the capital city on October 29.
The hosts played the first few minutes of the second half with just 10 men on the field as Ljungberg kept trying to grab the assistant referee’s attention to substitute him in place of Andre Moritz.
John Abraham co-owned NorthEast United looked like a renewed side in the second half with Durga Boro creating a couple of chances after the goal-less first half.
Mumbai’s Brazilian import Andre Moritz, who dazzled with his hat-trick against Pune, came close to giving his side a lead in the seventh minute but his effort was off-target.
Winger Nadong Bhutia wasted an opportunity when he failed to pass the ball accurately to Subash Singh in the 14th minute.
The hosts, who were dominant from the start, had no trouble in weaving their way into the other half and created a lot of chances. But they continued…

How Chipotle Has Revolutionized The Way We EatOne Way Chipotle Has Completely Revolutionized How We Eat
Posted:
reddit
Judging by our eating habits, we've become a nation of adult babies eating pre-cut food out of bowls.
Instead of sitting in highchairs toying with our cooked beef and rice, we shovel our lunches into our mouths while typing at computers in open-plan offices or robotically scrolling through our News Feeds.
Always an option at home and some restaurants, the bowl meal truly launched a decade ago when Chipotle first introduced its burrito bowl, a diners’ choice of rice, beans, meat, salsa and other fixings mixed up in a bowl. Chipotle now sells more bowls than burritos, according to Chris Arnold, a spokesman for the chain. Though Chipotle doesn't break out revenue by menu item, its success overall has been meteoric -- with revenue rising about 11 percent from $2.73 billion in 2012 to $3.04 billion so far this year.
Sales of so-called Mexican bowls at fast-casual restaurants went up 14 percent over the past two years, according to data from Technomic, a food research firm. The number of chains offering "Asian bowls" with ingredients like noodles, chicken, rice and vegetables grew 8 percent over the same period, according to Technomic. Chipotle’s Asian-themed spinoff, ShopHouse, exclusively sells bowls comprised of a base of rice, noodles or salad mixed with a protein like grilled chicken satay, vegetables and a choice of curry and tamarind sauces.
A Chipotle burrito bowl.
Besides just tasting good, the bowls play into some recent dining trends: the rise of gluten-free eating and the popularity of protein over carbs as people turn away from bread-heavy sandwiches. We're also increasingly picky, and a setup with a base of grain or lettuce and a choice of toppings allows us to dictate our meals to our exact preferences.
Perhaps more importantly, bowls are also perfect for workers looking for meals they can eat easily at their desks.
“No one is sitting down and eating a meal you have to cut up into little pieces,” said Kira Fisher, who runs the blog Sad Desk Lunch , which succinctly sums up the bowl trend. “It takes a lot of space to eat like a proper person.”
Some industry observers dismiss the bowl meal as trend. But it hints at more troubling concerns, said Marlene Schwartz, the director at Yale’s Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity.
Part of the recommended treatment for obesity and eating disorders is to “sit at a table without the television on and actually eat your food with a knife and fork,” Schwartz said. “The fact that that’s part of the treatment means that we’ve really moved away from it” as a society, she added.
Forking a mixture of rice, vegetables and meat into your mouth while looking at email or making phone calls isn’t an ideal way to eat, according to Schwartz. “People do tend to eat more and not realize how much they’re eating” if they’re distracted by another task, she said.
It’s true that in some cultures, people regularly eat stews, noodles and sushi without a knife and fork, and those meals are often unrushed family or even community events. But the elimination of the knife and the move towards the bowl at fast food and fast-casual restaurants is largely a Western invention of convenience.
Traditional fast food restaurants are on trend, too. The number of fast food restaurants offering a "bowl meal" grew by 5.6 percent between 2010 and 2014, according to research from Dataessential, a Chicago-based firm that tracks food industry trends.
Taco Bell launched a Cantina Power Menu earlier this year, which includes a selection of steak, chicken and veggie bowls featuring lettuce, guacamole, pico de gallo, cheese, sour cream and rice. KFC has offered its “famous bowl” line -- a mix of mashed potatoes, bite-sized crispy chicken pieces, gravy and cheese -- since 2006.
Many of the submissions coming into Fisher’s blog celebrate the old-school bowl meal: leftovers of a meat and rice stew or lasagna that were better the night before. “There’s always been casseroles and one-dish meals,” said Mary Chapman, senior director of product innovation at Technomic. “How it’s positioned is new.”
A sampling of the classic one-dish bowl lunch:
Part of the appeal of the bowls offered in fast-casual and fast food restaurants is that they can stand in for many of the standard lunch items, Chapman said. They’re “a way to have a big giant sandwich without having to hold it in your hand” or “a healthful alternative without having to be a salad,” she said.
But the rise in restaurants offering a bunch of ingredients mixed up in a bowl is “pure trend” that’s liable to go out of fashion, said David Just, a behavioral economist at Cornell University who has studied why people eat what they do.
“It’s trying to play to a modern idea of what’s beautiful and attractive,” Just said, noting that bowls also allow restaurants to rein in portion sizes because it takes less food to make a bowl look full.
And customers seemed convinced. A group of 16-year-old boys having their first-ever off-campus lunch at a Manhattan Chipotle one recent afternoon bragged about their ability to game the system by ordering bowls. “They give you more if you get the bowl,” one said. “I got it literally every day this summer,” another noted. An 18-year-old NYU student having a quick lunch by himself cited similar reasons for choosing a bowl instead of a burrito. “It’s more calories, more bang for your buck,” he said.
(That may be more perception than reality. According to Chipotle’s calorie calculator, burrito bowls typically have about 300 fewer calories than burritos.)
Out of 13 people who went through the line in about a 15-minute period during the lunch rush at the restaurant, just four ordered burritos. The other nine opted for bowls.
Even Mitt Romney gets a burrito bowl at Chipotle.
Eating without a plate, knife and fork has become so ubiquitous, we may have actually reached peak bowl. While the number of bowls on the menus of fast food and fast-casual chains grew between 2010 and 2014, it declined in fine dining restaurants, according to research from Datassential, a Chicago-based firm that studies food industry trends.
Once a trend starts to fall off in more expensive eateries, that typically means it’s saturated the market as much as it’s going to, according to Christin Groh, a senior manager on the MenuTrends team at Datassential. “It may end up tapering off,” Groh said. “In recent years, penetration has really remained flat.”
Still that doesn’t mean bowls are disappearing from restaurants like Chipotle any time soon. As Cornell's Just said, diners "are looking for things that are easy to eat and go without much thought.”

The Tragic Reality Of Americans  Vacation DaysAmericans Are Taking Fewer Vacation Days Than At Any Point In Nearly 4 Decades
Reuters
reddit
WASHINGTON, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Americans took the least  amount of vacation time in almost four decades last year,  forfeiting billions of dollars in compensation without scoring  points with their bosses, according to an industry group  analysis released on Tuesday.
The report for the U.S. Travel Association said the average  American with paid time off (PTO) used 16 of 20.9 vacation days  in 2013, down from an average of 20.3 days off from 1976 to  2000. It added that 169 million days of permanently forfeited  U.S. vacation time equated to $52.4 billion in lost benefits.
"By choosing to work instead of taking PTO, employees are  essentially working for their employers for free," the analysis  said.
The report did not give a reason for the drop in vacation  time but the fall coincided with the 2007-2009 recession and a  slow economic recovery. An Ipsos/Reuters survey in 2010 found  that only 57 percent of Americans used all their vacation time.
Wealthier workers tend to earn more vacation days, and also  leave more of it on the table, according to the study. People  with an annual income of more than $150,000 failed to use an  average of 6.5 vacation days last year, while those with less  than $29,000 did not use 3.7 days on average.
Employees who foreited paid time off do not get more raises  or bonuses than those who take all their vacation time. They  also report higher levels of stress at work, the survey said.
"America's work martyrs aren't more successful. We need to  change our thinking. All work and no play is not going to get  you ahead - it's only going to get you more stress,"  Roger Dow,  president and CEO of the U.S. Travel Association, said in a  statement accompanying the report.
The analysis was prepared by Oxford Economics, a forecasting  group. It used Labor Department data and a June survey of 1,303  workers by GfK Public Affairs and Corporate Communications in  conjunction with Oxford Economics.

Pakistan s Assembly passes resolution against  Indian aggressionPrint
By: Press Trust of India | Islamabad | Posted: October 23, 2014 6:18 pm | Updated: October 23, 2014 6:22 pm
Pakistan’s parliament on Thursday unanimously passed a resolution against the alleged “unprovoked and indiscriminate” ceasefire violations by India and asked the government to seek UN intervention to resolve the Kashmir issue.
The resolution, moved by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s Adviser on Foreign Affairs Sartaj Aziz, stated that the National Assembly condemned Indian ceasefire violations at the Line of Control (LoC) and the International Border (IB).
It strongly condemned unprovoked and indiscriminate ceasefire violations by India on LoC and IB resulting into loss of human and material losses.
13 Pakistani nationals have been killed in exchange of fire since September 13.
It called upon the Government that while pursuing bilateral dialogue with India, the issue should be raised at the UN and with the international community urging them to play their role in resolution of Kashmir dispute in accordance with the wishes of Kashmiri people.
Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said Pakistan’s military was capable of responding to all aggression. He said that India was mistaken if it thought Pakistan’s internal issued could be used to its advantage.
“India should not misunderstand Pakistan’s initiative towards peace as our weakness…We can respond effectively,” Asif said.
He said that both countries were nuclear and should refrain from any kind of misadventure.
The house also expressed concern over the plight of people of Kashmir living under “Indian occupation.”
Meanwhile, Foreign Office Spokesperson Tasneem Aslam alleged that Indian forces under the cover of unprovoked firing were engaged in constructing bunkers in locations within 500 metres of the IB.
The construction of these bunkers is in violation of the 2010 agreement between New Delhi and Islamabad, she said.
“Pakistan would never permit this construction which is in violation of a bilateral agreement,” Aslam said.
The agreement prohibits any construction, including that of bunkers, within 500 metres of either side of the international boundary.
Pakistan’s Punjab provincial assembly had on Wednesday unanimously adopted a resolution condemning “Indian aggression” at the IB and urged the international community to take note of the situation.

The revamped Regency Restaurant at Abad Plaza boasts an all-encompassing menu
Abad Hotel’s Regency restaurant’s redone, revamped, cheerful and bright interiors in violet and cream welcome us. The buffet spread at the restaurant has always been popular among corporates, shoppers and those looking to eat out. A buffet is easy, it is fast, you can’t go wrong with it and for lunch it is perfect.
The revamped restaurant is spacious unlike in its previous avatar. And there is plenty of natural light which gives it an airy feel.
The multi-cuisine restaurant boasts an impressive menu spanning continents and countries. Dinner is an a la carte affair, complete with the karaoke experience of Mohd. Rafi, Kishore Kumar, Mukesh songs.
The lunch buffet is extensive, complete with a tempting array of desserts. “On any given day there are a couple of dishes which are chefs’ innovations,” says executive chef Jayakumar. The surprises awaiting us on the day were Hawaiian miso dumplings and Turfan beef.
Both of which were different from anything one has eaten before, especially the beef which had the strong flavours of ground green chillies
The highlight of the lunch, however, are the a la carte dishes—the dramatically named Tom Sawyer’s fish, honey chilli prawns and murg malai kebab – which the chef wants to showcase.
Sliced fillet of Mahi fish topped with white sauce on a bed of rice bordered with green, yellow and red bell-peppers, chopped fine and rings of olives is a visual treat, and the complete meal assures Jayakumar, one which is very popular with the kids and tourists from abroad, says the chef. Why Tom Sawyer? “Because of its appeal for children,” he adds. A name like that would, undoubtedly, arouse curiosity.
Continental done, we move to the Chinese part of the menu and in come honey chilli prawns fried crisp with a glistening coating of honey. Spicy in parts, tangy in others...the sweetness of honey misleads the palate as the gingery aftertaste provides that spicy kick.
From the bland, easy on the palate, fish to the fiery-sweet honey chilli prawns, it is a leap across continents in terms of flavours. The creamy murgh malai kebabs are bite-sized chunks of chicken with hints of spices. The kebabs and the prawns make for filling finger foods too.
Squid rings, prawn cocktails, cashew chicken and the super healthy farmhouse broth are just some of the other dishes on the revamped menu which has plenty on offer.

Models say Gujarat must be wary of brewing Arabian Sea cycloneModels say Gujarat must be wary of brewing Arabian Sea cyclone
Vinson Kurian

Thiruvananthapuram, Oct 21:  
A day after its genesis, a rogue low-pressure area in the Arabian Sea is forecast to become a tropical cyclone by a number of weather models.
India Met Department appears to take the brewing cyclone to the northwest Arabian Sea for a likely landfall over the Yemen-Oman coast in another week’s time.
Likely target
But two other leading models suspect that the system may steer to the north-northeast and strike south Gujarat around Surat and adjoining Mumbai in a week’s time.
These are the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts and a Global Forecast Model of the US National Centres for Environmental Prediction.
India Met has located the low-pressure area to the southeast Arabian Sea and neighbourhood and has put it already under watch for intensification.
The ‘low’ would strengthen a round to a well-marked ‘low’ by tomorrow and further into a depression two days later, according to a bulletin issued this afternoon.
India Met watch
But wind field projections depicted on its site hint its onward intensification as a likely tropical cyclone tracking away from the Indian coast in a west-northwest direction towards the Arabian Gulf, along the Yemen-Oman coastline.
The two other models stick their neck out suggesting that the cyclone would actually steer mid-course towards north-northeast and hit South Gujarat-Mumbai.
The timeline for the landfall in this manner is also around the month-end, around October 29-30, according to the European and US model forecasts.
Drains moisture
Meanwhile, the brewing weather system in the Arabian Sea has drained the south peninsula of some moisture.
This morning, an upper air cyclonic circulation has formed once again off the Sri Lanka coast, which should bring rain to parts of Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Lakshadweep today.
There is also the presence of the rain-friendly Madden-Julian Oscillation wave in the higher levels over the tropical Indian Ocean/west Arabian Sea.
According to the Met, the heavy rain may lift from tomorrow as the away-looking ‘low’ in the Arabian Sea starts intensifying.
Outlook for a counterpart ‘low’ in the Andaman Sea is retained, but models are not very confident about it since the entire activity is now shifting to the Arabian Sea.

Microsoft Co-Founder Bumps Ebola Effort to $100 Millionmicrosoft co-founder bumps ebola effort to $100 million
Billionaire Paul Allen pledges at least $100 million to fight EbolaBillionaire Paul Allen pledges at least $100 million to fight Ebola
Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen calls Ebola 'unlike any health crisis we have ever experienced'
Paul Allen, billionaire owner of sports teams and mega yachts, on Thursday pledged at least $100 million to fight Ebola in what is believed to be the largest private foundation gift to combat the deadly disease and support healthcare workers in West Africa.
The co-founder of Microsoft — who regularly inhabits lists of the richest and most generous Americans — has already donated an estimated $26.5 million toward his pledge, including $12.9 million to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, $3.6 million to UNICEF, $2.8 million to the International Red Cross and $1.3 million to Doctors Without Borders.
It was an epidemiologist¿s worst nightmare: one of the world¿s deadliest contagious diseases loose in one of the world¿s most densely populated and sometimes chaotic megacities ¿ Lagos, Nigeria. ( Robyn Dixon )
“The Ebola virus is unlike any health crisis we have ever experienced and needs a response unlike anything we have ever seen,” Allen said in a statement. “I am committed to tackling Ebola until it is stopped.”
The disease, which has spurred worldwide panic, travel restrictions and a scramble by hospitals and health agencies to contain it and prepare for its possible spread, is generally transmitted through direct contact with bodily fluids of an infected person.

The deadliest Ebola outbreak in history is believed to have infected nearly 10,000 people and claimed more than 4,800 lives, with the highest death toll in Liberia, according to the World Health Organization. It pegs the cost of fighting the disease at $975 million.
WHO spokesman Daniel Epstein said his organization “welcomes all financial and technical support in our efforts to save the lives of those infected with Ebola in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, and to halt the spread of the epidemic as soon as possible. We need funds, and we need foreign medical teams most of all, to staff the 50 Ebola treatment centers now operating or under construction.”
With so many people possibly affected by this particularly deadly disease, funds have been hard to come by, especially from smaller donors who often step up to help in times of crisis.
“The small American donors are simply not there,” said Jack Shakely, president emeritus of the California Community Foundation. “It takes a wealthy donor to step up to the plate.”
Shakely is also a board member of Operation USA, a global relief organization that has sent medical supplies to Liberia, and he describes Ebola as “one of those horrible, horrible problems that can be fixed. [Allen] tends to be one of a group of social entrepreneurs who like to see results. This $100 million could, in fact, effect amazing results.”
How dare those .01%ers donate their money for a cause. This is a job for the gov't

The $100-million pledge by the owner of the Super Bowl champion Seattle Seahawks and the NBA’s Portland Trail Blazers is the latest in a stream of donations by wealthy individuals and foundations, many with ties to technology.
Last week, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, donated $25 million to the CDC Foundation, noting on his Facebook page that the deadly disease “could infect 1 million people or more over the next several months if not addressed.”
In September, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation gave $50 million to support the emergency response to the disease, and the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation committed $5 million. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation gave $1 million in August.
Allen plans to partner with the University of Massachusetts Medical School to provide medical workers and laboratory equipment in Liberia, with a particular focus on making sure that local hospitals are outfitted with decontamination equipment.
He also will fund the development and manufacture of two medevac containment units to evacuate medical workers from West Africa, what Dune Ives, senior director of Allen’s Vulcan Philanthropy, calls “safety cocoons.”
“As we started looking early on at what it is going to take, we recognized we need more trained healthcare workers to go to West Africa,” Ives said. “Personally, unless I knew I had safety and support to get back home if I got infected, I would think twice.”
The medevac units fit into airplanes and carry the kind of equipment and staff seen in hospital rooms, Ives said, adding that “right now, there is one plane that can safely medevac infected healthcare workers back to their country of origin. We wanted to provide the assurance of safe transport.”
One goal of Allen’s is to urge others to donate — individuals of modest means, corporations, foundations, the super-rich. To that end he has set up an online donation platform at TackleEbola.com to allow individuals to give money to specific areas of need.
“Time is not our ally in this fight,” Allen said in a blog posted Thursday. “The time is now to do the right thing. So let’s do this.”

Police: Gunman Acted Alone In Ottawa Shootingreddit
Canadian authorities confirmed early Thursday that there was only one shooter in Wednesday's horrific attack in Ottawa, the Associated Press reported.
Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, 32, was shot dead after opening fire near the Canadian Parliament building, killing Cpl. Nathan Cirillo and wounding three other people.
An Ottawa police spokesman had previously told HuffPost that they were looking for multiple possible suspects, but would not confirm the news later in a press conference.
Witnesses say Zehaf-Bibeau shot Cpl. Nathan Cirillo near the National War Memorial at point-blank range on Wednesday morning before being chased inside the Canadian Parliament building, where he was killed by Kevin Vickers, a sergeant-at-arms.

Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper characterized the attack as an act of terrorism and vowed a renewed crackdown on terrorist activity.
"This will lead us to strengthen our resolve and redouble our efforts and those of our national security agencies to take all necessary steps to identify and counter threats," Harper said in a televised address late on Wednesday.

Officials told the Globe and Mail that the Canadian government had been monitoring Zehaf-Bibeau over potential suspicious activity. He was deemed a "high-risk traveler" and had his passport taken away.
The Associated Press reports that court records appear to indicate that Zehaf-Bibeau had a string of convictions for assault, robbery, drug and weapons offenses, and other crimes.
A friend told the Globe and Mail that Zehaf-Bibeau had experienced a religious reawakening of late. Senior U.S. officials confirmed to the New York Times that he had recently converted to Islam.
In a brief interview with the Associated Press on Thursday, Zehaf-Bibeau's mother said she was crying for the victim's of Wednesday's attack, not for her son.
"Can you ever explain something like this?" she said. "We are sorry."
Wednesday's shooting came just days after a similar attack in Quebec, where Martin Rouleau-Couture attacked two soldiers with his car, killing one, before being apprehended by police. Rouleau-Couture was also a recent convert to Islam who was being monitored by federal authorities.

Surprise! The world s fastest growing consumer market is...World's fastest growing consumer... isn't Chinese
By Katie Holliday | CNBC –  Thu 23 Oct, 2014 4:19 AM IST

Burgeoning consumer markets usually bring the likes of China, India and Brazil to mind, but the top-five fastest growing ones aren't the usual suspects, according to a fresh report from Euromonitor International.
The fastest growing consumer market in the world is Malawi, a landlocked country in Southeast Africa, with a small population of 16.4 million consumers, Euromonitor found after analyzing markets by expected consumer expenditure and annual real growth this year. Consumer spending in Malawi, which is slightly smaller than the state of Pennsylvania, is set to grow 18.2 percent year-on-year in 2014, the report said.
Malawi's total consumer expenditure will likely reach $5.6 billion by the end of this year, translating into spending of only $335 per capita, the research firm said.
Read More China GDP beats, but growth rate slowest since crisis
The growth may be fast, but Euromonitor analysts cautioned that such a low level of spending inevitably limits business opportunities. Furthermore, finding ways to invest in Malawi can also be challenging, as barriers to investment include a shortage of foreign exchange and poor infrastructure.
"In the short term, consumer market growth in Malawi will be supported by the country's improved economic performance (which will help to raise incomes) and slowing consumer price inflation (which will raise consumer demand)," Euromonitor said.
The second-fastest growing consumer market may also come as a surprise to many: Sierra Leone.
The small Western Africa country is set to see rapid consumer expenditure growth this year, at a rate of 14.7 percent on year in real terms, Euromonitor said.
Read More Poverty data masks ongoing income strains
Its market is even smaller than Malawi with 6.1 million consumers and total consumer expenditure at $4.3 billion this year, equating to a higher per capita expenditure rate than Malawi at $688, Euromonitor said.
But the analysts added the caveat that Sierra Leone has been in the spotlight this year due to a high number of cases of people contracting the deadly Ebola virus. As a result, forecasts for growth are likely to be revised downwards as the outbreak takes its toll, adding to the country's challenges of poverty, youth unemployment, infrastructure deficit and corruption, it said.
In third place, central Asian state Turkmenistan has a consumer market set to expand 14.4 percent on year in real terms this year, Euromonitor said, supported by the fastest growth rate in annual disposable income globally.

Per capita consumer expenditure in Turkmenistan, which is slightly larger than California, will hit $3,594 in 2014, rising to $6,422 in 2020, it said.
"Rising incomes and a rapidly expanding middle class will create opportunities over the long term and across many sectors," said Euromonitor, flagging communications, education, leisure and recreation as the most dynamic sectors.
Fourth in line is Saudi Arabia, which has the highest level of per capita expenditure out of the entire top five, the report found, set to reach $7,786 in 2014.
Saudi Arabia's entire consumer market will reach $241 billion this year, and Euromonitor analysts have tipped hotels and catering as a sweet spot for consumer spending, with that sector's spending set to rise 15.6 percent year-on-year in real terms in 2014.

The east central Asia country, bordered by Russia to the North and China to the east, south and west, is set to enjoy 11.8 percent year-on-year growth in consumer expenditure this year, with the average per capita spending level reaching $1,785, the report said.
Euromonitor warned that the country's small population could restrict consumer demand growth in the future, but said nevertheless Mongolia is not to be ignored. It's one of the world's fastest growing economies and has taken enormous strides in tackling poverty and boosting incomes for consumers this year, it said.

How Ebola is fueling prejudice against gaysBy Ishaan Tharoor October 24 Follow @ishaantharoor

The victims of the Ebola epidemic gripping parts of West Africa aren't just the ones who contracted the virus. The infrastructure of whole nations is at a breaking point; hospitals and doctors are being pushed to their limits. Many Africans traveling to the United States, or at least intending to, have faced shameful racism from institutions and organizations that ought to know better. The virus has spread as a disease and a panic.
And, among other tragic effects, it has inflamed hatred toward gays.
That's right. According to a Reuters report , homosexuals in Liberia are facing threats and harassment after church groups linked the spread of the disease to their supposed sins.
"Since church ministers declared Ebola was a plague sent by God to punish sodomy in Liberia, the violence toward gays has escalated. They're even asking for the death penalty. We're living in fear," LGBT activist Leroy Ponpon told Reuters over the phone from Monrovia. The article elaborates:
Ponpon, an LGBT campaigner in the Liberian capital, says gays have been harassed, physically attacked and a few have had their cars smashed by people blaming them for the hemorrhagic fever, after religious leaders in Liberia said Ebola was a punishment from God for homosexuality.
The Liberian Council of Churches, as my colleague Terrence McCoy noted in August, released a statement saying "God is angry with Liberia, and that Ebola is a plague."  It went on:
Liberians have to pray and seek God's forgiveness over the corruption and immoral acts (such as homosexualism, etc.) that continue to penetrate our society. As Christians, we must repent and seek God's forgiveness.
"Voluntary sodomy" is a crime in Liberia and can lead to a year in jail. It is consistent with harsh anti-gay laws that exist in many African countries. According to Reuters, Ponpon is afraid to move around during the day -- local Liberian newspapers have printed his picture and phone number on their front pages. But a curfew imposed by authorities as a measure to deal with the epidemic means he can't go out at night either.
"All we want is protection," Ponpon told Reuters. "We want the government to come forward and say that this is a minority group and they deserve the same rights as anyone else and then people will stop attacking us."
Christian missionary and evangelical groups play a conspicuous role in parts of Africa, providing aid but also fanning bigotry and hate. In Uganda, American evangelicals have influenced the draconian anti-gay legislation being deliberated there.
And so it shouldn't be too surprising that some Christians across the Atlantic have imposed a similar narrative on the outbreak. In early August, Oklahoma conservative Christian radio host Rick Miles  appeared to echo the anti-gay Liberian clergymen, pinning the advent of the epidemic on a grab-bag of things loathed by American cultural conservatives.
"This Ebola epidemic can become a global pandemic, and that’s another name for plague," he said . "It may be the great attitude adjustment that I believe is coming. Ebola could solve America’s problems with atheism, homosexuality, sexual promiscuity, pornography and abortion."
In West Africa and the United States, it seems, such bigotry is one threat of the Ebola outbreak that is very real.
The number of people being monitored for symptoms of Ebola in the U.S. is growing. Here's how the virus spreads and how contact tracing works to stop outbreaks. (Gillian Brockell/The Washington Post)

Will Democrats cheer for record government revenueComments
By Ed Rogers October 24 Follow @EdRogersDC
Recently, the Obama Treasury Department announced that the government collected record revenue in 2014 . Is this a cause for celebration? If the government is taking in more money than ever, is it a sign of collective achievement or another sign that President Obama is driving us down? I would love to hear a Democrat campaigning for office cheer about how well the government is doing; how the government is collecting a record amount of money while the median household income for American families has dropped by about $1,600 since June 2009. Hooray!
Anyway, this raises the question of whether we are getting our money’s worth from this record revenue. A quick review of recent headlines – from the VA mismanagement to Obamacare costs to the Centers for Disease Control’s claim they need more money to combat Ebola – would suggest that we are not. And this highlights the management failures of this president. When a crisis confronts the White House, Obama feels compelled to appoint someone new, rather than delegate to his own Senate-confirmed Cabinet to address the problem du jour.
No doubt the White House is currently patting itself on the back for hiring Ron Klain as the Ebola czar; for “thinking outside the box” as The Post’s Juliet Eilperin and David Nakamura wrote this week. Well, maybe a little thinking inside the box is in order. It is remarkable that, despite the record government income and our skyrocketing national debt, Obama never seems to think the government is quite big enough or sufficient to handle the task at hand.
The Obama administration has collected record revenue this year, but the labor force participation rate has decreased to its lowest point since February 1978. Never have so many been dependent on so few. Even if it is not clearly in focus, part of what is on the ballot in November is the role of government and how big that government should be. Under Obama, we have seen record revenues, expenditures and deficits — not to mention a record number of people on food stamps, receiving disability payments, etc.  And, oh by the way, the debt under Obama has increased by $7.3 trillion in his six years in office so far.  For comparison, in the eight years under President George W. Bush, the national debt increased by $4.9 trillion.
The Obama administration is facilitating the uninhibited growth of government. It is fair to ask whether we have reached a tipping point in America, where more people want something from government than expect to be left alone by the government. The question of whether this trajectory is sustainable should be a bigger part of the political debate than it is. Our current path might be good for the government, but it is not good for American families.

Australia slumps to 282/8 at tea; Warner hits hundredAustralia slumps to 282/8 at tea; Warner hits hundred
PTI
Tweet
Dubai, Oct 24:  
Pakistan grabbed four wickets in the second session to eye a big first innings lead after David Warner’s aggressive hundred in the opening Test against Australia here today.
Warner, who made 133, was dismissed third ball after lunch as Australia fumbled to 282—8 at tea on the third day at Dubai stadium, still trailing Pakistan’s first innings total of 454 by 172 runs.
Mitchell Johnson (22) and Steve O’Keefe (four) were at the crease.
Debutant leg—spinner Yasir Shah (2—55) spun one sharply to bowl Warner, who by then had anchored the Australian innings in the first session.
It was the left—hander’s ninth Test century —— third consecutive in as many innings —— which took Australia to 207—4 at lunch after Pakistan fought back in the extended two—and—a—half hour morning session.
Warner hit 11 boundaries and two sixes during his 174—ball knock but his fall saw Australia slump against spinners.
Mitchell Marsh (27) and Brad Haddin (22) took Australia to 248—5 during their 42—run stand for the sixth wicket but Pakistan broke through with the new ball taken as soon it was due after 80 overs.
Debutant paceman Imran Khan had Haddin bowled off an inside edge while left—arm spinner Zulfiqar Babar had Marsh leg—before.

India Inc hails creation of Asia Infra Investment BankIndia Inc hails creation of Asia Infra Investment Bank
PTI
Tweet
Beijing, Oct 24:  
India Inc today welcomed the country’s participation in the newly—established Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) saying it will help to leverage badly needed funds for infrastructure development.
The moot point is that large economy like India really needs financing badly as it requires over a trillion USD for infrastructure development, A Didar Singh, Secretary General of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) said today.
India along 20 other countries signed the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to be its founding member.
“It is a very positive development in the sense that it opens up more borrowing opportunities. As another window of financing we welcome it,” Singh told PTI.
“There is tremendous requirement of funding in India for the a trillion USD infrastructure development. It is not possible for the Indian banking sector to manage that kind of investment,” despite the presence of Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other multilateral financing bodies.
“More is required beyond that. Therefore, if we get support from the BRICS Development Bank and AIIB offer further options and availability of finance which we need to tap into,” he said.
Singh, who is here to attend a separate event, said it will be mostly private sector which will access such funding.
“They will do it on terms favourable, transparent and good for them.”
But bank need to function on certain norms of governance, standards and transparency, he said.
Singh said India should access investments from China as it is plush with funds.
“China is a large economy with trade and manufacturing prowess. It also has funds which we have to recognise.
Therefore, businesses in India can leverage that funding also it will be one more addition to technology and market related relations.”
India along with 20 other countries today signed an agreement to become founding members of the China—backed AIIB to aid the infrastructure development in the Asian region and reduce the dependence on Western—dominated World Bank and IMF.

Rajesh Thadani of Multimedia Combines told IANS: “It had bumper opening. The occupancy was 80 percent at most places. The opening weekend collection will be really good because of holiday. Let’s see if it will be able to maintain the figures Monday onwards.”
Produced by Shah Rukh’s Red Chillies Entertainment Pvt Ltd, the Farah Khan directorial is a heist drama and the team was seen travelling from city to city to promote the film.
“Loved and enjoyed HNY’ at the dubai grand premiere and a fun after party @TheFarahKhan @iamsrk @deepikapadukone @juniorbachchan,” ace fashion designer Manish Malhotra tweeted.

Indias warning on pro-Pak groups rally on Kashmir inLondonPrint
By: Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: October 24, 2014 7:28 pm
Two days ahead of a planned rally in London by a pro-Pakistan group on Kashmir issue, India on Friday warned that forces inimical to Indo-UK relations may utilise such opportunity in open societies.
However, it appreciated Britain’s stand that the Kashmir issue was to be resolved only by India and Pakistan and said that with this reassurance the government was “quite comfortable” of any march being organised.
External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Syed Akbaruddin downplayed the ‘Million March’, being organised on Sunday, saying India was a country of more than a billion and millions don’t “overawe” it.
“Now it is possible that forces inimical to India-UK relations may utilise opportuinities of this sort and it was in this context that we discussued with UK and we were reassured repeatedly that the UK’s view is very clear and that it is for India and Pakistan to resolve any issue that they have by themselves.
“With that reassurance, we are quite comfortable of any march being organised, be it the so-called million march because we, as I said, are country of a billion. Millions do not overawe us….,” he said.
External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj had raised with Deputy Prime Minister of Britain Nick Clegg organisation of the planned anti-India march during her visit to London last week.
The “Million March” is planned on October 26 from London’s Trafalgar Square to highlight the Kashmir issue.
Asked about Pakistan parliament passing a resolution yesterday against the alleged “unprovoked and indiscriminate” ceasefire violations by India and seeking UN intervention to resolve the Kashmir issue, the Spokesperson said it was aimed at the domestic audience and that India opposed the option of involvement of any third party on the matter.
“Resolutions passed by Parliaments are…internalisation processes. Therefore, why should we have any problem with any internalisation process in any country? This is for that country to take a view on,” he said, adding India was strongly opposed to internationalising the issue.
“As regards to any issue of international nature, we have given our views on that we do not see any option of any third party be involved in this. Therefore, as far as internationalisation is concerned, we are against it. As far as internalisation is concerned, this is for Pakistan to sort itself out,” the Spokesperson said.
The Spokesperson said India was ready for talks with Pakistan under the provisions of Shimla Agreement and Lahore Declaration but it was for that country to create a conducive atmosphere for dialogue.
“Our view is that it is for Pakistan to enter into a situation where we can have an atmosphere conducive for talks. Therefore, our view is very clear that we are ready for a bilateral dialogue under the Shimla agreement and the Lahore declaration. But that requires an atmosphere which is conducive for talks. The ball, therefore, is in Pakistan’s court,” he said.
To another question on information on the blast in Burdwan, as was sought by Bangladesh government, the MEA Spokesperson said the ministry has requested concerned agencies to collate information and was awaiting a report in continued…

Cricket Association of Bengal ropes in VVS Laxman  Muttiah Muralitharan for Vision 2020projectPrint

Former India batting great VVS Laxman has been appointed batting consultant in Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB)’s Vision 2020 Project due to the initiative of association’s joint secretary and Laxman’s long-time India team colleague Sourav Ganguly.
His best cricketing achievement happened on the hallowed Eden Gardens turf and VVS Laxman feels that it’s time he repays something back to ‘City of Joy’ which has showered unadulterated love on him.
Laxman, who is also associated with Hyderabad Cricket Association, said he would spend at least 30 days a season giving tips to “score runs”.
“Over the period of next year, I’ll be coming spending here for at least 30 days. We’ll work out what’s best for myself as well as the youngsters,” Laxman told reporters at the Gardens.
“The ultimate aim for a batsman is to score runs. Run making is also a technique along with the skill. I’m looking forward to contribute.”
Laxman would be joined by Muttiah Muralitharan as the spin bowling consultant as the Lankan spin wizard is set to join the youngsters on November 1.
Excited to take up the challenge, Laxman said:”It’s great to be back at Eden Gardens. I’ve always enjoyed coming here not only because I’ve done well on this ground but the kind of welcome I get from the people of Kolkata it’s always been great to see.
“The city has given me a lot of joy and happiness. One of the best grounds I’ve played and some of my best (knocks) have come here. It always is a special feeling to come here.”
“The ultimate goal for all of us who have played is to help the youngsters play for the country. This time I’m doing it for the Bengal team along with the Hyderabad side. I’m happy to be here.”
Laxman feels that Bengal players have the potential to do well and his aim would be to help them realise their potential.
“Bengal have done really well last year, especially in the Ranji Trophy by making into the knock-outs. No batsman is perfect. There’re other aspects of batting which are equally important. Let’s hope they realise their potential.”
The former middle-order batsman however said this time he has come here not as a cricketer or being part of a side like the mentor of Sunrisers Hyderabad during the IPL.
“I’m here in a different role and capacity hoping to help Bengal youngsters.”
Giving credit to his former captain Ganguly for taking up the new role in Bengal cricket, Laxman said: “It’s because of him that I’m here. He persuaded me to take up this role. Really excited to see the young talents on display.”
“It’s been a long time since we met. It’s great to catch up with him and see him doing something for the Bengal cricket.”
Asked about East Zone’s batting collapse (84 and 62/9) against South in the Duleep Trophy in Lahli, he continued…

As Prime Minister Narendra Modi heads to Australia later next month, efforts are under way to schedule a visit to the nearby island nation Fiji, sources said here on Friday. Modi is expected to travel to Fiji on a day-long visit on November 19 from Australia where he will be attending a G-20 meeting.
This will be the Prime Minister’s first three-country tour. The tour will begin in Myanmar capital Nay Pyi Taw, where Modi will attend East Asia Summit on November 12-13. From there, he will go to Brisbane for the G-20 summit on November 15-16.
After Brisbane, Modi will travel to Canberra to hold a bilateral meeting with Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott on November 18. This will be second meeting between the two leaders after Abbott visited India last month. During the last visit, the two countries inked the civil nuclear cooperation agreement.
Modi, who is set to be the first Indian PM to visit Australia since Rajiv Gandhi in 1986, will deliver an address to a joint sitting of federal parliament, according to officials. He is also expected to address the Indian community at a reception in Australia, just like he did during his trip to the US at the Madison Square Garden.

Democrats rebound in early vote countBy Philip Bump October 24 Follow @pbump
When we first looked at how early voting was evolving in states that allow the practice, we included an important caveat: these things shift quickly for a variety of reasons, including that we're often talking about fairly small numbers of votes. And, sure enough, our latest look at data from the United States Election Project -- including two new states -- shows a much better picture for Democrats than it did even earlier this week.
First, here's the graph. If you're new to this, dots above the diagonal line represent voting that's outperforming voter registration. Dots below the line, underperforming. The farther from the line the dot appears, the better (or worse) the effect. We've tracked the past two reports as well; they're shown on vertical lines connected to the current data.
Earlier this week, we released a version of this graph that showed red/Republican dots above the line more than blue/Democratic ones. We'd also noted a shift in how the vote in one state that looked good for Democrats -- Iowa -- had shifted negatively for the party. Now, particularly with the addition of the new states, the picture is more nuanced.
We've broken out that tight cluster in the middle to make it easier to see.
The vote in Iowa is about even, with Democrats and Republicans representing roughly similar portions ofn the early vote. The trend is largely the same: Democrats fading, Republicans rising. North Carolina has seen a dramatic turnaround, with Democrats bouncing back above the diagonal line in the newest set of numbers. In Louisiana and Oregon, the two newly added states, Democrats and Republicans are both outperforming registration -- but there are a lot more Democrats in each.
Which brings us to caveats that we should have been more explicit about earlier this week. Dr. Michael McDonald , the University of Florida associate professor of political science who does the thankless* work of compiling the data, explained to the Huffington Post four reasons that the metric we're using (namely: early turnout versus registration) might not be an effective tool for forecasting final results. Those four reasons, in short:
Registration isn't representative of turnout, even in high-turnout years.
Democrats and Republicans tend to differ in how they use different methods of early voting, meaning that there's some apples/oranges at play above.
Even winning the early vote doesn't mean you'll win higher-turnout Election Day votes.
Non-party voters tend to vote later -- meaning that "overperforming" as a function of the percentage of people who have early voted is skewed by lower turnout now in one of the three groups being tracked.
All valid points, of course. The first point, as befits the point that comes first, is perhaps the most important. Pollsters spend a lot of time considering who they expect to come to the polls so that they can weight survey results appropriately. Turnout doesn't reflect registration perfectly. But the fourth point is important, too: a big jump in turnout from non-Democrats and Republicans could shift the party's results significantly. All those yellow dots under the diagonal line could indicate apathy -- or an imminent surge.
That said, as with polling and as with many other things about political campaigns, trends are often revealing. Republicans in Iowa continue to increase the proportion of the early vote they represent while the Democratic proportion continues to decline. That doesn't mean that Joni Ernst (R) is guaranteed to win her Senate race, but it also doesn't mean that Democrat Bruce Braley's ground forces are winning the turnout battle.
* Thanks, Dr. McDonald!

Sonia  Rahul should speak more : PChidambaramPrint
Former Union minister P Chidambaram (Source: PTI)
By: Express News Service | New Delhi | Posted: October 24, 2014 8:18 pm | Updated: October 25, 2014 1:04 am
Former Finance Minister P Chidambaram on Friday said the Congress morale was “pretty low” at the moment and that both party president Sonia Gandhi and vice-president Rahul Gandhi needed to “speak more”. They should show the “urgency” to reorganise the party and lead the Congress to play the role of the “true opposition”, Chidambaram told NDTV news channel. He also agreed a non-Gandhi could lead the party “some day”.
On the land deal between Sonia’s son-in-law Robert Vadra and real estate firm DLF in Haryana, he said, “I don’t know the facts. Whether they (the Haryana government) were helping him or whether they were taking a routine decision, I don’t know the facts. So how can I comment on that.”
“Without knowing the facts, I don’t think it is fair to comment on any particular transaction. Unless I have the papers in front of me, unless I have the facts in front of me, I can’t comment on any transaction,” he said. Asked if he was distancing himself from the issue, he said, “If I am obliged to comment, if I am authorised to comment, I will, provided I have before me the fact and the papers.”
Asked whether the Vadra issue created a perception problem for the Congress, he said, “May be it did. I don’t know.” Asked whether the party handled it effectively, he said, “I don’t know. May be it did, but these are questions which must be answered by people who were there in the field in Haryana, people who were contesting elections. I don’t know.”
Chidambaram said he was concerned about the lack of visibility of Sonia and Rahul Gandhi. “I would urge the Congress president and the Congress vice-president to speak more. I would urge them to come and address more rallies, I would urge them to meet the media. I would urge them to do that,” he said.
He said Sonia continues to be “the most acceptable leader of his generation” and Rahul has wide acceptance among the younger members of the party. Asked whether a non-Gandhi could become the Congress president, he said, “I think so. Some day, yes.”
He agreed that the Congress morale was pretty low but said it can be lifted. “I agree that the Congress morale is pretty low. But I don’t agree that the morale cannot be lifted, that a direction cannot be given… It’s a matter of time, more accurately a matter of timing. I am sure that the Congress leadership has its own timetable. I would urge again that the timetable be shortened and get on with the job of reorganising the party and getting on with the job of being true opposition.” Asked whether he felt the Congress leadership need to respond with a little more urgency, he said, “I think so.”

I am not bored of doing comedy: BhartiSinghA trendsetter herself, the 28-year-old's observation comes from the fact that she has teamed up with Punjabi artistes Krushna Abhishek and Sudesh Lehri in the new "Comedy Classes" sitcom.

A lot of talent from Punjab is tickling the funny bones of TV viewers and stand-up comedian-actress Bharti Singh loves the fact that people from her state are high on humour.
A trendsetter herself, the 28-year-old’s observation comes from the fact that she has teamed up with Punjabi artistes Krushna Abhishek and Sudesh Lehri in the new “Comedy Classes” sitcom.
“I am from Punjab. We speak so much Punjabi on the set that it feels like shooting in Jalandhar or Ludhiana. Punjabis are blessed. There are so many Punjabi comedians…even Kapil Sharma…” Bharti told told IANS.
“So, now if we return to our hometown, perhaps comedy will come to a halt in Mumbai. I really like it when people say that Punjabis make people laugh,” added Bharti, who has no qualms about laughing on herself, especially her weight.
Best known as the child character named Lalli, she hasn’t had enough of comedy.  “I am not bored of doing comedy. Who gets bored of eating food? I want to stay as a comedian and always be fat.
“The audience also says don’t lose weight. People still think of me as the child Lalli. Even handsome guys pull my cheeks and call me sweet and cute,” she said.
After completing about five years in the industry, she has become one of the most loved comedians. But it wasn’t cakewalk for her.
“There aren’t too many successful female stand-up comedians. So, sometimes people even change date or offer as much money I ask,” said the trendsetter.
“Earlier, there used to be problems. Now, people tell me that I’ve changed mentality of others and it’s good,” added the comedian, who rose to fame with “The Great Indian Laughter Challenge” show.
Apart from comedy, she loves putting on her dancing shoes.
“Punjabis are famous for eating and dancing. We love dancing. We can even dance when someone honks,” said Bharti, who had participated in the celebrity dance reality show “Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa”.
What about marriage plans?
“I would like to concentrate on my work for at least three more years and then will think about marriage. Bidai mai bhi nachna hai,” she said.

Long running TV show “Pavitra Rishta”, which will come to an end Oct 25, has put together an entertaining finale episode which will see a plethora of actors shaking their legs to hit numbers.
In the recent episodes, the focus was on the ups and downs in Ankita and Naren’s life. But now it is time for their marriage and the celebration will see a bevy of TV actors setting the stage on fire with their dance moves.
Reel and real life couple Asha Negi and Rithvick Dhanjani will perform on romantic songs like “Chaand chhupa baadal mein” and “Ram chahe leela”, while the team of Mishkat Verma and Kaanchi Singh will dance on peppy numbers “Band baaja baraat” and “London thumakda”, said a statement.
“Dance India Dance” stars Sanam and Moheena, will groove to “Lovely”, “Tu meri” and “Bang bang”.
Ankita and Naren will join the celebrations too — they will perform on “Sunona sangemarmar”.
“Pavitra Rishta” went on air in 2009 with Ankita Lokhande and Sushant Singh Rajput as the lead pair. In 2011, Sushant exited the show to pursue big screen dreams.

Diego Costa might play against Manchester United: JoseMourinhoDiego Costa missed out Chelsea's 6-0 thumping victory in UEFA Champions League on Tuesday. (Source: AP)
London | Posted: October 24, 2014 7:40 pm | Updated: October 24, 2014 8:15 pm
Diego Costa, Ramires and John Mikel Obi could all return to the Chelsea squad for their Premier League clash with Manchester United at Old Trafford on Sunday, manager Jose Mourinho said.
But striker Loic Remy is definitely out.
The three all missed Chelsea’s 6-0 Champions League club record win over Maribor on Tuesday, but Mourinho said they all have “a little chance” of playing against United, and he would decide after Saturday’s training session.
Costa, joint top scorer in the Premier League with nine goals, has missed the last two matches with a hamstring injury and then a virus, while Ramires has missed their last six games with a groin injury and Mikel the last two with a bad foot.
Remy, though, will be out for two to three weeks after injuring his groin scoring the opening goal of the win over Maribor at Stamford Bridge.
Asked if he had any positive news about Chelsea, unbeaten in 12 matches in all competitions this season, Mourinho bounced back: “I only have positive news.
“We are playing well, we are confident, we are top of the league, we are in a good position to qualify for the Champions League, the camp is happy and we are ready for the game.”
CLOSE FRIENDSHIP
Matches between United and Chelsea have ranked among the most attractive in the league in recent seasons, and this one is extra special for Mourinho who comes up against his old Barcelona boss Louis van Gaal for the first time in a league match.
Mourinho worked under Van Gaal for three years at Barca, and the two have maintained a close friendship ever since but have only faced each other in one competitive match — the 2010 Champions League final when Mourinho’s Inter Milan beat Van Gaal’s Bayern Munich 2-0 in Rome.
Although United are down in sixth place with only three league wins from eight so far, Mourinho says going to Old Trafford is always special — and that his friendship with Van Gaal will be put on hold for 90 minutes.
“It doesn’t matter who the manager is, or the moment, or the league table, or the players, Man Utd is Man Utd and I always look at them through these factors.
“But tomorrow (Sunday) I don’t play against Louis, Chelsea plays against Man Utd and during the match I have no time, and he has no time to look around and to see who the opposing manager is.
“Before the match and after the match he is one of my big friends in football so I am always happy to see him.
“Everyone knows the respect I have for him but please on Sunday he is my opponent so don’t ask me to speak about him for half an hour now.”

Colt McCoy is not the Redskins starter  even if hes starting  Jay Gruden saysBy Dan Steinberg October 24 Follow @dcsportsbog
(Via NBC Washington)
Colt McCoy will start for the Redskins on Monday against the Cowboys unless Robert Griffin III is healthy enough to play, Jay Gruden has said this week .
Multiple times.
NBC Washington put together this little package of Gruden discussing his starter on Thursday. Looks like he said “the starter” eight times in 25 or so seconds. Here’s how it went.
1) Colt’s the starter.
2) We’re preparing for Colt to be the starter, you know what I mean?
3) We’re trying to get Robert some reps, get him ready, but right now, looks like odds are Colt will be the starter.
4) But we’re trying to work Robert into the lineup and trying to get him reps to get him ready to go, because ultimately, when it’s all said and done, when Robert’s healthy, Robert’s the starter.
5) We understand that? Robert’s the starter.
6) Colt is not the starter.
7) Colt could be the starter Monday night.
8) But when Robert’s healthy, he’ll be the starter, right?

Government considering changing protocols for aid workers who return to the U.S. after fighting EbolaBy Mark Berman and Juliet Eilperin October 24 Follow @markberman Follow @eilperin

The federal government is considering altering the protocols for doctors and health-care workers who return to the United States from West Africa, authorities said Friday.
“It’s one of the questions the federal government is thinking through,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) told Fox 5 in New York .
A federal official said that the idea of quarantining medical workers who participated in the Ebola response in West Africa was being considered, but said no decision had been made.
While the idea of a quarantine is being considered, Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, emphasized that officials are still determining whether it is medically justified.
“These kinds of policy decisions are going to be driven by science,” he said.

The possible change would come in the wake of Thursday’s diagnosis of Craig Spencer , a doctor who had treated Ebola patients in Guinea, one of the countries at the heart of the Ebola epidemic.
Spencer, 33, returned to the United States last week and began feeling ill on Tuesday. He was taken to Bellevue Hospital on Thursday after reporting a fever of 100.3 degrees that morning and gastrointestinal problems.
But as federal officials consider a possible change, authorities in the New York area announced that they would take more immediate action. Medical personnel returning to New York and New Jersey from the Ebola-riddled countries in West Africa will be automatically quarantined if they had direct contact with an infected person, officials announced Friday.
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) announced the decision at a joint news conference Friday at 7 World Trade Center.
“The steps New York and New Jersey are taking today will strengthen our safeguards to protect our residents against this disease and help ensure those that may be infected by Ebola are treated with the highest precautions,” Cuomo said in a statement.
They said that public-health officials at John F. Kennedy and Newark Liberty international airports, where enhanced screening for Ebola is taking place, would make the determination on who would be quarantined. Anyone who had direct contact with an Ebola patient in Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea will be quarantined.

In addition, anyone who traveled there but had no such contact would be actively monitored and possibly quarantined, authorities said.
Laurie Garrett, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, said in an interview that while it made sense for returning medical workers to take voluntary steps to isolate themselves upon their return to the United States, concern over Ebola’s transmission in the West had begun to interfere with volunteers’ ability to contain the outbreak at the source.
“For everybody that’s professionally trying to go to the three epidemic countries, the situation has become more difficult with each passing day and each Ebola case — or alleged Ebola case — named in the United States,” Garrett said. “We’re in a crisis actually that imperils the entire effort to stop the epidemic that is completely about the fear of countries that have no known epidemic.”
Not only have many airlines curtailed flights to the three countries most affected by Ebola, Garrett noted, but nearly every major insurance carrier has now canceled medevac coverage for individuals choosing to travel there.
“This whole right of return issue, and circumstances of return, is fluid,” she said. “We’ve hit the point where it is quite obviously affecting the recruitment of volunteer health workers.”
Experts say that the region needs roughly 19,000 health and logistics personnel to contain the epidemic; outside of military personnel, total foreign volunteers now number in the hundreds.
Still, Garrett added, any people traveling to a nation affected by Ebola should undertake efforts to isolate and monitor themselves for any symptoms of the disease for 21 days after returning to their home country.
“At this point it’s incumbent on anyone going over there to build into your plans the assumption that you will have to radically modify how you live and work upon your return for three weeks,” she said.
Spencer had gone to Guinea to work with Doctors Without Borders, the international relief group that has been on the front lines of the public health crisis.
On Friday, the group said Spencer had followed its protocols for people returning from Ebola work, which included regular health monitoring.

“Extremely strict procedures are in place for staff dispatched to Ebola affected countries before, during, and after their assignments,” Sophie Delaunay, the group’s executive director, said in a statement. “Despite the strict protocols, risk cannot be completely eliminated. However, close post-assignment monitoring allows for early detection of cases and for swift isolation and medical management.”
The precise nature of Spencer’s infection is being investigated, the group said. So far, two dozen people working for the organization have fallen ill while fighting Ebola, and 13 of them have died.
Tim Shenk, a spokesman for Doctors Without Borders, said Friday afternoon that quarantining all medical workers who return from West Africa “would be an excessive measure to take at this stage.”
“As long as a patient hasn’t developed symptoms, the risk of contamination is close to zero,” he said.
Spencer became just the fourth person diagnosed with Ebola in the United States and the first outside Texas, which has previously been the nexus of Ebola infections in the country. Thomas Duncan, a Liberian man who flew to Dallas, was diagnosed last month and died eight days later. Two nurses who treated Duncan were infected while caring for him. No one who had close contact with Duncan or the nurses has tested positive for Ebola so far.
The two nurses who contracted Ebola in Dallas were both declared virus-free this week. One was cleared on Wednesday , while Nina Pham, the other nurse,  left the National Institutes of Health on Friday morning after doctors determined she no longer had the virus.
President Obama on Friday wanted to meet with Pham “to thank her for her service,” Josh Earnest said at his daily White House briefing.
When White House officials found out early Friday that Pham would be released, Earnest said, they contacted the NIH “to let her know that the president was interested in meeting her if she felt up to it.”

Pham did not undergo any additional medical testing before greeting—and hugging—the president, Earnest said, noting that she had been shown to be free of the virus on five separate occasions before being released.
Earnest also provided new details Friday about the coordination between federal and New York state officials after Spencer fell ill Thursday. President Obama ordered the Pentagon to provide an aircraft to transport a team of experts from the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta to New York City’s Bellevue Hospital so they could get there “as soon as possible,” he said.
The team, which helped supervise the protocols for treating Spencer, arrived “within a couple of hours” of his arrival, Earnest added.
“We certainly are pleased that so much of the planning that’s been done in recent days has proved to be useful,” Earnest said of how Bellevue’s handled Spencer’s admission.
While federal officials are discussing the idea of quarantining medical professionals upon their return to the United States, Earnest emphasized that officials are still determining whether it is medically justified.
“These kinds of policy decisions are going to be driven by science,” he said.
The administration is focused on protecting the American public, Earnest said. “But at the same time we don’t have to overly burden those individuals who are going to great lengths to stop this outbreak at the source,” he added.
Earnest also emphasized that these aid workers are aware of the public health concerns stemming from their service.
“Individuals who have spent time in West Africa certainly understand the seriousness of this disease,” he said, adding at one point of the precautions Spencer took upon his return to New York, “He is a highly trained medical professional [and] certainly had the capacity to take his own temperature.”
White House officials continued to emphasize the low probability of an Ebola outbreak in the U.S. Earnest said Obama would “have no qualms” about riding the New York subway, visiting the High Line or visiting a Brooklyn bowling alley even in the aftermath of Spencer’s diagnosis.
“The fact is, the risk facing the average New Yorker is exceedingly low,” he said.

Spencer works at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center. On Thursday, the hospital called him “a dedicated humanitarian” who “always puts his patients first.” The hospital said in a statement that he had not been to work and had not seen patients since returning from overseas.
On Tuesday, two days before he was hospitalized and diagnosed, Spencer went to a bowling alley in Williamsburg, rode three New York subway lines and used an Uber car. The bowling alley had closed after Spencer’s diagnosis, while Uber said that health officials had told them the car’s driver and any subsequent passengers were not at risk.
Spencer was is in stable condition Friday , authorities said, and he is talking to public-health workers as they try to trace his steps in recent days. Even as “disease detectives” work to determine who Spencer may have encountered and check the coffee shops and restaurants he visited, officials stressed that they felt they had the situation contained and urged calm among residents.

“New Yorkers who had not been exposed to an infected person’s bodily fluids are simply not at risk,” New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said during a briefing Friday afternoon. “There is no reason for New Yorkers to change their daily routine in any way.”
Spencer “poses no threat to others,” de Blasio said.
The ongoing treatment for Spencer at Bellevue Hospital involves giving him fluid and electrolytes and monitoring his vital signs, said Ram Raju, head of the city’s Health and Hospitals Corporation. Spencer remains in good enough shape to talk on the phone and tell the disease detectives from the health department about his steps so far this week.
Cuomo on Thursday had said that Spencer was a medical professional who had seen Ebola up close, adding that the doctor had been monitoring himself and immediately recognized the symptoms.
“He was familiar with the possibility and the circumstances, so he handled himself accordingly,” Cuomo said.
New York officials repeatedly emphasized on Thursday and Friday that they were prepared for Ebola’s arrival, having trained while also preparing Bellevue and other hospitals for handling patients with the virus.

Rep. Darrell Issa, a California Republican who chairs the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, urged the Obama administration on Friday to take steps to improve what he characterized as a “bumbling” response to the Ebola crisis.
“I think we all know that the system is not yet refined to where we could say it is working properly,” he said during a hearing on the U.S. government’s response to the disease.
Issa and other members of Congress questioned the measures taken by the administration to prepare for a possible pandemic before Ebola appeared in U.S. hospitals, as well as what officials have done since then to ensure the disease doesn’t spread.
Nicole Laurie, a senior official at the Department of Health and Human Services, said Friday that the risk of a significant Ebola outbreak in the United States was “remote.”
But health-care workers who will be the first to respond to Ebola cases in the United States were worried, particularly after two nurses contracted the disease through an exposure that has still not been explained.
Deborah Burger, co-president of National Nurses United, said these workers remain at risk. She said nurses have received inconsistent instructions, were often left to make decisions about proper precautions for themselves, and at times were forced to improvise their own protective gear because their medical facilities were unprepared. She said only new, legally required guidelines would ensure that medical facilities would provide workers the protection they need.
“The response to Ebola from U.S. hospitals and governmental agencies has been dangerously inconsistent and inadequate,” she said. “The lack of mandates and shifting guidelines from agencies and reliance on voluntary compliance has left caregivers uncertain, severely unprepared and vulnerable to infection.”

Diwali gift: Flats  cars  jewellery to `loyal staffersSurat-based diamond firm Hari Krishna Exports Pvt Ltd gave away gifts including Fiat cars to its employees at a function held on Sunday at the company's private lawns..
Ahmedabad, Oct 20:  
They all waited in their hundreds with bated breath in that sprawling lawn in Surat, awaiting the ‘divine’ announcement from the generous pauper-turned-diamond king and returned home as happy owners of cars, flats and gold-and-diamond jewellery worth a total of Rs 50 crore on Sunday.
In what was, perhaps, the most generous Diwali gift event anywhere in India in recent history, as Savjibhai Dholakia, a diamond worker-turned-merchant, gifted those valuables to the nearly 1,200 employees of Hari Krishna Exports Pvt Ltd who passed the ‘loyalty test’. The venue looked like a vast car mela as shining vehicles awaited their owners. Each rewardee returned with a Diwali gift worth Rs 4 lakh.
People recalled it like a Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL’s) AGMs held in a stadium in the past, as Savjibhai doled out jaw-dropping goodies as rewards to his ‘best performing’ employees.
“We don’t look at it as a bonus or incentive. But we call it a Loyalty Programme, under which we recognise our employees who have contributed great value to the growth of this company by constantly upgrading their skills over these years,” Dholakia told BusinessLine on Monday.
The company, which has over 6,000 employees in Surat alone and another 3,000 in Mumbai and across the world, had organised a grand celebration on Sunday at its huge private lawn inside Hari Krishna Complex on the outskirts of Surat. The 1,200 employees who were qualified for the ‘Loyalty Programme’ were given three options to choose from: a Fiat Punto car, part-payment for a 2-BHK flat or gold and diamond jewellery.
“We wanted our employee to live a complete life with own house and a car. Hence, the company offered Rs 4 lakh contribution for purchase of a 2-BHK flat. Those who already had a house, we offered them a Fiat car worth about Rs 4 lakh. And those who had both, we rewarded them with jewellery worth the same amount,” said Dholakia, who had bargained hard with Fiat dealer for a heavy discount.
Around 491 employees opted for cars, 207 preferred taking company’s contribution for new flat and the remaining over 500 employees chose to take jewellery.
Interestingly these employees hold job profiles ranging from diamond polishing worker to marketing executive and office executives - most of them drawing a minimum monthly salary of Rs 60,000. About 60 per cent of his total workforce is from Saurashtra, while many workers hail from North Gujarat and Rajasthan.
Dholakia had began Hari Krishna Exports in 1991 after 10 years of rigorous diamond polishing work. Today, he claims to achieve the sales turnover of Rs 6,000 crore from diamond exports for the fiscal 2014-15. Its jewellery vertical has a turnover of about Rs 700 crore.
As a recognition of the contribution of his employees to his company’s success, Dholakia introduced the Loyalty Programme two years ago. In the first year, three diamond polishing workers were gifted cars, while last year this number went up to 72.
Meanwhile, Dholakia has also set up an in-house institute, which runs one/two-year courses on diamond polishing and overall diamond polishing engineering for those interested to take up diamond polishing as a profession.
“We guarantee that trained at our institute, the person will surely get a job with starting salary of at least Rs 50,000 per month,” added Dholakia

Common Ground and Conversationreddit
I feel that we can all help start more conversations in regard to leadership, diversity, inclusion and respect. The old adage, never judge a book by its cover, applies to all walks of life. I remember when I first went to Stanford University, I participated in a group activity with my entire freshman dorm. All of us were apprehensive about this new chapter in our lives. The leader had us stand in a straight line and would pose a question to the group. Students would either take a step forward or stand still based on their individual response.
I took a step forward. I looked around the room and saw a group of people of different religions, races, genders, you name it. And they all answered the same way I did. The actual questions that brought us together weren't important; the questions and answers that followed were. All of a sudden, a group of strangers realized a collective common ground which served as a jumping off point for conversation.
A lot of times it's just a lack of exposure and awareness that is holding people back. Conversation and interaction help erase the lack of understanding by challenging people to discuss different things; share and appreciate new points of view. Eventually, we are able to accept and grow.
I've always found basketball to be a great vehicle to bring people together. It's such an easy sport to understand. It's just two hoops and a ball. You can play it indoors or outdoors and there is something about five people coming together -- and finding common language.
What sports can do is create a safe space for children. Some kids are going through some really difficult circumstances and dealing with adversity. But when they are on the court for a few hours, there is a safe space and a safe environment to play, interact, talk, and hang out. It's so important to know that someone else out there cares about you, that someone is trying to help and is on your team.
When you see guys like Kobe Bryant, Kevin Durant, and many other players in the sport showing this level of care to work with young people, it's pretty telling how important that type of work can be.
I'd invite people of all ages to be an ally to someone who is less fortunate. You might be in the midst of a good situation -- but take the time to be a counselor, a mentor, or just a positive role model because it's a great thing to do and you never know when the person who needs the help could be you. At some point, you'll be going through that tough time and you'll appreciate the support.
There are so many ways to get involved. Last year, I was thrilled to work with the league to donate the proceeds of my Brooklyn Nets jersey to the Matthew Shepard Foundation and GLSEN. They are two organizations that do tremendous work to replace hate with understanding, compassion, and acceptance.
Your gender, religion, race, or sexual orientation has no effect on your ability to lead conversations. You can help others recognize the common ground and ultimately, you can change hearts and minds.

Russia spy plane intercepted in NATO airspace: AllianceThe Ilyushin IL-20 "intelligence collection aircraft" was first intercepted by Danish F-16 jets when it approached Denmark.
By: Agence-France Presse | Brussels | Posted: October 23, 2014 12:46 am | Updated: October 23, 2014 12:53 am
NATO fighter jets intercepted a Russian spy plane over the Baltic Sea after it breached Estonian airspace, the alliance said today in the latest of such incidents amid tensions with Moscow over Ukraine.
The Ilyushin IL-20 “intelligence collection aircraft”, which took off from the Russian Baltic coast enclave of Kaliningrad yesterday, was first intercepted by Danish F-16 jets when it approached Denmark, NATO said in a statement.
It then flew north towards non-NATO member Sweden which also sent jets to intercept the plane.
Nearly four hours later the plane flew towards NATO member Estonia and was detected in Estonian airspace “for a period of less than one minute, which represented an incursion of about 600 metres (yards) into NATO airspace,” it said.
Portuguese F-16s spotted the Russian propeller plane and escorted it out of NATO airspace, the alliance said.
The Ukraine crisis has produced the worst east-west tension since the end of the Cold War.
NATO has stepped up its Baltic air patrols due to what it says is a surge in intercepts of Russian warplanes near Polish and Baltic airspace since Moscow’s annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in March.
The Swedish Navy meanwhile has been searching for a suspected Russian submarine off the coast of Stockholm for nearly a week, although it said today it was pulling back some of its ships.

Incorporating women: Greater awareness and tangible results are factors to consider. AKHILESH KUMAR
They drop out on account of cultural taboos and lack of follow up efforts by implementing agencies
Despite opportunities and systematic community-driven handholding support from the Government and non-government bodies, women might still choose not to participate in the economic development process. Under the purview of the National Rural Livelihoods Mission, the world’s largest poverty alleviation initiative, the Government and NGOs are targeting women from the poorest households in the economic development process. One such project is the Bihar Rural Livelihoods Project (BRLP) or Project JEEViKA.
Implemented in select districts of Bihar, the project facilitates the formation of women-based self-help groups (SHGs) federated at the village level to form village organisations (VOs). VOs receive investments from the project and play a vital role in implementing livelihoods interventions. Additionally, village resource persons (VRPs) are engaged to provide technical assistance to SHG members.
To understand what influences women’s willingness to participate in economic development programmes, we interviewed 613 SHG women from 24 villages in three districts of Bihar, where the project was introduced more than four years ago. The sample is not representative; ; nevertheless, the challenges we have recognised in these 24 villages could work as lessons for all.
Missing links
Half the women we interviewed were from landless households, and amongst those who owned land, the average land size was not more than half an acre. Thus, the project has been exceptionally successful in mobilising women from the poorest households in its community structure. However, a majority of the women, despite being informed about the livelihoods intervention, were not engaged.
JEEViKA’s most promoted intervention, system of crop intensification (SCI), was adopted only by 27 per cent of women, of whom half had discontinued the service. For many, it was due to lack of adequate land (60 per cent). This casts a serious doubt on the concept of farm innovation alone being the right kind of innovation for women belonging to landless or near landless households. JEEViKA has acknowledged this concern and so it also promotes off-farm and non-farm interventions such as poultry farming, agarbatti-making and so on. However, the data implies that participation has been less than satisfactory. Firstly, cultural barriers and taboos discouraged women from participating. For example, despite being affordable, only 8 per cent took up poultry farming; 43 per cent reported they did not want to share their household space with chickens as it affected their social status within the caste system.
Another constraint was lack of time. The project started the kitchen garden initiative in order to enable women to grow a variety of vegetables in their own premises. The project provides free or subsidised seeds and other technical support. Despite this, only 4 per cent of women adopted the initiative, mainly because many perceived it as requiring extra time and energy, and not providing any immediate income.
At the same time, many women felt that enterprise-based intervention could help them generate immediate income. However, there were no active follow-ups provided. For example, 52 per cent reported that they had been waiting for the agarbatti-making enterprise to start, however, they had not heard about it from the resource persons. This clearly highlights the incongruity between the women’s needs and the opportunities being offered by the project.
Continuous support
We also found that participating women who frequently receive handholding support from resource persons were three times more likely to re-apply the technique. For example, 48 per cent of women who had previously adopted the SCI technique stopped re-applying. Of the women who were visited by the resource persons, 58 per cent re-applied, compared to 31 per cent who had not been visited. What is interesting is that 64 per cent of women who had adopted this technique reported an increase in the productivity of crops, yet this had no significant effect on the re-application.
Lastly, it has been observed that a woman who is in the SHG leadership position or receives support from the village organisations is more than twice as likely to participate in the intervention. The findings of the IFMR study clearly indicates that provisions of well-designed interventions do not guarantee participation. There are many factors that come into play that influence women’s decisions — cultural beliefs, perceived opportunity cost of the intervention, and handholding support they receive from the project’s stakeholders.
The implementers need to be aware of the factors. Failure to do so might not only affect its long-term success, but also systematically exclude the most disadvantaged women from participating in livelihood interventions.

Chicago's tweaked SRO proposal has more in it for developers
Tenants still to get cash in tweaked Chicago SRO proposal
Chicago has backed away from a proposal to regulate the redevelopment of single-room-occupancy hotels in the city, and instead will offer more options for building owners and developers while still requiring cash payments for displaced long-term tenants.
An ordinance that would make it more expensive to convert single-room-occupancy hotels in Chicago into market-rate housing moved closer to becoming law Monday with an endorsement from aldermen. ( John Byrne, Mary Ellen Podmolik )
Backed by Mayor Rahm Emanuel and introduced last month, the original proposal's long list of mandates would have barred the city from approving the demolition or conversion of an SRO to market-rate housing unless the owner set aside 20 percent of the units for low-income residents or paid the city $200,000 for each unit that should have been kept affordable.
That key requirement, deemed onerous by building owners who said they might mount a legal challenge, is gone from a revised proposal circulated among housing groups, building owners and developers.
However, the proposed substitute Single-Room Occupancy Preservation Ordinance still offers protections and cash payments that range from $2,000 to $10,600, depending on the circumstances, to displaced tenants who have lived in a building for at least 32 days.
8
Michael Negron, Emanuel's policy chief, said set-aside requirements were not needed to accomplish the city's goal, which is to preserve the stock of affordable housing in gentrifying neighborhoods. "The right-to-purchase section really gets at our concern, buildings that are housing vulnerable populations but are in areas that are growing," he said. "Now there's an early warning system."
0
Owners who choose to sell a building would have three options. They could  negotiate in good faith for at least 180 days with a representative of tenants like a nonprofit group that would keep the entire building affordable. If those talks produce no agreement, the owner could sell to another buyer within the next 90 days with no affordable-unit restrictions. If no sale occurs in those 90 days, the owner would have to again start the process of finding a buyer that would keep the building affordable.
Or, owners could bypass the first two options and sell the building to whomever they choose. In that case, the buyer would have to pay to the city $20,000 per unit in preservation fees. In that scenario, each displaced long-term renter would receive $10,600.
Long-term tenants who are not given the opportunity to return to their building would receive a relocation payment of $2,000 or three months' rent, whichever is greater.
Shorter-term displaced tenants would get back their security deposits plus interest and any unpaid rent.
The revised proposal could be taken up by the city's housing and real estate committee next week. In July, the city passed a six-month moratorium on issuing building permits for projects other than normal maintenance while it developed protections for Chicago's supply of housing for its very-low and low-income residents. In the past three years, more than 2,000 rooms of housing have been converted to market-rate apartments. The city has said it wants to preserve at least 700 SRO units during the next five years.
"We recognized the reality that we needed to compromise," said Mary Tarullo, a community organizer with ONE Northside, a group working with the city to draft regulations. "We still think we have a strong ordinance. The goal is for these developments to be put into the hands of developers who are going to improve them and also keep them affordable."
Fees collected under the ordinance would be set aside in a fund from which SRO owners could seek forgivable loans for building rehabs.
Owners say the proposal still needs more tweaks. They say the 180-day sale negotiation period is too long and the potential $10,600 payment is too high and unfairly based on the Keep Chicago Renting ordinance when SROs, by their definition, house only one person in a unit.
"Before, the city said take it or leave it," said Eric Rubenstein, an owner of three SROs and executive director of the Single Room Housing Assistance Corp., which represents 75 properties. "The city is understanding better that the original version was lopsided and unfair and would drive these properties out of business. We still have a lot of work to do on this."

How to Create a Truly Supportive Community Onlinereddit
Do you ever feel lonely online?
You know, you're flipping through page after page of your so-called "friends" on Facebook or some other social media platform, but you realize you are actually quite lonely?
It may seem strange, but even though the world has become more connected via the internet and social media, studies are showing that more people consider themselves unhappy, even as we're becoming more connected.
Why More People Are Unhappy
A University of Michigan psychologist conducted a study last year which found that when users consumed online social media, it made those users more lonely and reduced overall life satisfaction.
Almost 100 participants in the study were sent questions five times a day over a two-week period with a link to a survey about their Facebook use, their feelings of well being and the amount of face-to-face social interaction they had engaged in.
According to the study, the more time participants had spent on Facebook, the less happy they felt over time.
"The more people used Facebook at one time point, the worse they felt the next time we text-messaged them," the study reported. "The more they used Facebook over two weeks, the more their life satisfaction levels declined over time."
A few years ago, I was just like the participants in that study. I was active on all the major platforms, like Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn, but I felt lonely. I didn't feel like I had a community where I belonged.
Part of the problem was my business. Like most lawyers, I was too dependent on the service-based billable hour. I was chained to my desk. If I wasn't at my desk, I wasn't making money.
I decided that I didn't want to be 100% dependent on the billable hour. I also knew I needed a community to help me transition my business by expanding my online presence, including using blogging and podcasting.
There's a saying "when the student is ready, the teacher will appear." That's what happened for me.
Enter Fizzle
Around that time, a new training program and community of small entrepreneurs, small business owners and wannabe business owners was forming. It was called Fizzle.co , and it was created in about September 2012 by three guys named Corbett Barr, Caleb Wojcik and Chase Reeves. It was just what I needed.
It's also a great case study in how to create a supportive online community.
The "3 C's" as they are known put together an incredible community of like-minded entrepreneurs. People who wanted to grow themselves, but also to help others to grow.
Through Fizzle, I have forged some amazing relationships with other solopreneurs like me who aspire to make a bigger dent in the universe in an ethical way.
These supportive Fizzlers have included people such as:
Darlene Hildebrandt , a great photographer and writer, who took the time to photoshop my headshot and critique my videos
Tony Rulli , who responded to my desperate call for help when I needed help with Facebook ads one early morning. I have since hired him to run Facebook ads for me and he's amazing.
Omar Zenhom , co-founder of The $100 MBA, who I've collaborated with on numerous projects.
Kevin Johns , a novelist and writing coach who helped me to create an ebook version of my Connect with Influencers course.
John Muldoon , who has helped critique my website and always makes me laugh when I'm feeling stressed
Julia Tunstall, who runs MastermindFinder to help people find mastermind groups, who has been a constant source of support
Bree Brouwer , who has given me tons of feedback on my progress log.
That's literally just the tip of the iceberg. There are many, many more.
How did it work? Why were other supportive entrepreneurs drawn to it?
I think it's because the 3 C's were authentic about who they were for, and who they were not for. They were not afraid to turn away people who they thought were not a good fit. They also created a popular podcast where they talked openly about these sorts of ideas -- who they wanted to attract, and who they didn't want to attract.
They also made it inexpensive (it's just $1 for the first 30 days; after that, it's $35/month.), which I think attracted a diverse audience.
I recorded a new video where I show off what this community looks like. You can watch it here:
What I Got From This Community
Now, what did I get from this supportive online community? Well, I got a sense of belonging. I got a feeling of being a part of something bigger, which is missing from other platforms like Facebook or Twitter. I got a sounding board for sharing my ideas where they would be accepted, even if some of my ideas were off-the-wall.
Most importantly, I built strong relationships with others who knew what I was going through and who wanted to help. (If you want to know more about this journey, read my guest post on the Fizzle blog )
These relationships have been instrumental in the metamorphasis my business has undergone over the last two years. Here's the before and after picture, and how Fizzle has impacted my business:
Before Fizzle email subscribers: 200 subscribers
After Fizzle email subscribers: almost 7,000 (3,200% increase)
Before Fizzle website traffic: my Mom and my dog
After Fizzle website traffic: 50K pageviews/mo
Before Fizzle income from blog and digital products: $0
After Fizzle income from digital products: approx. $4,000-$5,000/month and growing
Before Fizzle guest posts: N/A
After Fizzle guest posts: today, I write or have written for Forbes , Huffington Post , Psychology Today , Art of Manliness , BoostBlogTraffic , Smart Passive Income , etc.
I've also appeared on dozens of podcasts including The Art of Charm , Entrepreneur on Fire and Listen Money Matters (co-created by another Fizzler Matt Giovanisci) as a guest on CreativeLive , and I am going to be featured in at least two books in the next year.
(I have an ongoing progress log in the Fizzle forums that chronicles how I grew this side of my business between August 2013 and today. You need to be logged in to read it.)
I am not making so much that I'm able to go buy a boat and retire . But the revenue is significant, it is growing, and the products leverage my time much greater than one-to-one service.
Thanks to everything I have learned in Fizzle, today I am not 100% dependent on the billable hour. There have been numerous occasions over the past year where I've been out to lunch, or out with friends, or spending time with my kids, or sleeping, and someone somewhere who I've never met has sent me money. And that's super cool.
How Does this Affect You?
I am sharing all of this because I know a lot of people who have those feelings of loneliness like I felt. Often they are the most active on social media, but they are also the most lonely. They yearn to belong to something.
What you may not be realizing is you need to find a community and connect. You need to begin developing relationships, like I did. You need to find a community that is invested in seeing you succeed.
Now imagine what it would be like if you found that community. Imagine if you had friends who wouldn't let you fail?
Imagine if you were surrounded by people who are completely, 100% supportive of what you are trying to do. The business you want to create. The future you want to inhabit.
How would that make you feel?
I write on my blog about how to build relationships in our inter-connected world, and so I hear all the time about people who are struggling with their current relationships. They ask me what they should do.
And I can honestly say if you find you are not surrounded by a group of people who support you, then find a new community who does support you. That's what Fizzle is for me.
If Fizzle sounds like a community for you, then you can learn more about Fizzle here . (Full disclosure: If you do sign up through my link, I also get a modest affiliate commission, but that seriously is a very minor consideration. I would just want more cool people inside.)
But more importantly, find yourself a community and go build relationships and build connections. That's what really matters.

Innovation Reconsideredreddit
"I only came for the sushi," joked the dapper young man in the plaid shirt, popping a roll into his mouth. His friend turned his gaze away from the paintings on display at Portland's Elizabeth Leach Gallery and said, "He's lying. He's got 'innovate' tattooed on his arm."
That turned out to be a lie, too. But just because he didn't ink it doesn't mean he doesn't believe in it. The two friends were part of the hundred-odd designers, students, leaders, and entrepreneurs who attended a panel discussion on innovation hosted by Liquid Agency in Portland, Oregon.
What drives innovation? What stops it in its tracks? As part of Design Week Portland, a multidisciplinary exploration of the process, craft, and practice of design, I got to pose those questions to four business innovators: Jeff Faulkner, Creative Director for Analog at Microsoft; Micheael Shea, former creative director at Nike's Innovation Kitchen and cofounder of School+Jackson; Mohan Nair, Chief Innovation Officer at Cambia Health Solutions; and Genevieve Bell, Intel Vice President & Fellow.
The discussion was a heady one. Instead of focusing on the practicalities and modes of encouraging innovation, the panelists dove into dissecting the concept itself.
I suggested that an innovation is any invention that makes the world change around it. Mohan, too, invoked the idea of transformation: "it transforms the persons I seek to transform, and it also transforms me."
Michael noted the importance of execution. "If you can't put it out there, nothing's going to happen," he reminded the room. "You have to execute on creative insights." In other words, you can be as creative as you want to be and still not be innovative if you don't get your product to market.
Genevieve Bell pointed out that innovation doesn't always change things for the better. "The 20th century is littered with innovations that changed our lives that aren't necessarily good." She, for one, does not want an internet-connected toothbrush .
The Internet of Things became a bit of a punching bag for these tech-savvy thinkers. "Is it cool to get in an accident because you're turning off your washing machine at a stop light?" Michael asked, while Jeff wondered what exactly Facebook and its ilk are "doing to us."
The consensus, rather quickly reached, was that true innovation must aim for a larger societal good. Technological progress for the sake of technological progress was just more "noise," Jeff suggested. Mohan argued that we "should be worried about the health of our country and our world" broadly--and, mores specifically, things like cost of health care and education.
Taking it a step farther, one could argue that narrowly defined goals like shareholder value are damaging to society, since they tend to encourage irresponsibility in the name of a single group, causing other groups and future generations to pay for collateral damage.
It's a powerful thought. What if we put our energies toward creating broad-based, long-term value instead of mere shareholder value or corporate profits? What if we picked higher goals, as Mohan urged: "Aim for things you think you cannot reach and that will transform you"?
We still need a community of thinkers and makers and designers and funders who will spur innovation onwards, whether it's an internet-connected gadget that improves our morning routines or a novel way to produce clean energy.  As Michael reminded the room, "It's not a matter of 'if there's a will, there's a way.' You need a way... You need partners, teammates, experts.... You also need resources. And resources don't always mean cash. It means thought leaders, for example, and the alchemy of your team."
I think we provided a little alchemy of innovation that night. Not to mention free sushi.

More on Clarence Thomas and KorematsuBy Ilya Somin October 24
Drake Law School Professor Mark Kende has posted a response to my critique of his argument that Justice Clarence Thomas supports the Supreme Court’s infamous decision in Korematsu v. United States, which upheld the World War II-era internment of over 100,000 Japanese-Americans.
In my previous post, I emphasized that Thomas’ occasional positive citations to Korematsu are limited to a largely uncontroversial part of its holding: that racial classifications are subject to strict scrutiny national security is a “compelling” government interest that might sometimes justify racial discrimination in extreme circumstances. By contrast, he has never said that the Korematsu Court correctly applied that rule to the facts of the case before it. Kende responds as follows:
[I]n the Fisher v. Texas affirmative action [case], Justice Thomas cites to Korematsu as supporting the forcible relocation of Japanese-Americans on the west coast even under strict scrutiny. Thomas in Fisher said that Korematsu found the internment “had a definite and close relationship to the prevention of espionage and sabotage.” But Ilya then says that Justice Thomas is only “summarizing” Korematsu without necessarily approving it (despite Thomas’s recitation of the facts). This is odd. For example, at the end of his essay Ilya says that Justice Thomas is “usually among the justices least willing to suppress his own views for the sake of consensus.” By that logic, one would suspect Justice Thomas cited Korematsu approvingly in Fisher. Thomas could have cited other cases.
There is no contradiction here. I did not claim that Thomas, in this passage, suppressed his view on Korematsu for the sake of consensus. He simply chose not to give a comprehensive analysis of the rightness (or lack thereof) of Korematsu, because he didn’t need to do so to make the very limited point this passage was devoted to. All he did was 1) cite Korematsu for the mostly uncontroversial proposition that national security is a compelling state interest (the supposed threat of espionage and sabotage is of course a national security interest), and 2) summarize its holding in a passage whose main function is to summarize past cases where the Supreme Court held that a particular interest is important enough to qualify as compelling for strict scrutiny purposes. He could perhaps have cited a different case for the former proposition. But, as Thomas himself explained, he cited Korematsu because it was both the first case to hold that strict scrutiny applies to racial classifications and the first to conclude that national security was an important enough interest to pass strict scrutiny.
Kende also argues that Thomas’ dissent in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld can’t be distinguished from Korematsu on the basis that the former involved alleged enemy combatants, whereas the latter involved civilians who were not enemy combatants or even claimed to be such. Kende suggests that “[t]he alleged grave national security concerns asserted by American military leaders and by the President regarding Japanese-American loyalty on the west coast, and regarding the supposed danger of invasion, would have likely created far greater national security worries for Justice Thomas than a single enemy combatant.” Obviously, the issue in Hamdi was not just the status of a single enemy combatant, but the way alleged enemy combatants should be handled in the War on Terror more generally (just as the rule in Korematsu was not limited to Fred Korematsu himself). Moreover, there are a obvious differences between alleged enemy combatants and ordinary civilians distinguished from the rest of the population only by race or national origin. The latter both have stronger legal rights and are less likely to be threats to national security than the former.
Kende also suggests that Thomas’ deference to racial classifications by prison officials in Johnson v. California would require him to deter to the government in Korematsu because “Japanese-American internment camps were… the essential equivalent of prisons.” The camps were certainly prison-like in the sense that their inmates were not free to leave at will. But, as I noted in my earlier post, the camps were not legally equivalent to prisons because the Japanese-Americans interned in them had never been convicted of any crime, or even charged with one. Thus, they are not covered by various precedents holding that convicted criminals incarcerated for their crimes have much weaker constitutional rights than ordinary citizens. As I also pointed out, this distinction is likely the reason why Justice Scalia joined Thomas’ dissent in Johnson, but also opposes the Korematsu decision .
Finally, Kende argues that Thomas’ failure to cite Korematsu in his dissent in Hamdi is somehow an indication that he agrees with the former. He suggests that Thomas chose not to cite it, despite its potential relevance, because he did not want to reveal the fact that he agreed with it. If Thomas really were intent on hiding his supposed agreement with Korematsu by avoiding citation to it, one would think that he would also avoid citing it in other opinions. Yet, as Kende emphasizes he did cite it in at least two other cases. Moreover, Thomas’ omission of Korematsu from the discussion of precedents supporting his position in Hamdi could just as easily be construed as due to disagreement with the case. Unlike in Fisher, where the relevant part of Korematsu was largely uncontroversial, in Hamdi the relevant part was the Court’s deference to the executive on the question of whether the Japanese-Americans really posed a serious enough threat to justify racially-based internment. Quite possibly, Thomas chose not to cite the Court’s analysis on this point because he thought it was wrong.

Euro dips ahead of banks  stress test results  sterling firm0
The dollar posted its largest one-day loss against the yen since mid-October, falling after four straight days of gains. On the year, however, the dollar was still up 14 percent.
The U.S. currency's losses were in line with the drop in Treasury debt yields and stocks. The benchmark U.S. 10-year note yield was last at 2.24 percent, down from 2.31 percent last Friday.
"We're drifting off in the dollar and this is just consolidation," said Shaun Osborne, chief currency strategist at TD Securities in Toronto. "All the signs point to a stronger dollar. Oil prices are down, we have a Fed meeting next week and some are pointing to a possible change in language."
Earlier in the session, the dollar soared to a fresh two-year high against the euro, a seven-year high versus the yen and touched a five-year peak versus a currency basket. It also rose to its highest in 15 months versus the pound.
The euro stumbled after Ewald Nowotny, the Austrian central bank chief, said government bond buying could be valuable in addressing the "massive" weakening of the euro zone economy.
The euro fell to a low of $1.2247 after Nowotny's comments, but was last up 0.4 percent at $1.2332 .
"Markets are pretty much pricing in a Fed rate hike by the middle of 2015 and a growing likelihood of the ECB unleashing full scale QE (quantitative easing) in the months ahead," said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions in Washington.
The dollar surged to 121.84 yen , before falling 0.8 percent to 120.52 yen. Japan's national election on Dec. 14 is seen as likely to give a boost to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and reflationary policies that should further weaken the yen.
The dollar index climbed as high as 89.550 <.DXY>, its highest since March 2009. The index was last at 89.047, down 0.3 percent.

Does the air umbrella actually workComments
By Tuan C. Nguyen October 24
The air umbrella is a novel idea, but blasting away raindrops with air is going overboard. (Chuan Wang)
Umbrellas have been around seemingly forever. But if there were ever to be a second coming, it wouldn’t be a stretch to assume it would resemble the air umbrella.
Conceived in the form of a sleek wand, the device is both minimalist and high-tech. Push a button and a stream of jet air flows out from the motorized tip, generating an invisible barrier against the rain. It’s almost too perfect.
Of course, then, we have the big question of whether an actual product will ever materialize.  
For now, specifics are spare. The inventor’s fundraising campaign site on Kickstarter features a promotional video that, using a series of graphics-rendered mock-ups, details various models currently under development. Backers can choose from a compact women’s version, which measures a foot long, weighs just over a pound and is limited to 15 minute of operation on a single charge, as well as two other models that are longer and can run for 30 minutes. Near the end, there’s a brief lab demo of the latest prototype.  
With that, the air umbrella easily blew past its goal of $10,000. As of this writing, it’s raised just over $100,000, with funding set to close Friday morning.
To its credit, the air umbrella aims to solve some of the most pervasively glaring flaws of umbrella design. For one, the folding mechanism that enables canopies to collapse down also tends to give way to gusts that get caught along the inside, causing it to invert. Even when functionally intact, some parts can still poke passerbys. There’s also that annoying “wet umbrella” problem.   
A handful of start-ups have tried tackling these deficiencies through clever redesigns, though all fall short in some way. Alternatives include the redrawn Rainshader , with a canopy that’s curved downward, away from nearby pedestrians and the Senz umbrella , a variant that’s aerodynamically-formulated to channel wind flow fluidly across the surface to prevent the kind of resistance that can flip an umbrella inside-out. In Japan, inventor Hiroshi Kajimoto introduced the UnBRELLA , which, ironically, is designed to fold inside-out to allow excess droplets to drain out. 
The air umbrella design isn’t besieged with any of these complications because, well, there’s no actual physical canopy, so to speak. Simply put, as raindrops fall, a continuous stream of fast-moving air catches and blows them sideways. The physics is somewhat similar to how a leaf blower works.
“Rain falls at a terminal velocity or steady speed of 7 mph, which is reasonably slow,” explains Louis Bloomfield, a physics professor at the University of Virginia and author of How Things Work: The Physics of Everyday Life. “So with a consistent wind force, you can conceivably redirect their path away from the person below.”
While Bloomfield, who has no connection to the project, deems the technology to be fundamentally sound, he did question the practicality of a high-priced (starting at $88) gadget that weighs up to two pounds and takes at least an hour to recharge.
“With jetted air, you have only a fraction of a second to get it going sideways very quickly and that’ll require a lot of power to produce forces that strong,” he adds. “I imagine if you’re going for a walk, it’s likely the battery will run out on you.”
And though no one is in danger of getting poked, sharing a sidewalk with an air umbrella will likely mean enduring another kind of annoyance. 
“For people nearby, it might feel like walking in a windstorm because they’ll definitely feel a breeze,” he says. “It’ll probably be worse for the person next to you because they’ll also be sprayed by the drops that are being blown aside.”
His recommendation? Stick with a standard, unpowered $5 umbrella. 
“Even if you have a fancy, high-tech device, you’re still going to end up needing a regular umbrella anyway.” he says. “That kind of defeats the purpose, I think.”

What was fake on the Internet this week: Banksys arrest  Red Velvet Oreos and exploding bongsBy Caitlin Dewey October 24 Follow @caitlindewey
A screenshot from the satirical Facebook page “Christians for Michele Bachmann.” (Facebook)
There is so much fake stuff on the Internet in any given week that we’ve grown tired of debunking it all. Fake Twitter fights . Fake pumpkin-spice products . Amazing viral video? Nope — a Jimmy Kimmel stunt !
So rather than take down each and every undeservedly viral story that crosses our monitors each week, we’re rounding them all up in a quick, once-a-week Friday debunk of fake photos, misleading headlines and bad studies that you probably shouldn’t share over the weekend.
Ready? Here’s what was fake on the Internet this week:
1. Banksy was not arrested in Bristol. This is not the first time that Paul Horner has tricked the Internet into thinking he’s Banksy. This latest hoax, spurred by a (fake) story that Horner wrote for the (fake) news site National Report, was read by nearly 5 million people — and shared more than 3 million times. Of course, as we discovered in a long chat with Horner this week , he’s a would-be comedian in Phoenix … not, you know, an elusive graffiti mastermind with a cult-like following. Incidentally, the real Banksy painted a new mural  just this Monday.
2. New York police did not stop and frisk two Muslim men for wearing traditional garments. Some 200,000 viewers were rightly disturbed by a video that surfaced on YouTube over the weekend, purportedly showing an NYPD officer confronting two Muslim men over their clothes. The officer in the video was, however, and actor — and the men in the video were forced to admit, after taking a bit of Internet heat, that the clip was “a dramatization … to raise awareness for Racial Profiling.” Unfortunately, that message seems to have gone right over some commenters’ heads: “These muhammadan seditionists need to be arrested for impersonating a police officer,” raged one popular comment. “[They] are abusing our laws to line their own pockets and to gain more islamic terrorists through their twisted lies.” The lies might be twisted, but they’re just trying to gain YouTube hits, bro.
3. There is no Red Velvet Oreo. Marketing students in San Marcos, Tex., should definitely get an A for this little stunt, wherein they Photoshopped a crimson cookie onto an Oreo package and claimed that Nabisco was launching the new flavor for Valentine’s Day. Nabisco has not, alas, chosen to weigh in on the issue. But a Facebook post on the “Red Velvet Oreo” page two days ago would seem to confirm that this weird novelty — like Butterbeer and Fried Chicken before it! — isn’t actually meant to be.
4. An exploding bong did not take off half a woman’s face. A Facebook PSA about the dangers of marijuana — captioned, scarily, “THIS COULD HAPPEN TO YOU” — claims that a young woman was gruesomely disfigured when her bong exploded. In fact, the woman pictured is an Internet-famous makeup artist dressed up for a zombie bar crawl … and “Christians for Michele Bachman,” the page that posted her picture, is satirical and has nothing to do with the politician. Alas, this has not stopped 21,000 people from sharing the post, and a whopping 49,000 from commenting.
“How did this dumb s*** get on my page?” One man wrote. “It’s an insult that they think we are this stupid. LOST MY VOTE.”
Did we miss any other notable fake stuff this week? E-mail caitlin.dewey@washpost.com — or stay tuned until next week, because surely some more shenanigans will go down in the meantime.

Partial solar eclipse: Stunning photos from D.C. and beyondStargazers in Florida gather to watch a partial solar eclipse near a pier in Naples on Thursday. (Jay Staton )
 
Considerable cloud cover meant Thursday evening’s partial solar eclipse often played hide and seek for D.C. area skywatchers.  Nevertheless, a number of photographers managed to capture magnificent views.  Not only do photos reveal the “pac-man”-like bite taken out of the sun, but several also show the prominent sunspot region AR2192, the largest observed since 1990 , some 80,000 miles across!
Here we share with you standout images from the D.C. area and other parts of the nation, collected from Flickr , Twitter , and Facebook , as well as shared with us via email.  Thanks to everyone who sent pictures to our attention!

With Lalu attacking JD(U) s  weak  governance and Manjhi playing Dalit card  Nitish goes back to yatra politicsJD(U) senior leader Nitish Kumar addresses a protest dharna for special status to Bihar, in Patna on Monday. (Source: PTI)
Written by Santosh Singh | Patna | Posted: October 24, 2014 3:21 pm
BJP’s victory in Maharashtra and Haryana Assembly elections may have caused discomfort and some amount of self-doubt in the much-touted grand alliance of RJD-JD (U)-Congress, but it still has not given these parties a sense of urgency to come together with a common poll plank. All top Bihar leaders from grand alliance camp have been backing on their individual strengths rather than pursuing a common goal against BJP.
While RJD chief Lalu Prasad has been recovering from heart surgery, party vice president and former Union minister Raghuvansh Prasad Singh has started the party campaign, of course, with backing from Lalu Prasad, to take up “issue of public concerns”. Singh has, in fact, chosen 34-point agenda to attack JD (U) more than the ruling NDA.
Amidst such backdrop, former chief minister Nitish Kumar is back to his own Yatra politics, all by himself. He is back to renew his old agenda of demanding special status for Bihar, which otherwise failed to emerge a poll plank in last Lok Sabha elections. RJD legislature party leader AB Siddiqui asks how Nitish Kumar is thinking of consolidating alliance with RJD and giving it a formal shape when he is “running his own tune” to gain his lost political ground. Kumar will start his Sampark Yatra from West Champaran, again invoking Champaran symbolism of Gandhi, from 13 November and will cover two districts in a day.
Bihar Chief Minister Jeetan Ram Manjhi is bent on further “ultra Dalit” agenda, which has made the task of forging a strong grand alliance all the more difficult. Manjhi told a public gathering at Gaya on Thursday that Dalits, who are about 16 per cent of Bihar population, can make it count in next Assembly election. “I was made chief minister. If there is a greater political awareness, Dalits are in a position to choose its leader (read CM) after next polls, ” said Manjhi, who has earlier courted controversy for asking Dalits”to raise their numbers” by inter-caste marriage.
Nitish Kumar, the “yatri” trying to back his development politics, is now caught between personal ambition of Manjhi and “recalcitrance” of Lalu Prasad to not “allow him become a leader of grand alliance”. Nitish, who looks desperate to keep his pan-Indian appeal intact by joining meeting of regional parties outside Bihar, has now challenge at his own turf. The special status plank is the only thing that may get him into focus. But then, it remains to be seen how he tries to convince people against resurgent BJP under Narendra Modi.

SSTL sought permission to increase FDI up to 100 per cent in the company and its downstream wholly owned subsidiary Shyam Internet Services Ltd, both engaged in the telecom sector, on account of conversion of redeemable preference shares into equity.

French filmmakers shoot secret documentary on Jarawa  FIR filedFrench filmmakers shoot secret documentary on Jarawa, FIR filed
PTI
Tweet
Port Blair, Oct 24:  
Two French filmmakers have been booked on the charge of trespassing into the protected Jarawa tribal reserve in the Andaman islands and filming a documentary on the threatened aboriginal tribe.
“We have filed an FIR against French director Alexandre Dereims and producer Claire Beilvert for violating the law of the land. Entering the Jarawa area is banned and so are making any contact with them or shooting any photo or video,” the union territory’s Tribal Welfare Secretary Theva Neethi Dhas told PTI today.
“The police are investigating the matter and gathering evidences against them. If the charges are proved, it could lead to three years of imprisonment, besides a fine,” the Secretary said.
He said two local inhabitants have been arrested for allegedly helping the filmmakers to enter the Jarawa area.
The case was registered on October 19 while the incident is said to have happened during March-April.
The matter came to light only when the Andaman Adim Janjati Vikas Samiti (AAJVS) reported the matter to the administration.
Dhas said they had already sent notices to the filmmakers, who have returned to their homeland, asking them to restrain from releasing any visual related to the Jarawas.
The administration will also ask the Ministry of External Affairs to take up the matter with the French government, he said.
Charges against the two French filmmakers include violation of Protection of the Aboriginal Tribes (Amendment) Act 2012, Foreigners Amendment Act 2004, and Information Technology Act.
Under post-production stage now, the film ‘Organic Jarawa’ is about Utchu, a two-year-old Jarawa boy, his family and friends.

Hudhud : NIO vessel capsizes off Vizag 
 
The coastal research vessel (CRV) -- Sagar Paschmi -- of the National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIO) capsized off Visakhapatnam coast on the day of cyclone Hudhud,  according to a press release issued by Forward Seamen's Union of India.
Abdul Sharieff, the union representative, said the vessel belonging to the Shipping Corporation of India was on hire to the NIO and on the day of the cyclone it sank near the fishing harbour. All the 12 crew members escaped unhurt. He said it was regrettable that neither the SCI nor the NIO had deemed it fit to report the capsize of the vessel with costly equipment worth crores. Nor did the authorities bother about the crew, he alleged.

Govt sets up think-tank to fine-tune IPR policyGovt sets up think-tank to fine-tune IPR policy
Our Bureau
Tweet
New Delhi, Oct 24:  
The Government has constituted an Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) think-tank to help draft a new National IPR Policy and to advice it on issues related to intellectual property.
The think-tank, headed by Justice Prabha Sridevan, will highlight anomalies in the present IPR legislations and advice the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) on possible solutions, according to an official release.
It will also provide views on the possible implications of demands placed by negotiating partners of proposed free trade pacts and other regional arrangements.
With several developed countries criticising India’s IP regime on grounds of laxity and the US carrying out a review to see if it should be black-listed as a `priority country’ for giving insufficient IP protection to its companies, the think-tank is expected to play an important role in helping the Government deal with international pressure.
Other members of the IPR think-tank include Narendra K Sabarwal, former Deputy Director General of World Intellectual Property Organisation, Rajeev Srinivasan, Director, Asian School of Business, Advocate Pratibha Singh, Advocate Punita Bhargava and Cadila Pharma’s Unnat Pandit.
The DIPP, which constituted the think-tank of Friday, will co-ordinate with it to identify areas in intellectual property where study needs to be conducted, an official release said.
It will also take inputs from it on the new IPR policy which has been proposed to bring clarity in existing laws and safeguard interests of Indian industry.
An inter-ministerial group, with representatives from Ministries and Departments including Commerce & Industry, Health, Information & Broadcasting and Telecom, will soon meet to discuss the new policy for India’s IPR.

Queen Elizabeth sends her first TweetBy Frances Stead Sellers October 24 Follow @FrancesSSellers
Queen Elizabeth II sent her first tweet Friday - and she signed it “Elizabeth R.” The 88-year-old monarch tried her hand at Twitter as she opened a new gallery in central London’s Science Museum. (AP)
It looked as if there was a little sleight of hand today at 11:35 a.m. GMT when the Queen opened a new gallery at London’s Science Museum and launched herself into the Information Age by sending her first tweet.
Her Majesty walked over to a tablet perched on a podium, removed a glove, and …  a tweet appeared from @BritishMonarchy, an account with about 725,000 followers that is usually managed by Buckingham palace officials.
It is a pleasure to open the Information Age exhibition today at the @ScienceMuseum and I hope people will enjoy visiting. Elizabeth R.
But it didn’t look as if she actually typed.
The text prizes accuracy and formality over the usual conventions of 140-character missives.
There was a little redundancy in this construction: “at the @ScienceMuseum,” but the Queen made up for it with her characteristically abbreviated signature: “Elizabeth R.”
When you are the monarch, after all, you don’t need a last name — and you probably don’t need to compose your own tweet. You can just press “post.”
Still, it was enough to send a twitter of approval among 600 or so guests including such members of Britain’s IT glitterati as  Sir Nigel Shadbolt and Mo Ibrahim who gathered Friday morning to celebrate the opening of the new gallery in one of London’s most popular museums.

Pakistan in command despite Warners centuryPakistan in command despite Warner’s century
PTI
Tweet
Dubai, Oct 24:  
Pakistan’s spin bowlers shared six wickets between them to take control of the first Test against Australia despite a brilliant hundred by David Warner on the third day today.
Warner smashed 133 for his ninth Test century and his third in as many innings to match the indomitable Donald Bradman.
But Pakistan hit back to dismiss Australia for 303 in their first innings, for a first innings lead of 151, after they had made 454.
By the close, Pakistan had made 38—0 in their second innings with Ahmed Shehzad (22) and Azhar Ali (16) at the crease, stretching their lead to 189.
Debutant leg—spinner Yasir Shah (3—66) led the spin attack while left—armer Zulfiqar Babar (2—81) and Mohammad Hafeez (1—54) also chipped in as, apart from Warner, none of the other batsman made big scores.
Michael Clarke failed with a 13—ball two and so did Alex Doolan (five).
It was Warner who anchored the innings, becoming seventh Australian batsmen to score three consecutive hundreds, the feat last achieved by Adam Gilchrist (2005) and Bradman (1948).
But with his third ball after lunch, Shah spun sharply to bowl Warner, who had hit 11 fours and two sixes during his 174—ball knock, but his fall saw Australia slump against spinners.
Mitchell Marsh (27) and Brad Haddin (22) took Australia to 248—5 during their 42—run stand for the sixth wicket but Pakistan broke through with the new ball, taken as soon it was due after 80 overs.
Paceman Imran Khan (1—54) had Haddin bowled off an inside edge while Babar had Marsh lbw.
Warner saw Australia lose Chris Rogers (38), Doolan and Clarke in the space of just 30 runs before he and Steven Smith (22) added 48 for the fourth wicket.
Warner drove Khan to cover boundary for his eighth four to complete his hundred off just 128 balls.
The left—hander had hit a century in each innings against South Africa at Cape Town in Australia’s last Test in March this year.

Paswan demands hike in import duty on edible oilsPaswan demands hike in import duty on edible oils
PTI
Solvent Extractors Association (SEA) has been demanding a duty hike in crude edible oils to 10 per cent and on refined edible oils to 25 per cent to arrest cheaper imports from Malaysia and Indonesia.
New Delhi, Oct 24:  
Food Minister Ram Vilas Paswan today met Finance Minister Arun Jaitley here and discussed the issue of raising import duty on crude and refined edible oils to restrict cheap imports and protect domestic farmers, among other matters.
Problems faced by sugar mills in availing of loans sanctioned through the Sugar Development Fund (SDF) and the issue of additional budget allocation for FCI were also discussed.
“The proposals on increasing import duty on edible oils, additional budget for FCI and loan issue under SDF, among others, were on the agenda of the meeting,” Paswan told PTI.
The Food Ministry favours increasing the import duty on crude and refined edible oils from existing 2.5 per cent and 10 per cent, respectively, he said.
Industry body Solvent Extractors Association (SEA) has been demanding a duty hike in crude edible oils to 10 per cent and on refined edible oils to 25 per cent as local prices have fallen to historical lows due to cheaper imports from Malaysia and Indonesia.
On sugar sector issues, Paswan briefed the Finance Minister about the current impasse between the UP sugar mills and the state government over cane price policy, sources said.

David Warner ton in vain as Pakistan takes crucialleadDavid Warner was on top of his game earlier in the day but Pakistan spinners ruled the roost after that. (Source: Express File Photo)
By: Associated Press | Dubai | Posted: October 24, 2014 8:39 pm | Updated: October 24, 2014 9:07 pm
Pakistan stretched its lead to a commanding 189 runs after inexperienced spinners Yasir Shah and Zulfiqar Babar dismissed Australia for 303 on the third day of the first Test on Friday.
Opening batsmen Ahmed Shehzad, 22 not out, and Azhar Ali, 16 not out, guided the home team to 38 without loss at stumps, after Pakistan pushed Australia into a tight corner with a solid 151-run, first-innings lead.
Legspinner Shah, playing his first Test, chipped in with 3-66 while left-arm spinner Babar claimed 2-81 in only his third Test as they predictably exposed Australia’s vulnerability on a subcontinent-like slow pitch.
Opening batsman David Warner thwarted the spinners for well over 4 hours in scoring 133, his third successive Test century, but Australia stumbled from a healthy 128-0 in the morning to lose 10 wickets for 175 runs.
No. 8 batsman Mitchell Johnson, with 37, boosted Australia’s total with the third best score before holing out in the deep off Rahat Ali, who took 2-55. Shah wrapped up the innings by taking the last wicket of Steve O’Keefe.
Earlier, resuming at the overnight 113-0, Australia lost four wickets before lunch and another four in the second session as Pakistan’s bowlers never allowed the batsmen to settle down.
Shah removed Steven Smith for 22 just before lunch, and clean-bowled Warner with a sharp turner in the first over after lunch.
Warner scored centuries at Cape Town in his last test against South Africa in March, but was more circumspect as the wickets started falling around him.
He faced 174 balls, hitting 11 fours and two sixes before Shah made the ball turn through the rough while bowling round the wicket.
Pakistan’s other debutant, fast bowler Imran Khan, was rewarded with his first wicket when he knocked back Brad Haddin’s offstump in his first over with the second new ball as Australia plunged to 249-6.
Mitchell Marsh’s father, Geoff, who also played international cricket for Australia, cheered from the stands when he saw his son successfully overturn a caught behind decision on 26 off fast bowler Ali, but was not lucky a run later when Babar won an lbw decision through the Decision Review System.
Peter Siddle was next to go, lbw to Mohammad Hafeez’s offspin for a four-ball duck at 267-8. Hafeez later walked off the field when he twisted his right ankle while fielding off his own bowling, and Ali opened Pakistan’s second innings.
In the absence of suspended star Saeed Ajmal, the spinners tied down the Australians, and even the free-flowing Warner in an extended first session.
Warner completed his century off 128 balls with eight fours and a six when he hit his first boundary of the day in the 18th over by driving Khan through extra cover.
Alex Doolan took 16 deliveries to score his first run before his shaky 34-ball innings for 5 ended when he continued…

Sonia  Rahul Gandhi should speak more  saysChidambaramPrint
Former Union minister P Chidambaram (Source: PTI)
By: Express News Service | New Delhi | Posted: October 24, 2014 8:18 pm | Updated: October 25, 2014 1:04 am
Former Finance Minister P Chidambaram on Friday said the Congress morale was “pretty low” at the moment and that both party president Sonia Gandhi and vice-president Rahul Gandhi needed to “speak more”. They should show the “urgency” to reorganise the party and lead the Congress to play the role of the “true opposition”, Chidambaram told NDTV news channel. He also agreed a non-Gandhi could lead the party “some day”.
On the land deal between Sonia’s son-in-law Robert Vadra and real estate firm DLF in Haryana, he said, “I don’t know the facts. Whether they (the Haryana government) were helping him or whether they were taking a routine decision, I don’t know the facts. So how can I comment on that.”
“Without knowing the facts, I don’t think it is fair to comment on any particular transaction. Unless I have the papers in front of me, unless I have the facts in front of me, I can’t comment on any transaction,” he said. Asked if he was distancing himself from the issue, he said, “If I am obliged to comment, if I am authorised to comment, I will, provided I have before me the fact and the papers.”
Asked whether the Vadra issue created a perception problem for the Congress, he said, “May be it did. I don’t know.” Asked whether the party handled it effectively, he said, “I don’t know. May be it did, but these are questions which must be answered by people who were there in the field in Haryana, people who were contesting elections. I don’t know.”
Chidambaram said he was concerned about the lack of visibility of Sonia and Rahul Gandhi. “I would urge the Congress president and the Congress vice-president to speak more. I would urge them to come and address more rallies, I would urge them to meet the media. I would urge them to do that,” he said.
He said Sonia continues to be “the most acceptable leader of his generation” and Rahul has wide acceptance among the younger members of the party. Asked whether a non-Gandhi could become the Congress president, he said, “I think so. Some day, yes.”
He agreed that the Congress morale was pretty low but said it can be lifted. “I agree that the Congress morale is pretty low. But I don’t agree that the morale cannot be lifted, that a direction cannot be given… It’s a matter of time, more accurately a matter of timing. I am sure that the Congress leadership has its own timetable. I would urge again that the timetable be shortened and get on with the job of reorganising the party and getting on with the job of being true opposition.” Asked whether he felt the Congress leadership need to respond with a little more urgency, he said, “I think so.”
“I have, not only I, others have urged that the reorganisation that was promised in continued…

I also applied for additional shares. But I don`t think we will get 90%. The issue oversubscribed by 1.14 times and not 0.14 times. So those who applied for 21400 additional shares may get only 10000 shares. Also they may give preference to big investors like RJ.

Kochi, October 24:  
SmartCity Kochi has received environmental clearance for the entire project covering 246 acres, even as the construction of the first IT building is fast nearing completion.
Gigo Joseph, CEO, said the environmental clearance was received in July last year for the 6.5 lakh sq ft first IT building (SCK01), and later the company applied for the rest of the project, which has now been cleared.
According to him, not less than 8.8 million sq ft built-up area will be developed, with substantial area left for greenery and open spaces, attracting companies from within India and abroad.
Joseph said the environmental clearance was given at the meeting of State Environment Impact Assessment Authority Kerala (SEIAA-K) followed by the State Expert Appraisal Committee’s (SEAC) recommendations.
He said SEAC appreciated SmartCity’s effort in presenting a clear-cut master plan of the project. Now, as the decks have been cleared for the entire project, the company will speed up the construction of infrastructure.
SmartCity has entered into agreements for joint development of infrastructure with leading IT, hospitality, realty and education companies to make the hub an integrated township.

The U.N. says water is a fundamental human right in DetroitBy Emily Badger October 23 Follow @emilymbadger
Detroit residents address members of the United Nations during a UN Fact-Finding Town Hall Meeting, Sunday, Oct. 19, 2014, at Wayne County Community College in Detroit. (AP Photo/Detroit News, Jose Juarez)
Representatives from the United Nations spent a few days in Detroit earlier this week looking into the spate of utility shutoffs that left thousands of poor households in the city this year without water to bathe and cook by.
The two special rapporteurs — one on "the human right to water and sanitation," the other on "adequate housing" — were invited to town not by the city, but by community groups that have been advocating for the poor. And their conclusion reinforces what concerned on-lookers have been saying since this summer: "When people are genuinely unable to pay the bill," the U.N. says, the state is obligated to step up with financial assistance and subsidies. "Not doing so amounts to a human rights violation."
The ensuing narrative is provocative, representing a kind of rock bottom for the Motor City (and the U.S. by implication): The U.N. just condemned an American city for violating the fundamental rights of its own residents — rights that families in much more impoverished countries should be able to expect, too. As a reminder, the rapporteurs add in their statement, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights "is fully applicable to the United States," too.
"We were deeply disturbed," their statement says, "to observe the indignity people have faced and continue to live with in one of the wealthiest countries in the world and in a city that was a symbol of America’s prosperity."
This is an important conversation for American cities to have, even outside Detroit: whether water should be a right, and if so, how we plan to ensure that. But the problem in Detroit is also much more complicated than the U.N.'s scolding relays.
What makes the situation there so terrible is not that city officials have decided some people don't deserve water, or that they have blithely disregarded anyone's rights; it's that the city has many problems, this one included, and each one complicates the task of resolving all the others.
The city must figure out how to restore water to people who can't pay, while distinguishing them from people who simply won't pay (because that's a problem the city has, too). It has to figure out how to cover the costs of subsidizing water for the poor without further raising rates for households of more modest incomes (because water bills in Detroit are already well above the national average). Detroit has to find the resources to serve one of the most impoverished populations in the country — all while that very poverty has helped sap the resources the city once had.
Perhaps it's the UN's job to preach that water is a human right. But the logistics of making that a reality are much, much more complicated than saying it should be so.

Why are so few women on the business side of tech companiesBy Brigid Schulte and Jena McGregor October 23 Follow @BrigidSchulte Follow @jenamcgregor
Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer of Facebook, speaks during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Thursday, Jan. 24, 2013. Photographer: Simon Dawson/Bloomberg
The conventional explanation for why there are so few women in high tech has hinged on a simple statistic: Only about 18 percent of computer science and engineering degrees go to women every year.
Yet tech companies have experts in finance, marketing, sales — not just programming. And women account for nearly 40 percent of all MBA graduates. Moreover, many financial services companies hire equal numbers of men and women at the entry level. So Catalyst , a nonprofit research organization focused on the advancement of women, wanted to figure out if women are faring better on the business side of the fast-growing tech world.
They aren’t.
Among MBA graduates, fewer women than men choose to go into tech-intensive fields, Catalyst found in a report  released Thursday. And when women with MBAs do opt in, they tend to start out in lower-paying, lower-level positions than their male counterparts do. They also are significantly more likely to leave — not the workforce, as many assume, but the tech industry itself.
Catalyst  analyzed  the career paths of nearly 10,000 MBA graduates from 2007 to 2014 in the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia. It found that 53 percent of the women left tech-intensive professions for other work, compared to 31 percent of the men.
“These industries have reputations for being exclusive — the 'brogrammer' culture in high tech, the Old Boys’ Club is really typical in oil and gas, automotive and manufacturing. And it turns out, these reputations are really well deserved,” says Anna Beninger, the report's author and Catalyst’s research director. "The tech industry has some significant culture issues, and it’s really damaging their ability to attract the best talent.”
Companies like Google , Facebook and Twitter  are not only male heavy on the tech side, but they have few women in business or in leadership. "Women coming out of business schools, looking to advance their careers, look at these industries and realize they’ll be the only woman in the room," Beninger says. "So they’re looking elsewhere.”
Or, put more bluntly, female MBA graduates see these testosterone-fueled tech cultures, Beninger says, and “they run screaming.” One female technology executive, who has worked for several major tech firms but requested anonymity to speak freely, recalled that in the late 1990s she would see lines in the ladies room at the companies where she worked. "Now they're empty. The women have gone somewhere."
In the report, “ High Potentials in Tech-Intensive Industries: The Gender Divide in Business Roles ,” Beninger found that women with MBAs felt like outsiders even on the business side of technology companies. In tech, compared with other industries, they were more likely to work on a team with 10 percent or fewer women. They had fewer female supervisors and role models. And they were less likely to say they had a clear sense of how they were being evaluated.
The research not only compared women's experiences across fields, it looked at the difference in outlooks between female and male MBA grads within the same technology sector. The women were more than twice as likely to say that having no role models was a significant barrier to their advancement (18 percent to men's 7 percent). Fewer aspired to the C-suite (84 percent to men’s 97 percent). And they were more likely to downsize their aspirations (37 percent to men's 25 percent).
This expands on what other recent surveys and studies have shown: Corporate cultures, not just education, are a big reason behind the low number of women in high tech. The Center for Talent Innovation , a research think tank, published a report in February which found that U.S. women are 45 percent more likely than their male peers to plan to leave such "lab-coat, hard-hat and geek workplace cultures" within one year.
It doesn't help that some people running tech firms don't think these female MBA graduates could ultimately lead them. CTI's study found that nearly a third of senior leaders — both men and women — in science, technology and engineering fields don't believe a woman would ever reach the top position in their companies.
"Women MBAs work incredibly hard in whatever industry you put them in," says Laura Sherbin, director of research for CTI. "This is not about shying away from hard work. This is more about bias, whether you see it to be conscious or unconscious, that we don't see women in this industry to be intrinsically as capable."
More recently, Kieran Snyder, the CEO of analytics startup Textio, published the results of a survey of women who had left the tech industry. Of the 716 women she queried, 625 said they had no plans to return to the field. Women told her about the discrimination they faced, about being the first person to ever use their company's maternity leave policy, and about how tired they were of being asked to represent the female perspective just because they were the only women around.
Those stories, Snyder says, didn't just come from programmers or industrial engineers, but from women in business jobs at tech companies who had few role models to emulate. "There's this sense of alienation from being the only woman in the room," she says.
But what of Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg? Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer? Meg Whitman, Carly Fiorina, Anne Mulcahy, Marillyn Hewson — all who have served as CEOs of high-power tech companies?
“They are definitely a great face, and it’s very encouraging to see them there,” Beninger says. “But as a statistician, when you look at the full sample, they are definitely outliers.”
In the course of her research, Beninger asked for advice from some successful women in the field. “One said she tells young women to use a black coffee mug, because it doesn’t show lipstick marks. I was floored, but she was dead serious,” Beninger says. “Another highly-placed chief technology officer said she tells young women not to bring notebooks to meetings, because everyone will assume they’re secretaries. That kept happening to her, even as she got more senior."
In the Catalyst report, Beninger noted that male-dominated tech companies can change the dismal gender equation by having top leaders sponsor promising women, by making performance criteria transparent, and by promoting flexible work environments for both men and women. The report found that although 75 percent of the male and female MBA grads they studied had technical backgrounds, only 36 percent chose to return to tech-intensive fields. “The pipeline is leaking both men and women,” Benninger says. “Men want flexibility, too.”
Snyder, who has worked at Amazon and Microsoft in the past, advises women not to assume their requests for more flexibility will be deemed unreasonable. "I’m a single mom, and one thing I got really good at doing was drawing boundaries around my time," she says. She acknowledges, however, that she felt more comfortable doing so because of her seniority. When flexibility is "not a thing that most people you're working with care about," Synder says, "it's easy to not ask the question."
For some women, striking out on their own seems like the better option. Until she had her first child, Desiree Lehrbaum worked in Silicon Valley in what industry observers have dubbed the "pink ghetto" of high-tech firms — that is, their marketing and human resources departments. She left her marketing job to start a consulting firm, Lumen Consulting, doing largely the same work but gaining a measure of control over her schedule by choosing her own projects and setting her own hours.
Advancing in the tech culture, she says, still has a lot to do with subtle factors like being an insider, knowing someone or finding the right boss. “[Leaders] may like a woman and give her tons of work, but will she advance in the same way? It depends,” Lehrbaum says. “And if women find themselves not advancing, figure they’re going to be on the treadmill forever, a lot are going to opt out and find something else. It’s a shame. These companies are vastly underutilizing this amazing pool of talent because they’re caught in such an old paradigm.”
Lehrbaum recalls attending panel discussions with the handful of women who had made it to the top in high tech. Each one had a spouse who either stayed at home or who had a flexible or part-time schedule. “Not one was dual-career, dual-income,” she says. “You got the message that that was the sort of price someone in the family would have to pay to make it.”

The Rise of Xtremepreneurs: Today s World-Changersreddit
"Personal drive without ego, dedication beyond failures and conviction above circumstances. This describes the spirit of an Xtremepreneur." -- Val Jon Farris
What is an "Xtremepreneur?" Allow me to answer in an extreme way. I was recently invited to a cave dive in the Yucatan Peninsula with Guillermo de Anda , one of National Geographic's Global Explorers . We rappelled 100 feet underground to the surface of a "sacrificial cenote," or subterranean lake. ("Sacrificial" because human sacrifices actually took place there.) Equipped with underwater torches and a video camera we descended into the darkness of what the Maya call "Xibalba, the Underworld Goddess of Death."
After traversing ancient limestone catacombs we emerged into a grand underwater cavern, when suddenly my buoyancy compensator filled with water and I sank uncontrollably. By the time the dive team noticed, I had plummeted 120 feet to the cavern floor! I literally had to pry my mask from my face to equalize it, and as I did my nose and throat flooded with water.
Guillermo appeared in front of me with his hand raised cautioning me to not panic. On my knees in the darkness among scattered animal and human remains, and unable to breathe, I was about to find out who I was with respect to my opening quote of, "conviction above circumstances."
Before I tell you what happened next I want to discuss Xtremepreneurs and World-Changers for a moment. Xtremepreneurs are a hybrid between extreme sports enthusiasts and philanthropic entrepreneurs. And while the sports they engage in, (kiteboarding, base jumping, heli-skiing, cave diving, etc.) possess varying degrees of risk, those who participate in them share a common philosophy of using extreme challenges to access extraordinary capabilities.
How this extreme breed of entrepreneurs evolves into World-Changers is by shifting their attention off themselves and onto being a contribution to others. World-Changers exist at all levels of entrepreneurial success, from the likes of Richard Branson , Elon Musk and Guy Laliberte , all the way to professions like you and me who know we make a difference in the world and are striving to expand that difference. We do this by pressing ourselves beyond our limits, learning from our failures and moving forward with conviction, which brings us back to the challenge I faced on the underwater cavern floor...
On my knees, staring at Guillermo's raised hand, two waves of energy roared through me. First was sheer terror and second was some urgent advice from deep within my core, "Val Jon, you can't make the surface, you need to work with what you've got. If you don't, you will die right here, right now."
What happened next was a testament to the power of the Human Spirit and Greater Self which I believe dwells within all of us. Rather than panicking or trying to force a solution, I literally surrendered my Will over to the Greater Self Within Me to know what to do. And what was that? To simply wait until I could swallow the water blocking my airways and take tiny breaths until I could regain my composure. I did just that and by doing so it saved my life.
You might conclude it was remaining calm that saved me, but I say this to you. The moment "I" got out of the way, the Greater Self Within Me knew exactly what to do. It is this same Greater Self within us that always knows what to do, not only in life and death situations, but in business dealings and with respect to realizing our greatest dreams and aspirations.
Neither equipment failure nor personal threat was going to stop me from succeeding with our cenote dive. We surfaced, repaired my gear, added an additional proximity safety protocol and submerged again. Our willingness to reengage as a team, learn from our mistakes and persevere beyond fear yielded both an extraordinary experience and some extreme underwater footage. (To experience our actual dive, click here for the YouTube clips .)
I have a profound admiration for those who persevere and use life's challenges to better themselves and at the same time support others in doing the same. And obviously I have a special appreciation for the extreme crowd. To me, Xtremepreneurs like pro-kiteboarders Susi Mai and Bill Tai , founders of Mai Tai Global are an example of real World-Changers. And while I run the risk of appearing promotional, I want to mention a remarkable mentoring project Richard Branson and Kym McNicholas are spearheading in partnership with MaiTai Global called the Extreme Tech Challenge, XTC . I pay tribute to them here because it's my way of giving back to the spirit of mentorship that was so instrumental to my own entrepreneurial success many years ago.
These kinds of extreme mentoring projects develop something extraordinary within us, something greater than thrill seeking or even fame and fortune. There is a need today for bringing greater purpose and contribution into the world of commerce. And while it may sound Pollyanna to some, what I see happening is an "evolution of self" in which our egos are learning how to step aside so our Greater Selves can step forward into our lives and into our world. This spirited movement is The Rise of Xtremepreneurs, Today's World-Changers.
To learn more about a wide range of mentoring programs, log onto SuperSummit . You'll find a host of world-class talent gathering there. I also personally invite you to learn about our growing Global Xtreme Team at www.whowithinyou.com . And finally, true to my extreme spirit I encourage any and all Xtreme expedition invites!

California s Fracking Controversyreddit
Will a "Yes" or "No" vote on Measure P (the measure that bans all forms of enhanced drilling techniques, including steam injection and fracking) have an impact on Santa Barbara County's property values? This may be one of the biggest concerns for this California County's voters in November.
With nearly 7,000 new wells proposed locally, there is concern for the loss of property values - on top of environmental concerns related to fracking and other high intensity petroleum operations.
A Calgary and Duke University study of property values near shale gas wells notes a ten percent drop in values, but with fracking operations in place, values dropped some 22 percent. "Whether or not fracking causes groundwater pollution, people fear the risk enough that property values have dropped for homes with drinking-water wells near shale-gas pads, according to new research," writes Forbes in an article entitled Pollution Fears Crush Home Prices Near Fracking Wells.
"Real estate brokers say they see more signs of prospective home buyers worrying about the health and environmental effects of living close to a well," Reuters_News@reuters.com writes. "'For the most part, it renders those houses unsellable,' said Phyllis Wolper, a Denton, Texas, realtor who has several clients who live near oil and gas wells and have been unable to sell their homes."
These well sites impact individuals and developments. "When Gary Gless bought his sleek, modernist house in Los Angeles in 2002, he thought he had hit a "gold mine," reuters.com notes. "The world's largest inner-city park - featuring a lush, 18-hole golf course - was about to get built across the street. Gless's balcony was set to overlook the clubhouse and first tee....Today, instead of golf carts and fairways, Gless looks out on to drilling wells and oil pads. The park plan was ditched, and Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas LLC now operates 700 wells there - and 400 more are on the way. All the drilling, Gless says, has caused house foundations to crack and swimming pools to start to slide down hills."
And fracking operations are non-stop, thanks to the "Halliburton Loophole", a 2005 amendment to the Clean Air and Water Acts that VP Dick Cheney, former Halliburton CEO, pushed through Congress exempting fracking operations from almost all Environmental Protection Agency regulations.
"Coupled with existing exemptions to a variety of pollution laws like the Clean Air Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Superfund Act, and the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act, the 2005 carve-outs gave the fracking industry seven total exemptions from important environmental regulations," reported a recent truthout.org article.
California already has a thriving fracking industry. The majority of the state's new and active wells are concentrated in Kern and Los Angeles counties, said a National Resource Defense Council report entitled Drilling in California: Who's at Risk? However, expanded fracking in the large Monterey Formation is projected to bring the oil and gas industry into more communities, especially in Ventura, Monterey, Fresno, and Santa Barbara counties . According to http://ecowatch.com in Fracking the American Dream,
"In Pavilion, WY, where the EPA has linked groundwater contamination with fracking, Louis Meeks saw the value of his 40-acre alfalfa farm all but disappear completely. In 2006, his land and home were appraised at $239,000. Two years later, as ProPublica reported, "a local realtor sent Meeks a coldly worded letter saying his place was essentially worthless and she could not list his property."
"Last July, Nationwide Insurance spelled out specifically that it would not provide coverage for damage related to fracking. According to an internal memo outlining the company's policy, 'After months of research and discussion, we have determined that the exposures presented by hydraulic fracturing are too great to ignore. Risks involved with hydraulic fracturing are now prohibited for General Liability, Commercial Auto, Motor Truck Cargo, Auto Physical Damage and Public Auto (insurance) coverage," notes ecowatch.com.'
One little noticed side effect of this property value impact is that the secondary mortgage market hasn't caught up with the risk of loaning on properties affected by fracking and extreme oil production methods. As they do, these properties could be harder to finance. Housing Wire has reported on a webinar entitled, Oil and Gas Exploration for Mortgage Bankers, in which Daniel McKenna, with the Ballard Spahr's Mortgage Banking Group said, "The loans are actually low risk. But Fannie, Freddie, the FHA, and the VA prohibit gas leases on their loans. There are a ton of different regulations that impact selling these loans on the secondary market."
Even Exxon CEO and Board Chairman Rex Tillerson, is suing to stop construction of a water tower that would supply nearby drilling operations because of the nuisance of, among other things, heavy truck traffic, noise and traffic hazards from the fracking operations the tower would support.
So the CEO of the single largest drilling company in the world acknowledges the "constant and unbearable nuisance" that would come from having "lights on at all hours of the night...traffic at unreasonable hours... noise from mechanical and electrical equipment." And Tillerson's lawsuit - filed in 2013 with other plaintiffs, including former House Majority Leader Dick Armey - claims the project would do "irreparable harm" to his property values, in papers filed for the Denton County, Texas lawsuit.
Then, there's the real danger of earthquakes from injecting waste water back into the ground, which have been occurring with increasing frequency in some Oklahoma fracking fields, as reported on NPR Radio in a July 2014 broadcast by Linda Wertheimer.
Denver, Colorado had the same problems with so-called natural gas injection wells back in the 1960s, and played a critical role in discovering the link between forced injection wells and induced earthquakes.
There are currently more than 1.1 million active oil and gas wells in the United States, and more than 15 million Americans now live within a mile of the hundreds of thousands that have been drilled since 2000, according to the Wall Street Journal. Made possible by the advent of fracking, drilling is taking place in shale formations from California to New York and from Wyoming to Texas. And there's no indication that this "unprecedented industrialization" shows any signs of slowing. Almost 47,000 new oil and natural gas wells were drilled in 2012, and industry analysts project that pace will only continue.

The Case for a Sustainability Plan in Business: Short-Term Savings and Long-Term Opportunitiesreddit
We live in a world plagued by extreme weather events. Yet, as a general rule (and there are some outstanding exceptions), the world of business still hasn't woken up to the threat of climate change. All too often the sustainability team or programme is a side-lined function and very much seen as a 'nice to do.'
I can see why it happens. There is a perception (an incorrect one!) that going green costs more and therefore balance sheet pressures dictate going with the status quo of doing business.
Our view couldn't be more different. We believe that sustainability is both a moral and commercial imperative.
There is a business case for going green, and after seven years of following our own sustainability programme, we have a good case study to share.
In the short-term, it is about insulating your business from cost pressures; in the longer-term, a more sophisticated business case has emerged, predicated on opportunity, innovation and new revenue streams.
Seven years ago we set aside a massive £200 million for a five year initiative called Plan A, an eco and ethical programme that pledged to transform M&S by changing the way it did business. The environment and the right way to do business would be built into every decision made at the company and we set 100 bold targets to be achieved by 2012 including becoming carbon neutral, sending no waste to landfill and ensure that key raw materials come from the most sustainable sources available.
In only its second year, it became clear that Plan A was delivering significant cost benefits. To add to that it was opening up new revenue streams that were taking off. In year three it returned a net benefit to the business, or profit if you like, and has delivered one every year since. Last year the net benefit was £145 million and over the seven years in total, the benefit is £435 million.
That's £435 million that M&S would either have had to find from elsewhere or simply would not have had in the first place. The savings we're making include being more energy efficient, using less fuel, recycling and reusing clothes hangers, reducing waste, using less packaging etc etc.
But it's not just financial savings; we are seeing many other benefits such as increased staff motivation, brand enhancement and supply chain resiliency to name a few.
We're not the only company with a great business case story to tell. Companies like Walmart, O2, Unilever and Nike also understand the green imperative commercially and have embarked on their own eco-ethical journeys.
And, if you're reading this and thinking, that's all well and good for M&S, but what about small and medium sized companies? It's not the preserve of big businesses like us.
Our suppliers -- many of them small businesses -- are also getting involved in Plan A and making their businesses more efficient and more profitable. Take West Mill, a hosiery factory in Belper, Derbyshire, which was on the brink of closure a few years ago. Now it has turned its fortunes around by controlling its energy use, slashing £2 million from its annual bills. It was awarded eco-factory status by M&S meaning that every product produced at the factory can be labelled as having a Plan A attribute -- boosting the marketing power of the factory's products.
Going forward, as a consequence of interconnected opportunities and risks, business models will be disrupted by sustainability for the first time. We can't monetise the long-term business benefit but our use of the word 'disruption' highlights just how crucial we believe the business case for sustainability will become in the future. At M&S we're very clear the purpose of our business is to enhance lives everyday. And by doing this we will prosper.
That's why we've developed the next stage of our plan -- Plan A 2020, which aims to help accelerate our sustainability efforts. It's organised around four pillars -- Inspiration, In Touch, Integrity and Innovation, and supports our aspiration to become the world's most sustainable major retailer.
I call on every other business to not wait for the future to happen, but to proactively create it -- developing their own sustainable business plan, setting out, amongst other priorities, how they will promote wellbeing, sustain nature, take account of environmental and social impacts and be transparent.
Each plan needs to be adapted to their specific industry challenge and opportunities. It needs to inspire and mobilise everyone in the organisation. There are clearly huge challenges and headwinds ahead, but a sustainable business plan is the first step to realising opportunities and shifting to a new way of doing business, fit for the future.

Water Tower Place CNBC (tv network)
Craving a Crumbs cupcake? They're back.
Crumbs Bake Shop reopened its location in Water Tower Place on Thursday, ending a three-month absence of the colossal cupcakes in Chicago.
In July, Crumbs was delisted from the Nasdaq and soon after closed its remaining locations. Marcus Lemonis and Fischer Enterprises stepped in to buy the chain and said they would reinvent Crumbs as more of a sweets and snacks shop, rather than just focusing on cupcakes as the chain had since it opened in 2003.
0
Along with its well-known cupcakes, the chain is now selling items such as the Crumbnut, a cross between a doughnut and a croissant, and a Baissant, which it said is a combination of a bagel and a croissant.
The new owners previously said they planned to reopen about two dozen stores of the 50 or so that abruptly closed July 7.
The Water Tower Place location, at 835 N. Michigan Ave., reopened Thursday.
Lemonis, known for his CNBC show "The Profit," is expected to be at a grand reopening event at 6 p.m.
Along with the Chicago store, two stores have reopened in New York, along with one store each in California, Delaware and Washington, D.C., according to the chain's website.
The company said this week that it plans to open a store at 469 Central Ave. in Highland Park in the next 30 days. It also plans mass market products such as a new cookie line, ice cream products and a chocolate bar.

Labor Secretary:  We Suckreddit
Labor Secretary Tom Perez said Thursday the United States' current federal minimum wage is an international embarrassment, specifically calling out New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) for fighting attempts to raise the wage floor.
Speaking at a breakfast hosted by Bloomberg News , Perez noted the U.S.'s dismal standing among the 34 countries who belong to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development . The current federal minimum wage of $7.25, when compared to the median wage of full-time workers, ranks among the lowest of all member countries.
“I mean, we suck,” Perez said . “We really do.”
Last year, President Barack Obama threw his support behind a Democratic proposal to raise the federal wage floor to $10.10 an hour . In January, Obama announced he would raise the minimum wage for federal contractors to $10.10, pushing Congress to do the same on a national level.
“A majority of Americans – not just Democrats, not just independents, but Republicans too – support raising the minimum wage,” Obama said after signing the executive order. “It’s the right thing to do. So that’s something Congress should keep in mind this year.”
Republicans, however, have pushed back on the proposal. In April, Senate Republicans blocked a bill that would have gradually increased the wage, citing concerns over the impact on businesses and job growth. Democrats have used the GOP opposition as midterm campaign fodder, and hope that ballot measures in states like Arkansas and South Dakota will help boost turnout in November.
During the Bloomberg event, Perez called out Christie, who earlier this week said he is " tired of hearing about the minimum wage ."
“Chris Christie’s got his head in the sand if he’s getting tired about the minimum wage,” Perez said. “Chris Christie needs to talk to his economists, who will tell him that 70 percent of GDP growth is consumption.”
Perez, who is reportedly under consideration to replace outgoing Attorney General Eric Holder, spoke earlier this week on the country's " dismal " record on paid parental leave, saying that policies like paid leave and a higher minimum wage are the path to "shared prosperity."
"This is a family issue and an American issue," Perez said . "We need to lead on leave. We can't simply leave talent on the bench."

FORT COLLINS, Colo. (AP) — Some people are urging the Colorado burrito chain Illegal Pete's to change its name because of the way the word "illegal" has been used to describe immigrants.
The Coloradan (http://noconow.co/1wpoTne ) reports that about 30 people gathered in Fort Collins Wednesday to ask owner Pete Turner to change the name of the chain, which is about to open an outlet there.
It's part of a bigger campaign nationally against what critics refer to as the "I-word." They think using the word to describe a person is dehumanizing.
Turner said the name is a reference to novel he read in college and the "Pete" part refers to his name and his father's. He told the crowd that he is committed to an "inclusive" business and has helped pay for some employees to become citizens.
"This is all very near and dear to me," he said.
But those at the meeting likened the name to a racial slur used against African-Americans or hanging a Confederate flag in the restaurant's window.
"Social context is hugely important," Fort Collins immigration attorney and meeting moderator Kim Medina said. "We'll never get to big issues, such as immigration reform, until we can solve these smaller issues of language."

This picture tells you everything you need to know about global inequalityBy Matt O'Brien October 23 Follow @ObsoleteDogma
This handout picture released on Oct. 22, 2014, by local humanitarian group Prodein shows golfers playing while African migrants try to climb the fence into the Spanish North African enclave of Melilla (Jose Palazon Osma/AFP Photo/Prodein)
It's hard to believe looking at this amazing picture of African migrants trying to enter the Spanish enclave of Melilla, but global inequality has actually been falling the past 20 years.
It's a story about Brazil and India and, most of all, China joining the global supply chain and enjoying the wealth that comes with it. Indeed, it's this "emerging global middle class," as economist Branko Milanovic calls them, who have done better than anyone, relatively-speaking. Their incomes increased almost 80 percent, adjusted for inflation, between 1988 and 2008. As point of comparison, lower and middle class workers in already-rich countries, like the United States, have fared the worst over this period, with basically flat real wages.
This is great news for the billions of people who live in these countries, but what about the ones who live in places that are still disconnected from any real opportunities?
Well, their best bet is immigration, legal or otherwise. Not to belabor the obvious here, but where you live determines how much you can make. The same person with the same education and the same skills can make seven times more working in the United States than in Haiti, according to economists Michael Clemens, Claudio Montenegro, and Lant Pritchett . Or, to give another example, you can make more than 10 times as much for doing the same job in an American McDonald's as you can in an Indian one . That's why looser immigration laws are actually one of the best things we could do to fight global poverty.
But more than any facts or figures, all you really need to know is in this picture. You can see the chasm that, despite its shrinking size, still exists between the global haves and have-nots, as these migrant workers try to scale the fence into Spain's North African territory — and on to a very well-watered fairway, especially for that climate. The stakes are everything for them: potential European Union asylum and a chance to earn a better living.
But don't let that interrupt your game of golf.

Arabian Sea storm starts reorganising  eyes Gujarat for landfallArabian Sea storm may develop into a cyclone, target Gujarat
Vinson Kurian
Tweet
Thiruvananthapuram, Oct 24:  
After the Arabian Sea storm started rebuilding ending a brief pause, weather models have started re-plotting charts for the likely track for a developing tropical cyclone.
At least five leading models, including early projections by India Met Department, indicate that the cyclone might veer towards northwest Gujarat and adjoining Sindh coast in Pakistan for a landfall.
The Canadian Meteorological Centre subscribes to this view saying that the system would take a turn to the east over northeast Arabian Sea, but without suggesting an exact area of landfall.
The 21-member ensemble from the Global Forecast Model is more forthcoming, suggesting northwest Gujarat to be the area of landfall.
The UK Met model is the most forthright among all, with projected growth of the system as a very severe cyclone (wind speeds ranging between 177- 209 km/hr) and heading for northwest Gujarat.
The shift in cyclone track will take place under the influence of a western disturbance moving across the Arabian Gulf and towards Afghanistan, Pakistan and northwest India.
Westerly notified
India Met has said in its evening bulletin on Friday that a western disturbance would start affecting the western Himalayan region from October 28. Being computer-simulated models, these projections can change over time. This makes it imperative that the evolving weather system is tracked on a real-time basis, say experts.
Available indications indicate that it can grow to considerable strength. The month of October is known for vulnerability of the peninsular seas to these types of ‘disturbances’ from change in meteorological conditions associated with the monsoon transition.
Heavy rains
Meanwhile on Friday, heavy rains continued to lash parts of Kerala and Tamil Nadu, which are the two States with excess rainfall thus far during this northeast monsoon season.
Tamil Nadu falls in the rainfall excess category (+32 per cent) while Kerala followed (+18 per cent, ‘normal’ category).
Coastal and south interior Karnataka will start receiving meaningful showers as easterly flows from the Bay of Bengal head across the peninsula to feed the building cyclone in the Arabian Sea.

Christian Siriano to appear at Gold Coast pop-up0
In addition to his fragrance, items from his ready-to-wear collection will be for sale.
The pop-up is the first Chicago location to sell Siriano's fragrance, called Silhouette and inspired by the airiness of a blue tulle dress from his spring 2013 line. Price ranges from $35 for perfumed shower gel to $92 for a 100 ml eau de parfum bottle. It also will be sold exclusively by Chicago-based luxury consignment shop eDrop-Off through Oct. 31, after which time it will be available at Neiman Marcus.
The event is organized in partnership with eDrop-Off, which this week announced news of its own.
After 10 years in business, the online auction site is opening a bricks-and-mortar retail shop. The Collection by eDrop-Off debuted Wednesday at 1201 N. Clark St., featuring curated collections of pre-owned luxury items that customers can buy at a fixed price rather than waiting to win an online auction. Items owned by Mad Men costume designer Janie Bryant are featured. It also sells several new pieces by Siriano.
The shop, which will also continue to serve as one of the eBay seller's pickup and drop-off locations, will refresh its inventory every two to three weeks, said eDrop-Off owner Corri McFadden. eDrop-Off also recently launched The Collection online, where customers can buy select items at a fixed price (think $3,500 for a Chanel handbag, $250 for a Badgley Mischka gown), rather than buying on auction.

Morning Plum: Democrats strike careful balance on EbolaA new case of Ebola has emerged in New York City. Jonathan Cohn brings us up to speed, noting that the government response underway is dramatically different than what happened in Texas . This is the key takeaway:
What was true yesterday is true today. Experts expect isolated cases of Ebola to show up here and there, but they don’t expect outbreaks, because the U.S. has the resources and infrastructure to contain the spread and treat those who get it.
Democratic strategists had actually been privately relieved that Ebola appeared to be receding from the news. They think the GOP strategy of laying Ebola on top of ISIS and the border, to stoke generalized fear and anxiety, has been successfully nationalizing Senate races in favor of GOP candidates, helping explain recent gains in polls.
If anything, polls have actually shown public confidence in the government’s ability to handle Ebola, though to read the media coverage, you’d think the only thing polls are indicating is generalized fear of the disease. In truth, it’s hard to quantify Ebola’s political impact. It could be just adding unseen weight to a broader sense that the country is veering off track — which probably helps Republicans (who are doing all they can to feed that impression). But it’s also possible that — even with the new case — it could be receding as an issue at just the right time.
Nonetheless, Democrats have hastily embraced a travel ban, despite the counsel of experts. And they are criticizing the Obama administration for being too slow to deal with initial cases. Alex Roarty caught up with Senator Kay Hagan, whose opponent Thom Tillis has been pushing a travel ban, and she said this :
“It seems to take a period of time before it’s recognized that it’s a very important issue that needs more time and attention,” Hagan says during a brief interview when I ask how she feels about the president’s apparent slow-footed response to the VA scandal and Ebola. It’s more a carefully worded slap-on-the wrist than searing indictment, but this close to Election Day, with a liberal base to motivate, it counts as real criticism.
Note the balance Hagan (who also came out for a travel ban) is striking. As I’ve reported before , Democrats are using Ebola to achieve distance from the President, who continues to be deeply disliked by constituencies who still are populated by voters who remain undecided, and could be tipped towards Republicans by a feather-push from something like Ebola remaining in the news. At the same time, this sort of criticism is unlikely to alienate the core Democratic voters whose turnout will be crucial, and who might feel less motivated if candidates break with Obama on core Democratic issues. Either way, the politics of Ebola may now be back.
Of course, not all Democrats are embracing a travel ban. But that brings us to our next item.
* IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, A CLASH OVER EBOLA: Senator Jeanne Shaheen and Scott Brown held their final debate last night, and the clash over Ebola was remarkable . Shaheen said we shouldn’t institute a travel ban if experts say it’s a bad idea: “My opponent and I aren’t infectious disease experts. I think we need to listen to the experts. We should not be fear-mongering on this issue.”
But Scott Brown reiterated his call for a ban: “We don’t need to be experts to deal with this issue. It’s common sense. She calls it fear mongering. I call it rational fear.” We don’t need no stinkin’ experts…
* SCOTT BROWN CALLED OUT ON EBOLA: Democrats are circulating video of another interesting moment : Moderator Wolf Blitzer repeatedly pressed Brown on his claim that we wouldn’t be worrying about Ebola right now if Mitt Romney were president. Brown kept complaining he was being taken out of context. When Blitzer read his actual words back to him, Brown replied: “Thank you for repeating it for the fourth time.”
* MICHELLE NUNN HAS A SHOT IN GEORGIA: A new CNN poll finds Michelle Nunn leading David Perdue in Georgia by 47-44, within the margin of error. And:
In a hypothetical runoff, Nunn still holds a small margin over Perdue, 51% to 47%. But the poll’s likely voter model can only estimate the November electorate, as a runoff election can draw a smaller and different crowd than the general election.
The average still has Perdue up 1.7 points, but that margin is shrinking fast, and Nunn has led in the last five polls. The runoff is a big unknown, because it’s hard to anticipate what the electorate will look like. But it appears Nunn may have a real shot.
 * CORY GARDNER LEADS IN COLORADO: A new Quinnipiac poll finds Cory Gardner leading Senator Mark Udall among likely voters in Colorado, 46-41. Ominously for Udall, who is betting it all on his ground game, Gardner is leading among early voters, 49-37.
The polling average has Gardner up by 2.1 points. Udall has trailed in at least nine of the last nonpartisan public polls.
* ARE POLLS GETTING COLORADO ELECTORATE RIGHT? Mark Murray reports on a new Democratic-leaning poll that surveys Colorado voters who cast ballots in 2012, but did not vote in 2010:
This poll, conducted by the Democratic-leaning group Project New America, finds that 82 percent of these so-called “drop-off” voters have received a ballot in the mail. And a combined 83 percent say they’ve already voted (22 percent of them) or are planning to vote (another 61 percent).
If Democrats are going to overcome their deficit in the polls, they will have to bring in non-2010 voters who are not showing up in polls’ “likely voter” samples. Dems hope the new all-mail balloting will help them do that. But Udall is plainly trailing by a non-insignificant margin at this point.
* SENATE STILL UP FOR GRABS: Politico details the ways that Obama remains a drag on many Senate Democrats , but adds this key context:
Even as the map looks ripe for a GOP Senate takeover, at least 11 battleground states remain within or right at the margin of error, according to an average of public polling. That means if Democrats succeed in driving up turnout as they’ve vowed to do all year — particularly in states like Colorado, Iowa and North Carolina — they could tilt the electorate by one or two points in their direction and win enough races to hold the Senate.
Republicans are favored to take the Senate, but much uncertainty remains . If the polls are a bit off in a few races, the map gets easier for Dems. Of course, the polls could be off in a way that favors Republicans, leading to far more GOP gains than we expect.
* REPUBLICANS ATTACK DEMOCRATS FROM LEFT: Lori Montgomery has a good rundown of one of this cycle’s key subplots: Republicans are widely attacking Democrats from the left on entitlements, casting themselves as the real defenders of social insurance from the elderly .
As I’ve noted before , this shows that the politics of the safety net are perilous for Republicans even in red states, and gets at the GOP’s long term problem of over-dependence on older voters.
* ‘PLUTOCRATS AGAINST DEMOCRACY’: Paul Krugman’s column indicts the American right’s preoccupation with “voter fraud,” rooting it in a desire to prevent the “unwashed” from voting and protect the rich from redistributive policy :
Now you understand why there’s so much furor on the right over the alleged but actually almost nonexistent problem of voter fraud, and so much support for voter ID laws that make it hard for the poor and even the working class to cast ballots. American politicians don’t dare say outright that only the wealthy should have political rights — at least not yet. But if you follow the currents of thought now prevalent on the political right to their logical conclusion, that’s where you end up. The truth is that a lot of what’s going on in American politics is, at root, a fight between democracy and plutocracy. And it’s by no means clear which side will win.
What else?

Abbas incites  State Department acts as character witnessThe  Times of Israel reports :
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, right, chairs the first meeting of the new Palestinian unity government with Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah in Ramallah in June. (Majdi Mohammed/Agence France-Presse via Getty Images)
The day after an East Jerusalem man with ties to Hamas drove his car onto a light rail platform, killing a three-month-old baby and wounding eight, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu lashed out at the international community for failing to criticize Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas.
The Palestinian leader “both glorifies the murderers and also embraces the organization to which the terrorists belong, Hamas,” Netanyahu said during a briefing with security officials in Jerusalem’s national police headquarters. “And faced with these actions of the Authority chairman, we find only a flaccid [response] internationally. [World leaders] are unwilling to say two words, even one word of criticism of him [Abbas]. We do not share this weakness. We will stand firmly for our rights and obligations to defend our capital.”
Well, certainly he is exaggerating, right? Afraid not. Here is the mind-boggling exchange at the State Department daily briefing Thursday :
QUESTION: I’m not making any relation, but there’s been some concern over the last week or two about comments by President Abbas that believe to have incurred incitement. And are you concerned about that? You haven’t really spoken out about that. Do you in any way feel that this is inciting Palestinians to take actions into their own hands?
MS. [JEN] PSAKI: Well, I think, Elise, one, I mean, we obviously believe that the act last night warrants condemnation evidence by the statement we released last night. I’m not going to characterize the comments made or not made by President — Prime Minister Netanyahu or the response from President Abbas.
QUESTION: Well, if you haven’t really received a condemnation from President Abbas, then don’t you think you should offer one?
MS. PSAKI: I think our view of it is clear by — evidenced by our statement last night. I would point you to him on any comments that they would like to make.
QUESTION: But what about his comments, like, over the past — I mean, there has just been several comments that people have remarked about that seem to be incurring incitement. Is that not concerning?
MS. PSAKI: I don’t think that’s — as you know, President Abbas has renounced violence and consistently sought a diplomatic and peaceful solution that allows for two states. I don’t have any other analysis for you to offer.
Why is this administration — which greets any building permit in Jerusalem as a personal insult — so averse to condemning incitement to terrorism? One can chalk it up to the “bigotry of low expectations,” in this context, the assumption that the Palestinian Authority can’t behave in accordance with its obligations. It might, alternatively, reflect the president’s view that Israel is responsible for the failure of the “peace process”; incitement to terrorism therefore messes up the narrative.
Whatever the reason, it is logical to assume that Abbas continues to do this in part because there are never any consequences for objectionable behavior. Recall that Abbas spoke at the United Nations recently, wherein he accused Israel of genocide. Former deputy national security adviser Elliott Abrams summarized : “Abbas said not one word of criticism of Hamas, nor did he acknowledge what is obvious: that Hamas started this war by its ceaseless bombardment of Israel with mortars and rockets. Presumably he decided that Palestinian domestic politics required him to avoid that truth and blame Israel for the conflict. . . . The accusation of genocide is particularly vile when thrown at Israel. The word has a meaning, and it is obviously absurd to claim that Israel’s actions in the Gaza war last summer were aimed at killing every Palestinian or a very large number of them or at eliminating the Palestinian people.”
Now, it is one thing to acknowledge that the PA is preferable to Hamas in Gaza. But there is no justification for praising Abbas because he purportedly “renounced violence and consistently sought a diplomatic and peaceful solution that allows for two states.” That is false, as is the assertion that he is a partner for peace. Abbas has walked away from the table and threatens again to go to the UN for a declaration of statehood and continues to praise and reward terrorism. Accusing the Jewish state of genocide does not suggest he is dedicated to the “peace process.”
When John Kerry declares that “my hope is that it will be possible to get back to a negotiating table because that is the only way to resolve the issues” between Israel and the Palestinians, he embarrasses himself and reflects the double standard that the Obama administration maintains whenever Israel is involved. The way to resolve the conflict is for the Palestinians to recognize the Jewish state, give up the dream of eradicating it and stop inciting those who murder Jews.

Outside groups and political parties are driving judicial campaigningScreenshot from an ad in the Tennessee Supreme Court campaign this year.
Even judicial races aren’t immune from the influence of outside spending.
Nearly 63 percent of the TV ads bought in state supreme court campaigns this year were paid for by political parties and outside groups, worrying advocates for integrity in the judicial branch who fear all that spending could lead to distorted rulings. The TV ad data comes from an analysis of Kantar Media/CMAG data by Justice at Stake and the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law, both of which work to uphold the integrity of the judicial system. All told, more than $9.1 million has been spent nationwide on TV ads, according to a new analysis by the groups.
“This high level of spending is consistent with the spending we saw in 2010 midterm judicial races,” Alicia Bannon, counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice, said in a statement. “Special interest groups continue to dump money into state Supreme Court races in an attempt to stack the deck in their favor. Voters should feel like our courts are fair and impartial, not political playgrounds where business interests and lawyers can tilt the scales of justice with their pocketbooks.”
Political parties, outside groups, and judicial candidates themselves have spent more than $6.1 million on TV ads for the general election. Toss in primaries and off-cycle elections and that total surpasses $9.1 million, according to government filings and Kantar data. Michigan has seen $2.9 million spent to date, the highest level of ad spending on judicial races of any state this year. Illinois, Montana, Missouri and North Carolina have also seen significant judicial campaign spending this year.
Recent studies have shown that the influx of spending on such races has been associated with a shift in judicial decision-making. Just this week, a review of thousands of state supreme court criminal appeals found that an increase in TV ads was associated with less-favorable rulings for criminal defendants. Advocates for the integrity of the judicial branch fear that an increase in attack ads accusing justices of being soft on crime may be nudging them to increasingly rule against criminal defendants.

Of course, with two weeks remaining until the election, TV ad spending is far from over.

Beyonce  Jay Z renew wedding vows after six years ofmarriageBy: Press Trust of India | London | Posted: October 24, 2014 8:29 pm
Hollywood star couple Beyonce Knowles and Jay Z have reportedly renewed their wedding vows, six years after their marriage.
The ceremony, which took place during their tour of Europe where they were playing their On The Run tour, was said to be tiny and low key, reported the Daily Mirror
“Things have been difficult for them but they have worked hrough it. Now things are better than ever for them,” a source said about the Beyonce, 33, and Jay Z, who have a
two-year-old daughter, Blue Ivy.
“Their friends and families are now delighted that there has been a very happy ending to this whole sorry scenario. Both Beyonce and Jay-Z have put a lot of work into their
marriage and it has paid off. They are both over the moon,” the source added.
The pair’s marriage found itself in trouble when a video of Beyonce’s sister Solange attacking rap king Jay Z, 44, in a New York lift back in May went viral.
Footage of them arguing was leaked, but things became so nasty, Solange also tried to kick and hit her brother-in-law.
Fans were shocked and R’n’B’s golden couple found their marriage under staunch pressure. Rumours became rife that they would split following the end of their tour last month, however in public the pair always maintained their relationship was strong.

Panasonic launches 4K Varicam and Varicam HS production cameras inIndiaPanasonic has developed a next generation of P2 solid-state recording for these Varicam series products.
By: Tech Desk | New Delhi | Posted: October 24, 2014 8:28 pm | Updated: October 24, 2014 8:34 pm
Panasonic India has launched two new variants under its Varicam series of film production cameras – the Varicam HS and Varicam 35. The company has developed a next generation of P2 solid-state recording for these Varicam series products.
Specifically designed to capture 4K or high speed HD images, the expressP2 card offers transfer speeds (up to 2.4Gbps). The expressP2 card (AU-XP0256A) provides 72 minutes recording time in 4K/25p mode with high data reliability by containing a flash memory error correction system, equivalent to a RAID system, to recover from a failure.
Inherited from original Varicam series, the Varicam 35 features a V-Log gamma covering wide latitude 14+ stops. The camera also has the ability to simultaneously record in two different formats and codecs together with its in-camera colour grading function. The Varicam 35 incorporates a newly-developed super35mm MOS image sensor and images can be handled in variable frame rates up to 120 frames per second (fps). It can deliver a variety of recording formats, including 4K and UHD in AVC-ULTRA 4K, and 2K and 1080p HD in AVC-Intra 100.
Varicam HS provides smooth slow motion effects, by recording in 240fps HD, without a cache memory. With high speed 1080p image capture at up to 240fps, the Varicam HS camera is aimed at the production of extraordinary high-definition imagery, for the most demanding documentaries, sports or SFX slow-motion applications.

Jackie Chan wants to be better father after sonsarrestJackie Chan has pledged to become a better father after his son Jaycee was arrested on drug charges.
By: Associated Press | Beijing | Posted: October 24, 2014 8:26 pm
Jackie Chan has pledged to become a better father after his son Jaycee was arrested on drug charges.
The film star said in his first comments in person after the arrest: “I am always a father. I used to be an unqualified father. Now, after this event, I want to be a qualified father.”
Jaycee Chan was detained in August and was formally arrested the following month on suspicion of allowing other people to consume drugs, a charge that carries a maximum sentence of three years’ imprisonment.
Chan apologised in a statement soon after his son’s arrest and pledged to work with him on his recovery.
He spoke to reporters Thursday while promoting his latest movie, “Skiptrace,” in which he plays a Hong Kong detective.

The top 13 Senate races of 2014By Chris Cillizza , Aaron Blake and Sean Sullivan October 24 Follow @thefix Follow @aaronblakewp Follow @WaPoSean
For an election very few people are paying attention to, it's turning into a pretty exciting one. There are at least 11 Senate races where the outcome is far from certain with just 11 days left before voters go to the polls on Nov. 4.
That's an unusually high amount of uncertainty this late in an election. Typically, the playing field winnows with every passing week as party committees (and candidates) are forced to make fish-or-cut-bait decisions on races that just don't look winnable. There were 10 races rated as toss-ups by the  Cook Political Report in their final ratings before the 2012 election, but only seven such races in 2010 and six in 2008.
So far, the only race that has fallen by the wayside this cycle is the Michigan open seat contest, where national Republicans pulled their advertising earlier this month  in the face of poll numbers that suggested Rep. Gary Peters (D) was very likely to beat former secretary of state Terri Lynn Land (R).
But aside from Michigan, there haven't been any races that have totally collapsed for either side and, in fact, South Dakota, Kansas and Georgia -- all Republican-held seats -- have come on the map, in varying degrees, over the past six weeks (or so). There are currently eight races that the  Real Clear Politics polling average shows are within five points, a remarkable level of competitiveness this late in an election.
While that is welcome news for political junkies -- the more the merrier! -- it does put the national party committees in a tough spot. Money is finite, and that means making decisions about how it should be spent is of critical importance in the waning days of any race. Because there are so many competitive Senate contests, the where, how and when of cash distribution in the final days matters even more. And the closeness of so many races means that second-guessing of whichever side comes up short is inevitable.
Below are our rankings of the 13 most competitive Senate races in the country. The No. 1-ranked race is the most likely to flip parties.
13. Kentucky (Republican-controlled): Two things are true about this race. 1) Mitch McConnell has not been able to pull away from Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes despite massive spending. 2) This is Kentucky in a midterm election that looks bad for Democrats nationally. McConnell is a slight favorite  but both sides are engaged in this race and spending (after the DSCC momentarily stopped running ads), which suggests the outcome isn't quite decided. (Previous ranking: 13)
12. New Hampshire (Democratic-controlled): Former senator Scott Brown (R-Mass.) and Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D) debated twice this week, but there were no big momentum-shifting moments. Polls show Shaheen is popular and has a very small lead, inside the margin of error. This race is making Democrats more nervous than it was a couple of months ago, but Shaheen has at least avoided stumbles. (Previous ranking: 12)
11. North Carolina (D): Sen. Kay Hagan (D) got a boost this week from the environmental community when the League of Conservation Voters announced a $4.2 million effort on her behalf. If Hagan pulls this one out, it will be thanks to the barrage of attack ads the senator and her allies have launched. Tillis has faced a whopping $26 million in negative ads -- more than any Senate candidate and about twice as much incoming as Hagan has faced (though that excludes plenty of "issue ads" that were run against Hagan over the summer). (Previous ranking: 10)
10. Georgia (R): Democrat Michelle Nunn clearly has the momentum -- a new CNN poll Friday morning has her up three points  -- in the wake of Republican David Perdue's outsourcing problems , but it's probably likely now that we're headed for a Jan. 6 runoff. The prospect of that runoff has prevented us from moving up on our list, because runoffs are very unkind to Democrats . But it's also looking increasingly possible that Nunn could win outright on Election Day, with a majority of the overall vote. (Previous ranking: 11)
9. Iowa (D): Republican state Sen. Joni Ernst's decision to snub the Des Moines Register editorial board got lots of attention -- both in Iowa and nationally. You simply can't cancel on the state's biggest paper without getting heat.  Recent polling shows Ernst and Rep. Bruce Braley (D) at or within the margin of error of one another. Every little thing counts at this point. (Previous ranking: 8)
8.  Kansas (R): Both sides think this one remains very close. Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) was looking like he might have some momentum there for a while, but a couple automated polls have shown independent Greg Orman up by a small margin in recent days . It doesn't look like anybody will pull away here. (Previous ranking: 7)
7. Colorado (D): All of the movement here is in Rep. Cory Gardner's (R) direction. Gardner has led Sen. Mark Udall (D) in the last eight polls and, according to the Real Clear Politics polling average , Gardner is up by four points. If Udall does lose -- Democrats insist their ground operation and that's new vote-by-mail system are their aces in the hole --  expect his relentless focus on reproductive rights  to be blamed. (Previous ranking: 9)
6. Alaska (D): Republican Dan Sullivan has led Sen. Mark Begich (D) by two to six points in every public poll out this fall . Democrats are keeping the faith because of their well-oiled ground game and early vote operation. If the election ends up being really close, we may not know the outcome until well after Nov. 4 because of the  lengthy period of time to tally absentee ballots. (Previous ranking: 6)
5. Louisiana (D): We're moving this down a spot, from No. 4, just because Arkansas (now No. 4) is looking pretty tough for Democrats, and at least in Louisiana, they have some time to try and right the ship, given this is headed for a runoff. This runoff would be held Dec. 6 -- a month before Georgia's. Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.) would still be an underdog, but unlike in Georgia, she has actually won runoffs -- both that she's faced, in fact. (Previous ranking: 4)
4. Arkansas (D): Rep. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) has led by between three and eight points in the last five polls here , and Sen. Mark Pryor's (D-Ark.) days are looking increasingly numbered. Cotton overcame some early rumblings that he wasn't the great candidate that he was billed as to run a solid campaign. Republicans are counting on this one, at this point. (Previous ranking: 5)
3. South Dakota (D): Former governor Mike Rounds continues to suffer from some pretty tough headlines, the latest being this . And he's hardly looked like a world-beating candidate this year. But while there was some indication he was in trouble in a three-way race with independent former GOP senator Larry Pressler and Democrat Rick Weiland, Republicans released an internal poll this week showing Rounds up 24 points . Even if that's a little rosy, it suggests Rounds has benefited from the cavalry coming to South Dakota. But we'll await more data before moving this back into the "done deal" category. (Previous ranking: 3)
2. West Virginia (D): National Journal's Alex Roarty made a great point in a piece earlier this month: Rep. Shelley Moore Capito (R) is, quietly, running one of the best campaigns in the country . Capito has made zero mistakes, which has left no opening for Secretary of State Natalie Tennant (D). This is pretty much over. (Previous ranking: 2)
1. Montana (D): Sen.-elect Steve Daines (R). (Previous ranking: 1)

How many questions did Harper respond to? Unless I missed something here … he responded to zero of them, right? Like, not a single one. I don’t know why. Maybe his plane took off. Maybe his phone died. Whatever. Who cares.
This is the best way to handle Twitter Question Time, in my opinion. Never change, Bryce Harper.
If we’re being real, though, Harper probably doesn’t have time to answer questions anyway. Dude has sharkskin tuxedos to design .

New quarantine rules considered for aid workers returning to U.S. from Ebola-stricken regionBy Mark Berman and Juliet Eilperin October 24 Follow @markberman Follow @eilperin

The federal government is considering altering the protocols for doctors and health-care workers who return to the United States from West Africa, authorities said Friday.
“It’s one of the questions the federal government is thinking through,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) told Fox 5 in New York .
A federal official said that the idea of quarantining medical workers who participated in the Ebola response in West Africa was being considered, but said no decision had been made.
While the idea of a quarantine is being considered, Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, emphasized that officials are still determining whether it is medically justified.
“These kinds of policy decisions are going to be driven by science,” he said.

The possible change would come in the wake of Thursday’s diagnosis of Craig Spencer , a doctor who had treated Ebola patients in Guinea, one of the countries at the heart of the Ebola epidemic.
Spencer, 33, returned to the United States last week and began feeling ill on Tuesday. He was taken to Bellevue Hospital on Thursday after reporting a fever of 100.3 degrees that morning and gastrointestinal problems.
But as federal officials consider a possible change, authorities in the New York area announced that they would take more immediate action. Medical personnel returning to New York and New Jersey from the Ebola-riddled countries in West Africa will be automatically quarantined if they had direct contact with an infected person, officials announced Friday.
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) announced the decision at a joint news conference Friday at 7 World Trade Center.
“The steps New York and New Jersey are taking today will strengthen our safeguards to protect our residents against this disease and help ensure those that may be infected by Ebola are treated with the highest precautions,” Cuomo said in a statement.
They said that public-health officials at John F. Kennedy and Newark Liberty international airports, where enhanced screening for Ebola is taking place, would make the determination on who would be quarantined. Anyone who had direct contact with an Ebola patient in Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea will be quarantined.

In addition, anyone who traveled there but had no such contact would be actively monitored and possibly quarantined, authorities said.
Laurie Garrett, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, said in an interview that while it made sense for returning medical workers to take voluntary steps to isolate themselves upon their return to the United States, concern over Ebola’s transmission in the West had begun to interfere with volunteers’ ability to contain the outbreak at the source.
“For everybody that’s professionally trying to go to the three epidemic countries, the situation has become more difficult with each passing day and each Ebola case — or alleged Ebola case — named in the United States,” Garrett said. “We’re in a crisis actually that imperils the entire effort to stop the epidemic that is completely about the fear of countries that have no known epidemic.”
Not only have many airlines curtailed flights to the three countries most affected by Ebola, Garrett noted, but nearly every major insurance carrier has now canceled medevac coverage for individuals choosing to travel there.
“This whole right of return issue, and circumstances of return, is fluid,” she said. “We’ve hit the point where it is quite obviously affecting the recruitment of volunteer health workers.”
Experts say that the region needs roughly 19,000 health and logistics personnel to contain the epidemic; outside of military personnel, total foreign volunteers now number in the hundreds.
Still, Garrett added, any people traveling to a nation affected by Ebola should undertake efforts to isolate and monitor themselves for any symptoms of the disease for 21 days after returning to their home country.
“At this point it’s incumbent on anyone going over there to build into your plans the assumption that you will have to radically modify how you live and work upon your return for three weeks,” she said.
Spencer had gone to Guinea to work with Doctors Without Borders, the international relief group that has been on the front lines of the public health crisis.
On Friday, the group said Spencer had followed its protocols for people returning from Ebola work, which included regular health monitoring.

“Extremely strict procedures are in place for staff dispatched to Ebola affected countries before, during, and after their assignments,” Sophie Delaunay, the group’s executive director, said in a statement. “Despite the strict protocols, risk cannot be completely eliminated. However, close post-assignment monitoring allows for early detection of cases and for swift isolation and medical management.”
The precise nature of Spencer’s infection is being investigated, the group said. So far, two dozen people working for the organization have fallen ill while fighting Ebola, and 13 of them have died.
Tim Shenk, a spokesman for Doctors Without Borders, said Friday afternoon that quarantining all medical workers who return from West Africa “would be an excessive measure to take at this stage.”
“As long as a patient hasn’t developed symptoms, the risk of contamination is close to zero,” he said.
Spencer became just the fourth person diagnosed with Ebola in the United States and the first outside Texas, which has previously been the nexus of Ebola infections in the country. Thomas Duncan, a Liberian man who flew to Dallas, was diagnosed last month and died eight days later. Two nurses who treated Duncan were infected while caring for him. No one who had close contact with Duncan or the nurses has tested positive for Ebola so far.
The two nurses who contracted Ebola in Dallas were both declared virus-free this week. One was cleared on Wednesday , while Nina Pham, the other nurse,  left the National Institutes of Health on Friday morning after doctors determined she no longer had the virus.
President Obama on Friday wanted to meet with Pham “to thank her for her service,” Josh Earnest said at his daily White House briefing.
When White House officials found out early Friday that Pham would be released, Earnest said, they contacted the NIH “to let her know that the president was interested in meeting her if she felt up to it.”

Pham did not undergo any additional medical testing before greeting—and hugging—the president, Earnest said, noting that she had been shown to be free of the virus on five separate occasions before being released.
Earnest also provided new details Friday about the coordination between federal and New York state officials after Spencer fell ill Thursday. President Obama ordered the Pentagon to provide an aircraft to transport a team of experts from the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta to New York City’s Bellevue Hospital so they could get there “as soon as possible,” he said.
The team, which helped supervise the protocols for treating Spencer, arrived “within a couple of hours” of his arrival, Earnest added.
“We certainly are pleased that so much of the planning that’s been done in recent days has proved to be useful,” Earnest said of how Bellevue’s handled Spencer’s admission.
While federal officials are discussing the idea of quarantining medical professionals upon their return to the United States, Earnest emphasized that officials are still determining whether it is medically justified.
“These kinds of policy decisions are going to be driven by science,” he said.
The administration is focused on protecting the American public, Earnest said. “But at the same time we don’t have to overly burden those individuals who are going to great lengths to stop this outbreak at the source,” he added.
Earnest also emphasized that these aid workers are aware of the public health concerns stemming from their service.
“Individuals who have spent time in West Africa certainly understand the seriousness of this disease,” he said, adding at one point of the precautions Spencer took upon his return to New York, “He is a highly trained medical professional [and] certainly had the capacity to take his own temperature.”
White House officials continued to emphasize the low probability of an Ebola outbreak in the U.S. Earnest said Obama would “have no qualms” about riding the New York subway, visiting the High Line or visiting a Brooklyn bowling alley even in the aftermath of Spencer’s diagnosis.
“The fact is, the risk facing the average New Yorker is exceedingly low,” he said.

Spencer works at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center. On Thursday, the hospital called him “a dedicated humanitarian” who “always puts his patients first.” The hospital said in a statement that he had not been to work and had not seen patients since returning from overseas.
On Tuesday, two days before he was hospitalized and diagnosed, Spencer went to a bowling alley in Williamsburg, rode three New York subway lines and used an Uber car. The bowling alley had closed after Spencer’s diagnosis, while Uber said that health officials had told them the car’s driver and any subsequent passengers were not at risk.
Spencer was is in stable condition Friday , authorities said, and he is talking to public-health workers as they try to trace his steps in recent days. Even as “disease detectives” work to determine who Spencer may have encountered and check the coffee shops and restaurants he visited, officials stressed that they felt they had the situation contained and urged calm among residents.

“New Yorkers who had not been exposed to an infected person’s bodily fluids are simply not at risk,” New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said during a briefing Friday afternoon. “There is no reason for New Yorkers to change their daily routine in any way.”
Spencer “poses no threat to others,” de Blasio said.
The ongoing treatment for Spencer at Bellevue Hospital involves giving him fluid and electrolytes and monitoring his vital signs, said Ram Raju, head of the city’s Health and Hospitals Corporation. Spencer remains in good enough shape to talk on the phone and tell the disease detectives from the health department about his steps so far this week.
Cuomo on Thursday had said that Spencer was a medical professional who had seen Ebola up close, adding that the doctor had been monitoring himself and immediately recognized the symptoms.
“He was familiar with the possibility and the circumstances, so he handled himself accordingly,” Cuomo said.
New York officials repeatedly emphasized on Thursday and Friday that they were prepared for Ebola’s arrival, having trained while also preparing Bellevue and other hospitals for handling patients with the virus.
The office of New York Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) posted images of him riding the subway on Friday morning in an attempt to show residents that they had nothing to fear from public transportation:

Rep. Darrell Issa, a California Republican who chairs the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, urged the Obama administration on Friday to take steps to improve what he characterized as a “bumbling” response to the Ebola crisis.
“I think we all know that the system is not yet refined to where we could say it is working properly,” he said during a hearing on the U.S. government’s response to the disease.
Issa and other members of Congress questioned the measures taken by the administration to prepare for a possible pandemic before Ebola appeared in U.S. hospitals, as well as what officials have done since then to ensure the disease doesn’t spread.
Nicole Laurie, a senior official at the Department of Health and Human Services, said Friday that the risk of a significant Ebola outbreak in the United States was “remote.”
But health-care workers who will be the first to respond to Ebola cases in the United States were worried, particularly after two nurses contracted the disease through an exposure that has still not been explained.
Deborah Burger, co-president of National Nurses United, said these workers remain at risk. She said nurses have received inconsistent instructions, were often left to make decisions about proper precautions for themselves, and at times were forced to improvise their own protective gear because their medical facilities were unprepared. She said only new, legally required guidelines would ensure that medical facilities would provide workers the protection they need.
“The response to Ebola from U.S. hospitals and governmental agencies has been dangerously inconsistent and inadequate,” she said. “The lack of mandates and shifting guidelines from agencies and reliance on voluntary compliance has left caregivers uncertain, severely unprepared and vulnerable to infection.”

Rural job scheme has tremendousimpact on womens lives: Study60% of workers in Alappuzha district depend on the scheme for daily bread
Kochi, October 24:  
The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee (MGNREG) Scheme has helped improve the social and economic status of women and to alleviate poverty in rural areas, according to a study.
The study, conducted in Alappuzha district by Kerala University of Fisheries and Ocean Studies (KUFOS), showed that 97.3 per cent of workers under the scheme are women.
Empowerment
The study was funded by the Kerala State Institute of Rural Development (SIRD) to assess the impact of the scheme on poverty eradication and empowerment of women and marginalised groups.
It found that 60 per cent of workers earned their daily bread through the scheme and that it was a source of additional income for the remaining 40 per cent.
According to the study, 27 per cent of respondents believed that the scheme had helped boost their saving habits and that it brought a kind of financial literacy necessary for financial inclusion.
Impact on wages
The scheme also resulted in wage raise in other sectors, especially in fisheries, construction, coir and agricultural sectors. The study has recommended disbursing the wages within seven days and inclusion of agriculture related works such as harvesting of paddy and works in fish farms under the scheme.
According to V Ambilikumar, Head, Department of Business Administration and Management, KUFOS, and principal investigator of the project, the scheme had made a huge impact on women’s lives and this would reflect on the socio-cultural dynamics of the State.
Kerala has a higher density of population, very limited land holdings and shortage of agricultural land. Hence the list of permissible works under the scheme should be reviewed accordingly, he said.
MS Raju, Director, School of Management and Entrepreneurship, KUFOS, and Mathew Sebastian, Associate Professor, KUFOS, were the co-investigators.

Here Comes Honey Boo Boo canceled after reports about Mama Junes connection with convicted child molesterBy Emily Yahr October 24 Follow @emilyyahr
Honey Boo Boo (Alana Shannon), center, Mama June (June Shannon), right, and Kaitlyn Shannon star in “Here Comes Honey Boo Boo.” (TLC)
“Here Comes Honey Boo Boo” has been officially canceled by TLC, the network confirms, after disturbing reports that star Mama June is in a relationship with a convicted child molester.
“TLC has cancelled the series ‘Here Comes Honey Boo Boo’ and ended all activities around the series, effective immediately,” a network spokesman said. “Supporting the health and welfare of these remarkable children is our only priority. TLC is faithfully committed to the children’s ongoing comfort and well-being.”
On Thursday, TMZ reported that Mama June — mother to nine-year-old Alana Thompson, the inspiration for the series — is dating Mark McDaniel, a Georgia man convicted of aggravated child molestation (reportedly against one of June’s relatives) who spent 10 years in prison. He was released in March, about six months after Mama June split with her long-time partner Sugar Bear. TMZ posted pictures of Mama June and McDaniel together in a hotel room.
Mama June took to Facebook and denied that she was seeing McDaniel, saying they broke up a decade ago. She wrote: “It isnt true i promise my kids r #1 priority over anything else and I would never put them in danger period over this or anything else they r my life this is my past I left him 10 yrs ago for it and I wouldn’t go back.”
On Friday morning, she posted a Facebook video again denying the story: “The statement of me dating a sex offender is totally untrue. I would not ever ever ever put my kids in danger, I love my kids too much. That is my past. I have not seen that person in 10 years and don’t seem to want to see that person,” she said.
Her daughter Pumpkin told Radar Online her mother “left Mark 10 years ago.” McDaniel’s son Michael echoed the same thing to E! News, adding that he believes the molestation charges were false and the hotel room pictures were Photoshopped.
This is a very abrupt end to what’s been a controversial — and highly-rated — TV series for TLC since 2008, chronicling the low-income family as they became stars. TMZ reported that the network has already shot all of the episodes for the upcoming fifth season and will have to shelve them.
“Here Comes Honey Boo Boo” is off the air as reports surface that the mother on the show, June Shannon, was dating a convicted child molester. (AP)
The series was a spin-off from “Toddlers & Tiaras” after young Alana (“Honey Boo Boo”) was so charismatic on camera that the network decided to build a whole show around her and her quirky mother and siblings from Georgia. Alana’s many lines were instantly quotable — and often subtitled — while Mama June became famous for her extreme couponing and low-cost recipes for things like “sketti.”
In a story before the show’s second season, The Post’s TV critic Hank Stuever wrote about a fascination with the family that horrified so many:
Even if it were entirely scripted, “Here Comes Honey Boo Boo” feels as real to me as the Great Depression images shot by the WPA photographers. Okie refugees of the 1930s appear so stoic in sepia photographs because we can’t hear them fight about a spilled jar of puffed cheese balls. Hard as this might be for “Honey Boo Boo’s” detractors to stomach, I think the show is a fitting document for our times, good or bad.
He also said that while Alana may have started as the star of the show, Mama June stole the spotlight:
Anyhow, it’s not really Alana’s show anymore. The real find was June Shannon, Alana’s 33-year-old mother. Although she has been mocked far and wide, there is pleasure in encountering someone so comfortable being herself. At its heart, “Here Comes Honey Boo Boo” is a show about a family that enjoys being with one another.
At the end of the day, he wrote, the show is really about family over everything else:
The more we hang around the Boo Boo clan, the less they seem like ogres and the more they serve as a fascinating entree into America’s most pressing concerns: economy, employment, equality, health, community. “Here Comes Honey Boo Boo’s” producers have a keen eye for the class indicators that smart observers love to deconstruct. The camera is continually glancing at anything it considers a cultural cue — passing trains, litter, rust, copulating animals, a chicken perched on a pile of laundry, a shack selling “peches.” The show lives for opportunities to follow June and her brood deeper into redneck-land (a go-kart track, a pro-am wrestling match), but finds its best material in the warm, sectional-sofa center of home.
In her Facebook video Friday, Mama June urged that although TLC told them to stay quiet over the last several months, this is not the last you’ve seen of the family. She promised to update the many fans of the show all about their lives.
“This experience has been awesome to us, the girls have been able to do things they would not normally get to do,” she said of her four daughters. “And we just want to thank y’all from the bottom of our heart.”

1. Tci was holding 1.33 cr shares of gati in 2012 but now only 82 lakhs and the remaining 51 lakh shares have bee sold by the lenders.. Of the 81 lakh shares 41 lakh is pledged. The agarwals r notorious for not releasing the pledged shares. So the fair value of tci even if gati trades at 200 rs ( it will come back to 30 levels soon ) is only 24 rs.
2. As long as gati infra is not listed there will be no gain for tci finance from the power plant. All the positive boarders here hide the fact that tci has only 10% stake in amritjal. It was a negative boarder who informed this board that tci is holding only 10% stake in amritjal. ( i dont know why those giving 500 targets doesnt know how much stake tci has in amritjal ).
3. Tci has no office or even a mail id.
4. Tci posted good results only because of revenue from other operations. A company can grow only if it has good operating income. This time onwards the other operating income will be a big zero. So tci will post very poor results.
5. Tci is only a paper company. They says they r in finance business but they do not have their own office or even a mail id.
Does any one can point out even a single reason why one should buy tci ?

Insurance scheme for Asset Homes buildingsInsurance scheme for Asset Homes buildings
Our Bureau
Kochi, October 24:  
Kerala-based Asset Homes has introduced bundled insurance coverage for all its newly constructed dwellings.
All natural and manmade calamities are covered under the scheme, said Sunil Kumar, Managing Director, Asset Homes. The financial loss caused by recent cyclone Hudhud and Kashimir floods to building structures has prompted the company to go in for an insurance coverage, he added.
Incidents of natural calamities and manmade disasters such as terrorism and bomb explosions can damage buildings fully or partially.
Asset Homes has entered into an agreement with New India Assurance Company to offer the coverage called Insured Asset Scheme.
As per the MoU, all new villas and apartments of Asset Homes will be covered against damages caused by fire, earthquake, lightening, explosion etc for a period of 25 years.
The insurance company has agreed to extend a similar package to existing apartments of the company, for which discussions are in progress with resident associations.
CJ Philip, Deputy General Manager, New India Assurance Company, hoped that all builders in the country would emulate the initiative.

Getting a Grip on Ebolareddit
We have to get a grip. Ebola is not a crisis in the United States. One person has died and two people are infected with his body fluids.
The real crisis is the hysteria over Ebola that's being fed by media outlets seeking sensationalism and politicians posturing for the midterm elections.
That hysteria is causing us to lose our heads. Parents have pulled their children out of a middle school after learning the school's principal had traveled to Zambia. Zambia happens to be in Africa but it has not even had a single case of Ebola.
A teacher at an elementary school has been placed on paid leave because parents were concerned he might have contracted the Ebola virus. When and how? During a recent trip to Dallas for an educational conference.
Are we planning to quarantine Dallas next?
Some politicians from both parties are demanding an end to commercial flights between the United States and several West African countries. But there are no direct flights to the U.S. from Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea, where Ebola is taking its biggest toll.
So do they want to ban all commercial flights that might contain someone from any of these countries, who might have transferred planes? That would cover just about all commercial flights coming from outside the United States.
The most important thing we can do to prevent Ebola from ever becoming a crisis in the United States is to help Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea, where 10,000 new cases could crop up weekly unless the spread of the virus is slowed soon.
Isolating these poor nations would only make their situation worse. Does anyone seriously believe we could quarantine hundreds of thousands of infected people a continent away who are infecting others?
The truth is quite the opposite. If the disease is allowed to spread in these places, the entire world could be imperiled.
These nations desperately need medical professionals in the field, more medical resources, isolation facilities, and systems in place to detect early cases.
Even at this stage, that's not an impossible task. Nigeria is succeeding in checking the spread of the disease. It has not had a new case of Ebola in over a month.
But I'm worried about America. I'm not worried about Ebola. I'm worried about our confidence and courage.
Every time a global crisis arises these days -- the drug war in Latin America, terrorism in the Middle East, climate change that's straining global food and water supplies and threatening many parts of the world with flooding -- the knee-jerk response of some Americans is to stop it at our borders.
As if we have the option. As if we live on another planet.
What's wrong with us? We never used to blink at taking a leadership role in the world. And we understood leadership often required something other than drones and bombs.
We accepted global leadership not just for humanitarian reasons but also because it was in our own best interest. We knew we couldn't isolate ourselves from trouble. There was no place to hide.
After World War II, we rebuilt Europe and Japan. Belatedly, we achieved peace in Kosovo. We almost eradicated polio. We took on tuberculosis, worldwide.
Now even Cuba is doing more on the ground in West Africa than we are. It's dispatching hundreds of doctors and nurses to the front lines. The first group of 165 arrived in Sierra Leone in the past few days.
Where are we?
We're not even paying attention to health crises right under our own noses.
More people are killed by stray bullets every day in America than have been killed by Ebola here. More are dying because of poverty and hunger.
More American kids are getting asthma because their homes are located next to major highways. One out of three of our children is obese, at risk of early-onset diabetes.
We're not even getting a flu shot to all Americans who need one.
Instead, we bicker. For the last eight months, Republicans have been blocking confirmation of a Surgeon General.
Why? Because the President's nominee voiced support for expanded background checks for gun purchases, and the National Rifle Association objected.
We've got to get our priorities straight. Media outlets that are exploiting Ebola because they want a sensational story and politicians using it to their own ends ought to be ashamed.
Public fear isn't something to be played with.
There's a huge job to be done, here and abroad. Let's roll up our sleeves and get on with it.

Barack Obama extends Diwali greetings to people across the worldBy: Press Trust of India | Washington | Posted: October 23, 2014 6:28 am
US President Barack Obama greeted Hindus, Jains, Sikhs and Buddhists across the world on the occasion of Diwali, saying it was a chance to remember that even in the midst of darkness, light will ultimately prevail.
“I want to wish a Happy Diwali to all those who are celebrating the festival of lights here in the United States and around the world,” Obama said in his Diwali message yesterday.
In 2009, Obama became the first US president to celebrate the festival, a time of rejoicing for many in the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) community and across the world.
“For Hindus, Jains, Sikhs and Buddhists, lighting the lamp – the diya – is a chance to remember, even in the midst of darkness, that light will ultimately prevail. Knowledge will defeat ignorance, and compassion will triumph over despair,” he said.
“Diwali is also a reminder that we must each do our part to achieve that victory, by dedicating ourselves to service to others. If we affirm our commitments to one another and strive to lift each other up, then together, we will continue moving closer to that brighter future we all seek,” he said.
America is a great and diverse nation, strengthened by the contributions of its entire people, he said, adding, he was proud to host the first Diwali celebration at the White House in 2009.
“Since then, we’ve continued to mark this holiday to honour the rich traditions that define the American family. And I know Michelle and I will never forget the wonderful time we had celebrating Diwali in Mumbai with food, dancing, and the company of friends,” Obama said.
“So, to all the families gathering together this Diwali to reflect on all the blessings of the past year, I wish you a joyous celebration and Saal Mubarak,” said the US President.
This year Secretary of State John Kerry would host the annual Diwali celebration of the Obama Administration.
It would be held at the historic Benjamin Franklin Room of the Department of State.
Kerry will be joined on stage by the Indian Ambassador to the United States S Jaishankar, the State Department said yesterday.
Following their remarks, Kerry and Jaishankar will light a traditional Diwali oil lamp.
A local Hindu priest from the Sri Siva Vishnu temple will preside over the ceremonial lighting and will drape Kerry with a traditional shawl.
In his remarks Kerry will celebrate the important contributions Indian and South-Asian Americans have made to the United States, and highlight the State Department’s commitment to human dignity, compassion, and service – a commitment that is at the heart of all great faiths, a media release said.

Concern for Washington real estate: declining Metro commutersBy Jonathan O'Connell October 23 Follow @OConnellPostBiz
Fewer riders are taking Metro downtown for work in the morning. (Photo by jahi chikwendiu/The Washington Post)
For 15 years, more and more people rode Metro. Ridership increased an average of 3 percent annually, going from 150 million trips in 1996 to almost 225 million trips in 2009, according to the agency.
Growth came not only from the job gains Washington enjoyed during that period but rapid development near stations along the Green Line in the District, the Orange Line in Arlington and the Red Line in Montgomery County, among other places.
The growth came to a halt during the recession, but many assumed that it would restart once the economy recovered.
Instead, after plateauing, ridership resumed dropping  the past two years even as public transit usage nationwide reached record levels . Metro rail ridership is now almost at its 2005 level.

Such declines concern Metro as it pushes for funding for its long-term improvements. What’s causing ridership to wane?
The agency’s staff raised a bathtub full of possible concerns for the drop-off in a recent report to the board , among them cuts to federal jobs, slow economic growth, a possible rise in teleworking, increased alternative work schedules, more bike commuters and the increased fares and track work that have driven some longtime Metro riders up the wall and maybe back into their cars.
In the report, Metro staff pointed out that recent surveys of federal workers found that more than 10 percent telecommute at least once a week. “Changing commute patterns, particularly in the form of telework and alternative work schedules, are an area of continuing investigation for Metro,” the staff wrote.
Declining ridership is also troubling for the real estate firms and developers that build and own offices near the stations, and of particular concern is a drop in the number of commuters who are taking Metro downtown in the morning.
The real estate services firm JLL looked at the number of morning passenger arrivals (pre-9 a.m.) at the system’s busiest stations, most of which are in or around downtown D.C. All but two of the stations saw declines in 2014 and the drop in Foggy Bottom, of 13.6 percent, was dramatic.

Total arrivals at downtown stations were still up slightly, at 1.7 percent, but JLL’s Brian Sullivan said that from a real estate perspective there is concern that teleworking policies — which have been talked about for a decade or more — are finally taking hold.
Walking, biking or driving to work is one thing, as those employees still need offices. But if you own an office building, employees not coming to work at all is quite another because their employers may decide they don’t need to lease as much space. Sullivan said it’s possible the drop-off “signals that the federal telecommute policies are taking hold, as fewer federal employees take Metro to work on a daily basis.”
“Real estate east of 15th Street caters more to supporting federal offices and we’ve been seeing steady declines in federal employment, so that would explain some of the changes,” Sullivan said.
Richard Barkham, chief global economist at the real estate services firm CBRE, said he sees a societal shift but toward the tech industry, not toward teleworking.
Workers at technology companies are pushing the growth in residential density that cities such as Washington have experienced in recent years, he said. More of them are walking or biking to work and fewer are clocking in from 9 to 5 at the office the way previous generations did.
“The big story in U.S. cities is densification,” Barkham said. “People are moving downtown because it’s very fashionable and very popular. I don’t think it’s threatening suburban living at the moment but it’s what young workers want to do.”
“I don’t think you should overstate teleworking,” he added. “People have talked about this for more than 15 years. When I was doing my PhD in the early ’80s … we were talking about it then. While people are more location-flexible, the more creative industries actually need more face-to-face time.”

Health minister: Mali confirms its first Ebola caseA volunteer receives the Ebola vaccination "cAd3-EBO-Z" at the vaccine center in Bamako, Mali, on Oct. 9. (Alex Duval Smith/EPA)
Mali's health minister confirmed Thursday  that the West African country has its first Ebola case.
Health Minister Ousmane Kone told state television Thursday that the patient is a 2-year-old girl in the Kayes region in the west of the country, Reuters reported. The girl recently came from Guinea, the minister added, which neighbors Kayes to the south.
"The condition of the girl, according to our services, is improving thanks to her rapid treatment," the minister said, according to the Reuters report. He added, "the sick child and the people who were in contact with her in Kayes were immediately identified and taken care of." 
According to the health minister, the patient's blood tested positive for Ebola after she was admitted to a hospital Wednesday evening, the AP notes .
Although the World Health Organization recently declared neighboring Senegal Ebola-free after a single case of the virus there, Guinea is one of three West African countries hit hard by the outbreak.
Since the beginning of the outbreak, the World Health Organization has counted 9,936 confirmed, probable and suspected cases of Ebola in seven countries: Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Spain, the United States, Nigeria and Senegal.
The vast majority of those cases are in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. Along with Senegal, the WHO has also determined that Nigeria is now Ebola-free.
There have been 4,877 confirmed deaths in the current outbreak.
Guinea alone has 1,540 cases of the disease and 904 deaths, according to the latest available figures from the WHO.

Amla s 119 gives South Africa 2-0 leadHashim Amla's 119 led South Africa to an impressive, but not overly daunting, 282 for nine (Source: AP/File)
By: Reuters | Wellington | Posted: October 24, 2014 11:10 am
Hashim Amla’s composed century helped South Africa to within a sniff of reclaiming the one-day top ranking after they beat New Zealand by 72 runs to wrap up their three-match series with a game to spare on Friday.
Amla’s 119 led South Africa to an impressive, but not overly daunting, 282 for nine in the second match at Mount Maunganui before the home side failed to get going against a bowling attack that put them under constant pressure.
With Kane Williamson and Ross Taylor out injured, none of New Zealand’s top-order batsmen did themselves any favours in the jockeying for World Cup selection as they were dismissed for 210 in 46.3 overs.
Wicketkeeper Luke Ronchi, who top-scored for the hosts with 99 in the first game, again led his side with 79 and shared in another record final wicket partnership, this time with Mitchell McClenaghan (34 not out) as they put on 76 runs.
Ronchi and Trent Boult had scored 74 runs, a New Zealand record against all countries for the final wicket, in the first game.
The visitors had won the first game by six wickets and can jump to the top of the International Cricket Council one-day rankings if they complete a clean sweep of the series in Hamilton on Monday.
Australia top the list but a 3-0 series victory will mean two more points for the Proteas, also on 113 points.
South Africa had been well set to score in excess of 300 courtesy of Amla’s 16th one-day international century and Faf Du Plessis’ 67 before the wheels fell off their innings.
Amla was dismissed in the 45th over with his side on 257 for four and exciting stroke-makers JP Duminy, David Miller and Rilee Roussouw still to come.
Duminy and Miller took the visitors through to 279 in the 48th over before a spectacular collapse when they scored just three singles off the final 14 balls and lost five wickets causing some concern at their frailty ahead of the World Cup.

In this Idea Exchange moderated by Resident Editor (Chandigarh) Vipin Pubby, Yuvraj Singh speaks about cricket and fighting cancer 
Rakesh Rocky : How agonising was your fight with cancer after the high of the 2011 World Cup triumph? When did you feel something was wrong with your body?
Since I started to play for India, I had less time on hands to enjoy things other than cricket in life. And maybe I was taking lot of things for granted before being diagnosed with lung cancer and going through chemotherapy. It was a totally different experience. I would vomit a lot during chemotherapy sessions. I was not able to digest food and was losing hair. That pain made me stronger and I started to see life from a different, appreciative angle. After my recovery, I started to relish food, began to even enjoy the fresh air and was thankful to relatives and friends more than ever before. During the World Cup, I was really struggling with my breathing. I remember I had gone to meet Zaheer Khan in his room. I started to cough and vomited in the washroom, and I spit half a glass of blood. It occurred to me then, maybe something was really wrong.
Virender Kumar : When did the first symptoms surface?
I first started to cough and vomit while on tour with the Indian cricket team in South Africa, a couple of months before the 2011 World Cup began. The team physiotherapist suggested that I go for tests. And when I took the tests, a patchy problem appeared in my lungs. But I ignored the problem thinking that the World Cup was around the corner, for me playing in the mega-event was foremost. But symptoms worsened during the World Cup. I had neck pain, indigestion and insomnia.
Rakesh Rocky : Till few years back, you along with Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir, were seen as the next choice for the post of the Indian team captain after Sourav Ganguly. Do you regret missing out? Do you think that Mahendra Singh Dhoni has a coterie continued…

India can do well under Dhoni at WCPrint

Legendary West Indies fast bowler Michael Holding feels Mahendra Singh Dhoni is not “innovative and proactive enough as captain, especially in Tests” although India would remain a strong contender to retain their World Cup title in Australia next year.
Holding believes that captaining the Indian ODI team is “not a difficult task”.
India have earned many laurels during Dhoni’s captaincy but of late he has copped a lot of criticism, mainly for his leadership in the longest format.
“I don’t think ODI captaincy is a problem (with Dhoni) but the longer form of the game is. I don’t think he is innovative and proactive enough in the longer form of the game. But captaining in ODIs it is not too difficult. Therefore India can do well under him at the World Cup,” Holding told PTI in an interview.
Holding feels that there are a lot of modern-day players, who ignore Test cricket for extending their ODI and T20 career. Holding feels choosing between Test and limited overs cricket is not a tough choice for the current crop of cricketers.
“Why only him (Dhoni), a lot of cricketers prefer playing limited overs cricket,” said Holding, who was nicknamed ‘Whispering Death’ by umpire Dickie Bird for possessing one of the smoothest run-up that the cricketing world has ever seen.
“I don’t think a lot of cricketers like playing Test cricket. It is not peculiar to him (Dhoni) alone. Money is one main reason and if you can work for short period of time and get more money, eventually you want to do that only,” said the 60-year-old, who is respected for his straight talk as a commentator.
Asked about India’s chance of defending the World Cup title in Australia and New Zealand early next year.
“I can’t predict that. It is very hard to do that in one-day cricket. It matters who plays well on the day.
“Yes they (India) have a good enough team to challenge for the title. I think there about four or five teams that stand a realistic chance of winning but as I said it is a matter of how well you play on the day. Having names in your team doesn’t guarantee that you are going to play well,” said the Jamaican.
But does India have the bowlers for the conditions Down Under?
“You don’t have to take a lot of wickets if you get enough runs on the board. I think last time India won the World Cup at home and you saw how they won it. They chased big totals,” said Holding.
He reckons India must take Ishant Sharma to the World Cup and the lanky pacer along with Bhuvneshwar Kumar make a good pairing.
“I think Ishant Sharma is a very good bowler. You need your best team for the World Cup and he finds himself in that best team.
Bhuvneshwar could be another strong bowler if used sparingly. He continued…

DHS morale problem What DHS morale problemBy Jerry Markon October 24 Follow @JerryMarkon

Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson got right to the point Thursday afternoon after handing out distinguished-service awards to more than 300 department employees. A recent government survey has shown DHS morale plunging to new lows, but Johnson was having none of it.
“There’s a survey that says your morale is low,’’ he said at the start of his address to an auditorium crowded with DHS personnel. His voice rising, he called out: “How is your morale today?’’
The crowd answered with a series of loud whoops.
Johnson’s pep talk was part of the department’s latest effort to tackle the entrenched morale problems that have plagued it for years – and that Johnson has vowed to fix. It came during his “Secretary’s awards’’ ceremony, during which top DHS officials handed out awards to employees for actions ranging from responding to tornadoes and other natural disasters to investigating Russian counterfeiters.
At the event, held at DAR Constitution Hall in the District, Johnson and his deputy, Alejandro Mayorkas, presented the honors to 312 employees from a range of DHS agencies, including the Secret Service, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. A large U.S. flag fluttered overhead at the ceremony, attended by more than 600 DHS employees.
The government’s 2014 Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey recently showed that even as the vast majority of DHS employees are dedicated to their mission to protect the homeland, many say the department discourages innovation, treats employees in an arbitrary fashion and fails to recruit skilled personnel.
The survey has long been a measure of federal job satisfaction and a guide for government leaders, and it forms the basis of the widely read annual Best Places to Work in the Federal Government report.
In issuing the awards, Johnson revived an annual tradition that had been dormant since 2008. He clearly relished the task.
“This is probably the best thing I’ve done in months on my job,’’ he told the DHS employees. “Keep up the good work.’’

Washington vs. Dallas: A telling tale-of-the-tape on 3rd downsBy Liz Clarke October 24 Follow @lizclarketweet
Tony Romo and the Cowboys are leading the league in third down conversions. (AP)
Among the statistical contrasts between Washington (2-5, 0-2) and Dallas (6-1, 1-0) heading into Monday night’s game at AT&T Stadium, the one that leaps out as most telling is third-down conversion.
Dallas leads the NFL in its success rate on third downs, converting 54 of 94, or 57.4 percent.
Washington ranks 31st, better only than Tennessee, converting 26 of 82 third downs, or 31.7 percent.
Cowboys Coach Jason Garrett credits his squad’s enviable percentage to a collective effort that starts, not surprisingly, with getting in good position on first and second downs.
“Anytime you do that, you’re obviously giving yourself the best chance to convert those,” Garrett said in a conference call this week.
The fourth-year Cowboys coach pointed in particular to the team’s stout offensive line, which has protected well in the tougher third-down situations, and the array of receiving options at quarterback Tony Romo’s disposal — wide receivers Dez Bryant, Terrance Williams and Cole Beasley; tight ends Jason Witten, Gavin Escobar and James Hanna; and running back Lance Dunbar among them.
“We feel good about where we are right now,” Garrett said of his team, which brings a six-game winning streak onto its home field. “But it’s very much a collective effort and has a lot to do with what we’re doing prior to third down. We’ve just got to keep that going because it’s a big part of the game.”
Washington free safety Ryan Clark points to the Cowboys’ draft-day strategy as the foundation of the success of Dallas’ offense this season.
“They did good by making the unsexy first round picks — but not getting the big name guys; by not chasing people they thought would put butts in the seats,” Clark said. “They went out, they got first-round [offfensive] linemen. Now that’s paying dividends because now DeMarco Murray has a lot of space to run the football. Now, Tony Romo can use the play-action, and now you get one-on-one coverage with Dez every now and then, who’s a guy you really can’t cover man-to-man.”

The evolution of Islamism since the Arab uprisingsBy Quinn Mecham October 24

The Arab uprisings of 2010-2011 provided a major shock that led to the rapid evolution of Islamism in the Arab world. While it was clear at the outset that the shock to Islamist movements would be large, how Islamist movements would internalize that shock and the direction in which they would evolve were highly contingent on the evolution of the Arab political systems. Since the initial uprisings, Islamist movements have evolved dramatically due to a several key trends that have defined and redefined their experience in the new Arab political (dis)order. These trends must be understood in the context of the opportunities Islamist movements faced in initial uprising period.
Although most Islamist movements, such as the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, were initially slow to lead popular mobilization against autocratic Arab regimes, they recognized that they could benefit from changes in the post-uprisings political landscape. As it became apparent in many Arab countries that new elections could translate popular support for Islamist movements into political power, many Islamist groups supported the electoral process and launched aggressive campaigns to define society’s needs and capture votes.
These visions, championed by diverse Islamist groups such as Ennahda in Tunisia, Muslim Brotherhood and Salafi groups in Egypt, Islah in Yemen and the Justice and Development Party (PJD) in Morocco, as well as Islamist groups in Libya, Jordan and Kuwait, saw the 2011-12 period as a potential renaissance for Islamist participation in governance. They clumsily entered into political competition with other actors who also sought to redefine the emerging political order. In a large number of countries experiencing political turmoil (Tunisia, Egypt, Morocco, Yemen and Kuwait) Islamist groups found new levels of political prominence. Importantly, however, they were actively repressed by the state in Syria, and often had only limited access to key domains of state power (in Libya, Egypt and the monarchies).
Since their initial experience with mass mobilization and the political openings in 2011-12, four main trends have affected Islamist movements in the Arab world that have dramatically shifted their perceived political opportunities. These trends have led to the rapid evolution and devolution of Islamist groups, often in deeply defining ways that will leave a long-term organizational legacy for Islamist groups far into the future. I discuss each of these trends in turn.
Trend #1: Repression of the Muslim Brotherhood
Though a long-standing actor of significance in Egyptian society and politics, as well as a leader among Islamist movements in the Arab world, the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood initially appeared to benefit significantly from the political opening after the fall of President Hosni Mubarak. The Brotherhood had wide-ranging internal discussions regarding its electoral strategy in the post-Mubarak period, but ultimately chose to compete aggressively for both control of the People’s Assembly and the Egyptian presidency. In the Egyptian elections of 2011-12, the Brotherhood’s Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) won both the Assembly elections and the presidency, leading many in Egypt to fear Brotherhood dominance of the institutions of government.
In retrospect, the Brotherhood’s move to reverse its initial decision not to contest the presidency was a fateful one. After its candidate, Mohamed Morsi, narrowly won the election and became president of Egypt, he sought to challenge existing centers of power in Egypt, and was unable to resolve the deep economic and social challenges faced by Egyptians in the wake of political turmoil. Widespread popular anger at governmental ineptitude, combined with military concerns over potential threats to its economic and political prerogatives, led the Egyptian military and courts to disband the Brotherhood-dominated Assembly and subsequently forcibly remove Morsi from office in 2013.
Although a case could be made that the Brotherhood-dominated government had squandered its extensive popular support, the military decision to forcibly remove an elected Islamist government had enormous consequences for the incentives of Islamist groups to compete in popular elections. Furthermore, the military and judicial decision to aggressively pursue the Muslim Brotherhood as an organization, regardless of its political positions, cast a long shadow over Islamist political calculations that has only darkened over time. Beginning in 2013, the Egyptian state launched a massive campaign to brand the Brotherhood a terrorist organization, to systematically imprison leadership and to destroy the organization’s capacity as a political and social organization. In the process, human rights protections dramatically receded in Egypt, forcing remaining members of the Brotherhood underground or into exile. Simultaneously, the Brotherhood was pursued outside Egypt, particularly in Saudi Arabia and a number of Gulf countries, as Gulf leaders provided the new military regime in Egypt with budgetary support.
This dramatic turn of events, which took the Arab world’s most prominent and popular Islamist group from the heights of governance to a position where it was forcibly and irremediably excluded from normal politics, has deeply affected the organization’s capacity and incentives to participate in regular political processes. A similar process occurred with the Islamist Salvation Front (FIS), which won elections in Algeria in the early 1990s, and triggered a long and brutal civil war in that country. While there are as of yet no strong signs that civil war looms for Egypt, it is clear that perceptions of injustice coupled with exclusion from the political process have altered the incentives for Islamists in Egypt in a way that could produce militancy.
Trend #2: State Failure and the Rise of Islamist “State-Building”
A second trend that has become more pronounced in the Arab world since 2011 is state failure. This has been most prominent in Syria, Iraq, Libya and Yemen. State failure is marked by the inability of the state to provide security and basic state goods such as sanitation, transport, education and health facilities. As central governments have lost control over territory and have lost their monopoly over the use of violence, Islamist groups have been the most prominent of those who have stepped in to fill the breach. Islamists have competitors in the form of tribes and ethnic groups, but they have found it easier than these groups to secure external funding, weaponry and fighters, many of which have come from abroad and have rallied around a pan-Islamic identity.
Since 2013, a number of militant Islamist groups have begun to transition away from strategies that seek primarily to destroy or destabilize the state (e.g., in Syria and Iraq) to groups that seek to monopolize violence over territory that they control. While they still see existing states as rivals to be challenged, they have discovered that they have the ability to build organizational and economic capacity to rule territory and to distribute patronage to their political clients. These militants have both rejected the participatory political norms of groups like the Muslim Brotherhood as well as the anarchic tendencies of the al-Qaeda franchise in favor of norms based in militia-based governance. This brand of militancy requires the development of broader ideology of governance than al-Qaeda possesses, as well as resources that can be managed to produce a regular income.
Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in the Gaza Strip provided early territorial-based models of militant Islamist governance, but it has now spread through large parts of the Levant and Mesopotamia, as well as into parts of Libya and Yemen. The rise of the Islamic State that crosses the traditional Syrian and Iraqi border territory is the most expansive of these new models, governing at present close to 8 million people and commanding large economic and military resources. The Syrian conflict has led other Islamist groups to adopt a similar model on a smaller scale. Likewise, large parts of Libya and Yemen are now controlled by Islamist militias.
What distinguishes these groups from other Islamist groups is their ability to incentivize populations living under their control (through good governance, extortion or fear) to submit to their authority and often to participate in providing security or governance. They reject the Westphalian state system in favor of often unorthodox models of “Islamic” state governance, borrowing many of the tools of modern state systems but rejecting the legitimizing norms of these states. As these new political orders increasingly challenge international norms and the states in which they operate, their ability to maintain resource flows and territorial control will remain an open question.
Trend #3: Islamists as Actors in Sectarian Proxy Wars
The enormously destructive conflict in Syria has become a catalyst for a new level of proxy conflict between Middle Eastern actors, most notably between the dominantly Sunni countries of the Arab Gulf and Shiite Iran. This international conflict using local proxies has shaped how Islamist groups are funded and behave, leading to increasing Islamist militancy and to the development of sectarian ideologies.
As the Syrian opposition to the regime of Bashar al-Assad evolved from a dominantly non-violent campaign to a militant one, arms and resources to Sunni combatants flowed into the country from the Arab Gulf. When the competition between fragmented rebel groups for external funding intensified, they often sought to distinguish themselves from competing groups through their ideology, which in many cases came to mirror the anti-Shiite tendencies of dominant private and government funders. Active Iranian funding for the Assad regime gave the Syrian conflict an increasingly sectarian cast, which had been the case for some time in Iraq. By 2013, as the Iraqi and Syrian rebellions began to overlap in their organization, Islamists on both sides began to view the civil wars in these countries as existential sectarian conflicts. The Islamic State’s dramatic territorial gains in Iraq during 2014 have further aggravated the sectarian tendencies of Iraq’s Shiite-dominated government, and Shiite militias have been deployed throughout much of the country to counter the real and urgent threat from Sunni militants.
Sectarianism in Syria has led to Islamist violence across sectarian lines in neighboring Lebanon, as Sunni militants have targeted Hezbollah positions. Yemen has also seen violent clashes between mainstream Sunni Islamists (Islah) and the Shiite Zaydi Houthi movement, which have spread into the capital, Sanaa. Both countries remain at risk of civil war, which would likely fall along Sunni-Shiite lines. The ongoing funding of militants with highly sectarian ideologies by sympathetic external actors leaves Islamist groups in many parts of the Arab world more militant, well-funded, diverse and sectarian in their ideology than prior to the Arab uprisings. This is a trend that has already led to deep polarization across Islamist groups and will take many years to reverse.
Trend #4: Political Learning Continues
Despite the increasing levels of government repression, militancy and sectarianism experienced by Islamist groups since 2012, a number of Islamist groups have adjusted their strategies to limit their exposure to these trends and to remain relevant in their political systems. Just as the initial Arab uprisings created a large demonstration effect for protest movements throughout the Arab world, the deeply negative political developments in many Arab countries have led to increasing caution and political learning among Islamist groups in neighboring countries.
Islamist groups in countries such as Algeria and Jordan have chosen not to lead a major challenge against their governments, in part because of the negative lessons of Islamist activism from the 1990s civil war in Algeria and the contemporary civil war in Jordan’s neighbor Syria. Likewise, Islah in Yemen is operating in a context where al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula plays a militant role. As a result, Islah has sought to frame its ideology in a way that will avoid charges of militancy and allow it to capture some of the spoils of the post-Ali Abdullah Saleh political transition.
Perhaps the most interesting political learning has been demonstrated by the Islamist Ennahda party in Tunisia. Although Egypt watched Tunisia’s uprising against then-President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali closely, which then led to mass protests in Egypt that unseated Mubarak, Tunisians have observed the military’s removal of Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood with great interest. Morsi’s unwillingness or inability to offer significant concessions to his political opponents helped to trigger a military intervention with profoundly negative consequences for the Egyptian group. When public protests subsequently began in Tunisia against the Ennahda government and led to political deadlock, the Islamist government chose to resign in favor of a technocratic government. This helped to preserve the democratic system as well as the movement’s ability to participate within that system. As a result, Ennahda maintained its political reputation and organization within the Tunisian system. In Morocco, a similar process has unfolded since the Islamist PJD won elections in November 2011. While the party was criticized by many Islamists for being too conciliatory to the palace in a system that clearly favors the institutions of monarchy, it has maintained influence within that system in part due to its political conservativism.
As Islamist militancy leads to increasing conflict, and as the consequences of increased government repression become more apparent, many mainstream Islamist groups in functioning states are likely to exercise increasing caution in their political behavior in the near term, learning from the current political disorder in the Arab world.
These four trends have been deeply influential on the evolution of Islamist movements in a short period, and they are likely to be lasting in their effects. Unlike the fragile political transitions of 2011-12, which were subject to a range of political forces that worked against their success and stability, the destructive trends in large parts of the Arab world since 2012 are much harder to reverse.
This is primarily because they have led to the dismantling of important forces that take a long time to build. These earlier, but fragile, forces include the democratic interest and participation of Islamist groups, cross-sectarian coalitions that support state governance, and even state capacity itself. Both state and nation have fractured in many parts of the Arab world since 2012, and neither will be reconstituted except in the long-term. This has led many Islamist groups to face permanent exclusion from their states and societies, or to try to re-create state and society on their own terms by force.
Neither of those scenarios augurs well for the future of Islamist groups in the Arab world, and will lead many Islamist leaders to make difficult choices in the near term. If Islamists can continue to play a constructive role in Tunisia, Morocco or even Iraq by channeling Islamic norms of justice on behalf of national interests, then they may yet play a role in the urgent task of nation building. If, however, either narrow ideological interests or exclusion from the political process prevent Islamist groups from contributing to the processes of nation, state, or regime-building in the region, they will likely remain but one more contribution to the ongoing dissolution of the Arab world’s political order.

Sorry  Madeleine Albright dont play thatBy Helena Andrews October 24 Follow @helena_andrews
Well that escalated quickly.
The next time you decide to tweet a seasonal (and teeny bit sexist) punchline at a former secretary of state, just… don’t. Especially if the woman in question is one Madeleine Albright, who recently put Conan O’Brien (nay, the world) on notice: Don’t come for me, boo.
It all started rather innocently. O’Brien, host of “Conan” on TBS, tweeted Thursday that he’d finally figured out what he was going to be for Halloween. Things went downhill from there.
I picked out my Halloween costume. I’m going as “Slutty Madeleine Albright.”
— Conan O’Brien (@ConanOBrien) October 23, 2014
Instead of ignoring O’Brien and giving her Presidential Medal of Freedom its daily spit shine, Albright shot back with a perfectly executed burn of her own.
. @ConanOBrien I’m considering going as hunky Conan O’Brien – but that might be too far fetched. — Madeleine Albright (@madeleine) October 23, 2014
And…. boom goes the dynamite.
Fortunately for us, the lesson didn’t stop there. Albright, who has more than 70,000 followers on Twitter (O’Brien has 12.5 million), schooled the talk show host about her mettle.

Watch: Frank Mankiewicz on Walter Cronkite  political adviserBy Erik Wemple October 24 Follow @ErikWemple
As The Post’s Adam Bernstein writes in a wonderful obituary , Frank Mankiewicz plowed a classic Washington career toggling between the adjacent worlds of media and politics: aide to Robert F. Kennedy and George S. McGovern, NPR president, PR exec at Hill & Knowlton.
In an archival interview with C-SPAN’s Brian Lamb , Mankiewicz unspooled a telling anecdote about just how closely these worlds can intermingle in Washington, or at least the Washington of Mankiewicz’s time. Lamb and Mankiewicz discuss the Washington operator’s suggestion that CBS News/American legend Walter Cronkite serve as McGovern’s running mate in the 1972 contest against Richard M. Nixon. That idea didn’t fly, obviously.
As to why Mankiewicz thought Cronkite would be a good guy to tap, he recited the particulars of a meeting years before. In Mankiewicz’s own words:
I knew he was very much opposed to the Vietnam War because he had come back from Vietnam and immediately called me and asked to see Sen. Robert Kennedy. And the two of them met — I was there. And he began by saying, ‘Senator, you’ve got to run for president because this war’s got to end,’ and went on to say how unwinnable it was. He said we’d win a village in the daytime and we’d have to give it back at night. He said the Vietnamese in the south may not like the north, but they like us less. So I knew — and Kennedy said to him, he said, ‘Walter, I’ll run for president if you’ll run for the senate in New York.’ And Cronkite laughed and said ‘Well, I can’t because in the first place I don’t live in New York; I live in Connecticut. And secondly I’m not a Democrat. I’m registered as an independent.’
Mankiewicz told the same story in an op-ed in The Washington Post after Cronkite’s death . He noted that the “meeting was understood to be off the record, and no one else was present.” Correct: When a media big shot morphs into a political adviser, best to keep it quiet.

Demand concerns put pressure on base metalsDemand concerns put pressure on base metals
G Chandrashekhar
:  
The global base metals market is currently facing strong headwinds that impact price performance.
In 2012 and 2013, a combination of expanding liquidity, weakening dollar, China’s voracious appetite for consumption and slowly improving growth prospects helped a strong uptick in demand. Although selective, investor interest in base metals was healthy.
Things are different now. This year has not been a great one for metals market.
In recent months, some of the important drivers have reversed direction while new challenges have emerged. Shrinking liquidity following the US Fed’s tapering programme, a steadily firming dollar, slowing industrial production in some of the major economies and lower inflation expectations have combined to cap the upside and force market prices down.
Currently, macroeconomic risks are casting a shadow – concerns over growth being the most important.
There is apprehension of demand slowdown. As the mover and shaker of the world commodity market, China’s import and consumption of metals exert a profound impact.
With construction activity in the Asian major slowing, there are fresh concerns over metals’ demand growth.
Another reason is the high level of corporate debt in China.
Although inflation is under control and employment healthy, the Chinese government seems to be worried about corporate debt and has, therefore, asked State-owned enterprises to fund purchases through cash flow rather than on credit.
According to experts, the metals and mining sector in China is not in a good shape. Declining investment growth and falling property prices have generated fears that the 2015 GDP growth target may be lowered. There are demand concerns is other regions too. Although US recovery is back on track, global growth is still uneven. Demand in Europe and Japan is still fragile.
Of course, many emerging markets show signs of stabilising with activities being adjusted to global realities. The US Fed’s monetary policy normalisation is seen as another uncertainty as expectations differ about the timeframe. Geopolitical tensions may have somewhat receded, but the Russia-Ukraine stand-off and insurgency in Syria and Iraq can potentially create a turmoil.
Simply put, the global environment is full of strong pulls and pressures.
As a result, many commodities are trading close to their cost curve.
Some of the less-efficient producers have shut down. It has also prompted a cut in capacity expansion.
Collapsing metal prices deter fresh investment while investor risk appetite wanes.
Supply demand fundamentals have begun to assert themselves.
Exception
An exception to the general trend of falling base metals prices is nickel whose price surge has been triggered by Indonesian ban on export of unprocessed raw material. Zinc is another exception because of tightening supplies.
Despite all the uncertainties surrounding the base metals market, on current reckoning, nickel will turn out to be a winner next year followed at a distance by zinc.

Six Assam men held in Burdwan blast case sent to judicial custodyNSG commandos investigates Burdwan blast case at Badshahi Road, in Burdwan on Friday. (Source: PTI)
Written by Samudra Gupta Kashyap | Guwahati | Posted: October 24, 2014 8:50 pm
Six men who were arrested by the Assam Police two weeks ago for their alleged connection with the explosion in Burdwan, West Bengal were sent to judicial custody by the Chief Judicial Magistrate (CJM) here on Friday.
The six men, Shaikhul Islam @ Abdullah (20), Rafikul Islam (39), Md. Shiraj Ali Khan (53), Jahuruddin (60), Golam Usmani (23) and Sarbesh Ali (35), hail from three different villages in Barpeta district. Among them, Shaikhul Islam alias Abdulla of Kahikuchi village in Barpeta is said to be an important member of the Jama’atul Mujahideen Bangladesh (Party of the Mujahideen) sleeper cell in Assam, the police said.
While the police had sought remand for two of them – Shaikhul Islam and Rafikul Islam – the CJM’s court rejected that plea and remanded all of them in judicial custody for two weeks. They will be required to be produced before the court again on November 5. Both Shaikhul Islam and Rafikul Islam are also said to have been a close associate of Shakil Ahmed, a JMB operative who was one of the two persons killed in the Burdwan blast on October 2.
Meanwhile, Assam Police director-general Khagen Sarma has said that the police have information that some youths from Assam were visiting Bangladesh at the instance of the JMB. “We have received information against some youths who have been visiting Bangladesh for getting training under the Islamic terror networks such as the JMB to carry out terror attacks,” Sarma said on Thursday. He also said the police have evidence against the six persons arrested in Barpeta and had kept them under surveillance till they were arrested on October 10.

Itd be crazy to do Harry Potter spin-off: Daniel RadcliffeActor Daniel Radcliffe says he cannot imagine at the moment about working on 'Harry Potter' spin-off trilogy as he finished the last instalment of the original just four years back.

Actor Daniel Radcliffe says he cannot imagine at the moment about working on ‘Harry Potter’ spin-off trilogy as he finished the last instalment of the original just four years back.
Radcliffe, 25, who starred in the titular role in the ‘Harry Potter’ films, said it will be too much for him to sign on the three films, based on JK Rowling’s Potter book series ‘Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them’, reported Us magazine.
“At the moment the thought of signing on to another three would be crazy to me. It’s a lot to take on again so soon after he’s finished (Potter),” Radcliffe said.
The first instalment of this new spin-off is set for a November 2016 premiere. ‘Fantastic Beasts’ is set 70 years  prior to Potter’s story.

two-year-old daughter, Blue Ivy.
“Their friends and families are now delighted that there has been a very happy ending to this whole sorry scenario. Both Beyonce and Jay-Z have put a lot of work into their
marriage and it has paid off. They are both over the moon,” the source added.
The pair’s marriage found itself in trouble when a video of Beyonce’s sister Solange attacking rap king Jay Z, 44, in a New York lift back in May went viral.
Footage of them arguing was leaked, but things became so nasty, Solange also tried to kick and hit her brother-in-law.
Fans were shocked and R’n’B’s golden couple found their marriage under staunch pressure. Rumours became rife that they would split following the end of their tour last month, however in public the pair always maintained their relationship was strong.

Panasonic launches 4K Varicam and Varicam HS production cameras in IndiaPanasonic has developed a next generation of P2 solid-state recording for these Varicam series products.
By: Tech Desk | New Delhi | Posted: October 24, 2014 8:28 pm | Updated: October 24, 2014 8:34 pm
Panasonic India has launched two new variants under its Varicam series of film production cameras – the Varicam HS and Varicam 35. The company has developed a next generation of P2 solid-state recording for these Varicam series products.
Specifically designed to capture 4K or high speed HD images, the expressP2 card offers transfer speeds (up to 2.4Gbps). The expressP2 card (AU-XP0256A) provides 72 minutes recording time in 4K/25p mode with high data reliability by containing a flash memory error correction system, equivalent to a RAID system, to recover from a failure.
Inherited from original Varicam series, the Varicam 35 features a V-Log gamma covering wide latitude 14+ stops. The camera also has the ability to simultaneously record in two different formats and codecs together with its in-camera colour grading function. The Varicam 35 incorporates a newly-developed super35mm MOS image sensor and images can be handled in variable frame rates up to 120 frames per second (fps). It can deliver a variety of recording formats, including 4K and UHD in AVC-ULTRA 4K, and 2K and 1080p HD in AVC-Intra 100.
Varicam HS provides smooth slow motion effects, by recording in 240fps HD, without a cache memory. With high speed 1080p image capture at up to 240fps, the Varicam HS camera is aimed at the production of extraordinary high-definition imagery, for the most demanding documentaries, sports or SFX slow-motion applications.

The Democrats midterm turnout problem -- in 6 chartsThe Post's graphics team has a great new tool allowing you to compare turnout between presidential election and midterm elections among a whole bunch of different demographics.
We encourage you to play with it here, and below we'll offer a few observations.
This chart, better than just about anything, shows Democrats midterm problem -- specifically how their party base, while good for presidential elections, isn't exactly conducive to winning the non-presidential elections in-between.
Let's compare the midterm drop-off among the key parts of the so-called "Obama coalition" to more GOP-friendly groups.
Young people (who President Obama won by 23 points)...
... compared to senior citizens (who went for Mitt Romney by 12 points).
Now, switching to race, here are African Americans (who are almost exclusively Democratic voters)...
... compared to white voters (Romney +20).
And, lastly, here's another key portion of the so-called "Obama coalition" -- unmarried women (Obama +36)...
... compared to the inverse (and Romney +22), married men.
 
The differences in some of these cases (particularly race) are slight, but they are real and consistent. And in tight elections that are decided by a few points, a couple points in turnout difference in a key demographic or two can make the difference between winning and losing.
This is Democrats' big challenge come Nov. 4.

Hero MotoCorp plans to launch 2 new models in next one year
PTI
Tweet
New Delhi, Oct 17:  
Seeking to cash in on the fast growing scooter segment in the domestic market, the country’s largest two-wheeler maker Hero MotoCorp plans to launch two new models in the next one year.
The company is also considering to scale up its monthly scooter production capacity to 1 lakh units by January 2015 and 1.5 lakh units in the mid-term.
“In the next one year, there will be two new scooter models in the market,” Hero MotoCorp Senior Vice-President & CFO Ravi Sud told analysts in a conference call.
While he did not elaborate on the segmentation of the new scooters, Sud said it would add to the company’s existing models — Pleasure and Maestro — to accelerate growth in the scooter segment.
Domestic sales
Scooter sales in India grew 32.11 per cent during the April-September period at 21,90,351 units this fiscal against 16,57,920 units in the year-ago period.
In the first half of the ongoing fiscal, Hero MotoCorp had posted a growth of 5.52 per cent in scooter sales at 3,52,330 units against 3,33,889 units in the same period last fiscal.
Sud said that the company’s domestic scooter sales did not reflect the actual growth as Hero MotoCorp had committed its capacity to execute a one-time export order of 45,000 units by the beginning of November.
Production capacity
Seeing further growth in the scooter segment, the company would be enhancing its scooter production capacity.
“Currently we have a capacity to produce 80,000 units per month, which we are scaling up to one lakh units by January 2015. The consideration is to take it to 1.35-1.5 lakh units in the mid-term,” Sud said.
He said the one lakh scooters capacity would come from the existing plants of the company.
“When we increase it to 1.5 lakh units a month, it could also include the scooter capacity from the upcoming plant in Gujarat,” Sud said.
Currently, Hero MotoCorp produces its scooters from Gurgaon and Dharuhera plants.
Sales growth
He said scooter penetration in India is expected to increase to around 32-33 per cent from the current 27 per cent. Scooter sales growth has been urban-led where the penetration is 40 per cent, which can go up to 45 per cent.
The company has a total two-wheeler production capacity of 7.65 million units annually from its plants at Gurgaon, and Dharuhera in Haryana, Haridwar in Uttarakhand and Neemrana in Rajasthan. By next year, it would add another 1.8 million units annually when its fifth plant at Halol in Gujarat becomes operational.
The company is planning to set up its sixth plant in Andhra Pradesh.

Luxury brands prefer to stay away from e-commerce sitesLuxury brands prefer to stay away from e-commerce sites
Purvita Chatterjee
Cutting edge Being a bridge-to-luxury crystal brand, Swarovski cannot risk being a discounted brand.
Believe discounts will erode image
Mumbai, October 23:  
Even as pure play e-commerce sites bend backwards to offer deep discounts, some brands have been keeping away from the action, refusing to mark down their products.
Luxury and bridge-to-luxury brands such as Celio, Swarovski and Zegna are willing to jump onto the e-commerce bandwagon, but on their own terms. These brands feel that discounting would erode their premium image among consumers.
Calling the shots
“We should be in a position to control our prices so there will be no third-party sites. There are plans to start online transactions under our own site like we do worldwide, but there will be no discounts. Prices will be similar to our brick-and-mortar outlets,” says Sukanya Dutta Roy, MD, Consumer Goods Business, Swarovski India.
Being a bridge-to-luxury crystal brand, Swarovski cannot risk being a discounted brand. Its managers feel the brand should not be seen on pure play e-commerce sites.
Reliance Brands, too, has decided to stay away from selling most if its luxury brands on third-party Websites. “Mainstream consumers do not shop from luxury sites. We have limited e-commerce operations to just two of our brands like Quicksilver and Steve Madden. We have not yet taken a decision to bring the rest of our portfolio of brands on the e-commerce platform” says Darshan Mehta, CEO, Reliance Brands.
None of Reliance Brands’ iconic brands such as Timberland, Diesel, Ermenegildo Zegna and Paul & Shark are available on any Indian e-commerce sites as of now.
Given their premium offering, luxury brands insist that they do not like the idea of being treated like commodities. However, there are some international brands present on e-commerce sites. They do not have a choice, and are not allowed to go it alone because of the laws governing single-brand retail.
“We resort to third-party online sites to sell some of our products. We have to be FDI approved to start our own e-commerce operations,” explains Rajiv Nair, CEO, Celio Future Fashions. Though the brand is present on some leading Websites, Nair says: “Ideally, we would like to bring down discounts to a minimum. Once we have our own site, it will reflect the prices are offered at our brick-and-mortar stores.”
Touch and feel
Says Anjana Sharma, COO and Fashion Director, Stylista, a fashion portal: “Luxury brands are about experience, customisation, touch and feel… unlike the rest of the brands, which prefer to go online to get volumes.
Incidentally, most brands having their own e-commerce portals prefer to have similar prices as their offline counterparts. As Nair says: “Even the website belonging to Madura Garments has similar prices as their brick-and-mortar stores.”

Three House Dems  three proposals for net neutrality. Heres what they look like.By Brian Fung October 23 Follow @b_fung
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Rep. Anna Eshoo  join Yelp CEO Jeremy Stoppelman for a tour and policy discussion at Yelp Headquarters in San Francisco. ( speakerpelosi )
Rep. Anna Eshoo is urging federal regulators to oversee Internet providers using Title II of the Communications Act — a move that would give the Federal Communications Commission more latitude to prevent the sort of traffic discrimination net neutrality advocates say would hurt the open Internet.
In a letter to the FCC  this week, the California Democrat said the agency could selectively apply only those parts of the law that deal with reasonable rates and unjust discrimination — what are known as Sections 201 and 202. The rest of the law, she said, could be waived under a process known as "forbearance." (My colleague Nancy Scola has a good overview of what that means .)
"It is true that some of these laws do apply only to telephone services," said Eshoo, referring to Title II's historical role in regulating phone companies like AT&T. "But others are the source of timeless principles that can and do apply to all two-way telecom services, including broadband."
Eshoo's proposal tracks closely with one by her colleague, Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.). In an earlier letter to the FCC, Lofgren also called for a mix of Title II and forbearance — while leaning on another part of the law that could help the FCC make a stronger case for forbearance. In striking down much of the FCC's original net neutrality rules this year, a federal court granted the agency a little more authority under what's called Section 706.
Section 706, found under Title I of the FCC's congressional charter, is how the agency could regulate broadband under new net neutrality rules. Some advocates have been pushing for the FCC to rely primarily on its Section 706 authority to draft the new regulations, but consumer groups argue that won't be enough.
A third proposal by another California Democrat, Rep. Henry Waxman , also relies on Title II, but advances an alternative that waives the very provisions  of the law that Eshoo's letter says are the most important — the language against "unjust discrimination." This may sound counterintuitive, but Waxman appears to agree with industry officials' arguments that the phrase "unjust discrimination" actually could still allow Internet fast lanes — if broadband providers can claim that the discrimination is a "just" and reasonable practice.
"Indeed, section 201(b) expressly permits the creation of 'different classes of communications' with different charges so long as they are deemed 'just and reasonable' by the Commission," Waxman wrote in a letter to the agency, adding that the FCC has already "permitted tiered pricing structures based on volume and term discounts, different levels of quality of service" and other factors that could set a precedent for Internet fast lanes.
So, Waxman is proposing regulating broadband under Title II, but waiving Sections 201 and 202, along with much of the rest of Title II. But why does he even bother with Title II in the first place if he throws so much of it out?
To understand, we have to go back to this year's court decision. The D.C. Circuit said the FCC's old net neutrality rules were invalid because they imposed rules on Internet providers that could only be applied to "common carriers" regulated under Title II (remember that Internet providers are currently regulated under Title I). The wall between Title I services and Title II services is pretty strong, but Waxman's idea would knock down that wall for broadband providers, technically putting them under Title II. Then, rather than actually regulating the Internet providers using Title II requirements, the FCC would draw up new requirements based on Section 706.
That's a lot to digest. But we now have three House Democrats all promoting variations on the same idea: Use the most well-worn part of the FCC's authority to deal with a relatively novel problem.

10 Money Things You Must Know After 50reddit
Birthdays that mark a new decade tend to prompt personal reassessment: In your 20s, starting your career may have been your focus. In your 30s and 40s, maybe it was the big goals you wanted to reach with your family.
But by 50, you may already feel like you've got it figured out. You make a good salary, you've reached many of your life goals and your kids are on their way to independence.
But there are still a lot of money truths left to learn, especially as you're approaching your retirement years. Plus, times are changing: What was a financial truism in your youth may not be the reality now.
So we asked several CFPs to reveal 10 crucial things that could affect your money once you enter your 50s, both the bright spots and the potential pitfalls. Read on to see where you might need to be better prepared.
1. The cost of long-term care insurance
While it may not be the most pleasant thing to think about, how you plan to cover potential eldercare costs like a nursing home or a home health aide should be on your radar, stat. Long-term care insurance can help pay for so-called "custodial care" services like those, which are often not covered by Medicare -- but the longer you wait to buy a policy, the more expensive it's likely to be.
"It's something to start thinking about even prior to age 50," says Chuck Roberts, CFP®, founder and C.E.O. of Financial Freedom Planners in Richmond, Virginia. "It becomes more expensive as you grow older."
According to 2012 data from the American Association for Long-Term Care Insurance, a couple taking out a policy at age 55 will pay an average of $2,466 a year, while a couple who waits until they're 60 will pay $3,381. But some health conditions -- a stroke or metastatic cancer, for example -- can make you ineligible to purchase such a policy in the first place. So it can be wise to look into a policy now, while you're in good health.
2. You're likely not going to stay an empty nester
Got grand plans to build a wet bar in your basement? Not so fast. "Unless [your child] is a shark on Wall Street, he may need some help from his parents," says Brian Mahany, CFP®, principal at Sustainable Financial Planning in Toledo, Ohio. "I am definitely seeing some parents converting their basements for their kids to live in."
Pew Research data reveals that the percentage of 25- to 34-year-olds living in "multigenerational" households rose from 11 percent in 1980 to 21.6 percent in 2010. And only 48 percent of these so-called Boomerang kids pay rent to their parents. "A great many parents feel honor-bound to help their children," says Mahany. "They're not giving their kids any kind of lease."
3. And you may still have to pay for your children's health insurance
Recent grads are having a hard time in the job market:  One study by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York estimates that 44 percent of recent grads are underemployed, meaning that they work in jobs that don't require a college degree -- which also likely means they aren't getting the perks that a good job normally brings, like insurance.
On top of that, they are graduating with a lot of debt, which tends to leave little money left to cover their bills, let alone health care. "With the student debt load kids are carrying, I have seen more instances of parents bringing kids back into the family health plan," says Mahany.
According to Healthcare.gov , children under 26 may be eligible for coverage under their parents' health insurance plan even if they're married, not living at home and attending school. Keeping your kids on your insurance may only amount to a few extra dollars a month for you, but it's still an extra cost that you'll have to budget for -- on top of the fact that they've taken over the basement.

4. You should consider making credit card debt a thing of the past
"By the time you're 50, you should be out of revolving debt, such as credit card purchases," Roberts says. That money would probably be better off helping you prepare for retirement -- plus, when you're ready to enter your golden years, you don't want a debt burden during a time when you're no longer earning a salary.
Unfortunately, debt has been steadily rising amongst people of retirement age: According to recently released  research by the National Center for Policy Analysis, in 1989 the average credit card balance for people ages 65 to 74 was $2,100, compared with $6,000 in 2010.
If paying down credit card debt is something you still need to work toward in your 50s, you can use our checklist to help you get started.

5. It's a good time to start thinking about where you want retire
Especially if you don't plan on staying in your current home, you should ask yourself where you might want to settle down, whether it's a ranch house in Tucson or a condo in Miami Beach.
That's because where you eventually relocate will likely have an impact on how you're saving for retirement now. For example, you may need to ask yourself, "Do I really have enough to take on a new mortgage 15 years down the line? Does my current savings plan take into consideration a change in cost of living? How retiree-friendly -- or not -- is the state I'm thinking of moving to?"
And get as granular as you need to, even down to the type of home. "People should [even] think about what kind of house they want to live in: Is it a single story or multiple story?" Mahany says. All those details may help you determine what you'll end up paying for housing in your dream retirement locale.
6. Your life insurance needs may change
If your children are grown and independent, and if you have enough savings to provide for a spouse in the event of your death, you may decide that you no longer need as much term-life insurance coverage as you used to have, or you may need it only for a shorter period of time.
"In [your 50s], some of the heavy living expenses that life insurance provides for families in case of a premature death are lessened at that age," Roberts says, so it may be a good time to reassess what costs you'd need insurance to cover.
That's for term life insurance. Permanent life insurance -- like a whole life policy, for example -- has an added investment component that could potentially grow in value, and which you may be able to borrow against. Whether you decide to keep that type of policy will probably depend on whether you still see value in it as an investment vehicle, says William Bregman, a CFP® who practices in New York City.
For most people, however, term life insurance may be sufficient, and you can get coverage up until age 80. Whole life insurance generally is more often used if you're concerned about estate taxes or want to leave behind a legacy for your family. Because permanent life policies are often more difficult to understand -- and usually carry higher premiums -- it's important to consult with your insurance agent or a CFP® to determine whether a permanent life policy makes sense for you.

7. You don't have to worry about Social Security collapsing
Yes, the Social Security Administration has stated that , by 2035, taxes will be able to cover only 75 percent of scheduled benefits. But older Americans have a brighter Social Security future than their younger counterparts. "Confidence that Social Security will continue to provide benefits that are at least equal to today's value is higher among workers ages 45 and older than among younger workers," according to EBRI's 2014 Retirement Confidence Survey .
Why? Because even small tweaks to Social Security [policies] could secure it well into the future, according to Sylvia Allegretto, a labor economist with the Institute for Research on Labor & Employment at University of California, Berkeley. "Before the first Social Security check went out, people called for its demise, said it would fail," says Allegretto. "Yet not one person has ever had a missed Social Security check."
RELATED: Will Social Security Be Gone Before I Retire?
8. Retirement doesn't mark the end of your career
Even when you call it quits from your current job, your knowledge and experience could still be in demand -- and help earn you some additional money in your later years.
"I've had some nice good-news conversations with a client in his 60s, who found out he could retire right now if he wanted," says Roberts. "He's in the engineering profession and could easily do some additional consulting, which could add to savings."
Indeed if you've had a long career in the knowledge sector -- accounting, medicine, law, etc. -- you could very well extend your working years with a consulting side gig. According to 2013 data from the Associated Press NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, 82 percent of Americans over the age of 50 expect to work in some capacity after retirement.
RELATED: Reboot Your Career: How to Do Your Dream Job in Retirement
9. You can contribute more to retirement than you used to
Feel a little behind in your retirement savings? The good news is that turning 50 means you're eligible to make a "catch-up contribution" of $5,500 to your 401(k) plan. That's over and above the $17,500 that the IRS allows anyone younger than 50 to contribute to a 401(k) now.
You also get to play catch-up with your IRA too -- you can contribute an extra $1,000, for a total of $6,500.
10. It's never too late to save for retirement
"At 50 you can still take great advantage of compounding interest" in your retirement portfolio, says Roberts. He notes that while you may have a different asset allocation than you would have had at, say, 30, the fact is that  compound returns  take effect no matter when you start.
In fact, many financial planners complain about clients who don't seek help mapping out their retirement until they reach their 60s. "When anyone comes to me thinking about retirement by their 50s," says Mahany, "I'm very happy."

India  Aus must take initiative to set WI house in orderWest Indies' decline has a bit to do with the ineptitude of their management.
Written by Harsha Bhogle | Posted: October 24, 2014 10:43 am
Scorn-worthy as some of their actions might be, it helps no one at all to heap further scorn on West Indies cricket administration. Nor would it help saddling them with a huge financial liability for that would only end up earning their players lesser and driving them away from West Indies cricket and towards a pay-as-you-go form of cricket. I believe it is time to hold hands and show West Indies cricket the way ahead and it is imperative that India and Australia lead this initiative.
West Indies cricket has always been very poorly managed. Their decline as a cricketing power on the field has at least a bit to do with the ineptitude of their management off it. Products go through bad times but weak managements hasten that process. We always got the feeling that West Indies cricket was sitting on a tinderbox, that a strike or a revolt was round the corner. It would be interesting to ask their players how often, in the last fifteen years, they were genuinely happy playing for the West Indies. Mistrust might be the dominant theme of their cricket in recent years. It cannot produce strong teams.
That is why I believe this is a localised flare-up, unlikely to spread to any other part of the cricket world. The implications though are wider, immediately affecting India but in the short term likely to impact South African cricket and the World Cup. Post their reduced income last year from a shortened India tour, a weak West Indies team or, in the worst case, a no-show would hit South Africa further and I won’t be surprised if someone in the cricket administration there isn’t already working on a Plan B. And while few would give the West Indies a healthy chance of winning the World Cup, they provide decent opposition in limited overs cricket. For what is essentially a small sport, losing a team isn’t an option.
While the rest of the world cannot help make the West Indies a better cricket team, they can help them manage their administration better. I believe the West Indies have a decent product and if the game does move towards shorter forms, the product they offer would become more valuable.
Similar problems
In the world of business it is not unknown to have someone from outside come in and help streamline processes and managing sport is a business like any other. Hence, my suggestion that India and Australia help out with the administration; specifically with things like handling players, valuing their abilities, sharing wealth and negotiating contracts. Australia, in recent times, have had their players and administration arrayed against each other too, both sides have been feisty and determined, a strike has been whispered about loudly enough for people to hear but inevitably a solution continued…

Ericsson s India revenue grows 56% as telcos ramp up data networksEricsson's India revenue grows 56% as telcos ramp up data networks
Our Bureau
Hans Vestberg
New Delhi, Oct 24:  
Swedish telecom equipment maker Ericsson has reported a 56 per cent growth in revenues from India, making it the highest growing region for the company worldwide. Sales in India grew to 2 billion (SEK) Swedish Kronor or Rs 1,685 crore in the third quarter of 2014 from 1.28 billion SEK in the corresponding quarter last year. India, which accounts for 4 per cent of the company’s global revenue, now ranks number four behind the US, China, and Japan.
“Since the end of last year, sales in the region has recovered, mainly driven by an increase in operator capital expenditure spending in response to greater data uptake. The year-on-year growth in support solutions is driven by OSS and BSS and TV & media,” the company said.
(OSS and BSS are software solutions that enable telecom service providers to manage their networks, their business and their customer relations.)
Ericsson’s Chief Executive Hans Vestberg said the investment climate in India continues to improve.
The performance in India, China, West Asia and Russia helped Ericsson to grow its global revenue to 57.6 billion Swedish kronor ($7.94 billion) in the quarter, up 9 per cent from 53 billion kronor a year ago.

These six countries will be doomed if oil prices continue to fall
The collapse in oil prices is already a major cause of concern for countries heavily reliant on exports of the commodity. For some, it could be a matter of avoiding a severe recession, says a report from Business Insider.

For governments in oil-exporting countries to meet their spending commitments they need oil to remain above a certain price. With oil prices under $87 a barrel, countries that rely on high oil prices, including Venezuela, Russia, and Saudi Arabia, may have a reason to be concerned.

Martha Coakley is in deep trouble in Massachusetts (again)By Jose A. DelReal October 24 Follow jdelreal

Democratic gubernatorial candidate Martha Coakley is trailing GOP rival Charlie Baker by 9 percentage points in the deep blue Bay State, raising memories of her deeply flawed 2010 Senate bid just a week and a half before Election Day.
A new Boston Globe poll released Friday suggests Baker is pulling 45 percent support to Coakley's 36 percent among likely voters, the widest margin any poll has shown for either candidate since September. A poll released last week had the two neck-to-neck, with 41 percent support each.
“There is just positive movement in every single metric we can ask around Baker,” SocialSphere executive John Della Volpe, who conducted the poll, told the Globe. “The more voters have gotten to know him, the stronger he performs.”
The Democratic establishment in Massachusetts largely threw its support behind Coakley's gubernatorial bid. Both Hillary Rodham Clinton and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) are slated to appear with Coakley this morning in Boston.
The survey of 500 likely voters in the Bay state was conducted by telephone between Oct. 19 and 22. The margin of error for the poll is plus or minus 4.4 percentage points.

Saina  Kashyap in French Open quarterfinalsUpdated: October 24, 2014 13:53 IST
Saina, Kashyap in French Open quarterfinals
IANS
badminton
Indian shuttler Parupalli Kashyap continued his giant-killing spree, stunning World No.9 Tian Houwei 21-19, 21-18 in the pre-quarters of the French Open Super Series while Saina Nehwal also advanced to the quarterfinals at the Stade Pierre de Coubertin here.
Kashyap, Commonwealth Games champion, got off to a good start, taking a 5-1 lead before Houwei fought back to equalise at 7-7. However, Kashyap snatched three consecutive points to rattle the Chinese here Thursday night.
The World No.21 Indian continued the momentum to pile further pressure on Tian and surged to a 15-8. But Tian had his moment of brilliance to take four straight points and reduced the deficit at 17-14. He later managed to equalise at 19-19 before Kashyap stepped up to seal the first game 21-19.
In the second game, Kashayap didn’t waste time to race to a 8-1 lead. With his regal cross-court smashes and sharp net-play, he handled the pressure exerted by Tian to win the game 21-18 to enter quarterfinals, where he will meet World No.7 Wang Zhenming Friday.
Kashyap defeated World No.3 Jan O Jorgensen in the quarter-final of Denmark Open last week and also upset World No.4 Kenichi Tago 21-11, 21-18 in the first round here.
In other match, the World No.6 Saina was made to work hard for a 21-19, 21-16 victory over Scotland’s World No.21 Kirsty Gilmour. The Scottish girl matched the class and quality of the 2012 Olympic bronze medallist to take a 7-5 lead in the first game before Saina, finalist here in 2012, remained strong to win the first game 21-19. In the second game, the 24-year-old India played aggressively to win the game 21-16.
In the quarterfinals, Saina faces an uphill task of going past the Chinese World No.2 Shixian Wang.
However, it was curtains for the women’s doubles pair of Jwala Gutta and Ashwini Ponnappa, who was thrashed 6-21, 8-21 in 23 minutes by the Chinese pair of Wang Xiaoli and Yu Wang.
Also going out were men’s doubles team of Pranaav Jerry Chopra and Akshay Dewalkar and men’s singles shuttler Kidambi Srikanth.
While the Chopra-Dewalkar pairing lost 15-21, 21-19, 15-21 to the Chinese Taipei pair of Lee Mu Sheng and Tsai Hsin Chia, Srikanth lost 20-22, 14-21 to Hans-Kristian Vittinghus.

Itd be crazy to do Harry Potter spin-off: DanielRadcliffeActor Daniel Radcliffe says he cannot imagine at the moment about working on 'Harry Potter' spin-off trilogy as he finished the last instalment of the original just four years back.
By: Indo-Asian News Service | Los Angeles | Posted: October 24, 2014 8:36 pm
Actor Daniel Radcliffe says he cannot imagine at the moment about working on ‘Harry Potter’ spin-off trilogy as he finished the last instalment of the original just four years back.
Radcliffe, 25, who starred in the titular role in the ‘Harry Potter’ films, said it will be too much for him to sign on the three films, based on JK Rowling’s Potter book series ‘Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them’, reported Us magazine.
“At the moment the thought of signing on to another three would be crazy to me. It’s a lot to take on again so soon after he’s finished (Potter),” Radcliffe said.
The first instalment of this new spin-off is set for a November 2016 premiere. ‘Fantastic Beasts’ is set 70 years  prior to Potter’s story.

Boko Haram may have kidnapped more girlsBy Adam Taylor October 24 Follow @mradamtaylor
People demonstrate in Abuja, Nigeria, on Oct. 14, calling on the Nigerian government to rescue girls taken from a secondary school in the Chibok region. (Olamikan Gbemiga/AP)
While it captured the attention of the world six months ago, #BringBackOurGirls  — the online campaign to free 200 Nigerian school girls kidnapped by the extremist Boko Haram group — has faded from view almost as fast as it appeared. Here's just one depressing chart illustrating this (there are many more):
There are many reasons for this, but one important one was that it was tough to keep the public interested in the protracted, messy and ultimately complicated negotiations that  the Nigerian government entered into to free the girls, who were kidnapped from their school in the northeastern town of Chibok.
For a good example of the messy nature of these negotiations, look no further than the events of the past week.
First, there was a glimmer of hope: Last Friday, Nigeria said that Boko Haram had agreed to a cease-fire , and that there could soon be talks to free some or all of the girls. “I can say with some optimism, cautious optimism, that were are moving toward a situation where we’d be able to, in the very near future, to be able to get back our girls," Nigeria’s Foreign Minister Aminu Wali told reporters.
However, less than a week later, things appeared to have soured. Not only were there reports that Boko Haram was still fighting past the cease-fire, there were also multiple reports that Boko Haram militants had pulled off another large-scale kidnapping.  On Thursday, the BBC reported  that "dozens" of women and children from two villages in Nigeria's northeastern Adamawa state had been kidnapped. Other reports put the number of those kidnapped at 60.
The reported kidnapping has led to further skepticism about the Nigerian government's talk of a cease-fire and hopes for the release of the original Chibok girls. "We are confused that hours after the so-called cease-fire agreement has been entered between the federal government and Boko Haram insurgents, our girls were abducted by the insurgents," John Kwaghe, a witness to the attack who lost three daughters, told Reuters .
Some explanation was offered Friday by officials from Chad, the neighboring nation that was mediating the talks between Boko Haram and the Nigerian government. Moussa Mahamat Dago, the No. 2 official at Chad's foreign ministry, said that he believed that while some Boko Haram factions were refusing to abide by the deal, he saw no reason to believe that the broader talks had collapsed.  "What I can say is that those that negotiated with the Nigerian government did so in good faith," Dago told Reuters . "We are waiting for the next phase, which is the release of the girls."
It means further anguish for relatives of the original girls kidnapped, who have frequently complained about a lack of communication from Nigeria's government. It may also be a worrying sign for the talks. Dago disclosed to Reuters that Boko Haram was seeking the release of its fighters imprisoned by the Nigerian state in return for the girls. But if all Boko Haram factions won't agree to the deal, what hope is there?

David Warner ton ineffective as Pakistan take crucialleadDavid Warner was on top of his game earlier in the day but Pakistan spinners ruled the roost after that. (Source: Express File Photo)
By: Associated Press | Dubai | Posted: October 24, 2014 8:39 pm | Updated: October 24, 2014 9:07 pm
Pakistan stretched its lead to a commanding 189 runs after inexperienced spinners Yasir Shah and Zulfiqar Babar dismissed Australia for 303 on the third day of the first Test on Friday.
Opening batsmen Ahmed Shehzad, 22 not out, and Azhar Ali, 16 not out, guided the home team to 38 without loss at stumps, after Pakistan pushed Australia into a tight corner with a solid 151-run, first-innings lead.
Legspinner Shah, playing his first Test, chipped in with 3-66 while left-arm spinner Babar claimed 2-81 in only his third Test as they predictably exposed Australia’s vulnerability on a subcontinent-like slow pitch.
Opening batsman David Warner thwarted the spinners for well over 4 hours in scoring 133, his third successive Test century, but Australia stumbled from a healthy 128-0 in the morning to lose 10 wickets for 175 runs.
No. 8 batsman Mitchell Johnson, with 37, boosted Australia’s total with the third best score before holing out in the deep off Rahat Ali, who took 2-55. Shah wrapped up the innings by taking the last wicket of Steve O’Keefe.
Earlier, resuming at the overnight 113-0, Australia lost four wickets before lunch and another four in the second session as Pakistan’s bowlers never allowed the batsmen to settle down.
Shah removed Steven Smith for 22 just before lunch, and clean-bowled Warner with a sharp turner in the first over after lunch.
Warner scored centuries at Cape Town in his last test against South Africa in March, but was more circumspect as the wickets started falling around him.
He faced 174 balls, hitting 11 fours and two sixes before Shah made the ball turn through the rough while bowling round the wicket.
Pakistan’s other debutant, fast bowler Imran Khan, was rewarded with his first wicket when he knocked back Brad Haddin’s offstump in his first over with the second new ball as Australia plunged to 249-6.
Mitchell Marsh’s father, Geoff, who also played international cricket for Australia, cheered from the stands when he saw his son successfully overturn a caught behind decision on 26 off fast bowler Ali, but was not lucky a run later when Babar won an lbw decision through the Decision Review System.
Peter Siddle was next to go, lbw to Mohammad Hafeez’s offspin for a four-ball duck at 267-8. Hafeez later walked off the field when he twisted his right ankle while fielding off his own bowling, and Ali opened Pakistan’s second innings.
In the absence of suspended star Saeed Ajmal, the spinners tied down the Australians, and even the free-flowing Warner in an extended first session.
Warner completed his century off 128 balls with eight fours and a six when he hit his first boundary of the day in the 18th over by driving Khan through extra cover.
Alex Doolan took 16 deliveries to score his first run before his shaky 34-ball innings for 5 ended when he continued…

What does the candy you give out for Halloween say about youBy Joe Heim October 24 Follow @JoeHeim
My favorite book about candy came out 10 years ago. “Candyfreak,” by Steve Almond — a byline in search of a subject if there ever was one — is a must-have hymnal for anyone who worships confection in all its forms. For a story a few years back, I asked Almond about what the candy you give out for Halloween says about you. He agreed to muse on this as long as I made clear that he was a “professional candyfreak, not a therapist.” Fair enough. Here’s what Almond, whose most recent book is “Against Football: One Fan’s Reluctant Manifesto,” had to say about candy brands and what they say about the people who hand them out to trick-or-treaters.

Education Dept. finds it difficult to get qualified teachers in Mysore, Hassan
The State government’s decision to appoint graduates as homeschooling volunteers has affected the future of children with special needs, as the Education Department is finding it difficult to get qualified teachers.
All these years, the department appointed persons who have passed second PU to teach homeschoolers. But last year, the government made degree a minimum qualification for appointment of volunteers.
As the authorities hardly find degree holders in rural places, many homeschoolers were being deprived of training.
Following feedback from Block Education Officers, the Deputy Director of Public Instruction had written to the government a few days ago seeking permission to allow the department to appoint those who have passed second PU.
DDPI H.R. Basappa told The Hindu here on Friday that there were no volunteers who have passed degree in most villages. A few candidates who have obtained degree go to industries or other places of work. It is highly difficult to get degree holders to work as teachers for homeschoolers, he said.
Under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, special children are given free transport and escort.
There were over 270 homeschoolers in Mysore district last year and the government had spent over Rs. 25 lakh for these children. While there was no paucity of funds to help special children, the department continues to face severe shortage of volunteers in rural areas.

Forecasting the Brazilian electionComments
By Francisco Cantú and Marco Morales October 24
“Aécio” — a poster for presidential candidate Aécio Neves in Lapa, central Rio de Janeiro, with posters for allies Luiz Paulo and Otavio Leite. (Dom Phillips for The Washington Post)
Joshua Tucker: The following is a guest post from political scientists  Francisco Cantú (University of Houston) and Marco A. Morales (Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México) as part of our continuing series of Monkey Cage Election Reports .
*****
The runoff in the presidential election in Brazil will take place this weekend between the incumbent President Dilma Roussef (PT) and challenger Aécio Neves (PSDB). According to the conventional wisdom, the runoff is supposedly too close to call. Even the endorsement of Neves by the third-place candidate on the general election, Marina Silva (PSB), did not change that.
But in an all-too-familiar scenario, the accuracy of the polls has been questioned . Even the British weekly the Economist was quick to point to the difficulty of predicting the outcome of the general election in Brazil. In their view, the few (roughly 40) surveys published during the three months of the presidential campaign and the limited number of elections (six in total) since the return of democracy in 1989, make forecasting of Brazilian elections particularly hard.
Final polls on the eve of the vote gave a slight edge to incumbent Dilma Rousseff, who is in a tight race against Aecio Neves, a 54-year-old former state governor. (Reuters)
In our view, with only four polling firms publishing their survey estimates during the campaign, we should not so much be concerned with ease of forecast but with the extent of potential biases in public poll estimates. Having fewer pollsters might raise the stakes for presenting skewed numbers, but it also provides fewer opportunities for each pollster to “check” their numbers against their peers’. But on the positive side, a healthy competition among pollsters might just be the necessary ingredient to foster good polling.
All of this becomes particularly relevant in the context of the “polling crises” that have been reported recently in various countries, including in other recent Latin American presidential elections such as Mexico in 2012, Honduras in 2013, or El Salvador, Costa Rica and Colombia in 2014.
This, then, begs the question: How did Brazilian pollsters perform in the first stage of the election? To answer that question, we deployed a statistical model that allows us to estimate the true vote intention throughout the general election, and use this information to calculate the systematic bias of each pollster. This is similar to what Simon Jackman used in his analysis of “house effects” for the 2004 Australian federal election, or what Drew Linzer used to forecast the Electoral College votes in the 2012 U.S. presidential election. In our case, we used all polls published in Brazil starting in early February of this year and ending with the last published surveys before the election. (Full details of the model can be found here .)
Brazilian electoral legislation requires pollsters to publish vote estimates for all candidates, as well as null and don’t-know votes. It also compels pollsters to publish a brief methodological summary and file it with the electoral authority. Having this information readily available allowed us to separate signal from noise and track true vote intention for each candidate throughout the campaign and its associated 95 percent credible interval. Our task is facilitated by the fact that we know the actual result of the general election.
Looking at these estimates, it would be hard to make the case that either the World Cup (June 12–July 13) or even the strident defeat of the Brazilian national team before Germany (July 8) had any noticeable effect on vote intent for Roussef. But we can say that the tragic death of PSB candidate Eduardo Campos and the entry of Marina Silva to substitute for him was a game changer in the election for a brief period.
Figure: Francisco Cantú and Marco A. Morales/The Monkey Cage; Data: Datafolha, Ibope, Vox Populi and MDA.
Since we have a very good idea of how vote intent for each candidate moved throughout the campaign, we can also compute the systematic error with which each pollster estimated each candidate throughout the campaign. Results appear in the graph below, which shows the distributions of systematic error throughout the campaign that is independent from sampling error. Distributions appearing on the positive (right) side of the graph imply that a pollster tended to overestimate a candidate throughout the campaign, and distributions on the negative (left) side imply underestimation.
Figure: Francisco Cantú and Marco A. Morales/The Monkey Cage; Data: Datafolha, Ibope, Vox Populi and MDA.
Now we can answer the initial question: How did Brazilian pollsters do in the general election campaign? In general terms, we see a mixed bag. Vote intent for Dilma Roussef seems to have been systematically overestimated, although some firms performed better than others. Curiously enough, despite the candidate change for the PSB, most pollsters seem to have estimated both Eduardo Campos and Marina Silva rather accurately, although with a very similar direction and magnitude of error. Perhaps most interesting is that most polling firms seem to have consistently underestimated Aécio Neves, who ended in second place on the general election.
Now that we know that no candidate got the necessary majority to win the election outright, we will have two very different moments that will be interesting to contrast: the general election, which was strictly multipartisan, and the runoff, which will be strictly bipartisan. It shall be interesting to see how pollsters performed when this next round is over.

In government-wide survey  feds faith in their senior leaders plummetsBy Lisa Rein October 24 Follow @Reinlwapo
Federal employees protested the government shutdown last November in Detroit. (Steve Perez/AP).
Federal employees’ satisfaction with senior leaders at their agency hit a five-year low last year, according to a survey of the workforce released Friday.
The Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey, administered annually by the Office of Personnel Management, also found a workforce that overall was more unhappy with life in government in 2013 than in 2012. Employees still believe in their agencies’ missions, feel the work they do is important and said they put in extra effort to get the job done.
But their morale continues to plummet after a year of turmoil that included furloughs and a disruptive government shutdown.
“It is encouraging to see that federal employees remained committed to their jobs regardless of the difficulties our workforce has faced in the last few years,”  OPM Director Katherine Archuleta said in a statement. Her agency ” is committed to helping all federal agencies to implement agency-specific programs that will continue to foster employee engagement and better serve the American people,”  she said.
Almost 400,000 civilian employees responded to the survey, which was conducted from April through June. Results came from 82 federal agencies. Employees were asked to weigh in on almost every feature of their work lives, from their immediate supervisors to how well their agency helps them balance work with family life.
Across the government, the percentage of positive responses to 32 of 77 questions fell last year over the previous year. And the most significant slide came in a serious of questions about employees’ views of their senior leaders.
Employees had relatively high marks for their immediate supervisors. But when it comes to trusting senior leaders to maintain “high standards of honesty and integrity,” just 49.5 percent agreed, down from 53.6 percent in 2012. Just 38 percent of employees agreed that their senior leaders inspire a high level of motivation and commitment to their jobs.
This year’s survey results provide data on individual agencies; at some big ones, poor morale appears to have dragged down averages across the government. The Department of Homeland Security, for example, has suffered from low morale and high turnover for years, particularly among senior executives.
On Wednesday, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson gave a pep talk to his employees after handing out distinguished-service awards to more than 300 of them. It was part of the department’s latest effort to tackle the problem, which Johnson has vowed to fix.
Colleen Kelley, president of the National Treasury Employees Union, said in a statement that the 2014 survey “should serve as a wakeup call for federal managers to find creative ways within existing constraints to improve morale and employee retention.”
 

Gruden educates players on rivalryBy Mike Jones October 24 Follow @mikejoneswapo
(John McDonnell/The Washington Post)
Prior to this season, Jay Gruden had knowledge of the Redskins-Cowboys rivalry, but he felt like he could learn about it, and he believed that many of his players needed a more thorough education on the series.
So, this week, he showed his players a video on the history of the rivalry and what makes Dallas Week so special to Redskins fans.
“I just think the history — a lot of guys haven’t been in this organization, myself included. This is my first year,” Gruden explained. “It’s always good to see the history of this rivalry and how important it is to the fans, the ex-players, the alumni and the organization in general. This is a huge game for a lot of people, and we’re going to make sure it’s known that this is a big rivalry for the new players and coaches.”
Monday’s meeting will represent the 107th regular season meeting between the teams, dating back to 1960. Dallas owns a 64-40-2 advantage.

The Redskins’ younger players said they came away from the viewing of the video with an improved understanding of the significance of this week’s meeting.
“Obviously, it seems like a long-lasting, strong rivalry,” rookie guard Spencer Long said. “It was kind of eye-opening how serious they do take it, and it’s kind of cool.”
Long added: “I haven’t been a Redskins player for very long, but I’m sure it means something to the players. But I know it must mean something to the fans, who have been watching for many, many years. But I’ve always disliked the Cowboys. … I just don’t like them. Seems like everybody who was a Dallas player tries to stick their noses up in the air. Same with the [Texas] Longhorns. But that’s just me because I’m from Nebraska.”
The more senior players, particularly those who have been with the team for a significant amount of time, already understood the importance of the game beyond division and win-loss implications. But they said the video served as a good reminder and source of motivation.
“It was good to let people know that this was 50-plus years in the making – Redskins-Cowboys,” said defensive end Kedric Golston, who has spent his entire eight-season career with Washington. “It’s a huge game because it’s an NFC East game, but it’s [also] a huge game for our fan base. You know that when you do things in this game, it’s going to forever echo through history. That’s what I kind of took out of it.”
Few of the recent games have carried great significance. But the matchup in December 2012, won by Washington 28-18, determined the winner of the NFC East and sent the Redskins to the postseason.
The rivalry seems to have lost its luster as a result of Washington and Dallas being at opposite ends of the spectrum for a number of years. Free agency also has diminished the animosity between teams: Washington has two former Cowboys on the roster, in defensive linemen Jason Hatcher and Stephen Bowen.
But the players still understand the sense of urgency, Golston says.
“Obviously, now, with people living in different cities, it’s a different nature,” Golston said. “But the intensity is still there because of being division rivals, and it’s still Washington and Dallas, and you feed off the energy of the fans.”

WHO sends expert team to Mali after first Ebola diagnosis in the West African countryBy Abby Ohlheiser October 24 Follow @abbyohlheiser

The World Health Organization is preparing to send a team of experts to Mali after the country announced that it had its first Ebola case, a WHO spokesperson said Friday.
Mali's health minister said Thursday night that a 2-year-old girl who recently traveled from Guinea with her grandmother was admitted to a hospital in Kayes this week and tested positive for Ebola.
On Friday, WHO spokesperson Fadéla Chaib told The Post in an e-mail that four experts would travel to Mali as soon as possible to provide help with clinical management, epidemiology, contact tracing and social mobilization. "These functions need to be deployed within the next 24 hours," Chaib said.
The group will join a team of three WHO workers already in Mali, where they have been working on outbreak preparedness in the country since Oct. 19.
According to the WHO's statement on the case, the toddler's symptoms included a 102.2-degree fever, a nose bleed, bloody stools and a cough.
Chaib said the child first saw a health-care worker in Kayes, in the western region of Mali, on Monday. The next day, she was moved to the Fousseyni Daou Hospital and admitted to the pediatric ward.
Officials took samples from the patient on Wednesday, which were analyzed at the Bamako University Lab on Thursday. (An earlier statement from Malian officials said that the patient was admitted to a hospital on Wednesday.)
The WHO said that 43 contacts of the child have been isolated, including 10 health-care workers in Kayes. Local authorities are in the process of contact tracing and training personnel at the isolation site treating the child, the organization added.
In a second statement Friday, the WHO said that, based on an initial investigation, officials believe the grandmother traveled to a funeral in southern Guinea. The grandmother then returned to Mali on Oct. 19 with the child. The pair used public transportation.
"The case history revealed that bleeding from the nose began while both were still in Guinea, meaning that the child was symptomatic during their travels through Mali," the statement said. "Multiple opportunities for exposure occurred when the child was visibly symptomatic."
WHO officials are "seeking confirmation of media reports that the funeral was for the child’s mother, who is said to have shown Ebola-like symptoms before her death."
The number of people being monitored for symptoms of Ebola in the U.S. is growing. Here's how the virus spreads and how contact tracing works to stop outbreaks. (Gillian Brockell/The Washington Post)
Mali is now the sixth West African country to record an Ebola case during the deadliest outbreak in history . The epidemic, whose death toll is rapidly approaching 5,000, has been centered in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia; Nigeria and Senegal have also recorded cases.
Just hours before Malian health officials announced the diagnosis, WHO assistant director general Keiji Fukuda said to reporters that the organization had "reasonable confidence right now that we are not seeing widespread transmission of Ebola into the neighboring countries," including Mali, Guinea Bissau and the Ivory Coast.
However, WHO hadn't ruled out the possibility of an Ebola case in Mali, as it was one of 15 countries identified as a "priority" by the WHO as the outbreak spread -- due in part to its proximity to the most severely affected regions. That's why, Chaib said, there was already a small WHO team in Mali before the first case was identified.

The Kayes region of Mali, where the first case was diagnosed, borders Guinea, one of three countries hardest hit by the Ebola epidemic. Guinea alone has recorded 904 Ebola deaths and 1,540 total cases of the disease, according to the latest figures available from the WHO .
In all, there are 4,877 confirmed deaths and 9,936 confirmed, probable and suspected cases of Ebola in seven countries: Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Spain, the United States, Nigeria and Senegal.
Two of those countries are now considered Ebola-free: Nigeria and Senegal. Senegal, which also neighbors Mali, had a single case of Ebola, also imported from Guinea.
Also on Friday, the WHO announced that "several hundred thousand" doses of an experimental Ebola vaccine will be available by the first half of 2015.

Socialist Party Pushing $20 Minimum Wage Defends $13-An-Hour Job Listingreddit
The Freedom Socialist Party has right - wing bloggers seeing red over a job listing that paid less than the group advocates for a minimum wage.
Earlier this month, the nonprofit posted listings on Craigslist and Indeed to advertise an opening for a part-time web designer. It offered to pay $13 an hour or more, depending on the designer's experience. That's well below the $20 minimum wage the party pushes for in its platform , and lower than the $15 wage it helped pass this year in Seattle. Right-leaning sites promptly seized on what they saw as hypocrisy.
But Doug Barnes, the party's national secretary, told The Huffington Post on Saturday that the group relies heavily on donations from low-wage workers and could not afford to pay much to an inexperienced designer.
"We're practicing what we're preaching in terms of continuing to fight for the minimum wage," Barnes said, making his first public comment on the controversy. "But we can't pay a lot more than $13."
He said the party's revenues would increase if the minimum wage were raised to $20 -- and he'd even prefer $22, at least in Seattle. The city will begin phasing in a $15 minimum wage in April.
"Our donor base would all be affected, and the low-wage workers who support us with $5 to $6 a month would be able to give more," he said. "That would affect our ability to pay higher wages as well."
But Barnes said he removed the $13 starting wage from the Craigslist ad on Friday in response to the online criticism.
"The right-wing attack is very hypocritical," he said. "These are the same people who fought against the minimum wage and support companies like Walmart."
He said the Freedom Socialist Party, which was formed in 1966 as a revolutionary feminist breakaway group from the United States Socialist Workers Party, does not accept donations from corporations.

India firmly on the radar for HyundaiIndia firmly on the radar for Hyundai
Murali Gopalan
Hot seller The i20 elite has caught the fancy of the market and is a heavy contributor to Hyundai's sales.
The company clocked domestic sales of 4.44 lakh units for January-September
It was at the 1998 Delhi Auto Expo when Hyundai first made known its India intent with the unveiling of the Santro hatchback. This was the year when all eyes at Pragati Maidan were on the Tata Indica.
It was also the time when Suzuki Motor Corporation and its partner, the Indian Government, were locked in a bitter war-of-words.
There was a sense of enormous excitement coupled with fierce nationalism. This was thanks primarily to Tata Motors which was keen to show that India could also make its own car even while it had thrown open its gates to multinationals. The Indica was naturally the cynosure of all eyes at the Expo but nobody could ignore Hyundai either which, apart from the Santro, also had the Accent on display.
The numbers
Many Expos have come and gone at Pragati Maidan since then, but the Korean automaker is perhaps in the most exciting phase of its India tenure. Its recent launches comprising the Grand i10, Xcent and Elite i20 have caught the fancy of the market and are clocking over 20,000 units between them each month.
The entry model, Eon, has settled to a routine of nearly 7,000 units while the old warhorse, Santro, comfortably does around 4,000 cars.
On Thursday, Hyundai declared its third quarter results in Seoul where India clocked sales of 4.44 lakh units for the January-September period.
The i10 was the largest selling model with 2.12 lakh units followed by the i20 with 82,000 and the Eon with 74,000 units. Other models including the Santro, Xcent etc chipped in with the balance 76,000 units.
Sure, Maruti continues to be the market leader with monthly numbers averaging over one lakh units thanks to a host of successful models such as the Alto, Wagon R, Swift, Dzire and the more recent Celerio. It is equally true that the company has faced no threat to its numero uno status for many years now.
Yet, what is interesting about Hyundai is a new sense of energy and determination within its system. The new products (i10, Xcent and i20) have been loaded with features which have caught the attention of the market in a big way. “In terms of styling and design, Hyundai is making a strong statement which young buyers are finding incredibly hard to resist,” a top auto executive says.
Will this be enough to upset the Maruti applecart during the course of this decade?
Very unlikely given that the Japanese automaker is not being remotely complacent even for a minute.
Aware that it is still associated with the small car imagery, Maruti has been working on ideas like AMT (automated manual transmission) on its Celerio and more recently, the Alto. The Ciaz will show if the company can make a strong mark for itself in the sedan segment.
Hyundai also has competition from Honda which has staged a strong comeback with the Amaze, new City and the Mobilio multipurpose vehicle.
“The Xcent has made a bigger impact than the Amaze and Hyundai will now have to replicate this with the Verna against the City,” an industry observer says.
Why is Hyundai making news now when it has already proved that it is Maruti’s closest rival?
After hitting paydirt with the Santro and Accent in the late-1990s, the Getz and Elantra did not quite set the market afire.
And even as numbers continued steadily, there was really no excitement on the product front.
Bad timing
As an entry-level option, the Eon was an interesting product from the Hyderabad R&D centre but was unfortunate to be launched when the country was in the mist of a diesel buying craze three years ago. With petrol back in favour now, the car has made up lost ground.
Global conundrum
Unlike Suzuki which, apart from Japan, has India and ASEAN as its key growth regions, Hyundai is well and truly a global company with a presence in the US, Europe, China and BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India and China) regions. In the process, it becomes doubly difficult for the company to focus exclusively on countries such as India when other parts of the world, especially the West, are far more profitable markets.
This is a challenge that Toyota also faces except that Hyundai has rediscovered its mojo a lot faster in India.
Going forward, the company will launch a compact SUV here while building the base for exports to West Asia and Asia-Pacific.
And even while it focuses on important global projects such as the electric vehicle (planned with Daimler) which debuts in Europe next year, Hyundai will now step up the gas in a big way in India.

The other Italian stallionItalian racer: Benelli, like Moto Guzzi and Ducati, invested heavily into competition biking, including MotoGP. SHUTTERSTOCK
One of the oldest European motorcycle manufacturers comes with a legacy of competition racing
It just so happens that some of the biggest names in motorcycling have had their beginnings in other things – Ducati’s founders began with radio components and Suzuki saw its origins in a loom company. MV Agusta was the offshoot of an aviation company, and the man behind KTM first dabbled with metal works.
There are also some that started out as arms producers, such as BSA and Royal Enfield, and companies such as Husqvarna and Aprilia started off as bicycle makers. But then there are names that have always dived straight into serious motorcycling, and more often than not, these names have achieved cult status around the world.
While Norton and Triumph may be the most recognised British motorcycle brands of the yesteryears (the latter still thrives though) and responsible for shaping modern motorcycling in a big way, Italian manufacturers Ducati, Moto Guzzi and Benelli can be held responsible for making competition motorcycling big in Europe. Benelli was mostly a family affair – ‘Benelli Garage,’ as it was called in the beginning, was jointly operated by six Benelli brothers from 1911. The Garage mostly worked with repairing and manufacturing motorcycle parts, but it took just about ten years of garage-work for the brothers to come up with their own motorcycle, 'Velomotore', in 1921. It was a 75cc single cylinder that was made to fit on a bicycle frame.
But the first ‘real’ motorcycle to roll out of the Benelli Garage was the Benelli 175, the number denoting the engine’s capacity in cubic centimetres. Up to the beginning of WWII, Benelli made a lot of motorcycles, from 175cc to 500cc, mostly Turismo and Sport models. Benelli’s rich competition history began with one of the 6 Benelli brothers, Antonio, or ‘Tonino’ (also referrerd to as ‘the Terrible’). Between 1927 and 1969, with a handful of Italian and international riders, Benelli clinched more than 1000 titles in different Italian and European championships.
Right after the war, like many European automobile companies, Benelli found success with lightweight, economical and inexpensive machines that the working man could afford to own. Apart from the lightweights, Benelli also produced the Tornado, a 650cc twin-cylinder bike, known well for its massive power delivery.
But the onslaught of Japanese motorcycle companies in Europe caused many local manufacturers to shut shop, and Benelli was affected by the big-engined Hondas the same way as Triumph or Nortons. Benelli did fight back, and created the Sei, with a massive 6-cylinder, 750cc engine (which later evolved into a 900cc).
 The company made motorcycles up to the late 80s, but never really got the numbers as the other surviving European motorcycle brands. It was only in 2001 that the Benelli brand was truly reincarnated with the Tornado 899cc Limited Edition and subsequently the Tornado Naked Tre (TNT) and Tre-K. The company now offers in-line three or four cylinder motorbikes from 600 to 1131cc, including the 155bhp plus TNT1130R.

We see stronger revenue growth during the second half: Wipro CEOTweet
TK Kurien
Wipro, the country’s third-largest software services exporter, posted a revenue growth that matched the lower end of its guidance in the second quarter of this fiscal, making it the weakest performer among its peers Infosys, TCS and HCL Tech. In an attempt to bolster its performance, Wipro is trying to become more aggressive in the marketplace. In an interaction with BusinessLine, CEO TK Kurien said that the second half of FY 2015 would see better growth for the company. Excerpts:
The September quarter tends to be strong for IT players. Why has yours been weak?
For us, the strongest quarters are really Q3 and Q4, which is how it has been historically. In constant currency, we have delivered 3 per cent growth in revenue, which is not bad. Unfortunately, we got hit more because of currency than others. While others had around a 0.6 percentage point hit, we were hit by 1.2 percentage points. In the third quarter, we expect to do much better, and we have guided for 2-4 per cent revenue growth. I don’t see too many negative surprises from the currency part in the October-December period. There has been subdued growth due to our top clients in the banking and energy spaces. However, both banking and energy will bounce back in the next quarter.
Global infrastructure services have been strong for you for some time now. Where is the demand coming from?
A lot of demand is coming from transformational deals. These include data centre transformation, end-user computing transformation and network transformation deals.
You talked about execution to ensure growth. Have you augmented your hunting team, which looks for new deals?
Execution involves the entire company and many other activities. We have hired about 10-12 people in the hunting team, which now stands at 162 people, this quarter.
In which segments would you like to expand Wipro’s footprint?
The biggest challenge for us is to get accounts in some industry verticals where we don’t have a play at all. For instance, we are a two-bit player in insurance, where there are a lot of application development and maintenance deals. We need to break into it. Insurance and auto are sectors where we would like to become a much larger player. Our biggest task is to work on making sure our portfolio is balanced effectively.
How would you describe your leadership style?
My leadership style is not to get rid of people but to take people along. As the world changes outside, how quickly can the internal organisation change to deal with the external stimuli — that’s my role as a CEO. I have 2-3 critical priorities that can change the shape of the organisation. I want everybody to focus on those and am maniacal about getting those priorities in place. The rest of the time I give people plenty of flexibility to operate and do what they want.
The biggest issue large organisations have is leadership. Leadership is about vision, courage and execution. Most leaders who succeed have plenty of courage. My biggest contribution is to offer my people courage, because if you believe in something you should go ahead and do it without seeking permission to do it. Large swathes of management are extremely permission driven. I joke within the company and say, if you do something wrong, at worst, we will fire you not shoot or kill you.
The ability to take risks is what a lot of leaders don’t necessarily understand. I believe if you don’t take a risk and don’t fail, you will never succeed. I have failed hundreds of times in my life, but every time I have failed I have learnt. The only thing is not to make the same mistake twice — that is stupidity.

Honda ups ante to beat Bajaj in bike salesUpdated: October 23, 2014 23:44 IST
Honda ups ante to beat Bajaj in bike sales
G. Balachandar
company information
Even as Bajaj Auto is revamping its plans with new launches, Honda has been steadily increasing its bike volumes to reduce the sales gap with the former.
With robust growth in its motorcycle sales over the past few months, Honda threatens to dislodge Bajaj, which has been struggling with falling sales, from its Number Two position by volumes in the bike market.
Even as Bajaj Auto is revamping its plans with new launches, Honda has been steadily increasing its bike volumes to reduce the sales gap with the former.
Aided by new launches and expansion of dealerships, Honda posted 21 per cent rise in its total bike sales at 9.07 lakh units during the first-half of this fiscal, while Bajaj saw its bike volumes fall by 12 per cent at 9.52 lakh units. So, Bajaj’s sales are higher by just 45,000 units than Honda’s as of September 30, 2014. But, in a year-ago period, Baja’s bike sales were higher by 3.27 lakh units.
In the 110cc-and-below segment, Honda increased its volumes to about three lakh units from 2.55 lakh units a year-ago, while Bajaj has seen a drop to 4.58 lakh units from 5.75 units.
In the above-110cc-to-125cc segment, Honda surpassed the sales of Hero with 31 per cent rise at 4.60 lakh units and became leader in the category. Bajaj saw a significant drop in sales to 82,269 units from 1.57 lakh units a year ago.
The festive season has also brought cheer to Honda to support its dream ride in two wheeler sales. It has claimed to achieved highest ever Dhanteras sales of 1.65 lakh units when compared to 78,000 units last year. It also saw a strong rise in sales of its dream series bikes (comprise Dream Yuga, Dream Neo and CD 110 Dream) with sales of 45,000 units.
With current growth rate, Honda may surpass the sales of Bajaj in the next few months and become the Number Two player in bike segment. Honda is already a leader in scooter segment with about 55 per cent share. Hero is the leader in bike segment with a wide margin.
With festive boost, Bajaj sold more bikes than Honda in September this year though its monthly sales were lower than volumes of September 2013.

The #1 Dumb Thing Businesses Do to Hurt Themselvesreddit
If you really want to hurt your business, ignore what your customers want. Let me give you a few examples of this stupid business trick in action.
If you're a seafood fan like me, chances are you've eaten at Red Lobster. A couple years ago, I noticed the quality of service sharply decreased. It turns out, in their never-ending quest to cut costs, the owners eliminated all busboy positions and demoted many of the servers. In addition to bussing their own tables, servers now had to take on four tables at a time instead of three. The leadership did so after convincing themselves, somehow, that both the wait staff and the customers approved. Actually, they didn't. People got sick of waiting for clean tables and meals, and started voting with their feet. Less than a year later, Red Lobster rescinded the policy, and business has picked up since.
Downsizing can be deadly, and not simply because it overworks the surviving employees, but because it can lower your ability to respond to customer needs. You may have read my previous discussions of Circuit City's suicidal decision to save money by replacing commission-based sales personnel with minimum-wage newbies who didn't know the difference between a USB port and an Ethernet plug.  People stopped buying, and Circuit City died an ignominious death. Leadership forgot that while labor is your biggest expense, your employees are your greatest asset.
Borders couldn't adapt to the e-book phenomenon customers were demanding, whereas Barnes and Noble embraced it wholeheartedly. Borders eventually went the way of the buggy-whip makers who thought horseless carriages were a passing fad. Speaking of passing fads, wasn't that what the old Bulletin Board Services called the Internet? When was the last time you dialed into a BSB? (Do you even remember them at all?)
Netflix also ignored customer desires to their peril. They started out by mailing DVDs to subscribers, then added online video streaming. Eventually, Netflix decided to split the services into different two companies, despite the outcry against it. They stuck to their guns, making ready to spin off the DVD mailing as Quickster. They even hiked their fees...then, just as Quickster was almost a reality, they killed it. Those who had gotten used to the idea were outraged again. Once the brouhaha calmed down, Netflix finally stopped reloading the gun they kept shooting themselves in the foot with.
Bottom line: keep your ear to the ground, do what your customers love, and make changes that follow their desires.

The Bottom Line on Climate Change Costsreddit
The recent  report published by the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate , an organization aimed at helping the world's societies to combat the effects of climate change, suggests that the costs of combating climate change are considerably lower than widespread opinion has suggested. This new analysis is considered to be a real game changer in how we perceive and act on remedies for polluting the planet.
The analysis cuts to the heart of climate deniers contentious arguments that an overhaul of the fossil fuel industry will cream our economy. Not so.
The study tells us that between 2015 and 2030, nations are expected to invest roughly $90 trillion in urban, land-use and energy infrastructure. The report suggests that implementing the fixes necessary to transition to entirely sustainable sources of energy would amount to  4 trillion.  So, this amounts to 5% increase of the total amount that is estimated to be spent on new power plants, transit systems, and other infrastructure over the same period. While economically feasible, the report's recommended changes are expected to face a tough political reception.
The report outlines the plunging costs of renewable energy and point to solar technology costs which have been cut in half since 2010. Meanwhile, it paints the compelling argument, known for quite some time that limiting urban sprawl and deforestation are essential steps in combating climate change.
It's going to require the cooperation of countries to cease subsidies for fossil fuels and transition to renewable sources of energy alongside the adoption of a wide variety of initiatives to encourage--for instance-- more efficient land use and fighting forest fires.  Add to this, consistent and credible government policies  signals, which  are essential for businesses and investors to create jobs, growth and spur innovation.
Additional specifics deal with the implementation of a carbon tax and enabling the growth of alternative energies.  An investment is required of public infrastructure and is key to moving forward successfully. Another aspect is increasing the encouragement of low carbon innovators thru patents, public spending, and alternative energy research and production.
Action suggested by the report will require long years of hard work and an optimistic vision for  the future, but its authors argue that these practices currently have real world proof in major metropolitan centers all over the world. So, a greener tomorrow is just on the horizon, but it's all dependent on how willing we are to embrace it now.

Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) have released former off-spinner Saqlain Mushtaq after completion of a one-month contract but said that suspended off-spinner Saeed Ajmal will continue his remedial work on his bowling action.
A PCB press release said that the PCB will decide whether to hire Saqlain again after an evaluation of Ajmal’s remodelled bowling action at a bio-tech laboratory in the United Kingdom by November 10.
“Following this evaluation the cricket committee will decide whether or not to acquire the services of Saqlain Mushtaq afresh,” the release said.
Sources said the PCB decided to release Saqlain after the former Pakistan spinner spent the last one month working on correcting Ajmal’s bowling action at the National Cricket Academy.
“Basically Saqlain has got some other offers including one from the West Indies Cricket Board so obviously he wanted to be clear about his immediate future,” a well informed source in the board said.
He said that Saqlain would now return to England on Friday but Ajmal would continue his remedial work at the NCA under supervision of the committee of experts.
“If required Ajmal might be sent to England in early November so that Saqlain can be with him before his evaluation at the lab in Cardiff,” the source said.
The PCB paid a handsome amount of one million rupees plus other perks to Saqlain for his one month contract.

After video controversy  senior Marine is now helping Chicago youthBy Dan Lamothe October 24 Follow @danlamothe
Now-retired Marine Sgt. Maj. Paul Archie is shown here in 2007 while receiving a Bronze Star with V medal for heroism while deployed in Iraq. He retired amid controversy earlier this year after getting in an altercation that was depicted in a viral video, and says he has moved on with life. (Photo by Lance Cpl. Aaron Rooks/ Marine Corps)
Sgt. Maj. Paul Archie was a well-respected senior member of the Marine Corps when he came across something at the gates of Parris Island, S.C., that infuriated him: a man protesting while wearing the iconic “campaign cover” hat meant for drill instructors who are on base training future Marines.
The ensuing June 5 incident escalated quickly — and was captured in a video that went viral online. It showed Archie, wearing his desert tan utility uniform, going toe-to-toe with Ethan Arguello, a former drill instructor who was protesting the controversial U.S. decision to exchange five Taliban leaders for Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who went missing in Afghanistan in 2009.
No punches were exchanged, but Archie could be seen getting close enough to Arguello to knock the cover off his head. Archie snatched it as it fell, and then stormed back to his black Jeep Sahara and drove away.
“You’re about to get locked up!” Arguello yelled.
As noted in this Checkpoint post at the time , Archie resigned a short time afterward and was charged with assault. Marines and veterans, meanwhile, debated whether Archie was wrong for confronting Arguello, and whether Arguello was violating the spirit of Marine Corps tradition by wearing the campaign cover out of uniform.
There’s more to the story, however. Archie, in his first comments since the controversy, said Thursday that he was asked to retire by the senior enlisted member of the Marine Corps within days of the incident.
Sgt. Maj. Paul Archie is shown in this Marine Corps photograph in February 2014, after taking over as the sergeant major at Parris Island, S.C.
He declined to use his name, but he is Sgt. Maj. Mike Barrett. Archie added that he did not feel like his chain of command at Parris Island was inclined to keep him, either.
“He told me, ‘Paul you know you were wrong. You need to step down and resign before your chain of command needs to decide,’ ” Archie said of Barrett’s direction. “I kind of figured that was coming. I’d been let down before, but this time I was really let down.”
Barrett could not be reached for comment. His spokesman, Gunnery Sgt. Chanin Nuntavong, said the contents of the conversation between the two sergeants major should stay between them, but he confirmed they spoke at the time of the video.
Brig. Gen. Lori Reynolds, then the commanding general at Parris Island, addressed the issue in an interview with the Island Packet newspaper in June. She said that Archie was a great Marine worthy of emulation by others, but that his leaving was “about a very high standard, and that’s what we’re looking for from all our Marines.”
Archie, who served more than 25 years and earned a Bronze Star with V for heroism in Iraq, has moved on. The charges against him were dropped earlier this month, and he has moved to Chicago with his family to take a job as a sergeant major with the Marine Leadership Academy , a public high school that has a military curriculum and a strong ROTC program.
“It’s a motivating environment, and you see kids grow daily,” Archie said. “I loved my time in the Marine Corps, but the writing was definitely on the wall that it was time for me to move on.”
Archie said that “it was a fall from a high-ranking billet” and that he wanted to serve a full 30 years before retiring, but that he won’t look back. He realizes he could have diffused the situation by stepping away when it escalated, he said, but felt that Arguello needed to be corrected.
“When I saw his temper going up, hindsight being 20-20, I should have just got in the vehicle and drove away before it just kept escalating,” he said. “That’s the only thing I would say. But I still stand behind, ‘I was doing something for the Marine Corps and the institution.’ I wasn’t doing something for my sole gratification. It was all about the Marine Corps, and what it stands for. I regret not cutting the conversation shorter, but I do not regret what I did.”

Power has been restored to most of IT units at Rushikonda hills
Visakhapatnam, Oct. 24:  
The IT sector in Visakhapatnam like the other sectors has suffered considerable damage due to Hudhud cyclone, but there is no need for any apprehensions on the long-term prospects and the State Government will extend full support to it in all forms, according to IT Minister P. Raghunadhra Reddy.
He said here on Friday that power had been restored to the IT units at Rushikonda hills and all the pending incentives and subsidies to the units would be quickly given. "We will also make efforts to get the insurance claims of the companies cleared as quickly as possible. We are in touch with the insurance companies," he said.
He said the IT signature tower would be built on the Rushikonda hill, as planned, and all efforts would be made to attract investments into the sector. "We invited several IT companies earlier this month and nearly 400 of them responded. Several of them are positive about setting up units and starting operations here. There is no blow to the brand image of Visakhapatnam as an IT destination," he said.
According to the IT entrepreneurs, power was restored to the units on the Rushikonda hills only on Deepavali night and still some units were waiting for it. B. Gopi, of the Sankhya Technologies, said power had been restored to his unit only on Thursday night. "We have resumed operations on a small scale on Friday. Still, some of the IT units are waiting for power restoration," he said.
He said his company had put up a claim for Rs 77 lakh and so far two surveys had been conducted and yet the damage had not been accurately assessed. "We are waiting for another qualified surveyor to arrive at the spot and make a final assessment. In spite of the Chief Minister's clear directive that the process should be expedited and multiple surveys avoided, it has not yet resulted in any concrete action," he complained.
He wanted the insurance companies to understand the gravity of the situation and respond quickly.

Latinos could affect crucial races by not showing upBy Max Ehrenfreund October 24 Follow @MaxEhrenfreund
Anti-deportation protesters chant in front of the White House on Aug. 28, 2014. (Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)
With the exception of Colorado, there aren't that many Latinos living in states with competitive Senate races -- and there are even fewer Latinos living in House districts controlled by Republicans.In a fascinating thought experiment earlier this week,  Nate Cohn  determined that Republicans could hold a majority in the House without a single Hispanic vote.
The Hispanic vote does not appear to be damaging congressional Republican candidates all that much. On the contrary, those voters might be hurting Democrats, who desperately need their enthusiasm and support in some races.
Hispanic voters are frustrated with continued deportations and with what they see as the Democratic Party's failure on immigration reform. Only a narrow majority of Latinos say they approve of the job President Obama is doing, according to Gallup . His approval ratings among Latinos have fallen by 20 points since his reelection in 2012.
Much of the election analysis has been focused on control of the Senate, where Hispanics do have less influence over the outcome. But this year's gubernatorial races are arguably more consequential . In Kansas, for example, Gov. Sam Brownback's tax cuts have left the state with an expanding budget shortfall , but  haven't obviously improved the economy .
In a dead heat like Colorado's gubernatorial race, Latino support is crucial for Democrats. A recent Quinnipiac poll put Gov. John Hickenlooper just one point ahead of his Republican opponent, former Rep. Bob Beauprez. Hispanics constitute fully 14 percent of eligible voters, so it's easy to see how a small change in turnout could sway the election. (About one in three eligible Hispanic voters have voted in past midterm elections, according to the Pew Research Center .)
Last month, one Latino advocacy group threatened to boycott the election , saying a program to issue driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants had been underfunded. All the same, Hickenlooper's campaign has had success in reaching out aggressively to the community, said Matt Barreto of Latino Decisions, a polling firm.
In Kansas, eligible Hispanic voters are only about 6 percent of the electorate, but the gubernatorial race might even closer.  The polls are split on whether Brownback will survive a challenge from Paul Davis, a state legislator.
Even in some crucial Senate races, Latinos could be influential, but by not showing up at the polls. Take Sen. Kay Hagan (D-N.C.), whom the advocacy organization Presente Action targeted in a radio spot . Hagan voted with Republicans in a filibuster of the Dream Act in 2010, and more recently, sided with Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) in a failed procedural vote supporting deportations.
Barreto argues that Hagan's decisions on immigration won’t deliver the kind of swing voters she may have been targeting. Those voters are moderate on immigration anyway, he said. Now, less than half of Latinos are planning on voting for Hagan, according to his firm's research -- despite months of hard work by Democratic organizers.
Well-informed Latinos are understandably frustrated with Hagan and other Democrats, Barreto said. If they don't vote, he added, "it’s because they’re paying attention." Most models give Hagan a comfortable, if narrow, lead , and Latinos are only about 3 percent of eligible voters in North Carolina, so she may well survive without the ardent support of the Hispanic community.
The Latino vote might not be decisive in North Carolina or in any other state, the way it could be in 2020, when as many as 25 million more Hispanics  will have joined the electorate.

The physician, Craig Spencer, had recently returned from Guinea, where he was treating victims of the disease. Authorities have quarantined his fiancée and two friends, but do not believe that he was contagious before he was isolated with a fever on Thursday. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are conducting a second test to verify an initial positive result. Marc Santora in  The New York Times .

Two vaccines could be ready for large-scale trials early next year, but ethical and practical questions remain. At this point, immunization could be the best hope of controlling the epidemic in West Africa, but GlaxoSmithKline's vaccine has to be stored at -112 degrees Fahrenheit. And while early trials don't show any negative side effects, it isn't clear yet whether it can really prevent infection, and organizing a large-scale trial in a place like Liberia right now would be difficult. Brady Dennis in  The Washington Post .
One vaccine sat on the shelf for a decade after highly successful testing in monkeys. Fully developing and testing a vaccine in humans typically costs more than $1 billion. "There's never been a big market for Ebola vaccines," said one of the researchers. "So big pharma, who are they going to sell it to?" Denise Grady in The New York Times . 
In one of Liberia's poorest slums, neighbors are coming together to fight the disease. Shoes and socks, plastic bags for gloves, and buckets of bleach are volunteers' weapons against Ebola. The scene in the West Point district of Monrovia has changed from a few weeks ago, when residents thought the disease was a hoax and flouted quarantines. Heidi Vogt in  The Wall Street Journal .
GERSON: We are in collective denial about the horrific danger posed by Ebola in West Africa. As many as 10,000 new cases a week are expected by December, the global community hasn't begun to ask the most important questions: "Is Ebola containable?

They can't repeal Obamacare while the president is still in office, but they aim to weaken the employer mandate. Steven Mufson in The Washington Post .
They're attacking Democrats for cutting Social Security, which could complicate entitlement reform.

Rejoinder to Sherif Girgis on sex discrimination and same-sex marriageBy Ilya Somin October 24
Political theorist Sherif Girgis has written a thoughtful response to my critique of his argument that laws banning same-sex marriage should not be subject to the same heightened scrutiny as other legislation that discriminates on the basis of gender. The response helpfully clarifies Girgis’ position, but fails to fix its shortcomings.
I. Sexism and the motivation for excluding same-sex couples from the institution of marriage
Early in his response, Girgis disclaims reliance on the common argument that laws banning same-sex marriage are different from laws banning interracial marriage because, while the latter are motivated by racism, the former are not motivated by a desire to promote “male supremacy.” I appreciate the clarification and am sorry if I misinterpreted his earlier reference to this argument as an endorsement of it. But if supposed lack of sexist motives does not distinguish laws banning same-sex marriage from other forms of gender discrimination, this weakens the case for exempting them from heightened judicial scrutiny.
Moreover, as I noted in my earlier post, the issue of motive cuts against Girgis’ position in another way: sexism was historically one of the reasons for excluding same-sex relationships from marriage recognition in the first place. Same-sex relationships were excluded from marriage and often subjected to persecution in large part because their participants did not conform to traditional sex roles and were seen as a potential threat to male dominance. The presence this motive does not by itself prove that discriminatory marriage laws should be struck down by courts. It also does not mean that everyone opposed to same-sex marriage is automatically a sexist. But it further undermines the case for subjecting legislation banning same-sex marriage to a lower standard of review than other sex-discriminatory laws. In modern jurisprudence, even laws that are formally gender-neutral or race-neutral are subjected to heightened scrutiny if they were enacted in large part out of racist sexist motives . This principle applies with even greater force to laws that are not gender-neutral at all, because, as Girgis himself puts it , they “involve.. treating sex as Virginia’s ban [on interracial marriage] in Loving had treated race.”
II. Is there a unique “conceptual” connection between between opposite-sex marriage and reproduction? Does it matter if there is?
Girgis also tries to clarify his central argument for exempting laws banning same-sex marriage from heightened scrutiny, its connection to reproduction:
When a policy’s form triggers extra scrutiny, again, judges pivot to examining its justifications: the state’s reasons for thinking that the classification is sufficiently linked to a legitimate interest….
But my point was that in the case of a law classifying by sexual composition—by male-female pairing—the law’s form itself already points to its own link to the common good, apart from mere social conventions, or merely contingent data about men and women. So the justification of this classification begins to appear at the first, “formal” stage of analysis….
neither (a) reproduction nor (b) its social value nor (c) its link to the male-female pairing is just a social construct….
Likewise, my argument isn’t undermined by Somin’s objection that “adoption and artificial insemination” make “same-sex marriage . . . also closely connected to reproduction.” Neither adoption nor reproductive technology weakens the conceptual link tying male-female union to reproduction. So they do not justify a judicial presumption against classifications based on the male-female pairing. Even finding ways to make children out of two ova or two sperm cells wouldn’t cut that link. It would only mean that, while male-female union has a conceptual link to reproduction, other groupings could have a contingent, technologically enabled link. The latter (unlike the male-female) link would require inquiry into empirical data; and it wouldn’t be limited to same- or opposite-sex couples, but any group of adults deciding to produce and rear children.
None of this provides a good reason to treat laws banning same-sex marriage differently from other laws that discriminate on the basis of gender. At the risk of belaboring the obvious, it is important to emphasize that an opposite-sex relationship is neither necessary nor sufficient for reproduction to occur. Many opposite-sex couples are unwilling or unable to reproduce by standard biological means (e.g.- because of age or sterility). Conversely, reproduction and child-raising can and do occur in same-sex relationships. Girgis makes much of the fact that “male and female are defined with respect to the physical potential for… reproduction.” But potential for reproduction is not the same thing as reproduction itself. The connection between potential and actuality is, in Girgis’ terms, a merely “contingent” one.
Moreover, legal status of marriage is not and never has been limited to those couples who are willing and able to engage in conventional biological reproduction. There is of course a high correlation between marriage and biological reproduction. But that connection, although strong and important, is also “social” or “contingent” rather than “conceptual.” Or, if it can be considered conceptual despite the fact that it is not an inevitable link, then the same goes for the connection between same-sex marriage and reproduction.
It is also worth noting that, as a social good, reproduction cannot be separated from child-raising. The latter is the main purpose of the former. And even if same-sex relationships had no direct connection to reproduction whatsoever, they still clearly can and do facilitate child-raising. Including them in the institution of marriage enhances same-sex couples’ ability to raise children in a variety of ways .
Finally, even if there was a conceptual connection between opposite-sex marriage and reproduction in some strong sense of the term that does not apply to same-sex couples, this still would not justify exempting laws excluding the latter from heightened judicial scrutiny. The whole point of heightened scrutiny is to ensure that the gender classification in question really is necessary to advance the interest in question, and that there is not a comparably effective gender-neutral way of achieving the same goal. The need to conduct that inquiry is not obviated by the existence of a “conceptual” connection. In this case, the ability of opposite-sex marriage to facilitate reproduction and child-raising is in no way impaired by extending marriage rights to same-sex couples. In states where same-sex marriage exists, opposite-sex couples can still reproduce and raise children, and the institution of marriage can still facilitate those activities.

Assam Muslims for speedy  unbiased probe into jihadiactivitiesPrint
Written by Samudra Gupta Kashyap | Guwahati | Posted: October 24, 2014 8:51 pm
With the Assam Police widening its net to apprehend persons having links to jihadi groups including the Jama’atul Mujahideen Bangladesh, a group of leading Muslim citizens of Assam today urged the government to carry out speedy but unbiased investigations into such activities in the state. It also asked the government to mete out stringent punishment to those found guilty.
“The Muslims of Assam do not support any kind of terrorist activity and strongly condemns any kind of terrorist activity carried out in the name of jihad,” a resolution adopted in a meeting of leading Muslim citizens of the state said here today. The group also called upon all right-thinking Muslims and such organizations to intensify public opinion against such anti-national and terrorist activities.
Presided over by veteran journalist Haider Hussain, the meeting also asked the government to take care so that the entire Muslim community was harassed due to suspicion as an outcome of anti-national activities carried out by a handful of persons who have gone astray. “The Muslim community should also remain alert against elements that might drag members of the community into anti-national and criminal activities by taking advantage of their socio-economic backwardness,” the group in an appeal issued here today said.
Interestingly, even as the Assam Police have arrested six Muslim persons from Barpeta district on October 10 for their alleged links with JMB, a section of All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) leaders have said that those arrested should not be labeled as terrorists until proven guilty in a court of law. They has also alleged that the Congress government in the state had hatched a conspiracy to brand Muslims as jihadis.

Six men who were arrested by the Assam Police two weeks ago for their alleged connection with the explosion in Burdwan, West Bengal were sent to judicial custody by the Chief Judicial Magistrate (CJM) here on Friday.
The six men, Shaikhul Islam @ Abdullah (20), Rafikul Islam (39), Md. Shiraj Ali Khan (53), Jahuruddin (60), Golam Usmani (23) and Sarbesh Ali (35), hail from three different villages in Barpeta district. Among them, Shaikhul Islam alias Abdulla of Kahikuchi village in Barpeta is said to be an important member of the Jama’atul Mujahideen Bangladesh (Party of the Mujahideen) sleeper cell in Assam, the police said.
While the police had sought remand for two of them – Shaikhul Islam and Rafikul Islam – the CJM’s court rejected that plea and remanded all of them in judicial custody for two weeks. They will be required to be produced before the court again on November 5. Both Shaikhul Islam and Rafikul Islam are also said to have been a close associate of Shakil Ahmed, a JMB operative who was one of the two persons killed in the Burdwan blast on October 2.
Meanwhile, Assam Police director-general Khagen Sarma has said that the police have information that some youths from Assam were visiting Bangladesh at the instance of the JMB. “We have received information against some youths who have been visiting Bangladesh for getting training under the Islamic terror networks such as the JMB to carry out terror attacks,” Sarma said on Thursday. He also said the police have evidence against the six persons arrested in Barpeta and had kept them under surveillance till they were arrested on October 10.

Elton John and David Furnish put LGBT community on notice in fight against HIV/AIDSBy Jonathan Capehart October 24 Follow @capehartj

There is this myth that marriage equality is the silver bullet for all the ails in the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community. As if having the right to say “I do” in all 50 states will solve everything. It won’t . Tomorrow night, Sir Elton John and his longtime partner, David Furnish, will remind everyone at the Human Rights Campaign’s annual national dinner that the HIV/AIDS epidemic still demands our attention. And they will challenge the LGBT community to act.
“This is the critical moment in our fight, and so many of us don’t seem to care. Even in our own community. Especially in our own community,” John will say, according to prepared remarks he shared with me Friday. This comes after he rattles off some startling statistics from the Kaiser Family Foundation, including how “only 30 percent of gay and bisexual men have had an HIV test in the past year. A majority of gay men don’t even talk about HIV with their friends or partners. More than 60 percent don’t even talk about HIV with their doctor.”

John and Furnish will announce at the dinner a $300,000 grant to the HRC to assist in its HIV/AIDS prevention and advocacy around the root causes of the epidemic’s spread. “Our grant . . . is the beginning of a new initiative to refocus and reenergize the LGBT fight against AIDS,” Furnish told me in an email. And in his prepared remarks he will decry the lack of compassion for those who contract HIV/AIDS, which only serves to help spread the disease.
If a young gay man won’t get tested because he’s afraid of the stigma attached to HIV, that’s how the virus spreads. If a former prisoner can’t get the medicine she needs to bring her viral levels down, because no one cares about prisoners, that’s how HIV spreads. If a drug user won’t bother with rehabilitation or HIV prevention because he has been told time and again that his life is worthless, that is how HIV spreads.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about 50,000 people become HIV positive every year. Most of them are young African American men who have sex with men. Most of them live in the South. Compounding the impact of the silence in the gay community is the opposition to Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act. As I wrote last month, HIV/AIDS continues to rage in the South.

This devastating map and others like it were brought to my attention by Lauren Banks of AIDS Alabama. It turns out that her organization and many like it are supported by the Elton John AIDS Foundation (EJAF). According to Funders for LGBTQ Issues, not only is EJAF the largest funder of gay organizations in the South , it is also the No. 1 funder of black LGBT organizations .
“We now know that AIDS thrives where it’s ignored. So it’s no surprise that the South, for example, is the new American epicenter for AIDS. Or that African Americans are eight times more likely to contract HIV than whites. Many Southern states don’t provide proper treatment options for AIDS, or have LGBT-friendly health care policies. And the African American community has been neglected for too long,” John told me. “These failures have nothing to do with science, and everything to do with getting health care and information to the marginalized groups that need it most. That’s why we support organizations that help the people and communities that are being ignored. The real fight against AIDS is taking place in low-income communities, in the rural south, and in the inner-city. That’s where we need to get to work.”
In addition to the grant to the HRC, John and Furnish will soon announce another $1.1 million in grants to organizations battling HIV/AIDS. In D.C., where HIV/AIDS is an epidemic on par with West Africa , EJAF funding has gone to AIDS United , HIPS and the National Black Justice Coalition .
“Thanks to advancements in science and hard advocacy work, HIV is no longer a death sentence. Unfortunately, some members of the LGBT community have taken that to mean they can ignore the AIDS epidemic,” Furnish told me. “No one’s going to save us but ourselves. It’s on us to put an end to HIV.”

A Dallas nurse who contracted Ebola is now free of the virus, U.S. health officials said on Friday.
Nina Pham, who contracted the disease while treating a man who later died of Ebola in a Dallas hospital, had been undergoing treatment at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, since Oct. 16.
The NIH scheduled a Friday news conference to discuss Pham’s discharge.

Govt aims at 50th position in ease of doing businessrankingThe Commerce and Industry Ministry has already taken several measures and has proposed series of steps. Reuters

The government is aiming to improve India’s ranking in ease of doing business index to 50th position in the next two years from the current 134th.
The Commerce and Industry Ministry has already taken several measures and has proposed series of steps, including drastically reducing the time for registration of business to one day, single registration of all labour laws and cut in number of taxes to improve ease of doing business in India.
“Aim is to improve the ranking to 50th position in two years from 134th at present. Different government departments have already started consultation and deliberations on steps to improve India’s ranking,” sources said.
They added that meetings would continue to remove all the barriers and simplify the cumbersome procedures related to approvals and clearance mechanism for business activities.
According to a World Bank report, India has slipped three positions to 134th spot in the latest ‘ease of doing business’ list, which is topped by Singapore.
The Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP), has identified sectors and specific reforms that are urgently required to substantially improve India’s ranking in ease of doing business.
The department has listed as many as 46 action points for different central government ministries and state governments for improving the business climate.
For Corporate Affairs Ministry, it has suggested that the time taken in registration of business from existing 27 days be reduced to only one day as in Canada and New Zealand.
It has also called for doing away with the requirement of company seal and removal of minimum paid up capital for starting a business.
It has suggested introduction of Bankruptcy Law, Unified Insolvency Code, speedy constitution of benches under National Company Law
Tribunal and fixing of a definite and predictable timeframe for rehabilitation and liquidation process.
Similarly, it has recommended reduction in number of taxes and permitting online payment of taxes; simplification of complex tax processes; expediting implementation of Direct Tax Code, Goods and Services tax besides abolition of minimum alternate tax for SEZ developers and units.
Further, it has called for a uniform policy and procedure for all states for a single window clearance along with combined application form and single registration for VAT and other state taxes.
The DIPP has also proposed timelines to implement these initiatives, aimed at attracting investments as part of the Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Make In India’ campaign.
During the last three years, India received an average of USD 30 billion annual foreign direct investment.
India needs huge investments to give a boost to its manufacturing sector and to create million of jobs.

Ottawa shooter had sought Libyan passport: Libyan embassyofficialPeople look at the makeshift memorial near the National War Memorial near Parliament Hill, where Cpl. Nathan Cirillo, 24, was killed by a gunman. (Source: AP)

The man suspected of shooting dead a Canadian soldier on Wednesday had sought a Libyan passport in recent days but had been unsuccessful, an official at the Libyan embassy in Ottawa said on Friday.
“Even if your father was born in Libya, there are many documents that are required in order to get a passport. It is not easy,” said the official, who refused to give his name.
The suspected shooter, Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, 32, was a Canadian citizen who may also have held Libyan citizenship, Canadian police said on Thursday.

Maria Sharapova loses No1 ranking to SerenaWilliamsMaria Sharapova lost the top ranking to Serena Williams after being eliminated from WTA Finals in Singapore. (Source: AP)

Maria Sharapova failed to advance out of the WTA Finals groups and conceded the year-end No.1 ranking to Serena Williams despite a three-set victory over Agnieszka Radwanska on Wednesday.
Sharapova needed to win in straight sets to have a chance of progressing in the tournament, and had to win the title 10 years after her first time if she was to topple Williams from the top of the rankings.
Sharapova inexplicably collapsed from a set and 5-1 up, missing three match points and losing the second set in a tiebreak. The Russian ultimately prevailed 7-5,   6-2 in over three hours but she will go home while Radwanska qualified for the semifinals despite a 1-2 group-stage record.
Radwanska was helped by Caroline Wozniacki beating Petra Kvitova 6-2, 6-3. Kvitova would have progressed had she won.
Williams takes the year-end top ranking for the fourth time, beside 2002, 2009 and 2013.
Since the rankings began in 1975, only five players have held the No. 1 spot at year end four times or more. The others were Steffi Graf (eight times), Martina Navratilova (seven), Chris Evert (five) and Lindsay Davenport (four).
Wozniacki finished top of her group with Radwanska second. Their semifinal opponents would be known late Friday, after Simona Halep faced Ana Ivanovic.
Halep would finish top of her group and Williams runner-up, unless Ivanovic won in straight sets, in which case the Serb and Halep would advance, with the order to be determined by percentage of games won through the tournament.
Sharapova, the 2004 champion and two-time runner-up, was left to rue an unforeseeable collapse from a dominant position in the second set against Radwanska, who won five straight games.
The Russian converted only two of six break points in that set, against two of three by Radwanska, and said she became too hasty as she tried to close out the match.
“A little impatient, her doing a good job of retrieving balls — that is her strength — and going for a little bit more than I should have,” Sharapova said in explaining what went wrong in the second set.
“I know I’m not moving forward but I’m proud of that effort, and to finish the year in this way.”
For the match, Sharapova had a 61-12 advantage in winners, but committed 63 unforced errors against just 17 by the Pole.
Radwanska assumed she was going out in straight sets, so began to play looser tennis and it paid off in that second set.
“In that case you pretty much know that it’s over, so you are more relaxed and she got tighter a little bit,” Radwanska said. “It was easy for me to play, there are not so many nerves as early in the match.”

Study: Democrats are more likely than Republicans to believe in fortune-telling  astrology and ghostsBy Christopher Ingraham October 24 Follow @_cingraham

Human beings are, in general, a superstitious lot. Our tendency to see patterns where they don't exist, and to falsely apply cause to effect, may have helped keep us alive back when we were little more than a band of frightened critters scurrying about the savanna. Those tendencies linger to the present day, reflected in our stubborn belief in completely irrational things: Rabbit's feet. Horoscopes. A return to the gold standard.
The Chapman University Survey on American Fears , a comprehensive study of the fears, phobias and irrational beliefs of the American people, was just released this week and contains an interesting section on belief in the paranormal. The results are drawn from a nationally-representative sample of 2,500 American adults.
It finds that belief in certain paranormal phenomenon - like influencing the world with physical thought, and foretelling the future with dreams - are fairly widespread. On the other hand, few Americans actually believe in astrology.
 
It's instructive to compare Americans' belief in the paranormal with their understanding of scientific knowledge. For instance, a 2014 AP poll found that 51 percent of Americans said they were confident that childhood vaccines are safe and effective. This is roughly the same proportion of Americans who believe houses or rooms can be haunted by spirits.
Slightly over 40 percent of Americans believe in UFOs. This is considerably higher than the share of Americans who are confident that global warming is real, that life evolved through natural selection, or that the earth is 4.5 billion years old.
About as many Americans say they believe in Bigfoot as say they're confident that the universe began with a big bang.
The Chapman authors provided me with breakdowns by party affiliation. In general, Democrats were slightly and in some cases significantly more likely than Republicans to believe in paranormal phenomena: 75.6 percent of Democrats agreed that positive thoughts could influence the physical world, compared to 68.6 percent of Republicans.
Democrats were significantly more likely than Republicans to believe in fortune telling, and about twice as likely to believe in astrology.
 
On the other hand, Republicans were significantly more likely to say that Satan causes most evil in the world, a reflection of the higher degree of religiosity in the Republican party.
There were no significant partisan differences on belief in Atlantis, UFOs or Bigfoot.

Premature to talk of US troop cuts in Asia: JohnKerrySecretary of State John Kerry said on Friday that it was too early to discuss cutting the number of US troops.
By: Agence-France Presse | Washington | Posted: October 24, 2014 10:40 pm
Secretary of State John Kerry said on Friday that it was too early to discuss cutting the number of US troops stationed in Asia and South Korea, amid increased tensions on the heavily guarded peninsula.
The top US diplomat insisted before any such moves could happen North Korea must first show a serious commitment to rejoining six-party talks on ending its suspect nuclear program.
Asked after meeting his South Korean counterpart Yun Byung-se whether Washington would consider reducing its military presence in Asia if North Korea returned to the stalled nuclear negotiations, Kerry ruled out the idea.
“The mere entering into talks is not an invitation to take any actions regarding troops or anything else at this point. It would be way too premature to have any thought, or even discussion” along those lines, Kerry said.
“The only purpose of entering the talks is to come to an understanding regarding first the denuclearization and then following the denuclearization obviously whatever relationship might be appropriate.”
He also ruled out any idea of visiting isolated North Korea and meeting leader Kim Jong-un in the near term. Washington and Pyongyang do not have diplomatic ties.
Yun said South Korea was awaiting a “clear stance” on Pyongyang’s nuclear policy and “a halt to the sophistication of its nuclear weapons.”
“All of this has to be real. It has to lead to real solutions,” Yun said.

NorthEast United go past 9-man Mumbai2-0By: Press Trust of India | Mumbai | Posted: October 24, 2014 10:26 pm
NorthEast United struck twice in the second half in a remarkable turnaround to stun Mumbai City FC 2-0 in a Hero Indian Super League match which saw the home side reduced to nine men in the end on Friday.
The home side, who had thrashed Pune City FC 5-0 in their previous match, failed to score a goal despite dominating the proceedings early in the match in front of their home crowd at the D Y Patil Stadium.
The first half belonged to Mumbai City FC but the visitors came back in the second half with a superior performance as they scored two goals to run away winners in their first away match of the tournament.
Zambia’s Kondwani Mtonga grabbed the opener in the 57th minute when he collected Koke’s pass to work past the lone defender Tiago Ribeiro and custodian Subrata Paul.
NorthEast United FC doubled the lead in the injury time when James Keene, who came in place of Koke in the 69th minute, fed the ball to Guilherme Felipe who just had to beat the goalkeeper, to seal the issue for the visiting side.
The match also saw some bizarre moments as Mumbai could not send in a replacement for injured marquee player Frederik Ljungberg who pulled his hamstring in the 72nd minute as the home side have used all their substitutions by then, leaving them one man short.
Coach Peter Reid later said that Ljungberg has pulled his hamstring.
Making matters worse, Mumbai were reduced to nine men on the field when Czech defender Pavel Cmovs had to leave the field in the 75th minute after getting his second yellow card of the match.
Mumbai now have just three points from two matches while NorthEast have added three points to their kitty, taking their tally to seven from four games.
Mumbai now take on Chennaiyin FC on October 28 in an away encounter, while NorthEast play against Delhi Dynamos in the capital city on October 29.
The hosts played the first few minutes of the second half with just 10 men on the field as Ljungberg kept trying to grab the assistant referee’s attention to substitute him in place of Andre Moritz.
John Abraham co-owned NorthEast United looked like a renewed side in the second half with Durga Boro creating a couple of chances after the goal-less first half.
Mumbai’s Brazilian import Andre Moritz, who dazzled with his hat-trick against Pune, came close to giving his side a lead in the seventh minute but his effort was off-target.
Winger Nadong Bhutia wasted an opportunity when he failed to pass the ball accurately to Subash Singh in the 14th minute.
The hosts, who were dominant from the start, had no trouble in weaving their way into the other half and created a lot of chances. But they continued…

Till a few years ago, this ancient and historic banyan tree spread over five acres at Paidimadugu village of Korutla mandal in Karimnagar district on the banks of the picturesque Godavari, was not known to many people.
Thanks to the Tourism Department, which declared it an ancient and tourist destination in the district, the banyan tree got some prominence on the tourism map of Telangana State. Though there are no adequate facilities, a huge number of visitors throng the tree, stated to be 500 years old, during weekends and vacations.
People believe that the goddess Mahalaxmi temple constructed under this huge tree brings prosperity to the visitors. This has earned the tree the name ‘Bakthuka Marri.’ Historians say the idols of Ganesha and goddess Nagini belong to the 10th century.
A rivulet flows from east to west of the tree, which, people say, is a rare thing. It is believed that devotees should first take a dip in the rivulet to be cleansed of their sins. There is also the popular belief that people bitten by rats would be cured if they take a dip in the rivulet.
Official plans to beautify the location by going for landscaping and fencing around the tree and provide other facilities for the visitors continue to remain on the drawing board. A most worrisome aspect is that the tree, the cynosure of all eyes, is withering due to lack of care.
Those planning to have a look at the tree can take RTC buses to the village. Bus services are operated from Karimnagar, Jagtial, Vemulawada and other places. From the village, one would have to trek about two or three km to reach the banyan tree.
You would enjoy the drive from Hyderabad to this village as the road condition is excellent. Anyone packing bags?
