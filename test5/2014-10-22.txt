R Sreesankar, head of institutional equities at Prabhudas Lilladher, told NDTV that deregulation of diesel will reduce the borrowing of oil marketing companies (OMCs) as under-recoveries of these companies will reduce. But this would not result in immediate earnings upgrade for OMCs, he added.

Apple worth $96 or $115 Analysts debateApple worth $96 or $115? Analysts debate

Apple (AAPL) shares are up sharply on strong sales of its latest smartphone, but some analysts disagree over the future of the stock.
Following better-than-expected sales of iPhones, investors surged into their darling stock pushing shares of Apple up $2.52 or 2.5% to $102.23. That’s an impressive gain for a stock of the size of Apple, creating roughly $15 billion in wealth in the blink of an eye.
But analysts are already debating how much higher this stock can go. It’s hard to find any skeptics on the stock, which has been screaming higher for years. Most investors and analysts agree that this time it’s different — and that this stock can march past the $600 billion valuation territory and keep going. The stock, valued at $597 billion, is already worth more than any other company.
The average Wall Street analyst rates the stock “outperform” with an 18-month price target of $115 a share. The bullish investors include Steven Milunovich of UBS, according to a report to clients. He points out that sell-through of iPhones rose 26% and that demand is outstripping supply. Milunovich thinks the stock is headed to $115 if the stock trades for 14 times his 2015 earnings estimate.
But there are some analysts who are starting to question whether the crowd can continue to be right about the stock. Andy Hargreaves at Pacific Crest doesn’t have a price target on Apple, but says the stock’s fair value is $96 for at least the next 12 months. He says all the good news is largely reflected in the stock price already. And following such a strong quarter, customer growth will “slow substantially” in fiscal 2016, he says.
The company’s valuation continues to push to new highs, and gravity eventually needs to set in, he says:
Pacific Crest
Investors who chase the stock higher are making overoptimistic assumptions that haven’t held true with other companies in the past — thinking that Apple is somehow different, says Colin Gillis, analyst at BGC. Apple is completely dependent on the iPhone, shown by the fact that iPad sales have posted three quarters of year-over-year shipment declines, he says.
And the phone business will reach saturation. The overall cellphone market grows about 5% a year — hardly enough to impress investors, Gillis says. Apple has been benefiting from the fact that smartphone sales are a growing slice of cellphone sales, but “it’s entirely possible longer term this will slow down,” he says. Already, smartphone sales are 55% of total sales. Meanwhile, smartphone growth is slowing, Gillis says, from 46.6% growth in 2012 to 25% in the June quarter of 2014.
The smartphone market could slow as consumers realize current models are “good enough.” The screens are now “big enough” and the cell speeds are “fast enough.” The danger of devices being “good enough” that two-year upgrades are no longer needed has plagued the PC market, he says. The dangers of companies relying too much on a product where improvements get increasingly incremental is the topic of Harvard professor Clayton Christensen’s breakthrough book, The Innovator’s Dilemma.
Meanwhile, the average selling price of Apple smartphones at $600 is twice that of the average smartphone. Such margins get increasingly difficult to defend over time — and typically high-end players are relegated to a smaller market share, Gillis says. Lastly, as the company gets bigger, it takes an enormous amount of revenue to move the needle, he points out.
Investors are so enamored with this stock — they’re forgetting the risks, and there are risks, Gillis says. “There are pitfalls,” he says. “We’ll see if Apple can maintain.”

Latest perk - egg-freezingReddit
Corporate perks are tricky. One employee’s free healthy meal at Google’s canteen is another’s misery – yet another reason never to leave the office.
And so what to make of Facebook’s and Apple’s offer to employees that they will cover the cost of freezing their eggs?
On the one hand, it is an incentive to attract female talent at a time when Silicon Valley is keen to shed its frat-pack image. Notwithstanding comments from Satya Nadella, the Microsoft chief executive, last week – and subsequent retraction – that women should trust in karma rather than ask for a pay-rise.
But could it also be seen as a ruse to get women to work through their child-bearing years and delay motherhood? Such perks can set the tone of a company culture, after all. Once a free taxi is on offer for all those who work past 10pm, it can swiftly become the norm to stay chained to the desk until that time.
The technology is also uncertain at this point. As Atlantic points out:
“Egg-freezing is, at this point, more about assurance than insurance. It is marketed largely under the auspices of ‘peace of mind’, a way of reassuring women that, regardless of their age, they still have time to conceive.”
Apple said that it:
“cares deeply about our employees and their families, and we are always looking at new ways our health programs can meet their needs. We continue to expand our benefits for women, with a new extended maternity leave policy, along with cyropreservation and egg storage as part of our extensive support for infertility treatments.”
 
It added:
“We also offer an Adoption Assistance program, where Apple reimburses eligible expenses associated with the legal adoption of a child. We want to empower women at Apple to do the best work of their lives as they care for loved ones and raise their families.”
Might other employers follow suit?
 

Tribune buying Sun-Times suburban newspapersStop the presses: Tribune buying Sun-Times suburban newspapers
posted on
Tweet
Chicago Sun-Times
In a blockbuster deal that could change the Chicago journalism landscape, the parent company of the Sun-Times plans to sell all of its suburban daily and weekly newspapers to Tribune Publishing, sources said.
Once the sale is completed, Wrapports LLC would continue to publish only the Sun-Times daily tabloid and the Reader free weekly, according to insiders. Tribune Publishing, parent company of the Chicago Tribune and nine other newspapers nationwide, would acquire the Aurora Beacon-News, the Elgin Courier-News, the Lake County News-Sun, the Naperville Sun, the Northwest Indiana Post-Tribune, the SouthtownStar, and the 32 weekly newspapers published by the Pioneer Press.
Terms of the deal are not known, but the agreement between Jack Griffin, CEO of Tribune Publishing, and Michael Ferro Jr., chairman of Wrapports, is said to be on a “very aggressive timeline.” No contracts have been signed, but sources said Sun-Times Media personnel are already working to make the necessary system changes by early November.
Matthew Hutchison, senior vice president of corporate communications for Tribune Publishing, said: “We cannot comment on speculation.”
Dennis Culloton, a spokesman for Wrapports, said: “Wrapports is declining to comment on speculation.”
The surprise move comes as Wrapports is negotiating new terms of its printing and distribution agreements with Tribune Publishing. The current arrangement expires in May.
Wrapports was formed in 2011 by Ferro and CEO Timothy P. Knight after they negotiated to buy Sun-Times Media Holding Company from the estate of James C. Tyree, who had led the Sun-Times out of bankruptcy.

Rajkummar:  Queen  was Kangana s filmPrint
The 16th Mumbai Film Festival organized by Mumbai Academy of the Moving Image (MAMI) began on the 14th October at PVR Andheri, Cinemax Versova and Chandan Cinema in Juhu. Actor Rajkummar Rao, who won his first National Award this year for his role in Hansal Mehta’s ‘Shahid’, is associated with the festival and he spoke to Yahoo Movies about why this festival is so close to his heart and how things are after he won the most prestigious award for an actor.
What is the best thing about this festival?
I think it is a really important festival for everyone, for each and everyone one of us. I have been attending the festival for the last three years now and I have been watching some great films. This is the only platform where you get to watch films from around the world, some really beautiful films, which you will otherwise not get to see on the big screen especially.
Also, MAMI was the festival where ‘Shahid’ got its first award, that way also it’s very special for me. And since, it’s happening in my city, in Mumbai, there is no way I will not be associated with it. Whatever, I can do, I would love to do it.
I had spoken to you before the release of ‘Shahid’ and you had told me what an emotional experience the film had been. After the National Award does it all feel worth it?
Absolutely (laughs)…it’s more than worth it now. ‘Shahid’ is always going to be one of the more special films of my career.
How far does this kind of recognition go in validating your choice of roles?
I think somewhere it puts a responsibility, subconsciously but I don’t want to feel pressurized because of anything. I want to choose my projects the way I was choosing them before, just go with my gut feeling, if I feel excited about anything, I want to go ahead and do it.
How have things changed for you professionally after the National Award?
The number of scripts I read now has increased a lot, so the option to choose films now has increased.
So, you are at a good place now?
I am happy; I won’t say I am not happy but it’s still a long way to go. It’s a good start but there’s still a long way to go.
What kind of roles are offered to Rajkummar Rao today?
That way I am quite lucky because I have been offered various kinds of roles. I have not been typecast as of now. People want me to do love stories, thrillers, comedies and biopics.
Are you open to doing an out and out commercial film?
I am open to do anything, if there is a story that excites me, if it’s a story I want to be a part of. I would love to do that keeping my aesthetics in mind.
‘Queen’ was a huge success but it was considered Kangana’s film all the way. Are you okay with that?
Of course, the film was supposed to be Kangana’s film, it was never meant to be my film. I am grateful that people thought that I did a decent job but I always knew it was Kangana’s film. I think it was a beautiful film, it was an interesting and a very lovable story. I just wanted to be a part of a great story. And I am glad that I did that film, there are a lot of people, who know me because of ‘Queen’.
Does the length of a role matter to you or just the script?
No, it matters, the length of the role absolutely matters. Like in ‘Hamari Adhuri Kahani’, it’s a special appearance that I am doing. It’s a story that has been written by Bhatt saab and I really can’t say ‘no’ to him. I love him too much to say no to him. He really convinced me to do that part; it was a very challenging part. He only saw me in that part, so, I told him that I would love to do that part but it will only be a special appearance and that’s how we agreed on the film.
We wish the actor all the very best for his future projects that include, ‘Dolly Ki Doli’, ‘Shimla Mirchi’ and ‘Hamari Adhuri Kahani’.

CARAMEL CUSTARD:
Caramel-flavoured egg custard is a deceptively simple dessert. We’ve often felt like Goldilocks, chiming, “This one’s too hard, this one’s too watery, and this one’s too bitter, take it away!” On every occasion that we’ve sampled Britannia’s caramel custard however, we’ve been rewarded by the consistency of its fluffy texture with just the right amount of sweetness. It’s a lovely, light ending to the restaurant’s fantastic fare.

The 12 big winners since the  87 crashEMAIL

It’s been 27 years since the brutal Oct. 19, 1987 Black Monday crash. Many investors swore off investing at that time. What a mistake that was.
There are 12 stocks in the current Standard & Poor’s 500, including health care company UnitedHealth (UNH) , biotech Amgen (AMGN) and discount apparel seller Ross (ROST) that are up more than 10,000% since that infamous day, according to a USA TODAY analysis of data from S&P Capital IQ.
The 12 stocks are up 21,278% on average since their closing prices on Oct. 19, 1987. Just to put that into perspective, a $10,000 investment made in one of these stocks would be worth $2.1 million today. It’s an impressive run if you consider the Dow Jones industrial average is up 843% since the close on Black Monday.
The best stock in the bunch wasn’t some obscure tech stock either. Health care services firm UnitedHealth was the biggest winner with a 59,493% gain since 1987, says S&P Capital IQ. It’s not just speculation. The company has been an explosive growth story all though the 90s and 2000s. The company’s total revenue is up 58,139% since the early 1990s, says S&P Capital IQ. Amgen, also a leader in the health care industry, has seen its shares soar 27,893% since the 1987 crash.
Helping consumers save money, too seems to be a way to score. Ross Stores might not be as glamorous as a biotech, but the gains have been stellar. Shares are up a blistering 23,729% since the 1987 crash. Revenue is up 1,534% since the late 1980s and profit has jumped 3,119%, says S&P Capital IQ.
Again, these top stocks are based on members of the current S&P 500, and it’s important to point out that nearly half of the current members of the S&P 500 weren’t trading in 1987. And there were certainly plenty of losers, too.
But looking back is still a great way to respect the awesome money-building power of investors who hang on.

I Have One of These to Sell
Description:
1986 Fleer Michael Jordan #57 BGS Pristine 10 - One of Five Known. Literally the most desirable and valuable trading card printed in the last half century makes its auction debut here, the single most perfect specimen ever to find its way into a grading company's plastic slab. While PSA may dominate the post-war card grading market, collectors are well aware that no service is more maddeningly discerning than Beckett when it comes to modern cardboard. How vast is the divide? Consider that PSA has encapsulated 194 Gem Mint 10 specimens, just one percent of total submissions. Just five rookie Jordans have garnered the elusive rating from Beckett, in over 7,400 attempts. That calculates to approximately .0007 percent.
Beckett itself was well aware of the magnitude of this rating, trumpeting its emergence upon the cover of its (included) Summer 2006 Beckett Basketball Card Plus magazine. Along with an image of this card, they shout, "Centering doesn't get any better! Razor-sharp Edges! Corners could be used as a weapon! Silky-smooth Surface! The first BGS Pristine 10 Jordan Rookie Card!" With subgrades of 10 for centering, edges and corners, losing half a point only for surface, in an attempt to give it a touch of humility. But, much like the man whose emergence the card announces, it's tough to be humble when you're among the best in the world. The rarest of opportunities for the uncompromising collector. A November 18, 2009 article on the Beckett website announces a privately brokered sale of this card for $200,000!

Has Apple stock peaked Experts debateApple worth $96 or $115? Analysts debate

Apple (AAPL) shares are up sharply on strong sales of its latest smartphone, but some analysts disagree over the future of the stock.
Following better-than-expected sales of iPhones, investors surged into their darling stock pushing shares of Apple up $2.52 or 2.5% to $102.23. That’s an impressive gain for a stock of the size of Apple, creating roughly $15 billion in wealth in the blink of an eye.
But analysts are already debating how much higher this stock can go. It’s hard to find any skeptics on the stock, which has been screaming higher for years. Most investors and analysts agree that this time it’s different — and that this stock can march past the $600 billion valuation territory and keep going. The stock, valued at $597 billion, is already worth more than any other company.
The average Wall Street analyst rates the stock “outperform” with an 18-month price target of $115 a share. The bullish investors include Steven Milunovich of UBS, according to a report to clients. He points out that sell-through of iPhones rose 26% and that demand is outstripping supply. Milunovich thinks the stock is headed to $115 if the stock trades for 14 times his 2015 earnings estimate.
But there are some analysts who are starting to question whether the crowd can continue to be right about the stock. Andy Hargreaves at Pacific Crest doesn’t have a price target on Apple, but says the stock’s fair value is $96 for at least the next 12 months. He says all the good news is largely reflected in the stock price already. And following such a strong quarter, customer growth will “slow substantially” in fiscal 2016, he says.
The company’s valuation continues to push to new highs, and gravity eventually needs to set in, he says:
Pacific Crest
Investors who chase the stock higher are making overoptimistic assumptions that haven’t held true with other companies in the past — thinking that Apple is somehow different, says Colin Gillis, analyst at BGC. Apple is completely dependent on the iPhone, shown by the fact that iPad sales have posted three quarters of year-over-year shipment declines, he says.
And the phone business will reach saturation. The overall cellphone market grows about 5% a year — hardly enough to impress investors, Gillis says. Apple has been benefiting from the fact that smartphone sales are a growing slice of cellphone sales, but “it’s entirely possible longer term this will slow down,” he says. Already, smartphone sales are 55% of total sales. Meanwhile, smartphone growth is slowing, Gillis says, from 46.6% growth in 2012 to 25% in the June quarter of 2014.
The smartphone market could slow as consumers realize current models are “good enough.” The screens are now “big enough” and the cell speeds are “fast enough.” The danger of devices being “good enough” that two-year upgrades are no longer needed has plagued the PC market, he says. The dangers of companies relying too much on a product where improvements get increasingly incremental is the topic of Harvard professor Clayton Christensen’s breakthrough book, The Innovator’s Dilemma.
Meanwhile, the average selling price of Apple smartphones at $600 is twice that of the average smartphone. Such margins get increasingly difficult to defend over time — and typically high-end players are relegated to a smaller market share, Gillis says. Lastly, as the company gets bigger, it takes an enormous amount of revenue to move the needle, he points out.
Investors are so enamored with this stock — they’re forgetting the risks, and there are risks, Gillis says. “There are pitfalls,” he says. “We’ll see if Apple can maintain.”

spinning blades produced more energy than splitting atomsWind farms outstrip nuclear power
By Roger Harrabin BBC environment analyst
Wind farms have attracted controversy in the UK
Tories would end wind farm subsidies
The UK's wind farms generated more power than its nuclear power stations on Tuesday, the National Grid says.
The energy network operator  said it was caused by a combination of high winds and faults in nuclear plants.
Wind farms are causing controversy in rural areas and the government is choking off planning permission for new sites.
But for a 24-hour period yesterday, spinning blades produced more energy than splitting atoms.
Wind made up 14.2% of all generation and nuclear offered 13.2%.
It follows another milestone on Saturday, when wind generated a record amount of power - 6,372 MW, according to National Grid.
This formed nearly 20% of the the UK's electricity, albeit at a time at the weekend when demand is relatively low.
Reactors down
But wind power's ascendancy over nuclear is expected to be temporary.
The situation is caused by windy conditions boosting the output from turbines at a time when eight out of the UK's 15 nuclear reactors are offline.
EDF Energy said current ageing reactors are down for a number of reasons:
Sizewell B is in the middle of a planned "statutory outage" for maintenance and refuelling
Hunterston B Reactor 4 is down for maintenance, expected back in early November
At Dungeness B, one unit is being refuelled and the other is expected back online soon after being shut down after a fault on a boiler pump was discovered
The four reactors at Heysham and Hartlepool were taken offline in August after a crack was found on a boiler spine.
'Convenient whipping boy'
A government spokesman said a "diverse energy mix" was essential to the UK's energy security.
"We're preventing a predicted energy crunch by turning round a legacy of underinvestment and neglect.
"To deliver this, we need a diverse energy mix that includes renewable sources like wind and solar alongside nuclear and technologies like carbon capture and storage so we can continue to use fossil fuels in a cleaner way."
But wind energy has proved controversial in rural areas and among some politicians.
Last week the former environment secretary Owen Paterson condemned the wind industry for soaking up subsidies, producing a "paltry" amount of power and ruining landscapes. He called instead for a new generation of mini nuclear plants dotted around the country.
The government is offering more generous subsidies to nuclear than wind in the long term.
But Jennifer Webber, a spokeswoman for RenewableUK, the trade body, said: "Wind power is often used as a convenient whipping boy by political opponents and vested interests.
"All the while, it's been quietly powering millions of homes across the UK and providing a robust response to its vocal detractors."

Apple stock hits all-time highApple appears unstoppable as stock hits all-time high

Shares of Apple (AAPL)  set a new intraday high of $104.11 Wednesday, as investors continue to scurry into the stock following its estimate-blowing third quarter.
The tech giant topped its previous intraday high of $103.72 set on Sept. 2, 2104 but shares ended up 52 cents, or 0.5%, to close at $102.99. That fell short of its closing high of $103.30 set on Sept. 2, 2014.
Wall Street analysts remain very bullish on the stock, holding out an 18-month price target of $115.52. Skeptics, though, remain,  especially as the stock reaches levels that have been difficult for it to sustain in the past, the smartphone market is maturing as well as the tablet market.
While most cellphone handset makers have eventually hit the wall as saturation hits — think Nokia and BlackBerry — bulls say this time is different. Fans of the stock point out that consumers have been trained to get a new phone every two years whether they need them or not. Also, the wireless carriers front the $700 price tag of new iPhones and allow consumers to pay off the balance over two years so it’s not as noticeable.
But skeptics look at the stock’s rising valuation and massive size. Apple can’t get by introducing thinner and lighter products to move the needle now; it needs huge hits. It’s unclear whether the Apple Watch will be anywhere as popular as Apple’s smartphone. Meanwhile, the stock is trading for about 16 times its trailing 12-month earnings, which is approaching the 18 peak set in April 2012.

Apple’s dominance looks even more impressive compared with shares of Google, which are down this year:

Retiree dreams of lengthy vacations, days on the golf course and indulging  the grandkids may be dust.
Most retirees haven't saved enough even to maintain their pre-retirement  lifestyle, according to a new study from Interest.com based on Census Bureau  data. The rule of thumb among financial planners is saving to have a retirement  income of at least 70 percent of your working-days salary.

Most retirees haven't saved enough to maintain their pre-retirement lifestyle, according to a new study.
Only residents of Washington, D.C., and Nevada are exceeding that mark, with  the typical retiree's wage replacement ratio at 73.81 percent and 70.78 percent,  respectively. Nationwide, residents age 65 and older are living on a median  income of $37,847, for a wage replacement ratio of 59.63 percent. The bulk of  that income is from Social Security, rather than savings.
That makes for big changes from a working lifestyle, said Mike Sante,  managing editor of Interest.com. Not only might there be no trips abroad, but  seniors may also find it a struggle to meet regular expenses or create a cushion  for emergencies or medical needs. "It's a pretty limited income for someone to  live on," he said.
By the numbers, retirees are slightly more prepared than in 2011, when the  wage replacement ratio was 57.41 percent, or in 2005, when it was 50.06 percent.  But the bulk of that improvement stems from older adults staying in the  workforce longer, said Sante, which he called "a strategy with an expiration  date."
"I hear that a lot from people," said certified financial planner Andrea  Blackwelder, co-founder of Wisdom Wealth Strategies in Denver. "They say, 'If  the numbers don't work, then I'll work for a couple more years.' That choice may  not be in your hands."

Among retirees in a 2013 survey from the Society of Actuaries, 21 percent  cited health problems as a reason they left the workforce, while 13 percent left  because they needed to care for a family member. Another 13 percent lost their  job. 
In other words, working longer may be one option, but it shouldn't be the  only strategy you employ—and definitely not the one you count on.
Even with just few years to go before retiring, boosting  contributions to tax-advantaged retirement accounts can have a significant  impact, said Marilyn Plum, a certified financial planner and director of  portfolio management at Ballou Plum Wealth Advisors in Lafayette, California.  (Keep in mind, workers age 50 and older can make catch-up contributions of an  extra $5,500 in a 401(k) and $1,000 in an IRA.)

That 70 percent wage replacement benchmark is also worth revisiting. There's  a lot of flexibility in that number , said Blackwelder. "It's  a fine place to start," she said. "But people shouldn't assume that if they hit  70 percent, they're good to go."
You might be able to get by on less, especially if you expect big changes  from current expenses—say, you'll have paid off your mortgage,  won't have commuting and other work expenses, or you plan to move somewhere with  a lower cost of living. Of course, you might need more than 70 percent of  current wages, too, to fuel travel plans and other expensive hobbies, said Plum.  
"Our clients want to live the same lifestyle they have always lived," she  said. "They don't want to cut back 30 percent just because they're in  retirement."

Christophe de Margerie, chief executive officer and chairman of the French energy company Total, says his job is to provide people with power.
He says it is up to politicians to deal with such issues as climate change, and if they want to see more renewables then the price of energy for the consumer will go up.
Mr de Margerie also supports fracking to unlock gas reserves from underground, which the French government has said it will not allow because of environmental concerns.
