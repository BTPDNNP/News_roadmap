Sebis revised ESOP norms welcomestepFPI inflow in equities reaches Rs 1 lakh crore
In recent times, stock-based incentive schemes have increasingly been used by companies as a compensation tool. With a view to improve the governance and transparency of such schemes, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has notified Share-Based Employee Benefits Regulations 2014 on October 28, 2014 replacing the existing Esop guidelines that were in place since 1999. The objective of the regulations is to facilitate smooth operation of such schemes, prevent any malpractices carried out in the name of ESOPs and align the provisions with the Companies Act, 2013.
The market regulator has widened the coverage of the types of schemes to include the Stock Appreciation Rights Scheme, General Employee Benefits Scheme and Retirement Benefits Scheme in addition to the traditional Employee Stock Option Scheme and Employee Stock Purchase Scheme. That such schemes can now be granted to employees of associate companies as well is a welcome step. On the other hand, independent directors have been excluded from the definition of ‘employees’.
Clarification on secondary market acquisition
In the recent past, Sebi had barred listed entities and their trusts from purchasing their own shares from the secondary market; however, it has now given a go-ahead for secondary market acquisitions that have to be mandatorily implemented through the trust route. As a safeguard, overall and yearly limits on quantum and holding periods for shares held by the trust under secondary acquisition have been prescribed. If the scheme is to be implemented through a trust, the same has to be decided upfront at the time of taking approval of the shareholders.
Enhanced disclosures
Several other protective measures have been incorporated. These include stricter disclosures and other regulatory obligations such as prior approval of shareholders to acquire shares from the secondary market, filing of trust deeds with stock exchanges and disclosure of shareholding of the trust as non-promoter and non-public.
To ensure a smooth transition for complying with the new regulatory framework, all listed companies that have existing employee benefit schemes to which new regulations apply have been provided with a time period. The period is one year from the date of these regulations coming into effect, subject to a few exceptions wherein a longer transition period of five years has been provided for.
In the light of the abovementioned developments, employees may soon expect some variations to stock-based incentive plans under which they are covered. As a way forward, listed companies that have such schemes dealing with shares are required to review the existing schemes and align them with the new regulations within a year from the date of their applicability. Also, listed companies proposing to implement such schemes should ensure compliance.
While we await some clarifications from Sebi on certain clauses, the new regulations are likely to bring an end to the manipulative activities undertaken by some listed companies under the cover of ESOP trusts.

Telugu cinema
Anjali Patil holds forth on her journey from NSD to Telugu cinema and reacts to the recognition she received as Fanny from ‘Finding Fanny’
In four years, Anjali Patil has featured in a handful of films — the independent film Delhi in a Day by Prashant Nair, Sri Lankan film With You, Without You and Prakash Jha’s Chakravyuh among them. But these days, she gets more recognition as Fanny from Finding Fanny. “I had two scenes in the film,” she says with a smile, masking the slight hint of exasperation. “It was Homi Adajania’s film and had recognised actors. I am lucky to have acted with Om Puri in Chakravyuh and Naseer in Finding Fanny. Naseer saab taught us at National School of Drama. Now I am waiting to act with Pankaj Kapur,” she says. The dusky actress was in town to promote Naa Bangaaru Talli, the Telugu/Malayalam bilingual that earned her a special mention at National Awards early this year.
“I don’t speak both these languages so when I was approached, I wondered how I’d do it,” she says. “I am a spontaneous actor who likes to play with words and draw from the energies of my co-stars. But if you don’t know the language, it could be a black hole,” she says.
Director Rajesh Touchriver convinced her that she would be able to portray the emotions of a 16-year-old and language wasn’t an issue. She landed on the sets and realised, “it was nightmarish. We were shooting each scene in Telugu and Malayalam. I’d refer to the two books in which I had written each line in Devanagiri and English,” she says. Anjali discovered that the stresses were on different syllables for Telugu and Malayalam. Help came in from Ahmed Ali, a youngster from Rajahmundry and Justin, who helped her with the Malayalam lines. At the end of filming, Anjali was ready to dub in both languages. “But at the same time, I was busy shooting for Chakravyuh,” she says.
She signed Naa Bangaaru Talli before Chakravyuh but the film is up for release only now. “Once I finish a project, I move on to my other commitments. I don’t call up the director or producer to keep tabs on the release. I understand that each film has a different journey,” she says, recalling how With You Without You had to pulled off theatres in Chennai after protests by fringe groups. “Then 900 people turned up at a private screening at a hall that could accommodate only 400. I consider my work in WYWY the best,” she says
Does the acceptance of each film’s journey stem from a sense of security? “We actors are full of insecurities and worry about how we look, talk, photograph…” she laughs.
Born in Nasik, she graduated in Pune. Her parents wanted her to be a doctor and her father didn’t talk to her for a year when she said she didn’t want to pursue medicine. “I was a brat, a rebel. I liked to dance, wanted to travel and what better way to do it than with theatre. I bagged a gold medal in graduation and my dad calmed down and let me do what I wanted. I enrolled in National School of Drama and studied direction,” she says.
Lined up next are Mirziya with Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra, Prakash Jha’s next and Nagraj Manjule’s (of Fandry fame) next Marathi film. She is open to acting in Telugu as well. “Telugu films may be more commercial but the passion is unmatchable. I’ve heard a lot about the discipline of the crew here,” she signs off.

Why youre often better off saving for retirement than buying a homeBy Michael A. Fletcher November 11 Follow @Fletchpost
(REUTERS/Larry Downing)
U.S. home prices crashed 43 percent between 2005 and 2012, yet polls find that the vast majority of Americans still consider home ownership to be a good idea and the best way for average people to build wealth.
But is it?
For more than 40 million households—or half of the nation’s current homeowners—the answer is no, according to a new study by HelloWallet, a firm that works with employers to provide online financial planning services to workers. People in those households would have built more wealth by renting and investing their money in 401(k)s, IRA’s or other types of tax-advantaged investments, the report concluded.
“Home ownership is this kind of unquestioned positive aspiration, when it is not necessarily a good investment for people,” said Matt Fellowes, HelloWallet’s chief executive and a former Brookings Institution researcher.
The benefits of homeownership are often overstated, the study found, even by several popular online calculators that purport to offer guidance to prospective home buyers. The calculators do not consider the wide variations in local property and other taxes, which can dramatically affect the cost of owning a home. But the biggest mistake those calculators make is the same one that many Americans make: they tend to overstate the tax benefits of buying a home. For many families, the tax write off that they gain by buying a home is little better than the standard federal tax deduction—$6,200 for single people and $12,400 for couples who file taxes jointly.
The paltry tax benefits are particularly true for lower income Americans, the study concluded. A family earning $50,000 a year—close to the national median—sees only a negligible tax benefit from buying a home and would generate 50 percent more wealth over the next decade by investing in their retirement accounts rather than their homes, the report found.
Timing is also a big factor in determining whether buying a home is a good financial move, the report found. The higher that rents are relative to price, the more financial sense it makes to buy a home. That ratio varies from city to city and in different time periods but, overall, most Americans would have been better off renting than buying for most of the past 30 years, according to the HelloWallet report. The chart below illustrates the point:
Higher income households have fewer worries in deciding whether to rent or buy, mainly because the tax benefits they reap from buying a home are more lucrative than they are for lower-income buyers. For them, that makes owning a better deal than renting in more cases than not.
All of which raises urgent concerns about federal housing policy, according to Fellowes and study author Aron Szapiro of HelloWallet. They believe the mortgage interest deduction, which they said flows disproportionately to higher-income people in expensive regions of the country, sends a misleading signal to many Americans who assume that tax benefits make purchasing a home a no-brainer.
But the reality is that those benefits are either non-existent or small and fleeting—meaning they diminish over time—for many people. Reforming the deduction to, say, a refundable tax credit for homeownership matched by an equal-sized refundable tax credit for retirement savings, would “send  a signal that there are tax benefits to either approach to building wealth,” the report said. That would better distribute the revenue the government forfeits with its tax subsidy of home purchases through mortgage interest and property tax deductions. Federal tax law “should serve a broader wealth-building agenda,” the report said.

McClellans Retreat: Civil War cocktails and strong whiskeyBy Fritz Hahn November 11 Follow @fritzhahn
George B. McClellan served as general-in-chief of the Union Army during the Civil War, and commanded the Army of the Potomac at Antietam. He may have been beloved by his troops, but "Little Mac" doesn't seem like the kind of guy who'd inspire a new cocktail bar, especially when you know that he discouraged the drinking of whiskey.
McClellan's Retreat, a Civil War-inspired whiskey bar, takes its theme from a nearby statue of General George B. McClellan. (Photo by Fritz Hahn/The Washington Post)
But that doesn't matter to Matt Weiss and Joe Englert. The two partners have turned the former Veritas wine bar into a new lounge called McClellan's Retreat, located a few blocks south of the 1907 bronze statue of McClellan at Connecticut Avenue and Columbia Road NW.
"Joe roped me into it," Weiss says. "[Earlier this year, when] he knew he was going to wind down Veritas, we spitballed some ideas and we came up with McClellan's Retreat, because of the statue. And it's a nice double entendre, because he was famous for never leading his troops into battle." (Defeats at the Seven Days Battles dented the notoriously attack-shy McClellan's reputation; his failure to engage the Confederates after Antietam led to President Lincoln removing McClellan from command.) 
Weiss and designer Molly Allen wanted to "make the bar look and feel like the general's retreat, where he'd have his officers in to relax," Weiss explains. "But with electricity and running water." Large iron lamps hang from twisted iron poles on the bar, and tintype photos of the McClellans hang next to illustrations from Harper's Weekly magazine on the walls. Keep an eye out for cool details, like the buttons in the cushions, which are reproduction Civil War uniform buttons.
Former patrons of Veritas will recognize the low ceilings and low light, but they'll find much more room at the extended wooden bar. (Photo by Fritz Hahn/The Washington Post)
Megan Barnes, late of the Columbia Room and Compass Rose, is in charge of the cocktails, and she's creating modern twists on Civil War-era cocktails, such as Sangaree, the Madeira-based forerunner of modern sangria; and Sherry Cobbler, which Barnes calls "the most popular cocktail of the Civil War." Her version, served in an ice-cold julep cup, mixes sherry, cognac, gomme syrup and lemon, topped with raspberries. It's rich and silky smooth.
There will be a weekly punch special, served from a large, ornate silver punch bowl at the end of the bar; Barnes also plans on making house cocktails "for the table," using a comically large 40-ounce cocktail shaker that can make four to six drinks at a time.

Of course, it's not all recreated classics: Barnes and fellow bartender Rob Tinney both worked at the Columbia Room, and they're planning on putting that training to use. The Gin & Pine cocktail contains gin and pine liqueur and is topped with fragrant smoked pine needles, but the flavor gets its balance from house-made mandarin gastrique, a vinegar-based shrub of mandarin oranges that cuts through the forest of flavors.
McClellan may have groused about the intoxicating effects of bourbon, but his namesake bar has a strong selection of bourbon and rye whiskey. Instead of a massive list, like you'd find at sister bar Barrel , or a few blocks away at Jack Rose, there are just 15 bourbons and 15 ryes on the menu, with most for $8 to $14 per glass. There's also an "Officer's Reserve" list with Old Rip Van Winkle 10 year ($18 per ounce) and Thomas H. Handy Sazerac Rye ($15 per ounce).
There are no draft beers; a short list of 10 craft bottles and cans, strong on porters and stouts, includes Devils Backbone, Great Lakes and Victory, averaging $7.
While the bar doesn't have a kitchen, there will be food. Former Belgian Embassy chef Jan Van Heute will cater a short menu of quiches, mini sandwiches on pretzel rolls and charcuterie. Weiss describes the selection as "not really dinner -- more snacks" and says items will cost $4 to $12. He expects to regularly host pop-up dinners at some point in the future.
McClellan's Retreat opens Wednesday at 4 p.m. It will open at 4 p.m. daily after that, with happy hour until 7 p.m.

Microsoft takes aim at Android with newest smartphoneBy Hayley Tsukayama November 11 Follow @htsuka
Microsoft's first branded Lumia smartphone, the Lumia 535. (Courtesy of Microsoft)
Microsoft on Tuesday showed off its latest smartphone, the Lumia 535, which the first handset that the company has launched since announcing it would officially drop "Nokia" branding from its line of devices. It also signals how the Nokia acquisition -- a pet project of former chief executive Steve Ballmer -- fits into the new, cloud-first, mobile-first vision of current chief executive Satya Nadella.
The announcement doesn't immediately have any effect on American consumers, as Microsoft has said only that it will launch the phone in unspecified "selected markets" in November. But the strategy here is clear: Go after first-time smartphone buyers -- who are mostly overseas --  who stand as Microsoft's best chance to build its reach in the smartphone market. That much is apparent from the company's advertising campaign, as well as the price of 110 euros, or around $137, that Microsoft announced for the phone. That price is low, even before carrier subsidies.
Everything about the phone screams that Microsoft's main target for competition -- at least out of the gate -- are phones that run Google's Android rather than Apple's iOS. Apple has made a name for itself in the smartphone world by making higher-end products, while phone makers who use Google's phones tend to aim for the lower end of the market. While companies don't make as much money per phone in that price range, Microsoft is more interested in reaching a broad audience than a high-spending one. What it wants is reach. Right now, the tech giant has a firm hold on the third-place spot for mobile operating systems, but it only has an estimated 2.5 percent market share.
Market share isn't everything, of course -- Apple has just under 12 percent, compared with Android's 80 percent, and is doing just fine. But Microsoft definitely wants more customers to use Microsoft smartphones -- because that also means more customers for Microsoft services such as Office and Skype. Both products are actually built into the phone: For example, users can automatically convert eligible phone calls to Skype calls with the push of a button.
Microsoft is selling the phone as a "5x5x5" device: It has a 5-inch screen, 5MP front-and rear-facing cameras and access to five Microsoft products: Office, Skype, OneDrive, OneNote and the artifical intelligence software Cortana.
Microsoft now has to balance making its software products widely available enough to be a player in mobile without hobbling the main selling point of its own hardware: the best integration with Microsoft products. That is, after all, the hardware strategy that Nadella has articulated for the company. As Nadella has said, the reason for Microsoft to make its own devices is to show off the best of what its software and services can do.
It's not always an easy balance to strike. When the company announced last week that it was making its mobile Office apps free on iOS devices (and launching a pilot program for Android apps), many hailed that as a smart way forward for the company. But critics noted that the move made it far more appealing to use Office mobile apps on competitors' devices than on Microsoft devices. That fact hasn't escaped Microsoft, which  itself felt the need to reassure customers that it was still working on a "touch-first" solution for Office on its own devices.
 

Bharats other ratnasPrint
Written by Ajay Chhibber | Posted: November 12, 2014 12:04 am
There is surprisingly little debate on India’s other ratnas — the 240 odd public sector undertakings, including nine maharatnas,16 navratnas and mini ratnas. The 2014-15 budget looks for record receipts of Rs 58,000 crore from disinvestment, and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley recently spoke about the need to privatise some PSUs. So, what should the government do with the public sector ratnas that account for about 20 per cent of the GDP and 15 per cent of stock market capitalisation through 50 listed firms?
After pursuing state-led capitalism for four decades after Independence, India introduced a new industrial policy in the 1990s that emphasised delicensing, greater independence for profitable PSUs and restructuring of loss-making firms through the Bureau of Industrial Financing and Restructuring. Between 1992 and ’98, privatisation was not pursued aggressively, though one of India’s most successful privatisation initiatives — the sale of Maruti to Suzuki — was completed during this period.
The NDA government followed an aggressive privatisation policy but faced political and bureaucratic hurdles. The objective of disinvestment under it was not just to raise revenue but also improve efficiency. Some 20 companies were either privatised or 50 per cent of their stock divested. The UPA 1 government, dependent on the communists, did not try to privatise PSUs, while UPA 2 brought back disinvestment with the intent to raise revenue. The latter also encouraged restructuring of state-owned enterprises by creating the Bureau for Restructuring of Public Enterprises. A National Investment Fund was also created to collect disinvestment receipts, with the idea that it would be strategically deployed rather than used as part of budget receipts. Following fiscal pressures after the 2009 crisis, the criterion was gradually relaxed until the fund, for all practical purposes, became part of the budget.
There are surprisingly few good studies on the performance of PSUs. The following trends can be gleaned from those available. First, the number of profit-making PSUs has declined and the number of loss-making ones has increased in the last 15 years. But PSU profits as a whole have increased. In the data for 2012-13, about 150 PSUs show profits and 80 PSUs record losses.
Second, the return-on-assets in PSUs is better than in the corporate sector and in FDI-based companies, though the value of assets, especially land, needs careful scrutiny. Returns are also kept artificially high in some PSUs.
Third, PSUs in the service sectors, such as Air India and BSNL, have done poorly relative to those in mining and industry. This is not surprising, given the lack of service orientation in service-sector PSUs. The presence of PSUs in the telecom sector has not had a negative effect on the industry because of a more effective regulatory environment, which has not hindered private sector companies. But in aviation, the DGCA has not worked as effectively in creating a level playing field.
Earlier, studies showed that disinvestment had a positive effect on PSU performance, ostensibly because new owners injected continued…

A teacher for the HouseWhen he spoke on the possible consequences of a nuclear conflict, it was visible from the press gallery that not only MPs but even his cabinet colleagues were taken aback by his revelations.

The Mahatma was India’s liberator and Jawaharlal Nehru, its moderniser as well as founder of its secular and “socialistic” democracy. Assiduously, he shaped and nurtured every institution that underpins the democratic system. Among these, Parliament was of paramount importance. Nehru devoted much of his time and energy to ensure that it functioned smoothly and effectively in both its roles — as the voice of the people and as a keen watcher of the government that could last only as long as it retained the confidence of the Lok Sabha, originally named the House of the People.
For the last several decades, Parliament has been greatly devalued and often made dysfunctional by its own “honourable” members who think nothing of rushing into the well of the House and even using a pepper-spray there. The character of the Rajya Sabha or the Council of States has been distorted to the point of destruction by a joint effort of all political parties, even though some of them detest one another. In Nehru’s time, things were totally different. The British political scientist, W.H. Morris-Jones, already quoted in this series, wrote that India’s Parliament was, in some ways, “Nehru’s sound box or tuning fork”, but it had also become the “Grand National Council” to debate and decide on all national issues, and should therefore be a “role model” for nations that were being liberated from “Western colonial rule”. He deservedly gave Nehru full credit for this.

Having covered Parliament for long years, I have been witness to the great respect Nehru always showed it. He attended it regularly, unlike some prime ministers in later years. He also treated all its members with regard. After the Bandung Conference in 1955, he had invited President Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt. Nehru noted the visitor’s surprise at the number of communist MPs present at a reception in his honour and said to him: “Gamal, you put your communists in prison; I put them in Parliament.” Alas, sometimes, Nehru had to teach many MPs not only parliamentary norms but also elementary manners. For instance, in the spring of 1951, Parliament’s first late-night sitting became necessary because of the urgency to pass a particular bill. All concerned were also promised dinner. The moment the meal began, there was a virtual rain of chicken bones on the grassy plot. Nehru handed his plate to someone and started picking up the discarded bones. In the ensuing shockwave, everyone joined continued…

The president came to Washington thinking he could change Washington, make it better, unite it and the nation. He was wrong. As he ascended, the tone of political discourse descended, as much because of who he was as what he did. When Obama introduced Joe Biden as his vice-presidential running mate in Springfield, Illinois, he expressed his confidence that Biden could “help me turn the page on the ugly partisanship in Washington, so we can bring Democrats and Republicans together to pass an agenda that works for the American people.”
In his first inaugural address, Obama said: “On this day, we gather because we have chosen hope over fear, unity of purpose over conflict and discord. On this day, we come to proclaim an end to the petty grievances and false promises, the recriminations and worn-out dogmas that for far too long have strangled our politics. We remain a young nation, but in the words of scripture, the time has come to set aside childish things.”
He underestimated the degree to which his very presence for some would feel more like a thorn than a salve. The president seemed to think that winning was the thing. It wasn’t. Stamina was the thing. The ability to nurse a grievance was the thing. The president’s first “I won” moment came shortly after his inauguration. It was in an hour-long, bipartisan meeting with congressional leaders about the stimulus package. ABC News reported an exchange the president had with Eric Cantor this way: “Obama told Cantor this morning that ‘on some of these issues we’re just going to have ideological differences.’ The president added, ‘I won. So I think on that one, I trump you.’ ”
Then, in a 2010 meeting with members of Congress about the Affordable Care Act, a visibly agitated president quipped to John McCain (who was raising concerns about the bill): “We’re not campaigning any more. The election is over.” And in 2013, appearing even more agitated following the government shutdown, the president chastised his opponents across the aisle: “You don’t like a particular policy or a particular president? Then argue for your position. Go out there and win an election.” This idea that Republicans would honour the fact that he was elected — twice — almost seems quaint. It angered; it didn’t assuage. And in addition to some people being ideologically opposed to Democratic principles in general, others are endlessly irritated by a personal attitude and persona that seem impervious to chastisement or humbling.
Even the president himself has come round to giving voice to this in public. Last year he told The New York Times: “There’s not an action that I take that you don’t have some continued…

Cairns won more than USD$140,000 when he sued Modi over a 2010 tweet accusing the all-rounder of corruption during his time in the now defunct Indian Cricket League (ICL).
"Mr Modi has issued proceedings to set aside the 2012 libel judgment on the ground of fraud and is claiming the return of all damages and costs paid which are in excess of £2.4m," Vyakarnam said.
"Mr Modi is still bound by the injunction awarded by Justice Bean and does not wish to prejudice the (Crown Prosecution Service's) case against Mr Cairns or Mr Fitch-Holland. He will therefore not make any further comments at this time."

Modi's allegations related to the 2008 editions of the ICL competition when Cairns captained the Chandigarh Lions.
However, the court ruled that Modi "singularly failed" to provide any reliable evidence that Cairns was involved in fixing.
Cairns has since been arrested by the London Metropolitan Police and appeared in court last month charged with perjury in relation to evidence given at the libel trial.
He is to reappear in court in January for a plea hearing and has indicated he will fight the allegations. A trial is expected next October.
Cairns retired from international cricket in 2004 after becoming one of only 12 players in Test history to complete the 'double' of 200 wickets and 3,000 runs.

Women in Business: Elyse Causey  School of Rock franchisereddit
26-year-old Elyse Causey took her father's CEO and CFO business advice to pursue her passion for helping kids. Elyse's father was a successful businessman in C-level positions most of his life, but when the recession hit, he made a life changing decision to pursue a new route of business, one that he was passionate about - School of Rock , the leader in performance-based music education. After learning this lesson at such a young age, Elyse was determined to let her passion shine within the family business, becoming a successful General Manager of a thriving franchise at the young age of 23. Elyse has always had a special place in her heart for helping children and she wanted to be a part of something that would have a positive impact on her community by helping kids develop self-confidence and empower them to accomplish anything they put their minds to. From the moment she walked into a School of Rock, she was dedicated to her new position, growing the business and providing a musical outlet for kids.
How has your life experience made you the leader you are today?
My family has played a huge role in the leader I am today. I grew up as the oldest child with two younger brothers, which really helped develop my leadership skills from a young age, along with a desire to help my parents in any way that I could. I think that desire to help translated well to owning a family business and acting as General Manager. I also grew up learning from my dad, a wonderful businessman and entrepreneur, who believed in me just as much as he did my brothers.
How did your previous employment experience aid your position at School of Rock?
I got into this family business young--not my first job right out of college, but just about. However, I began working as soon as I could at age 16 at an ice cream shop, moved onto working in a restaurant, worked through college as a tutor, and in the summers worked in retail. I've basically been in customer service since I was a teenager, which helps me now as I currently work with both my employees and my customers. I then got a job right out of college at a local magazine as the administrative assistant. At that time I was pursuing writing, but found out that wasn't what I wanted. I also happened to work much more with the sales department and financial team than the writers, which actually turned out to be great experience for later. That job truly gave me a great primer in customer service and being a cheerful and helpful face of a company--as well as learning how to multi-task and juggle lots of jobs at once, which has proved useful in running a small business.
How do you maintain a work/life balance?
Work/life balance is tough, especially for someone in my generation. My family got internet access when I was in junior high and I've been pretty much constantly "plugged in" since then. I think the only times I haven't checked my emails since we opened School of Rock is maybe a day or two of vacation when our doors were already closed, and an occasional Sunday over the past couple years. It's something I'm working on getting better at, but I think that's my biggest struggle in that balance. It's so easy to work from anywhere and at any time that it's difficult to say no. But, I don't think I'm alone--I know a lot of other people my age with careers who have a hard time unplugging.  I've actually thought of attending an unplugged conference that takes place in my city at a monastery--a full day without internet, your phone, anything--but I don't know if I have the guts. This is something the Millennial workforce needs to get better at, myself included.
What have the highlights and challenges been during your tenure at School of Rock?
The biggest highlights have been relationships with people--students, parents, teachers, members of the community. Seeing students light up when they walk into School of Rock, seeing their parents try to drag them out when they're supposed to leave, parents telling us how excited their kid is to come in, meeting amazing parents who really care about their kids, music instructors who are extremely passionate not only about music but about affecting kids' lives -- those are the things that get me up in the morning. The "why" behind what we do is all of these things, and it makes every struggle worth it. The biggest challenges have involved getting a small business off the ground, from financial struggles to finding the right people--but all I have to do is watch the kids perform, with their joy and passion evident on their faces, and all of a sudden I'm reignited.
What has been the secret to your business success at School of Rock?
Business gurus like Seth Godin and Simon Sinek often talk about the secret to running a successful business, which is to focus on the good you're doing, the excellence of the product you're selling, the importance of the relationships with your customers and above all the "why" behind what you're doing. My dad is a business coach and is constantly reminding our team to keep at the forefront of our minds our goal: to inspire kids to rock on stage and in life. If we focus on that, everything else will fall into place; and it works. People can tell when your primary goal for your business is much larger and more important than financial success or attaining customers. That was one of the things we fell in love with about School of Rock as a brand; they truly focus on what's important, which is affecting kids' lives in a positive way.
What advice can you offer young women wanting to pursue management positions?
My suggestions for young women wanting to pursue management positions are to believe in yourself, to be open to coaching and growing as a manager, and to value and respect the people in positions above you, alongside you, and under you.
What do you think is the biggest issue for women in the workplace?
I think it depends on what industry you're in and the environment. A small business like ours is very different from a corporate environment. However, I think overall, women have to overcome their fear of managing, fear of success, fear of how they're being perceived. And honestly, men struggle with a lot of those same issues. I think a lot of challenges we label as women's issues are really life-issues everyone deals with. I've run into someone not respecting me because I'm a woman, but I've also run into someone not respecting me because I'm young, so it's not always necessarily a gender issue.
What are your thoughts on Sheryl Sandberg's Lean In book and movement?
I have to confess, I haven't read the book from cover to cover; however, I know a lot of women who really enjoyed the book. I commend Sandberg on writing such a successful and inspirational book for women. I think it's an important movement, one that's offering plenty of positive encouragement and coaching for women in the workplace.
How has mentorship made a difference in your professional and personal life?
One of my favorite aspects about this family business is my dad's mentorship of me. Having someone encourage me, teach me, and coach me in the business world as I learn how to be the best manager I can has been incredibly important. Even just to hear his insight as a seasoned businessman is invaluable; something that may seem like a huge deal to me, he quickly puts things into perspective in light of everything he's experienced in the last thirty years since he's been in the business world.
Which other female leaders do you admire and why?
I often think about my two previous female bosses. They did such a great job encouraging me and never belittling me, pushing me to do things I didn't know I could do. They set a great example of what I strive to be as an employer. I've also met some inspiring local women who own and run their own businesses that I admire. These are the leaders that inspire me to be better.
What are your hopes for the future of School of Rock?
I think everyone who's involved with School of Rock, from the corporate management team to the franchisees to the instructors all hope for the same thing: to positively affect more and more students' lives. It's a mission that's most recently been expanded to adults and even to other countries. School of Rock has more than 140 schools in eight countries, with more than 17,000 students. As School of Rock grows as a brand, it will be amazing to track, years from now, the positive effects we've had on students and in our local communities.

Walmart Black FridayNov 12, 2014 9:17am

Black Friday will last longer at Walmart. The world’s biggest retailer says its best discounts will be offered on TVs, tablets, toys and other goods over a five day period at the end of this month and into early December. “Black Friday is no longer about waking up at the crack of dawn to stand in long lines and hope for the best,” says Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising officer, Walmart U.S.
One reason why Walmart and other major retailers are stretching out the deals beyond Black Friday is that many more shoppers are using their smartphones to compare prices. “It’s more prevalent among consumer electronics,” says Sheri Petras CEO of CSI Group, a customer research firm. “It’s easier to compare versus fashion where you try it on and you are not exactly sure if the dress that’s over here might not be the dress that’s over there.”
A memo from Walmart headquarters to store managers calls on them to improve performance in their meat, dairy and produce departments. The New York Times reports that last month Walmart issued a sensitive “urgent agenda” memo to managers across the country. The order tells managers to make sure that aging meat and baked goods are discounted “to maximize the chance that those items will sell before their expiration dates,” says The Times. “The memo also tells stores to be sure to “rotate” dairy products and eggs, which means removing expired items and adding new stock at the bottom and back of display cases.”
U.S., British and Swiss regulators fined five global banks more than $3 billion for attempted manipulation of foreign exchange markets. Citibank, JP Morgan Chase Bank, HSBC, UBS, and the Royal Bank of Scotland have been penalized.  Clive Adamson, with Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority, warned the banks not to reward their executives for profits gained though dishonest practices. “We would expect firms to think hard about this during the current bonus round and we’ll be reviewing that very carefully,” he said.
A trade deal between the U.S. and China could end tariffs on $1 trillion in global sales of semiconductors and other high tech items. President Obama, now in Beijing, says an understanding has been reached. Apple HP and Microsoft are among the American forms likely to benefit from the deal. Chinese high-tech exporters will also be helped by ending tariffs, which give domestic goods a price advantage for customers over imported ones. The expanded deal would eliminate those costs for multiple high-tech products such as global positioning systems, medical equipment, software and gadgets — leveling the playing field for those items.
Ford is using aluminum almost exclusively in the body of the 2015 version of its best-selling F-150 pickup, which will arrive at dealerships next month.

Ford hopes the advantages outweigh customer doubts about the durability of aluminum or potential repair costs for the pricier metal. It’s a big risk. So far this year, one out of every three vehicles Ford sold in the U.S. was an F-Series pickup.

The test to textualism in King v. Burwell: A Reply to Abbe GluckBy Jonathan H. Adler November 12
Tuesday afternoon I had the pleasure of debating/discussing King v. Burwell with Professor Abbe Gluck at the Yale Law School. Professor Gluck is one of the more thoughtful and persistent critics of the plaintiffs’ claims in King and the other cases challenging the lawfulness of the IRS rule granting tax credits for the purchase of health insurance in exchanges established by the federal government.  The event, co-hosted by the Yale Federalist Society and American Constitution Society, was moderated by Linda Greenhouse, and they packed the room.  (Maybe it was the food.)  Alas, the event was not recorded, so you’ll have to take my word that we had a vigorous yet civil and informative exchange. I think those assembled got a good sense of the competing arguments on each side in these cases.
Since I can’t post a link to audio or video (and I had some time at the airport), I thought I’d instead take the opportunity to respond to Professor Gluck’s contribution to the recent  SCOTUSBlog symposium  on King v. Burwell,  “The grant in King – Obamacare subsidies as textualism’s big test.”   It’s a thoughtful piece, but I don’t think I’m revealing a spoiler when I say I’m not convinced. Indeed, I think this piece helps show why the government has such a hard time mounting a textualist defense of the IRS rule.
For starters, it’s interesting to note that Professor Gluck frames her piece as a defense of textualism.  She writes that “King is about the proper way to engage in textual interpretation; specifically, about the interpretation of five words in a long and complex modern statute.” I’d agree with that.  While I don’t think the argument against the IRS rule is confined to these five words (“Exchange established by the State”), Professor Gluck is correct that the meaning of this phrase should control the outcome.
Professor Gluck also maintains that “no one has to – or should – go outside the four corners of the Affordable Care (ACA) to decide it.” I agree with that too (and I suppose this means Professor Gluck is no longer urging the adoption of a  “CBO Canon”  to resolve this case). When Michael Cannon and I embarked on our survey of the legislative history of the PPACA’s exchange and tax credit provisions for our  Health Matrix article , we did so because we knew many commentators (and, potentially, courts) would care about such things (and because the PPACA provides an interesting case study of unconventional lawmaking). But I have always maintained that the text should control and that the text should be interpreted in accordance with traditional norms of statutory interpretation.
From what Professor Gluck writes in her SCOTUSBlog essay, we agree on the importance of various textualist principles, such as the need to look at the context of specific textual provisions and to consider the overall structure of a statute when seeking to identify what the text means. Professor Gluck cites Justice Scalia’s opinion in  UARG v. EPA , a case from last term in which the Supreme Court confronted another large, complex, and at times difficult-to-parse statute: the Clean Air Act. Specifically, she cites Justice Scalia’s statement that the Court must do its best to observe the “fundamental canon of statutory construction that the words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.”  Agreed, but there’s more to it than that.
What Professor Gluck omits is what else Justice Scalia has to say in the same opinion just a few pages later:
An agency has no power to “tailor” legislation to bureaucratic policy goals by rewriting unambiguous statutory terms. . . .
The power of executing laws necessarily includes both authority and responsibility to resolve some questions left open by Congress that arise during the law’s administration. But it does not include a power to revise clear statutory terms that turn out not to work in practice. . . .
We reaffirm the core administrative-law principle that an agency may not rewrite clear statutory terms to suit its own sense of how the statute should operate.
Justice Scalia’s UARG opinion instructs courts to both consider context and to preserve the meaning of clear statutory terms.  Further, as Justice Kagan explained in another case from last term ( Michigan v. Bay Mills Indian Community ), courts have “no roving license, in even ordinary cases of statutory interpretation, to disregard clear language simply on the view that . . . Congress ‘must have intended’ something” other than what the statute’s text actually says.
The scenario Justice Scalia was addressing in UARG is actually quite similar to what we see in King. The Clean Air Act has some provisions that are not entirely clear. A term like “pollutant” necessarily means pollutant, but which pollutants depends upon the context and operation of a given provision.  Even when Congress refers to “any pollutant” and provides definitions for the term, there is some residual ambiguity about the scope of the term (though, again, “pollutant” must mean pollutant).
At the same time, there are other terms and phrases in the statute, such as “100 tons-per-year” or “250 tons-per-year,” that are perfectly clear. While the Court has an obligation to consider context, particularly when trying to bring precision to the definition of potentially ambiguous terms (or to identify the constraints within which an agency may operate after a finding of ambiguity), the Court must also ensure that “clear statutory terms” mean what they say. Only when a Court does both of these things can we say that it has followed textualist principles and adopted an interpretation that, as  Justice Scalia further counsels , “does least violence to the text.”
The parallel between UARG and King is instructive. Both involve terms (“pollutant,” “Exchange”) that are defined in the statute yet may yield to slightly different interpretations when placed in specific contexts. At the same time, both include phrases (the CAA’s numerical emission thresholds, “established by the State”) that are perfectly clear. Under UARG, and fairly traditional rules of statutory interpretation, it may be permissible to stretch or mold the understanding of the former given context and other factors, but the clear statutory text of the latter must be observed.  These words cannot be written off or treated as a nullity.
The relevant provisions of the PPACA in Section 1401 (and it is provisions, plural, contrary to what many pundits claim and even if one ignores the cross-references), both make reference to Exchanges established by the State under [Section] 1311.” If these provisions were referring to Exchanges, as generically defined under Section 1563, or even to “Exchanges established . . . under 1311,” there would be no reason to include this additional language. (Language which, it is worth remembering, was added to multiple places at multiple times.) The law is clear about what “establish” means. This word is used throughout the text, and exchanges are identified as those “established” by states (1311) and those “established” by the federal government (1321). Further, Section 1321 instructs HHS to both “establish and operate” its exchanges.  It is also clear what a State is, and that the states and the federal government are quite distinct.
Professor Gluck takes a different view. She writes:
Section 1401 can still be read literally because the section that authorizes the federal exchanges, Section 1321, provides that if a state does not establish an exchange under Section 1311, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) “shall . . . establish and operate such Exchange within the State.” In other words, HHS must “establish” a Section 1311 exchange, which is a state exchange. Moreover, the Act defines “Exchange,” with a capital E, three times in the statute as a “state” exchange. And HHS, in Section 1321, is told to establish “such [capital E] Exchange.” The Court need not add or delete a single word of the ACA to reach this conclusion.
Note what her account omits, the repeated qualification that coverage months and premium amounts must both be calculated with reference to insurance purchased in an Exchange established by the State. Note also, as her account acknowledges, under Section 1321 it is HHS that is doing the establishing of the exchange.  While embracing context, her interpretation ignores inconvenient-yet-perfectly-clear statutory terms.
A more complete consideration of context further illustrates the error of this interpretation. The statute defines “Exchange.” Specifically, Section 1563 (the second 1563, as there are three in the PPACA) provides: “The term ‘Exchange’ means an American Health Benefit Exchange established under section 1311 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.” Read in isolation, this definition might seem to support Professor Gluck’s suggestion that all exchanges are to be treated alike for all purposes.  But we should not read this, or any other provision, in isolation.
Section 1551 of the statute also provides that this definition applies “unless specifically provided for otherwise.” So, when the word “Exchange” is used without qualification, we can presume the 1563 definition applies and the statute is speaking of a Section 1311 exchange. When it is modified or qualified, however, the statute instructs us to pay attention to that fact. Thus, when Section 1401 specifies that the Exchange must be one “established by the State,” it does not matter that those established by the federal government under Section 1321 exchanges may be otherwise equivalent to Section 1311 exchanges for some purposes because the statute has specified that we’re not simply talking about an “Exchange” or even a Section 1311 Exchange, but an “Exchange established by the State under 1311.” The statute has identified an additional characteristic that these exchanges must satisfy for the purposes of these provisions.
Professor Gluck goes on to argue that other provisions of the law are “slashed to pieces” by an interpretation that insists “established by the State” means “established by the State.” She cites two provisions in particular.  Read in context, however, neither of these provisions proves her case, and there are other portions of the statute which undermine it.
Here is Professor Gluck’s first example:
Section 36B(f)(3) requires “[e]ach Exchange (or any person carrying out 1 or more responsibilities of an Exchange under section 1311(f)(3) or 1321(c)” to report the premiums doled out. Section 1321 is the federal exchange provision, and so this section is rendered meaningless if the federal exchanges have no subsidies.
This is a very selective description of the reporting provisions added in the HCERA reconciliation bill. Yes, this provision requires the reporting of tax credits, but it requires the reporting of lots of things, including the level and duration of coverage, premiums “without regard to any credit,” information on those covered by the policy, and more. This information matters to the federal government whether or not tax credits are issued. As the D.C. Circuit explained in its  Halbig opinion , “Even if credits are unavailable on federal Exchanges, reporting by those Exchanges still serves the purpose of enforcing the individual mandate—a point the IRS, in fact, acknowledged in promulgating a recent regulation, 26 C.F.R. § 1.6055-1(d)(1).”
A premise of Professor Gluck’s claim is that it would be nonsensical to apply these reporting requirements where there are no tax credits. Yet these provisions apply to all insurance purchases on exchanges, and not all those buying insurance on exchanges are eligible for tax credits. Moreover, the provision applies to “any person carrying out 1 or more responsibilities of an Exchange,” so even those involved with exchanges that have nothing to do with tax credits must report relevant information. So, even under her interpretation, these provisions apply to entities and transactions where tax credits are absent. Finally, this provision – unlike Section 1401 – makes explicit reference to both Section 1311 and Section 1321 exchanges, which would be completely unnecessary if, as Professor Gluck claims, the two types of exchanges are equivalent for any and all purposes.
Her next example highlights what many see as the most problematic statutory provision for the plaintiffs’ case.
Section 1312(f) provides that only “qualified individuals” can purchase on an Exchange but defines a qualified individual as one who “resides in the State that established the Exchange.” Failure to understand a federally operated exchange as the legal equivalent of a state exchange would mean that federal exchanges have no customers.
Here it’s worth remembering that definition of exchanges I noted above. This provision (Section 1312(f)) is one of several identifying the requirements of Section 1311 exchanges. The reference to “an Exchange” under the Section 1563 is presumed to be a Section 1311 exchange which, under Section 1311, is an exchange established by the state. Read in context, this provision – like other parts of Section 1311, 1312, and 1313 that detail requirements of Section 1311 exchanges – speaks to the establishing state and is identifying a requirement of a state-established exchange.
Section 1321, however, while requiring the federal government to “establish and operate” the “required exchange” does not create an exchange “established by the State.” In this way, Section 1321 takes us out of the default definition of an exchange.  This exchange is not that defined under Section 1563 because it is otherwise specified as being one “established” under a different provision by a different entity. Therefore, we need not read Section 1312(f)’s “qualified individual” provision as directly binding on the Section 1321 exchange. Further confirmation of this reading comes from the fact that Section 1321 goes on to provide HHS with the authority to replicate the various requirements for Section 1311 exchanges.  That is, Section 1321 anticipates that the requirements for Section 1311 exchanges cannot all, automatically apply to Section 1321 exchanges, so it gives HHS the power to fill those gaps.
Is this account of Section 1312(f) persuasive? Consider two more things. First, this interpretation, unlike that offered in defense of the IRS rule, preserves the plain meaning of “established by the State,” and thus does less violence to the overall text of the PPACA than one which would give this phrase no meaning at all. Second, this provision – Section 1312(f) – at worst, is ambiguous. But if this provision is ambiguous, that tells us nothing about the meaning of Section 1401, and it certainly does not justify ignoring the text of Section 1401.  As courts have noted time and again with other large, complex statutes, ambiguity in one provision does not render the entire statute ambiguous.  Under Chevron, what matters is whether there is ambiguity on the precise question at issue.
Pretending that “established by the State” does not mean “established by the State” creates other problems when one looks at the statute as a whole. This phrase is used in several provisions throughout the PPACA. In each case, these provisions serve to facilitate coordination between state exchanges and other programs or to provide incentives for state action. Thus the use of “Exchange established by the State” in these provisions is not anomalous at all.
In some of these provisions, however, adopting Professor Gluck’s interpretation – that “Exchange established by the State” means both those established by the States and those established by the federal government – creates some anomalous results.
For example, Section 1311(f) authorizes states to establish “one or more subsidiary exchanges.” Pursuant to this, 1311(f)(3)(A) provides that “A State may elect to authorize an Exchange established by the State under this section to enter into an agreement with an eligible entity to carry out 1 or more responsibilities of the Exchange.” If “established by the State” means an exchange that is, in fact, established by the State, this makes perfect sense. But if it also means an Exchange established by the federal government it creates the anomalous situation that a state that elected not to create its own exchange is deciding whether the federal government is allowed to enter into contracts to create subsidiary exchanges.
Then there’s Section 2001, the so-called “maintenance of effort” provision. It provides that states are not allowed to tighten existing eligibility standards under the State’s Medicaid program until the date on which the Secretary determines that an Exchange established by the State under section 1311” is operational. A state that fails to comply risks losing its Medicaid funds. There are two ways to read this provision. Under one, this provision says to states: You can’t throw people off of your Medicaid program by tightening existing eligibility rules until you’ve created an exchange. That makes sense, as it prevents states from creating a coverage gap, even if leveraging Medicaid in this way is constitutionally suspect under NFIB.
Now consider the alternative read. If the “Exchange established by the State” could be either a state or federal exchange, the provision is problematic. This is because for the state that does not create an exchange and wishes to alter its eligibility requirements, continued receipt of Medicaid money is conditioned on the federal government getting around to launching an exchange.  The state’s flexibility to alter its own program is not contingent on what the state does, but on what the federal government does.  Thus the state’s receipt of Medicaid funds is held hostage to federal action.
To understand why this is so problematic, it is worth revisiting the Medicaid portions of the NFIB v. Sebelius oral argument.  If there was one thing that concerned the justices more than a potentially coercive use of conditional spending controlled by a clear statutory requirement, it was the prospect of a potentially coercive use of conditional spending controlled by administrative discretion.  In the former case, the state has some certainty, and the notion that conditional grants of funds are like contracts is observed.  In the latter case, however, all a state can do is cross its fingers and hope the federal government does that which is required to unlock their funds and programmatic flexibility.  So however problematic one believes Section 2001 when one believes “established by the State” means established by the State, the alternative reading of this phrase is even worse.
Next let’s turn to Section 2201. Here, under Section 2201(a), the PPACA states that “a condition of . . . receipt of any Federal financial assistance under section 1903(a) for calendar quarters beginning after January 1, 2014” is meeting several requirements. One of those is that the state must “establish procedures” for (among other things)
ensuring that the State agency responsible for administering the State plan under this title (in this section referred to as the ‘State Medicaid agency’), the State agency responsible for administering the State child health plan under title XXI (in this section referred to as the ‘State CHIP agency’) and an Exchange established by the State under section 1311 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act utilize a secure electronic interface sufficient to allow for a determination of an individual’s eligibility for such medical assistance, child health assistance, or premium assistance, and enrollment in the State plan under this title, title XXI, or a qualified health plan, as appropriate;
So, the state must “ensur[e] that . . . an Exchange established by the State under section 1311 . . . utilize[s] a secure electronic interface.” As applied to exchanges that are, in fact, established by the State, this makes sense. As applied to federal exchanges, however, this provision makes no sense. How can a state be expected to “establish procedures” to ensure that a federal exchanges – those established and operated by the federal government – “utilize a secure electronic interface sufficient to allow for a determination of an individual’s eligibility”? States can certainly establish such procedures for the exchanges they create and control but states cannot tell federal entities what to do. And yet this is an obligation imposed on states as a condition of continuing to receive Medicaid funds. Perhaps this provision too is unenforceable post-NFIB, but there is no question it only makes sense if an “Exchange established by the State” is, in fact, an Exchange established by the State.
A few other tidbits, Professor Gluck repeats the error made by others that there are three definitions of “Exchange” in the PPACA. That is untrue. There is only one real definition, that which is provided in Section 1563. Indeed, one of the others referenced is nothing approaching a definition at all. It is, as it is expressly labeled, a requirement of 1311 exchanges. It says as much and operates as such. Indeed, were it otherwise ( as my co-author explained ) for-profit exchanges could be transmuted into not-for-profits exchanges, and that would be quite absurd (and defeat the clear purpose of that provision to boot).
Although she says we should focus on the text, Professor Gluck cites language from the NFIB v. Sebelius joint dissent endorsing the government’s understanding of how exchanges would operate. Yet this was not an issue in the case beyond the question of severability, and on that question the dissenters’ view did not prevail. It is not a holding of the court. Further, the joint dissent is hardly an authoritative account of the PPACA’s text. Indeed, the dissent makes the indisputably false claim that that “The ACA requires each State to establish a health-insurance ‘exchange.’” The law does not require any such thing. Indeed, under well-established principles, it couldn’t.
Professor Gluck’s purpose in citing the NFIB dissent, beyond making it awkward for its authors to take a different view of the exchange provisions today, is to suggest that it would be absurd to think Congress would have enacted a statute that could be, in large part, undone due to state intransigence. Yet Congress has done that before, and even did it in the ACA. Medicaid relies upon state cooperation, both as initially enacted and as modified in the ACA. The Supreme Court modified the terms of the deal in NFIB, but it did not alter the fundamental premise that, with Medicaid, Congress offers states a deal, and if states refuse, then Congress’s purpose is frustrated.
Professor Gluck has  elsewhere argued  that the exchange provisions are different from Medicaid because Congress created a fallback: a federal exchange. Yet that’s what Congress does all the time in “cooperative federalism” statutes, while simultaneously providing states with incentives to act. So, for instance, under the Clean Air Act, if a state refuses to implement the program, the federal government will step in. In addition, the recalcitrant state foregoes some benefits (funding for environmental programs and highways), and also suffers some sanctions (more onerous offset requirements).
As the CAA is structured, if only a few states refuse to cooperate, it is no big deal, as the EPA can take over for them and provide the desired fallback. Yet if thirty-six states were to refuse to implement the CAA’s provisions, the core of the statute would come crashing down, as the federal EPA does not have the resources to take on the permitting and enforcement obligations currently shouldered by states. Nowhere close. So Congress has indisputably done what defenders of the IRS rule say it would never do: condition benefits on state cooperation in a program that will not function as Congress had hoped should a sufficient number of states refuse to hum the federal government’s tune.
The structure Congress adopted in the exchange provisions does not undermine the plaintiff’s arguments either. All the eligibility requirements for tax credits – that insurance be purchased on an exchange, that it be an exchange “established by the State,” that the individual fall within the requisite income range, etc. – are contained in the same place: Section 1401. And these limitations are precisely where Congress has put similar limitations on the receipt of tax credits for other forms of health insurance before. So there is nothing odd, awkward or unprecedented with what Congress did here, as it is completely in line with what it’s done before.
Professor Gluck reminds the reader that,
Justice Scalia’s own statutory interpretation treatise argues (at pages 63 and 168) that “there can be no justification for needlessly rendering provisions in conflict if they can be interpreted harmoniously,” and that statutory provisions should not be interpreted to render them ineffective or superfluous.
Precisely. However poorly the PPACA may be written, it is Professor Gluck’s interpretation, and that interpretation urged by the government, that renders the repeated phrase “established by the State” superfluous and creates unnecessary conflict within the statute. And it is this interpretation that seeks to deprive clear statutory terms of no meaning.  Thus it is this interpretation that does the most violence to the statutory text that Congress actually enacted into law.
At this point it should be clear that the case against the IRS rule is not based upon one phrase read in isolation or a single statutory provision ripped from context. The argument is based upon a consideration of the entire PPACA – the one that Congress wrote and enacted into law, not the one that others may have preferred.  This argument considers how the law’s various provisions interrelate and the context in which these provisions appear. In sum, it is an argument based upon well-established approaches to statutory interpretation, and it is an argument that most would readily accept were we not talking about the PPACA.
So, by all means, confine the inquiry in King to the text of the PPACA, for it is the text – and not any unexpressed intentions – that are the law. If that is what the Supreme Court does, it should conclude that the IRS tax credit rule is unlawful.  By July of next year we will see if that is what the Court does.

What X gets wrong about YBy Alyssa Rosenberg November 12 Follow @AlyssaRosenberg
Matthew McConaughey in “Interstellar.” (Melinda Sue Gordon/Warner Bros. Entertainment/Paramount Pictures)
“Interstellar,” a big new movie based in part on the work of physicist Kip Thorne , rocked the box office this weekend, and so the season of fact-checking pieces is upon us once again. Slate warned us about “what the movie gets wrong and really wrong about black holes, relativity, plot, and dialogue,” only for the writer to follow up and explain his own mistakes in the original . Neil deGrasse Tyson has weighed in enthusiastically , though with some caveats.
These kinds of pieces have become increasingly popular in recent years, and not entirely for bad reasons. Audiences want to debate the ideas in pop culture, and these sorts of pieces help them do it. I have even written pieces like this (or at least pieces with similar headlines ). But I have come to hate “What x gets wrong about y” as a mode of pop culture criticism. This kind of framing is meant to spark discussion. But it shuts it down instead, and these pieces diminish the power of art in the process.
I do not think anyone is surprised by the idea that fiction is a departure from reality. The people in novels, film, television, comics and songs are nonexistent or licensed versions of real ones, for reasons both creative and legal. And the demands of storytelling inevitably put pressure on history and science, warping them to conform to the length of a 120-minute biopic or a 12-episode prestige television season.
It has become common, though, for creators of fiction and their fans to make claims of authenticity or accuracy as marketing devices. “Interstellar” will show you what it is really like to pass through a black hole! Tarantino enthusiasts battle with ‘ 12 Years a Slave ‘ partisans over the history of American cruelty! When artists and the marketing departments that support them float these ideas, they are inviting audiences and journalists to test those assertions.
When observers go digging, they inevitably find something that went factually wrong. And if they were fact-checking biography or history, these discoveries might be proof of shoddy research or a flawed thesis such that the work ought to be rejected out of hand. But with fiction, diversions from fact are not disqualifying. Instead, they invite further questions. Do writers know they have diverted from the facts? If they do, why did they make those decisions? Are the changes matters of storytelling economy, or pure dramatic bang for the buck? Or are the creators trying to say something significant about the world we live in and the alternative they are imagining into being?
In the case of something like “Dallas Buyers Club,” what are the incentives to portray AZT as dangerous and the government as untrustworthy , given the progress both treatment regimens and bureaucrats have made from the early days of the AIDS crisis? What is the political alchemy behind the relative fantasy of sexual assault investigation and prosecution that is a show like “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit”? Where does the drive to try to claim historical figures as gay in biopics come from? What narrative constraints does “The Wire” operate under by hewing closely to David Simon’s nonfiction reporting on the war on drugs, and what innovations does the show come up with as a result? If an industry is depicted as less diverse than it really was at a given point in time, as is true with the Madison Avenue of “Mad Men,” what does that mean for our assumptions about the pace of progress in the past and what is possible in the future?
History and nonfiction are constrained by what is true and what we can reasonably ascertain. It is fiction’s liberty and fiction’s responsibility to take us further. Interrogating pop culture’s relationship to the facts is a way of thinking about how well art has done in transporting us or making us see things differently. Some fiction can make major revisions and still get us someplace remarkable. And being factually accurate is no guarantee that a story will launch and help us take flight beyond ourselves.

In Panamas rain forest  death means more lifePanama's rainforest canopy borders the Chagres River and the Caribbean Sea. (Erin Spear/University of Utah)
In Panama's forest, death is a beautiful thing.
It kills ultimately for a good reason, so that trees in a wetter part of the forest can grow big and strong. according to a new study published in the Journal of Ecology.
"That’s exactly right," said Erin R. Spear, lead author of the research and a doctoral candidate in biology at the University of Utah. "We have this negative perspective on pathogens and disease. We think of pathogens as being destroyers, and in this case they are constructors."
The killing part, Spear admits, is still ugly. Death sends a gang of pathogens in a wetter part of the forest to dispatch seeds that wind up there from a drier part of the forest. They meet their end in a slow, agonizing demise that looks perfectly awful on time lapse video.
But the cold truth is that seeds from the drier side carried about 40 miles by wind and birds had no business being in a place where they can hardly survive. Seedlings native to the wetter side have developed better defenses against attacking viruses, bacteria, disease and fungus that thrive there, but for drier seedlings it might as well be the set of a horror film.
Essentially, killing drier seedlings in their cribs creates space, and more space allows more diverse species of trees that can not only survive but grow into leviathans on the wetter side. "They’re allowing more tree species to exist in a given area," Spear said. The wood and canopy creates a greater habitat for birds and other fauna. They also provide "better water quality, [regulate] carbon in the atmosphere, raw material for medicine and food."
How seedlings live and die in Panama provides a lesson to conservationists trying to determine how tree canopies will shift as the climate warms. It will inform their understanding of whether trees in some temperate areas can survive in others, before they embark on massive and expensive replanting efforts that are doomed to fail.
It had long been suspected that the pathogens slither up to seeds that wander too far from home. But Spears and her fellow researchers -- Thomas A. Kursar and Phyllis D. Coley, professors at the university and researchers at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama -- set out to investigate if it actually happened and how.
Panama, as everyone knows, is a narrow strip of land connecting Central and South America, sandwiched by the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, and slashed by the famous canal.
The volume of rain on the Atlantic side basically doubles the amount on the Pacific side, giving life to more types of pathogens than anyone has bothered to count. By comparison, the drier side is virtually disease free.

Spear, Coley and Kursar established 30 gardens in each part of the forests and seeded them with the progeny of 12 species of trees. Spear hiked for miles to collect some seeds, and kayaked in the canal to grab overhanging tree fruit that contained others. She even rode "a crane-carried gondola more than 100 feet upward into the forest canopy" for seeds, a statement for the study said.
When the seeds were planted for the experiment, it didn't take long to spot damage. One species was dead within a week. "In some cases, we could actually see the pathogen growing on the seedling," Spear said.
Within three weeks, nearly 40 percent of more than 700 seedlings were damaged, and most of it by far was on the pathogen-rich wetter side. Seventy-percent were more likely to be damaged there.
Every seed planted was at a much greater risk of an attack in the wetter forest, but drier seeds didn't put up much of a fight. "On the whole, seedlings of the dry-forest species suffered relatively high levels of pathogen-caused damage and mortality in both forests. In fact, seedlings of dry-forest species were at a greater risk of pathogen-caused mortality in the drier forest than seedlings of wet-forest species," the study said.
Death's defense of the wetter part of the forest could actually save it from greater harm. Because it gets less rain, the dry forest is favored area for agriculture, housing developments and resorts that help denude it. In a sample of a 40 by 40 meter plot, the researchers counted 57 species of trees on the drier side, compared to 174 species on the wetter side.
Overall, about 495 tree species in the wetter forests compared to 101 restricted to the drier forests with several intermediate species of trees between them.
"I think a cool aspect to our study is it's broadly applicable to other plant communities," including forests in the United States, Spear said. "We can control where species can and can’t grow, and better predict how distributions might change as the climate warms, especially where we’re at risk of losing species."
Animals, like this sloth in the canopy of rainforest on Panama’s Atlantic coast, capture our attention but trees are essential for feeding and sheltering those animals. (Erin R. Spear/University of Utah)

Club for Growth gets a jump on 2016By Jose A. DelReal November 12 Follow jdelreal

Fresh off the 2014 election cycle, the conservative Club for Growth announced Wednesday that it is endorsing six incumbent GOP senators facing competitive, high-profile races in 2016.
The group announced its support for Marco Rubio of Florida, Rand Paul of Kentucky, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, Tim Scott of South Carolina, Mike Lee of Utah and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin. With the exception of Scott – who was appointed to his seat by Gov. Nikki Haley in 2013 and won another partial term in a special election Nov. 4 – the senators all waged their last campaigns in 2010 as the tea party wave gained momentum.
“The pro-growth class of 2010 has done excellent work in the United States Senate. Our members want to make sure they stay there for another six years,” Club for Growth President Chris Chocola said in a written statement. “The Club for Growth PAC is ready to stand by these members of Congress – all of whom have a consistent record of voting for pro-growth policies."
The club’s endorsements are extremely significant, in no small part because of the millions of dollars it has mobilized for its candidates. This latest round of endorsements are not only unique for their promptness, but also because it means that the group will likely stand alongside establishment groups such as the National Republican Senatorial Committee in these races. (The club has been known to rally support against incumbent Republican candidates.)
"With such an important group, the Club’s PAC is taking the major step of endorsing all six incumbent Senators now, and declaring their re-election as our top electoral priority for 2016,” the organization said in a news release.

There are more estimated NFL fans in Mexico City than in D.C.  Baltimore and 23 other NFL marketsBy Scott Allen November 12 Follow @ScottSAllen
(John McDonnell/The Washington Post)
Amid the talk of the NFL one day putting an expansion team in London , Nate Silver of ESPN’s fivethirtyeight.com offers a compelling argument for why the league might want to first consider a few cities closer to home.
Looking at cities that already have NFL teams and a few potential expansion markets for his analysis, Silver multiplied a metro area’s population by the volume of Google searches it conducts for NFL-related topics. He then calibrated the estimate of NFL fans in a given metro area to the U.S. average of 28 percent who say they are avid NFL fans.
The largest estimated NFL fan bases are in New York (5.45 million), Los Angeles (3.66 million) and Chicago (2.7 million). Five of the top six metro areas already have NFL teams, with L.A. being the exception. Mexico City ranks seventh, despite the fact that  only seven percent of its population is estimated to be NFL fans.
Washington, D.C. is ninth, sandwiched between Miami and Phoenix, with an estimated fan base of 1.38 million. Silver’s method suggests 29 percent of the D.C. metro area’s 4.79 million residents are NFL fans.
Baltimore’s estimated fan base (850,000) ranks 18th, three spots below Toronto, but 38 percent of the Baltimore metro area’s 2.26 million people are NFL fans, the highest percentage in Silver’s study.
Los Angeles, Mexico City and Toronto are the only cities without NFL franchises in the top 20. Las Vegas (22), Sacramento (28), Virginia Beach-Norfolk (30) and San Antonio (31) all rank above London (33).
The smallest estimated fan bases in metro areas that have NFL teams are Nashville (230,000), Jacksonville (290,000) and New Orleans (290,000).

The split between Obama and the FCC on net neutrality  in plain EnglishBy Brian Fung November 12 Follow @b_fung

Late Tuesday, Nancy Scola and I reported on a split between Obama and his top telecom regulator over net neutrality. This post attempts to expand on that with a plain-English analysis — to the best of our understanding — of where things stand at the Federal Communications Commission and how we might expect them to unfold next.
Here's what's going on, in a nutshell: Obama wants FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler to ensure net neutrality — the principle that all Internet traffic is treated equally — by implementing a certain set of rules. Wheeler isn't completely sold on the idea. That's exposed a rift between the two men. The question now is whether that rift will grow larger or smaller in the coming weeks.
To understand why the rift exists, we have to talk about what Obama proposed. In essence, Obama wants the FCC to adopt the most aggressive policy possible to preserve the open Internet. Internet activists (and Democrats) love this, because it allows the FCC to bring the full power of its authority to bear. The proposal is known as "reclassification," whereby the FCC starts to regulate Internet service providers under a part of the communications law known as Title II. With this power, Wheeler can set down rules explicitly prohibiting the blockage of Internet traffic, as well as "unjust" or "unreasonable" discrimination of data that might lead to some Web sites being sped up at the expense of others.
For understandable reasons, telecom companies (and Republicans) hate the idea. They've bashed it as regulation of the Internet and said it will prevent them from making network upgrades and finding new business models. They've also argued that reclassification doesn't achieve Obama's net neutrality goals anyway, because the phrase "unjust" or "unreasonable" technically permits behaviors that ISPs can claim are, in fact, just and reasonable.
Whatever the merits of these arguments, Wheeler appears unready to commit to Obama's plan. For the past few weeks, he's been trying to find a way to give everyone a little bit of what they want. That's great, except it also means everyone can find something about it they don't like , and legal experts are skeptical in any case that a hybrid approach could survive a court challenge by ISPs.
This leaves us with an FCC that's being hemmed in on pretty much all sides, with consumer advocates, tech companies and now the president pressing for one thing and telecom companies and ISPs urging another.
The high-level politics between Obama and the GOP risk obscuring what is actually a very sophisticated technical and legal task for Wheeler. The political winds are pushing him to take Obama's side and go all-in on Title II: Not only would that bring him closer to the leader of his party, it could also make gaining support for a net neutrality rule easier. Wheeler needs three votes to pass any regulations. He likely won't have the support of the two Republican commissioners on the panel, who are opposed on principle to new limits on broadband providers. So he's left with himself, Commissioner Mignon Clyburn, and Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel.
Wheeler really needs Clyburn and Rosenworcel on his side. They're all Democrats, but it's more complicated than that. If Wheeler bucks Obama and proposes anything short of Title II, Clyburn and Rosenworcel will be in the uncomfortable position of having to vote against the president, too. Chances are they would, as the Democrats might prefer non-ideal rules to no rules at all. But a vote with Wheeler might be easier for his liberal colleagues to swallow if they knew they had the president backing them up.
But here's the thing: Wheeler's a pragmatist. Based on conversations I've had with people close to him, the chairman is chiefly interested in designing rules that — rather than simply appeasing one political interest or another — actually stands the best chance of 1) surviving a lawsuit and 2) achieving the goals he shares with Obama, which is preventing ISPs from slowing or blocking Web traffic.
From where Wheeler sits, Title II may not be the best option for fulfilling those goals, which is why a split, currently, exists between him and Obama. It's possible that Wheeler may move closer to Obama's position in the coming weeks, for the reasons I've outlined. But the FCC is an independent agency that has to follow certain procedures concerning public input, decision-making and rule-drafting. So Wheeler can't simply wake up tomorrow and decide to go all-in on Title II, even if he believed that was the best course — which it doesn't seem like he does (yet?).
So that's where we stand.

For Rahul to beboldPrint
The lesson to be drawn from the Youth Congress and NSUI elections is not to abandon them but to take elections to every echelon and every level of the Congress, bottom to top, including the very summit, and make transparent the process of ticket distribution.
Written by Mani Shankar Aiyar | Posted: November 13, 2014 12:05 am
Immediately after the Congress received a drubbing in the elections to the Delhi assembly in December 2013, Rahul Gandhi announced that he would be changing the Congress “in ways you cannot even imagine”.
Making that change has not proved as easy as perhaps he imagined a year ago. As against his (presumably) radical ideas, there is a conservative element in the Congress that cautions against travelling down “the road less travelled”. After all, it is the present system that pulled the party up by its bootstraps after the disastrous Sitaram Kesri interregnum. It is the same system that brought the Congress to victory in 2004. And it is the same Congress that gave us the thumping victory of 2009, when the party increased its seats from 141 to 206, a gain of 65, notwithstanding having to contend with a full term of anti-incumbency. Why change radically just because of one setback, however severe?
There is, on the other hand, the radical element that points to Rajiv Gandhi having declared at the Congress centenary in 1985, and that too in the wake of the largest election triumph the party had ever experienced, that the “brokers of power” needed to be driven out of their perches of patronage (even as Jesus had driven the money-changers out of the temple!). That observation got little traction during the remainder of Rajiv’s term but did result in the Uma Shankar Dikshit report, which laid out a roadmap for the democratisation of the party. Rajiv’s worst fears were realised when the party slid to less than half the seats it had won in 1984 in the Lok Sabha elections held five years later. Inevitably, upon moving into the opposition, his priority task was to dust off the Dikshit report. An extended meeting of the Congress Working Committee was convened on April 4, 1990, which endorsed the Dikshit committee recommendations. The recommendations were then taken to an AICC meeting held in Mavalankar Hall in mid-July 1990, where they received a thunderous welcome.
But just a fortnight later, Mandal and kamandal clashed, signalling the inevitable crumbling of the V.P. Singh government. That was followed by the short-lived Chandrashekhar interlude and we were back at elections by March 1991. Two months later, Rajiv was assassinated and his plans for party reform were put on the backburner and have not since been revived. Although, the first A.K. Antony committee (1999) added a coda to party reform continued…

Apple (AAPL) shares are hitting another record high. And it seems like there’s nothing that can stop it — not even price targets.
Shares of the smartphone-maker keep blasting blast analysts’ price targets almost as fast as the analysts can raise them. Apple’s breathtaking rally this year — powered by strong uptake of the iPhone 6 smartphone — continues to mock analysts’ price targets rooted in fundamentals and valuations as emotion and speculation takes over.
Shares of Apple Wednesday closed up $1.55, or 1.4%, Wednesday to $111.25. That already tops the $108.10 18-month price target that analysts had just two months ago. Analysts have been scrambling to keep ahead of the soaring shares of Apple — but the stock seems to have no bounds. Perhaps the analysts saying Apple is the first “risk free” stock are on to something after all?
Apple at $110 a share is just below analysts’ current $116.69 18-month price target on the stock. And that average price target has been collectively raised 4.4% just over the past month.
Certainly, there are degrees of optimism, even among analysts. The highest 18-month price target on Apple is currently $143 a share. That might seem outlandishly high, especially since the stock is already trading at 17 times its earnings the past 12 months. But analysts have learned the hard way that you’re either bullish on Apple, or you’re wrong.
Earlier this week, UBS tech analyst Steven Milunovich took his price target up nearly 9% to $125 a share. He pointed to “strong buying intentions for the iPhone 6 … appreciation of the brand and ecosystem and interest in Apple Pay,” as drivers for the ever-rising stock price in a note to clients.
Computerized tools continue to be more guarded about the trajectory of Apple’s stock. Trefis , a tool that measures how much a company is worth by looking at the present value of expected cash flow, pegs the stock’s value at $110. But even that’s been raised more than 10% over the past few months.
How high can the stock go? Seems like it has a mind of its own — one that even the analysts can’t read.

Why Jonathan Gruber wont change the Obamacare debateBy Aaron Blake November 12 Follow @aaronblakewp
The Post's Jose DelReal explains why Affordable Care Act architect Jonathan Gruber's year-old comments about the historic law have Republicans so angry. (Jose A. DelReal and Nicki DeMarco/The Washington Post)
Republicans think they've just happened upon a major moment in the never-ending political debate over Obamacare: Newly discovered video of White House consultant Jonathan Gruber's controversial comments about the passage of the law .
In the video, from 2013, Gruber suggests the details of the law were  obscured in order to assure its passage . He says the bill relied on the "stupidity of the American voter” and a “lack of transparency." Pretty damning stuff.
Republicans, naturally, think they just might have this goose cooked now, with the Post's Robert Costa quoting Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) calling Gruber's comments a potential (for lack of a better term) game-changer -- one that could finally help turn public sentiment against Obamacare for good and assist the GOP's efforts to dismantle it.
"We may want to have hearings on this," Jordan told Costa. "We shouldn't be surprised they were misleading us."
But while it's clear this is hardly Obamacare's proudest moment, the idea that Gruber's comments will suddenly swing public sentiment against Obamacare is wishful thinking. That's because, throughout the law's history, support and opposition have been pretty consistent. Yes, there have been some rises and dips along the way, but, overall, the picture is one of stasis for the better part of five years.
Here's the Kaiser Family Foundation's tracking poll on impressions of the law, also known as the Affordable Care Act:
Make no mistake: Gruber's comments are dumb. But, it's not as though the GOP has struggled to find supposedly disqualifying elements of Obamacare in the past.
There was the flawed Web site launch in late 2013 (that was a pretty big deal, as we recall). There was the whole "if you like your plan, you can keep it" imbroglio around the same time. There have been the incremental changes made by the Obama administration, including two delays of the employer mandate in July 2013 and February 2014. There was the Supreme Court ruling in June 2012 that Obamacare was, in effect, a tax.
There was also a 2010 quote from House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) that barks up a similar tree as Gruber's new comments: " We have to pass the bill to find out what's in it ." There's even previous comments from Gruber himself, in which he appeared to agree with the thrust of an anti-Obamacare lawsuit seeking to dismantle the Affordable Care Act by pointing out that its subsidies were intended only for states who set up exchanges -- and not by states using the federal exchange. (This, moreso than Gruber's latest comment, could impact things. That's because it could be used in the  case that will be heard by the Supreme Court this year .)
Each one of these things, by themselves, got plenty of Republicans plenty excited. And each of them undoubtedly contributed to the long-standing distaste with the law. But none of them really changed the playing field for good.
And Gruber's comments, while damning, aren't exactly the most fertile political territory. That's because, while "stupidity of the American voter" is a pretty strong soundbite, Gruber's connection to the law takes some explaining. And we're not sure most people -- apart from those who already decided the efficacy of the law years ago -- are really keen on the latest Obamacare debate a week after the 2014 election.
Changing public opinion on something like this, five years hence, takes a lot -- especially when the support and opposition have been baked in for so long at pretty constant levels.
If anything can change that, it is far more likely to be something that has a personal impact on lots of Americans -- like large premium increases or canceled plans. And if Obamacare is dismantled, it will be because the GOP has Congressional majorities and a president who wants to do it.  That means no earlier than 2017.
Gruber has done Obamacare no favors with his overly blunt and cynical assessments, and there's a reason he apologized publicly for them on Tuesday . But if Jordan or other Republicans think this is their big moment, they're probably hoping a little too hard.

Let me share my experience-
I started to invest from 2008, at that time I followed the finance new channels and had a very bad experience. I lost a good amount of money. Then I stopped investing. Once again I started in 2011 and took a paid subscription, which went fine for very short period and then once again I lost good amount. But I continued browsing Moneycontrol and it was in the month of August-2014 I came to know about an angel (Arvind ji)
. I watched him closely for couple of weeks only to realise that I have friend, philosopher and guide. I sold all my old stocks (I didn`t even bothered about the losses) and invested in his recommendation. And the magic started- I have started gaining now (Though it is small now but this is just the beginning). Just imagine- who thinks about the well being of others? You will find one in lakhs. And my belief is Arvind ji is one of them. I am not asking you to blindly follow my words. But this is my experience. He never said that we will be richer in a month or so. Whatever he says make sense. Jai shree Ganesh ji Maharaj ki

Crisis communications and Ebola: Advice for businesses0
That's especially true of line managers, as they are likely to get the first call from an employee. A manager's first action should be to call human resources, which will need to follow Illinois Department of Public Health protocols but also shouldn't leave the messaging to public health officials alone, Spurgeon advised.
"This is happening everywhere, but no one's talking about it: Your company should, out of prudence, pay you for the 21 days to stay home," said Spurgeon, an executive vice president at MDC Partners. "Whether or not you disclose to your co-workers why you're staying home versus just saying you might be sick, that's very much your determination. Part of what makes this a complicated scenario is that you're balancing an employee's right to health privacy, which is so fundamental, with your employer's obligation to keep everyone safe."
Spurgeon also is a lawyer but isn't practicing. Her view is that a company doesn't have the right to release the employee's name or health status.
"It's harder when it's someone making an hourly rate based on time worked," Spurgeon said. "In those scenarios, I always recommend an employee not be penalized in any way."
If I came down with a fever at work post bowling, a whole different approach is necessary.
"The Tribune now has an obligation to your co-workers, who are facing a very legitimate health risk," she said. "They shouldn't name you, but it would probably be very clear who you are. And they need to have a protocol and a way of informing people."
Given where I work, that would certainly generate a news story. Thankfully, I'm not handling food, so it's unlikely protests would take place outside Tribune Tower, Spurgeon guessed.
"Big companies are doing Scenario A, Scenario B planning," right now, Spurgeon said. "There are regulatory agencies and the important thing would be for the Tribune not to get a call from the Illinois health department, saying, 'Hey, one of your employees was in the office yesterday and now has symptoms, and we're going to go public with that' and the Trib is sort of caught flat-footed."
Even with advance warning, there won't be any time for a conference call or planning session. The plan should be so specific as to instruct managers and executives exactly who needs to be called when.
"Scenario A happens, and Joe needs to call the health department," Spurgeon gave as an example. "It has to get to that level of granularity. Many times companies are shocked that I recommend getting into that level of detail — like call this person, call that person. But the situation can induce such a panic, that you need to be able to go on autopilot. You don't want to have to think. You want to already have the steps in front of you. You already have the internal memo ready."
That memo should double as the company's public statement. The employee's name should be left out, unless the employee says it's OK or the employee can't retrace his or her steps with confidence, Spurgeon said.
And the company needs a similar plan for the employee.
Spurgeon reminded me that the University of Chicago, where I attend business school, would need to be notified, as would management at my condo building. And did I visit the Argo Tea in my building in the last 24 hours?
"The company should have tools to help the employee manage through it," she said. "In my view, helping your employee navigate what their messaging should be to their friends and family, and other people who could be talking to the press, is very important."
The best tip Spurgeon has in that regard: Stay away from Facebook.

Unemployment Is Down  But Wages Aren t UpUnemployment Is Down, But Wages Aren't Up

Friday delivered another solid-if-not-amazing jobs report. Unfortunately, the "not-amazing" part continues to involve your paycheck.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the U.S. economy added 214,000 jobs in October and that unemployment fell a tenth of a percentage point to 5.8 percent. This is the ninth straight month in which employers added 200,000 jobs or more, the Financial Times' Eric Platt pointed out . The last such streak of that length happened in 1993-1995 and lasted 19 months .
Unemployment has been ticking down with remarkable consistency, thanks to this incredibly durable job growth, along with a steady decline in the percentage of Americans in the labor force -- when people drop out of the labor force because of retirement or discouragement, they're no longer counted as "unemployed."
Often when unemployment falls, wage gains accelerate. Good workers get harder to find, forcing employers to pay up.
That's not really happening this time. Here's the unemployment rate and the yearly change in average hourly wages, charted:
Pay rose a paltry 0.1 percent in October and is up 2 percent in the past year. That's just 0.3 percentage points above inflation, which is currently rising at an annual rate of 1.7 percent.
There are lots of potential explanations for why unemployment keeps dropping without driving wages higher. The number of Americans sitting on the sidelines of the job market is still relatively high, for one thing.
The negatives of lousy wage growth are obvious. There are positives, too, though they're a lot less obvious: With wage growth stagnant, there is no indication that inflation is going to rise anytime soon. That means there's no pressure – aside from ideology – for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates to slow down the economy.
The zaniest theories of coming hyperinflation being espoused by the hyper-rich continue to be rebutted by reality. Such debating points are little consolation, however, for stagnant paychecks.

Climate change: US  China unveil ambitious goals to cut pollution levelsclimate change
The surprise agreement has brightened prospects for a climate deal in Paris next year
China and the United States have agreed on a timetable to limit emission of greenhouse gases — a decision that will impose fresh pressure on India not to obstruct a binding treaty on climate change next year.
The breakthrough was achieved during talks between visiting U.S. President Barack Obama and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, ending a 20-year discord between the world’s two leading economies on how to combat climate change. In a joint announcement on Wednesday, the U.S. agreed to reduce by 2025 its emission of greenhouse gases by 26 per cent to 28 per cent below its 2005 level. China stated its intent to peak emissions of carbon dioxide in 2030, if not earlier. It also agreed to raise the share of non-fossil fuels to 20 per cent, in its primary energy mix, in the next 16 years. This would entail China shifting towards clean energy generated by nuclear, wind, solar and such zero-emitting resources.
The surprise agreement on Wednesday between the United States and China on a timetable for emission cuts to combat climate change has brightened prospects for a climate deal in Paris next year. The deal can tilt the scales at negotiations at the UN climate conference slated for Paris in 2015.
Three years ago, leaders from 200 countries had agreed to finalise an agreement in Paris, which would replace the Kyoto protocol — the only legally binding treaty on cutting emissions, signed in 1997.
Analysts point out that the U.S.-China deal is in tune with the target of avoiding a dangerous 2 degree rise in temperatures across the globe.
The agreement underscores the complexity of the U.S.-China relationship, which has otherwise nosedived after Washington announced its “Asia Pivot” — a strategic shift, which includes fresh troop deployments in China’s periphery.
The joint announcement could impose fresh pressure on India not to become a deal breaker in the run up to the Paris talks. India’s per capita emissions are estimated at one-tenth of the United States and one-fourth of China, but, without a significant shift towards non-fossil fuels, its carbon footprint could rise substantially between 2020-2040, out of sync with global expectations.
 

Who will make the Middle Easts new mapUpdated: November 12, 2014 14:24 IST
Who will make the Middle East’s new map?
Peter Jones
AP Thick smoke from an airstrike by the US-led coalition rise in Kobani, as seen from a hilltop on the outskirts of Suruc, at the Turkey-Syria border.
TOPICS
unrest, conflicts and war
The U.S. wants countries like Iraq and Syria to remain unified failing which it fears complicated new realities will emerge. But those complications are already here
The present turmoil raging across the Middle East is unfolding on several levels, reflecting the multitude of forces and tensions involved. There is civil war in Syria, an insurrection in Iraq, domestic political unrest in Egypt and others countries and the relative peace that earlier existed between the majority Sunni and minority Shia communities have now been breached with break out of interreligious conflict across the region. One way to understand this turmoil is as an exercise in fundamentally redrawing the region’s map. But the mapmakers have vastly different objectives.
The Middle East since World War I is the legacy of the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, and the efforts of the European powers to redraw it in their interests. New states were created by Britain and France to reward wartime allies, to protect key imperial routes and to assure access to oil. But these new states rarely aligned with the tribal, religious or other realities of the region.
Thus were born Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and others. Some have established coherent political spaces, such as Jordan. Others were held together by force. The rulers and systems which did this in places like Iraq, Libya and Syria have been ousted or are under threat, and centrifugal forces are pulling these countries apart.
Disintegration
It seems likely that several of these countries will not survive. Syria and Iraq are foremost, but places like Yemen and Libya are not far behind. They will probably become several smaller states in the coming years, despite western policy preferences for their survival in their present form. It will be a messy few decades.
What will make it even messier is the fact that those vying to replace the existing order have differing aims. Some wish to achieve statehood in terms that we understand – the Westphalian model of sovereign political spaces. Even if some don’t like the idea of some of these peoples achieving statehood because it will complicate the regional picture, groups such as the Kurds do not seek to upset the present international system; they seek to join it. As the chaos of Syria descends even further, groups such as the Alawites may decide to seek their own sovereign spaces for protection.
Others are motivated by objectives incompatible with our conception of the international system. The Islamic State, Al Qaeda and others do not seek statehood as we understand it. Rather, they seek to establish a new order based on a misreading of a mythical idea to bind a community of believers together through common allegiance to religious precepts as to how society should function. It is the ideology of these groups which appears to have influenced those who have carried out the recent attacks in Canada and elsewhere.
Such groups will fail because they have nothing but brutality to offer; they cannot deliver the services that people expect. The likely trajectory for these groups is eventual disintegration into ever smaller groups of extremists, fighting each other as much as anyone else, with considerable attendant chaos and bloodshed. But, in the meantime, they represent a capable set of forces bound together by deeply-held goals. Those seeking to redraw the map along Westphalian lines are fighting each other as much as anyone else.
The making of the new Middle East map can thus be understood, at least in part, as the collapse of the post-Ottoman order, which has unleashed a violent confrontation between those who seek to draw the region’s map based on the idea of statehood, and those who seek to establish another kind of order in the region. The latter seem to have the upper hand in the fighting, for now.
Policy based on fear
The current U.S. policy that countries like Iraq, Syria and others should remain unified is based on a fear that complicated new realities will emerge if they disintegrate. But those complications are already here. Moreover, the West is manifestly unwilling to use the levels of force that would be required to achieve its goals; to put ‘boots on the ground’ over a long period in sufficient numbers to keep existing states together.
The U.S. also says, at least for now, that it is unwilling to countenance the return, or continuation in power, of the kinds of leaders who have shown that they could keep these spaces together, such as Saddam Hussein and Bashar al-Assad. This may change as and if the Islamic State and others continue to spread. By initiating air strikes, the U.S.-led coalition has effectively thrown in with at least some of those seeking to remake the region along Westphalian lines (turning a blind eye to the fact that most of the new states that emerge will probably not be democratic bastions of human rights). It does this in order to help them stop those who see a very different future for the region; one of constant sectarian and religious bloodshed in the service of mythical goals which justify terror and brutality on a level which makes any civilised person shudder. Success is far from certain, and the strikes may just make things worse.
The current turmoil has the prospect to make for new alliances. Iran is as much concerned by the way things are unfolding as we are. Revolutionary rhetoric aside, Iran is a profoundly status-quo power when it comes to questions of sovereignty and statehood. If the nuclear impasse can be breached, the collapse of a regional order may make for some interesting bedfellows.

Burger King in Mumbai in  Next Few Days : Details HereGovernment May Make PAN Must for Registering Charitable Trusts
Burger King India will open in Mumbai in the "next few days", chief executive officer Raj Varman told NDTV. The outlet will come up at Oberoi Mall, the world's second largest burger chain after McDonald's said.
"Very soon in the next few days you will see us move into Mumbai and open the first restaurant there," Mr Varman said.
Burger King launched in India last Sunday, when it opened the doors of its first store at New Delhi's Select City mall.
The American burger giant will open 12 stores between Delhi and Mumbai in the next 60-90 days, Mr Varman said. "We will continue to put one restaurant every week here in Delhi as well as in Mumbai till we kind of achieve our total."
Burger King India will also actively consider starting home delivery after the launch of the first 12 restaurants.
"The intention is to get to that at some point (delivery) we have to get the product mix right, the menu offering right, we'll have to study that in the next 90 days. We will determine that," he said.
The India menu that includes the likes of Chicken, Mutton and Vegetarian 'Whopper' burgers, is likely to see upgrades as Burger King said they will continue to adapt and the current menu is not the final one. "One of the very basic premises and principles of Burger King is continue to innovate, continue to bring new news to the market."
Burger King India menu does not include any beef options. All ingredients are sourced from within India.
Founded in 1954, Burger King now has its presence in 100 countries after the India foray.

Piyush Goyal Says Possible to Stop Imports of Thermal Coal in 2-3 YearsFiscal cliff: IMF welcomes action, says more needs to be done
New Delhi: India, the world's third-largest buyer of overseas coal, may be able to stop imports of power-generating thermal coal in the next three years as state behemoth Coal India steps up production, Power and Coal Minister Piyush Goyal said on Wednesday.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has asked Coal India, the world's largest miner of the fuel, to more than double its output to 1 billion tonnes by 2019 to feed existing and upcoming power plants.
Mr Modi has promised round-the-clock power to all Indians by 2022 and recently announced the nationalised coal industry would be opened up to allow private firms to compete with Coal India, which accounts for 80 per cent of the country's output.
Declining shipments to India would drag on global coal markets grappling with oversupply as top consumer and importer China tries to shift towards cleaner fuels.
"I'm very confident of achieving these targets and am very confident that India's current account deficit will not be burdened with the amount of money we lose for imports of coal," Mr Goyal told a conference.
"Possibly in the next two or three years we should be able to stop imports of thermal coal."
Coal generates three-fifths of India's power, but a shortage of the fuel means millions still go without electricity and power cuts are common.
Around 60 of India's 103 power plants had enough coal for less than a week's usage as of November 2 due to lower supplies from Coal India.
Imports of coal have been surging as a result, equating to about 1 percent of India's economy.
Shipments rose to 168.4 million tonnes last fiscal year, and the government estimated earlier this year that the domestic shortage would range between 185 and 265 million tonnes by 2016/17.
And some analysts were sceptical the country would be able to end imports soon.
"India's reliance on imports is not going away anytime soon," said Prakash Duvvuri, head of research at consultancy OreTeam.
"Obviously coal demand will continue to mean imports are needed in India."

#2. Oval face
If your forehead is in somewhat similar proportion with your chin, and cheekbones are dominant, then you are blessed with oval face. One of the best things about oval-shaped face is that they can try almost any shape of bindis. However, avoid putting on too long bindis as they may give an elongated look to your face. Also, make sure that the colour of your bindi matches up with that of your lipstick. This will give your face a balancing effect.

Indirect Tax Collections Rise 5.6% in April-OctoberMore Steps to Rationalise Subsidies on Anvil: Arun Jaitley
New Delhi: Indirect tax revenues rose 5.6 per cent in April-October to over Rs 2.85 lakh crore, mainly on account of an increase in service tax and customs collections.
However, excise collection, which is an indication of economic activity, declined 1.2 per cent during the seven-month period to Rs 88,330 crore, an official statement said.
Indirect tax collections so far this fiscal year (2014-15) has been 45.7 per cent of the full-year Budget target.
The government has budgeted to collect over Rs 6.24 lakh crore from indirect taxes in the current fiscal year, up 20.28 per cent over the collection in 2013-14.
Service tax collections increased 10.9 per cent during the seven months to October to Rs 90,673 crore. This amounts to 42 per cent of the budget target.
Customs mop-up rose 7.5 per cent to over Rs 1.06 lakh crore in April-October. This is 52.6 per cent of Budget estimates.
Economic growth, after remaining at sub-5 per cent levels in the last two fiscal years, is estimated to be between 5.4 and 5.9 per cent in 2014-15.
During April-August 2014, industrial output growth as measured by Index of Industrial Production (IIP) grew at 2.8 per cent, as against flat production in the corresponding period a year ago.
In the Budget, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had hiked excise duty on cigarettes in the range of 11 per cent to 72 per cent. The excise duty on 'pan masala' was increased from 12 per cent to 16 per cent, unmanufactured tobacco from 50 per cent to 55 per cent, and 'gutkha' and chewing tobacco from 60 per cent to 70 per cent.
Mr Jaitley has announced a host of measures, including a hike in tax exemption limit, incentives for the housing sector and a relief in indirect taxes on auto and other sectors, to promote industrial output and boost growth.

Patents, Copyrights and Trademarks Linux
Daily deal website pioneer Groupon Inc has stood down in a trademark spat with an open-source software project called Gnome, after the nonprofit called on the public to help in its legal fight.
Groupon said on Tuesday it would abandon its trademark applications for "Gnome," the name it chose for a new merchant checkout platform it launched in May. The company said it would come up with a different moniker.
0
The decision came just hours after The Gnome Project, which develops desktop software for the Linux operating system and claims millions of users, announced a legal fund to formally oppose 10 applications Groupon filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.
Groupon spokesman Bill Roberts told Reuters in an email that the company's relationship with the open source community was more important than a product name.
Gnome launched its Internet fundraising campaign saying it needed about $80,000. As of Tuesday afternoon, when Groupon announced its decision, the group had already raised nearly $69,000. A representative from Gnome did not immediately respond to questions about what it would do with the funds now that the trademark fight has ended.
Gnome, which started in 1997 and claims its technology can be found in phones, tablets, TVs and systems used by retailers, trademarked its brand in 2006.
It said it had approached Groupon to choose a different name, but the coupon and shopping website refused. With the legal fund, Gnome said it was calling attention to Groupon's "terrible behavior."
When Groupon launched its tablet-based Gnome checkout system in May, the company said it would act as a cash register and a coupon redemption system for businesses.

Fraudsters And The Rise Of Modern Finance (NEW BOOK)reddit
It is a new season and there are new accusations of fraud: car dealers in Alabama, a Vietnamese banking tycoon, Scottie Pippen's financial adviser (convicted). Every fraud is a warning and a lesson in greed, but do they have more to teach us other than caveat emptor?
Consider the fraudster - that man or woman of confidence and performance who adopts a fake name or title, who forges assets or fudges numbers, who doctors accounts or relationships. It is not hard to think of examples. Jeff Skilling and Ken Lay of Enron were revelations in 2001, but it turned out they were merely the opening act. The past decade and the recent financial crisis outed no small number of confidence men, among them Bernie Madoff, Christian Gerhartstreier (a.k.a. Clark Rockefeller), and Bernard Ebbers. As these confidence men and their frauds now recede into the recent past, they will join a long list of notorious rogues.
For example: John Law, a Scotsman born near the end of the seventeenth century. On the assets side of the ledger, Law appeared to have a great head of hair, was the son of a successful goldsmith and went on to become a close adviser to Louis XIV in France. He developed groundbreaking thinking on the functioning of credit systems and central banks, and was an early proponent and adopter of paper money.
The liabilities, however, are the chief reason Law is remembered. In 1716, he established the Banquee Generale Privee, which brokered shares in, among other things, the Mississippi Company. The Company attracted investors intrigued by New World possibilities and promise, while allowing Law to consolidate French national debt.
There was, however, nothing behind the Company, and as prices soared, Law found himself in a confidence game, propping up paper prices through all means available, including banning trade in large amounts of gold and silver. When Law's charade collapsed, and the Company with it, so too went French confidence in the type of financial assets that would prove crucial to stability and power over the next two centuries.
Law's fellow Scotsman, Sir Gregor MacGregor arrived on the scene a century later. In 1821, posing as having freshly returned from the Latin American wars of independence, MacGregor made the social rounds in London claiming to be the Liberator of the Floridas, the Cazique of Poyais, the Prince of the Mosquito Shore. Anybody want to buy beachfront property in an invented country on the Bay of Honduras?
Outlandish, perhaps, but MacGregor was selling shares and property in a London market of strutting dandies and global goods, a market smitten by opportunity in Latin America. The Latin American bubble would burst in 1825, but not before those who sailed to Poyais came to the brutal and deadly realization that there was no such place.
As assets diversified, companies expanded and new geographic locations for investment emerged over the remainder of the nineteenth century, the opportunities for fraud increased. "Everything," noted one turn of the century publication, "was swagger." Men of the market had swagger yachts, swagger palaces, swagger entertainments, it added. And in such an environment, the line between legitimate business and fraud grew hazy. Buy a company, stack its board with famous names, over-capitalize it, pay out the directors, and close up shop. This was the route of Ernest Terah Hooley, the so-called "Napoleon of Finance."
And, of course, such was the gall and bravado of Charles Ponzi that, nearly one-hundred years after his investment scheme first fell apart in 1920, his last name is still commonplace. Italian born, Ponzi was a well-turned out showroom who globetrotted through the early twentieth-century economy, carrying out spurious schemes in Europe, Massachusetts, Florida, and Brazil.
So outlandish are these schemes that the temptation is to see them as exceptional -- the victims as fools, the perpetrators as hunters of the naïve and vulnerable. But consider, for a second, what fraudsters know.
First, they know what the market wants. Law tapped into French appetite for New World investment, while MacGregor fed off what many financial historians felt to be the first modern investment bubble, Latin American sovereign debt in the first half of the 1820s. Most importantly, they know the market wants returns, which Law offered at nearly forty percent, and which Madoff nearly four centuries later would all but guarantee.
Second, they know how the market works. Law knew the financial structure of early 18th century France better than anybody else alive - he all but set it up. Beaumont Smith, a British financial official, committed roughly £350,000 worth of fraud through the sale of fraudulent bills in the mid-nineteenth century. He knew that the market moved at such a brisk trading pace that nobody held bills long enough to discover they were forged. MacGregor and Hooley understood and exploited the intricacies of Georgian and Victorian financial and commercial structures. The fraudsters of Enron understood a modern day fraud requires a little help from a third-party accounting friend.
They know that in a speculative environment, a fraud is only a fraud if the bottom falls out; or as Trollope put it in The Way We Live Now, "Nobody really loved Melmotte and everybody did believe. It was probable that such a man should have done something horrible! It was only hoped that the fraud might be great and horrible enough."
Third, and most alarming of all, they know how trust works. They know the psychology, ambitions, and social arenas behind the markets. Law, close to the Crown, appealed to the Royal desire to consolidate the debt. MacGregor, the Cazique, understood the desire in 1820s London to rub shoulders with soldiers returned from Latin America, while also making a shilling. And our more recent fraudsters have shown a remarkable ability to build trust not only through social circles (Madoff) and assimilation (Rockefeller, née Gerhartstreier), but through exploiting the very processes of verification designed to prevent fraud.
We ogle these historical fraudsters, placing them at the fringes of capitalism and history. But if history is any guide, there will be soon be another and another. And those at work now know not only the market, but also you, better than you think.

The Hard Truth About the Current State of Soft Skills in the U.S.reddit
Years ago, I was asked to deliver a class at University of Chicago's Booth School of Business. One of the questions on a survey distributed in advance of the class was, "Please provide three words that describe you." One of the responses, to my amusement and surprise: "Smarter than you." During the class, I posed several trying situational leadership scenarios about surmounting obstacles and being successful, to which one student answered every time that he would have an MBA from the best finance program in the country, and that would be all he needed to excel in the business world.
Of course, his M.O. was not credible. I wish it was. If so, the world would be much easier to navigate. But we all know a handful of people like this, with enough letters after their names to fill a can of alphabet soup, and in my view, they do so at their own peril.
But alas, it does appear that employment trends are espousing a similar philosophy. A recent study by Millennial Branding and Elance-oDesk.com reveals the following:
1. Fifty-five percent of HR managers are biased toward hard skills when hiring. Twenty-one percent focus more on personality.
2. Forty-five percent of HR managers expect to become even more hard skills-focused in 10 years. Only eleven percent expect to become more personality-focused.
While this change in focus is understandable given the increasingly results-oriented mindset of U.S. companies, studies like the above are dangerous in that they lead people to swing the personal development pendulum too far toward obtaining hard skills. Hard skills can be developed anywhere fairly quickly, and focusing too much in this area leads to a capability profile that competes against lower-cost workers worldwide. I believe that this is the true reason why wage gains have been fairly non-existent over the past two decades. Economically, the world is flat, and the U.S. is still at the high end of the global wage scale.
While many things have changed, what hasn't is your greatest career differentiator over the long term, providing you the greatest wage gains--soft skills (a.k.a., emotional intelligence).
1. Emotional Intelligence (EQ): refers to a set of emotional and social skills that influence the way individual contributors perceive and express themselves, develop and maintain social relationships, cope with challenges, and use emotional information in an effective and meaningful way. Daniel Goleman defines these soft skills as an array of skills and characteristics that drive leadership performance focusing on self awareness, self-management, social awareness and relationship management.
2.  Intelligence (IQ): Hard skills are directly related to an individual's smarts/intelligence. They are taught in school. Examples are accounting, finance, computer programming, and physics.
"The more your success on the job depends on relating to people -- whether in sales, as a team member, or as a leader -- the more emotional intelligence matters. A high-enough IQ is necessary, but not enough, to be a star performer." -- Daniel Goleman
I see the tradeoff between hard and soft skills to be most at play in professional capacities such as accounting, finance and law, where people are trained and hired for their extreme analytical capabilities (left brain-logical center). Every day, they are using logic and defined parameters to create desired results. And although they need to know the rules of accounting or finance, they eventually become responsible for building their book of business, selling to clients and managing and leading teams. Selling to clients for example, challenges these professionals because there are not defined parameters or a set of rules for being effective in securing new business. Selling and communication tactics vary from client to client. These responsibilities require a leader to tap into soft skills (or their right brain-emotional center) to effectively communicate, influence, or be empathetic. I would say my most common query from potential clients is from those who were trailblazers in client work, were promoted to partner, and have hit a brick wall just at the moment when they are realizing the ultimate goal to which most in the industry aspire.
Are soft skills innate, or can they be trained?
Emotionally intelligent qualities are definitely innate and can be refined. But they also can be learned. Soft skills are mainly learned and polished by placing oneself in stretch situations. Emotionally intelligent leaders learn from moments of turmoil and excellence.
Beyond trial by fire, here is how a leader (and anyone else, for that matter) can hone soft skills:
1. Have an accurate picture of your strengths and weaknesses. Leverage assessments and models to enhance your leadership effectiveness and deepen your understanding of how to more resourcefully tackle challenges coming from a position of power.  Having a coach for an outside perspective helps in bolstering awareness immeasurably.
2. Develop practices around self-awareness - This can be accomplished by staying tuned to superiors and peers for feedback, meditating and journaling daily about your personal and work experiences, and being as relationship-focused as possible at work while still allotting time to excel at the work tasks at hand. Doing so will promote a greater understanding of your interactions with others and how to better navigate politics and potential professional opportunities that might otherwise go ignored.
3. Practice gratitude - As new-agey as this sounds, the exercise of gratitude helps you to focus on what you are doing that is working so that you can more easily identify and capitalize upon your strengths. Focusing on the positive aspects of your life also helps you to become more resilient, increasing your ability to stay calm and focused when stress is at its highest.
While it appears quite clear that hard skills are the ticket to employment in today's marketplace, I truly fear what this new-found focus may bring. After all, preserving a balanced focus that includes soft skills is one of the great drivers in keeping the U.S. a leader in the global economy. For those without a job, by all means do what you have to do to secure one, but once you have, remember to nurture those soft skills to maximize your long-term earning potential.

Why Purpose-Driven Innovation Trumps Allreddit
Innovation that sticks is purposed-driven - led by someone on a mission to do good for others. It doesn't matter if the innovation succeeds on its own or leads to another innovation by someone else that does succeed. What matters is that the innovator is committed to a cause and is compelled to innovate to overcome a barrier keeping people from realizing their purpose.
Innovations come from everywhere. As Bobbi Brown told me at C2MTL, they are often born of necessity in solving problems. As Peter Skarzynski explains, "Valuable innovation is born of new, frame-breaking insights." Innovation happens when people with diverse backgrounds and perspectives come together at things like C2MTL or HATCH, the CEO Connection Mid-Market Convention or the lobbies and gathering spaces of Apple, Facebook, Google and the like.
The world needs three types of leadership and innovation: artistic, scientific and interpersonal.
Artistic Innovations
Consider artistic innovations like Paul D. Miller aka "DJ Spooky" on a stage at HATCH "spinning" his iPad to play the music he created by digitizing ice bergs with world-class cellist Philip Sheppard improvising on his cello to that ice music. (Not something you see every day.)
This, like most artistic innovations is all about breaking down barriers of perception.
Scientific Innovations
Intel's Rich Hannah and Mary Smiley took us through their Pocket Avatars app at HATCH. Their group has created avatars that use smart-phone cameras to capture and transmit a whole different level of communication on things like Snap Chat and What's App. The technical barriers were only part of the story, Rich and Mary have protected and grown a group within Intel with a mission, credo and business model different from the mother ship's.
At the most recent CEO Connection mid market convention, MasterCard Labs' John Sheldon took us through the company's innovation track record. So far, they've tested 400 ideas and feel fine that only four have reached the highest levels in their commercialization process (several are being developed in their pipeline). As he explained, their Qkr platform is one of them - because, among many potential uses, it enables school children to pay for school lunches without cash. Keeps them from losing that cash and prompts conversations between parents and kids about planning their week's lunches.
Interpersonal Innovations
Wharton's Mauro Guillen redefined emerging markets at the mid market convention. While most think of them in terms of geography, Guillen went further. He pushed us to consider cities as an emerging market. He pushed us to consider the aging population. We'll soon have more grandparents than grandchildren. Frame-breakers like these prompt interpersonal innovations for those whose purpose is to meet emerging needs.
Implications for you
Sheldon closed his presentation with some prescriptions for what you can do:
Own and rigorously defend your innovation agenda.
Like what's happening at MasterCard, Intel and others, if senior leadership isn't championing innovation and letting people fail hundreds of times (while learning from it)or encourage teams to consider and build business models that don't fit the mother ship's current models, innovation will wither and die.
Build innovation muscle through repetition
As Aristotle said "excellence is a habit". So is innovation. Your organization must get in the habit of innovating.
Make space - isolate and focus
It's not enough to defend the innovation agenda. You must give innovators a safe, secure space - physically and emotionally - in which they can play.
Trust your employees - they will surprise you
If you already knew the answer, you wouldn't need to innovate. Let them play. Let them digitize ice. Let them redefine what emerging markets are. Let them wow you. And appreciate and reward the wow.
Try a lot of things, but fail smart
The Gore Company used to tell people that it was okay to experiment with things that could put holes in the boat above the water line, but not below the water line. That's failing smart - faster, cheaper and maximizing learning.
Do well by doing good
And we're back to purpose. Start and end with a focus on doing good for others. It's enlightened self-interest. The good will come back to you and yours. Random innovations die. Those who are committed to the cause will not let purpose-drive innovations fail in the end.

Hey isn’t that… Comedian, actor, singer, and sometime awards show host Jamie Foxx capping off his appearance on the National Mall Tuesday with beleaguered local club owner Marc Barnes ? Who knew those two were BFFs?
A tipster tells us that Foxx and friends joined Barnes at the new Del Frisco’s Double Eagle Steak House in CityCenterDC, Washington’s attempt at a Rodeo Drive-like luxury alley. Foxx, one of the many celebrity hosts at “ Concert for Valor ,” didn’t bother to change out of the grey suit (no tie) he wore during the live-streamed concert earlier that night.
Del Frisco diners immediately recognized the former “In Living Color” star, who will reboot the role of Daddy Warbucks in the new film version of “Annie.” Foxx, described by our source as a “very nice guy,” posed for photos with an entire table celebrating a birthday before noshing on stone crabs and sea bass.

(Assuring that there would…)
PANAJI: Union Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar today said the country need not worry about Pakistan and China, but needed to build the defence capabilities over the next three years.
Assuring that there would be transparency in the functioning of his ministry, he also said that crucial defence purchases would be fast-tracked.
"I have realised that if someone properly heads the defence ministry, then we need not worry about Pakistan and China. We are strong enough...we have to build our capability over the next two-three years," said Parrikar, who visited his home state today after joining the Union Cabinet on Sunday.
"We need to provide the armed forces the required logistical support. Prime Minister has given me the responsibility to provide all the support to defence forces. I am feeling more responsible because the defence deals are worth Rs one lakh crore," he said, talking to the reporters.
Parrikar said he would ensure transparency in the defence purchases and the functioning of his ministry, which he said were crucial for the strengthening of the forces.
"All the purchases which are immediately required would be fast-tracked," he added.

Memo to Democrats: Stop chasing voters who wont ever support youComments
By Paul Waldman November 12
When Democrats lose an election, they can be counted on to fall to their knees and beg forgiveness from the voters who rejected them, even in an election like this one where the results were determined almost entirely by turnout (which this year was the lowest since 1942). This happens again and again despite the fact that it never works.
Today we’re learning of a new plan to embark on an absurd fool’s errand to save Senator Mary Landrieu, who is embroiled in a tough run-off election in Louisiana, through the inevitably unsuccessful tactic of giving Republicans what they want:
Senate Democrats are working on plans to hold a vote authorizing construction of the Keystone XL pipeline — approval that Democrats believe might bolster the chances of Sen. Mary Landrieu, who faces a tough runoff election next month.
It was not immediately clear Tuesday night whether Republicans would consent to proceeding with such a vote during the lame-duck session that begins on Wednesday — especially given the high stakes surrounding Landrieu’s reelection race. Such a move would also draw howls from the environmental movement who had hoped that President Obama would resolve a years-long dispute over a long-awaited energy project in their favor.
Several Senate Democratic aides confirmed on Tuesday evening that talks are underway to allow for a vote authorizing construction of the pipeline in the coming days.
I find it incredible that there are any Democrats who think this is actually going to save Landrieu. If there’s anything we learned from last Tuesday, it’s that in midterm elections, turnout matters much more than persuasion. And in a runoff election where turnout will be particularly low, the time for persuading Louisiana voters that Mary Landrieu is the oil industry’s best friend is past. If Landrieu has any hope of winning, it lies in motivating Democrats to get to the polls, which will be a particularly hard task, given that they just suffered such a huge defeat and are surely demoralized. Something tells me that the Keystone XL pipeline is not the thing that’s going to get Louisiana Democrats excited.
Even more egregiously, Democrats are willing to hand Republicans a significant policy victory while getting absolutely nothing in return. Let’s stipulate for a moment that the practical significance of the Keystone XL pipeline has been exaggerated by both sides. Tar sands oil is just about the most environmentally pernicious form of energy on earth, but the unfortunate reality is that the Canadians are committed to pulling it out of the ground and selling it whether it comes south to the United States or not. On the other side, the Republicans’ claims that building the pipeline will have a significant impact on the American economy are laughable; it will create a few thousand construction jobs while it’s being built, and the number of permanent jobs will literally number in the dozens. (And before anyone gets mad, yes, I realize that I’ve oversimplified the issue here.)
But what’s undeniable is that Republicans have made an emotional investment in the pipeline, and if Democrats are going to give in, they should at least get something meaningful in return. But as so often happens, they’re ready to just fold.
Take a look around at what happened in this election. Every Democrat who tried to avert defeat by saying “Please don’t hate me!” to Republican voters lost. Alison Lundergan Grimes said “I’m not Barack Obama,” shot guns and sang the praises of coal, and lost. Mark Pryor voted against the Manchin-Toomey background check bill (which was supported by huge majorities of voters), and lost. Mark Begich said he’d be a thorn in Obama’s butt, and lost. They might have lost anyway, but it’s clear that all but denying they were members of the Democratic party didn’t help them.
The Democrats who survived the bloodbath did so by making sure not to alienate their own base. The one Democrat in a close Senate race who won was New Hampshire’s Jeanne Shaheen, who forthrightly defended the Affordable Care Act and didn’t bash President Obama like so many other Democrats did. Turnout in New Hampshire remained strong, and she prevailed. In Colorado, Governor John Hickenlooper held on despite being targeted by the NRA for his gun control efforts. He didn’t run away from that record or cut ads with him shooting to try to convince the voters opposed to him that he was really on their side.
The issue of oil in Louisiana isn’t in quite the same category — it’s about economics and doesn’t have the same partisan intensity associated with it as something like guns, at least in that state. But what exactly do congressional Democrats think voters there will conclude if they hear that the Keystone XL pipeline is going to be built? That Mary Landrieu loves oil? I’m pretty sure they know that already. If you were a Louisiana Democrat, would that make you eager to turn out in a runoff election to support Landrieu? Hardly. And it won’t convince any Republicans or independents to come to her side, particularly when her opponent comes from the “Drill, baby, drill!” party.
After they’ve given Republicans this huge gift, and Landrieu ends up losing anyway because Democratic voters don’t see much reason to turn out in the runoff, the Democrats in Congress will say, “Gee, I wonder why that didn’t work?”

Time magazine wants to know if you want to ban the word feministBy Mark Berman November 12 Follow @markberman

Time magazine, a magazine dedicated to the study of time, has decided that it’s time (get it) to have readers vote on what words should be banished from the English language forever. Apparently this is the fourth time (eh?) that Time has done this, with previous installments resulting in the eradication of “ LOL/OMG/WTF ,” “ yolo ” and “ twerk ,” words that have never been heard from again  for all time (there we go).
This year’s poll asks readers to vote on the word that “will definitely” make them cringe if they hear it again. The contenders listed include a grab bag of words, such as “bae,” “kale,” “literally” and “om nom nom nom,” which is really four words (or at least two, if you want to be entirely literal here) and therefore not entirely in the spirit of the poll, but we will let it pass.
Also, one of the options is “feminist,” for some reason? Time: The Magazine offers explanations of why these words and phrases are included on the list (“disrupt,” for example, is “worn out,” while “obvi” is described as “unnecessary, cloying word-shortening”), while the argument against “feminist” says that you have nothing against feminism, duh, but the word was included because of how it became “a thing that every celebrity had to state their position on whether this word applies to them.”
So according to Time, they are not asking whether the word “feminism” is itself as tiresome as, say, “influencer.” They are just tired of celebrities being asked if they consider themselves feminists (the blurb’s author reiterated this on Twitter ). The question has been posed to quite a few celebrities recently, with Shailene Woodley  saying no  (reported Time magazine), Miley Cyrus responding yes  (according to Time magazine) and Katy Perry saying she  was not sure  (I read that in Time magazine).
As the question is asked more and more, the answers themselves prompt headline after headline, becoming a self-regenerating news cycle. A publicist told The Washington Post in September that  he advises clients to “avoid labels of any kind,” rather than defining themselves one way or another. One would think that perhaps the answers given and the news cycles sparked and the reactions thereupon would offer a value, if only to help us discern and discuss our modern sensibilities toward gender and celebrity and equality, and that perhaps this would help “feminism,” the word, avoid the same axe threatening “om nom nom nom.”
In any event, throwing out the word because you’re tired of reading articles on Time’s site about celebrities being asked about the word is not exactly winning lots of people over. Some folks – including Roxanne Gray , author of the recent book “ Bad Feminist ” — were not thrilled:
In what universe is it a problem that celebrity women are finally claiming feminism in significant numbers?

The (one) simple thing fueling your social media addictionBy Caitlin Dewey November 12 Follow @caitlindewey
What Facebook looks like without the numbers (Grosser)
If friendships were ever about quality, rather than quantity, that certainly isn’t the case anymore: Virtually every Web site that governs our social interactions these days puts numbers front and center, like a bold-faced, numerical tally of your precise social worth.
Three hundred Twitter followers. Five hundred Facebook friends. A mere three upvotes on that link you posted to Reddit a full three hours ago, which means it really kind of bombed. I even have a friend who watches the number of Instagram likes his pictures receive, deleting the ones that fail to “go double-digit.” As if there were anything in the world more arbitrary than whether nine or 10 people heart that highly filtered photo of your last meal, anyway.
The quantification of our social lives is intended, presumably, to give some shape to our otherwise amorphous interpersonal interactions. But as a startling new paper by the artist and developer Benjamin Grosser makes clear, all these numbers are having a more insidious effect, as well: They’ve become the primary measure by which we judge whether our friendships, and our lives, are valuable or fulfilling.
Since 2012, Grosser has published an intriguing, infuriating browser plug-in called Facebook Demetricator , which — as its name implies! — essentially removes all the numbers from Facebook. No friend counts. No event invites. Demetricator even masks dates, so you can’t tell exactly when something was posted.
Metrics on Facebook are absolutely everywhere, even if we don’t realize it. (Gross)
In the two years his tool has been online, thousands of people have used it — and Grosser has gotten a lot of feedback on how Facebook looks and feels without all those pesky metrics. In short, it acts nothing like the Facebook we know: Users feel less pressure to compete for likes, less pressure to like other people’s posts because their friends have, and less pressure to delete unliked posts, a la my Instagram double-digit friend.
In other words, all the anxieties of Facebook fall away. Social networking without the numbers looks less like a popularity contest … and more like actual socialization.
“With Demetricator, the focus is no longer on how many “likes” a user received, how much someone likes their status, or on how old a post is, but on who liked it and what they said,” Grosser writes in his paper. “Quantity is no longer foregrounded, leaving users to focus on the content that remains.”
And that makes sense, right? There’s a lot of literature out there on how numbers and numerical feedback impact our behavior; it’s the very reason dieters count calories, urban planners place speed display signs, and teachers assign grades on a 1-to-100 scale. For decades, psychologists have understood that real-time, numerical feedback on our behavior motivates us to change it.
“Action, information, reaction,” Thomas Goetz wrote in his 2011 deep-dive on the phenomenon. The feedback loop, he found, is a “profoundly effective tool for changing behavior.”
Even the +1 on the “Add Friend” button encourages you to make more Facebook friends, Grosser claims. (Grosser)
And yet, as Grosser’s Demetricator suggests, maybe social media’s feedback loops are changing us in ways we’d rather not. They encourage us to contort ourselves and our digital identities in order to wrack up more “friendships” or “likes.” They teach us that jokes and photos and major life announcements are only of value when someone else has double-clicked them.
These days, there is surely no disappointment more universal than posting a brilliant witticism or adorable photo to Facebook … and seeing it earn a measly one or two likes.
How many people like this photo? I’ll never know! (Facebook)
I had never heard of Grosser’s Demetricator before he published this paper — but since I too know the misery of the unloved Facebook status, I installed it for a trial run earlier this week. On Tuesday, I posted a pretty great photo of my dog — a piece of like-bait so adorable, so imminently lovable, I was sure my friends would “like” it. In fact, I’m sure my friends have liked it. But I didn’t get any notifications on the subject, which is either liberating or invalidating. (I haven’t decided yet.)
In my timeline, things were a little more clear-cut: It’s awesome, frankly, to be able to judge other articles and ads and other people’s baby photos based solely on their merits, without the gentle halo of how many people have judged them meritorious already. I was immune to viral posts, to Facebook peer-pressure, to acutely targeted ads. Only I determined what I clicked, and oddly, in that vacuum, I clicked almost nothing.
Does that say something about the essential nature of Facebook? Of human manipulability? Of both? Grosser certainly seems to think as much: Facebook (and other networks) designed this system intentionally, he points out, to encourage more engagement, more clicks — it’s good for advertisers, so it’s good for Facebook’s business. Whether it’s good for the hearts and minds of users is, of course, a different story.
“The notifications become like meth,” one man told Grosser. “You just can’t stop checking and rechecking. It simply became a nervous addiction for me.”

Maharashtra: 5 Congress MLAs suspended for  heckling  governorComments
Five Congress legislators were suspended by Maharashtra assembly speaker Haribhau Bagde for two years for allegedly heckling and physically stopping governor C Vidyasagar Rao as he entered the Vidhan Bhawan on Wednesday.

Revenue minister Eknath Khadse proposed their suspension saying that the governor had received "injuries" on his left hand during the incident.
Congress MLAs who have been suspended are Jaykumar Gore, Rahul Bondre, Abdul Sattar, Amar Kale and Virendra Jagtap.
A House panel is set to probe the incident and submit its report during the winter session of the legislature.
Meanwhile, all five suspended Congress members of Maharashtra assembly have denied causing injury to Maharashtra governor C Vidyasagar Rao and alleged that the entire episode was a "conspiracy" by the BJP government.
Talking to reporters, Congress MLAs Rahul Bondre, Jaykumar Gore, Virendra Jagtap, Abdul Sattar and Amar Kale said they did not heckle the governor.
"The BJP legislator Girish Mahajan's account of the alleged incident was taken as an eye-witness account, while we were not given a chance to put forth our side of the story.
Mahajan's presence at the place of protest itself is suspicious, since he is the Governor's bodyguard. How was he present there?" they said.
The MLAs appealed to reporters asking them to examine the the facts, since they too were present at the venue.
"We are confident that we will be proved innocent after the probe. If the government keeps us out for two years, we will tour the entire state and go to the people to highlight wrongdoings of the BJP government," they said.

Chess World Championship game 4: Anand draws with CarlsenIn the fourth game of the World Chess Championship, a confident Viswanathan Anand - playing black in a Sicilian Defence - stretched Carlsen for more than four hours before agreeing to a draw.
 
Even though Vishy opted for Sicilian Defence, which is supposed to encourage active play, game 4 ended in a draw. 
Game Board
Sending a message with Sicilian
Anand, playing with black pieces in game 4, was expected by many chess experts to play for a draw rather than risking his game going for a win.
 
But Anand surprised them. He played the famous 'Sicilian Defence', which is known to create unbalanced positions, thus having high probability of ending in a result.
Vishy started with Sicilian defence
The Sicilian is popular because it leads to sharp positions where the better player usually prevails, whereas most other moves by black leads to drawish positions.
 
This bold move was appreciated by many chess experts. It was interpreted as a 'message' Anand is sending to his opposite camp - 'I'm ready for the fight, bring it on'.
 
Susan Polgar, famous chess commentator, wrote in her blog, "Big psychological game displayed by Anand. After winning yesterday (Tuesday), he gave a big message with Sicilian that he's not afraid. If Anand continues to send the message that he's not afraid to battle, we will witness a very good match."
 
Carlsen replied to Anand's Sicilian with 'King's Indian Attack'. A move, which according to Polgar, was 'off the popular theory'. Polgar felt that Calrsen moved away from the usual 'theoritical moves' because Anand is so good with his current preparation and his knowledge of this setup is good.
 
Slight positional disadvantage for Anand
 
But Sicilian, like we saw before, led to a strange position for black. Even though the game was even, Carlsen maintained a small positional advantage over Anand by move 15.
A slight positional disadvantage for Anand
World number two Fabiano Caruana tweeted, "Vishy's position looks slightly uncomfortable. I remember suffering quite a bit in this line years ago vs @nigelshortchess."
 
And Carlsen gained a good postion with his 15th move Qf1. Nigel Short, chess player and commentator, tweeted, "Qf1! was a real Magnus Carlsen move. It is not even doing that much, but it just makes things a bit harder for Vishy."
 
But the match remained pretty dull when it entered mid-game level. Neither were there any brilliant moves nor blunders.
 
Isolated pawns
 
The only problem that Vishy had at this point was that his pawn structure was a little worrying. His pawns were not connected on the queen side and isolated pawns always become a major headache at the business end of the game.
 
The game gained a lot of intensity after move 21. Both players started exchanging pieces and entered active game play.
After move 21, game play got a little active
But after exchanging one rook and two bishops, it went back to a dry position again. It went on like this for more than four hours with neither of the players making inroads.
 
This was followed by more pieces getting exchanged in a boring monotonous game play which continued even beyond the first time control.
 
Magnus had a one-pawn advantage at the fag end of the game. But as there were only few pieces left, this didn't create an impact.
 
At the end of 47 moves, the players repeated the same set of moves three times, forcing a repetitive draw.
 
In the press conference, Magnus said, "I'm not playing very well. Actually, I'm playing somewhat terribly. My last two games were pretty bad."
 
Magnus added, "Overall, it was not a high quality game. There were no errors in general. But not very good game play either."

Road work starting for I-66 traffic management programBy Robert Thomson November 12 Follow @RT_Thomson
The image shows what drivers are likely to see when the Active Traffic Management system is activated in 2015. (VDOT image)
Beginning Friday, the Virginia Department of Transportation’s traffic management program for Interstate 66 will become more visible to travelers.
For the next four months, most of the impact on traffic will involve overnight construction to install 36 gantries along the interstate between the Capital Beltway and Route 29 in Centreville. But after that, drivers will experience the Active Traffic Management system that has been under development for several years.
The theory: Without rebuilding the highway, the system of sensors, cameras, central computers and highway signs will give drivers more information on incidents ahead, potential delays and how best to handle them. Drivers might respond to advisories that they change lanes, consider an alternative route or just slow down because of trouble ahead.
The smart highway will only be as smart as the drivers who use it. Slowing down well ahead of a crash, or moving away from a blocked lane, can ease the traffic flow for everyone — if drivers are willing to make those moves where traffic is still flowing freely.
This will be one of the most interesting traffic stories of 2015. But before we get to that, the gantries must go up. The initial work is scheduled for 12:01 to 2 a.m. Friday on eastbound I-66 at mile marker 53 in Centreville. At some point during that two-hour window, all eastbound traffic will be brought to a complete stop for up to half an hour, VDOT said.
After that early Friday start, the road crews generally will work Sunday through Thursday nights. VDOT said they will focus first on both sides of the interstate between Routes 29 and 50, mile markers 52 to 58. These also will involve some traffic stops. Regular drivers should watch for message boards along I-66 announcing upcoming shutdowns.
There won’t be any closings during the Thanksgiving travel days, or on other upcoming holidays, VDOT said.
This isn’t the only I-66 project travelers will hear about during 2015. The Virginia government has a study underway that is likely to add I-66 outside the Beltwa y to the network of high-occupancy toll lanes on the Beltway and I-95/395.

Naked Kim Kardashian wont break the Internet. The Internet would break without naked Kim Kardashian.Paper Magazine cover … slightly cropped. (screengrab from Twitter)
Let that headline sink in for a second.
On Tuesday night, Paper Magazine tweeted a link to its new cover (pictured above, cropped, because this is a family news organization, thank you very much), which shows a photo of  a naked Kim Kardashian taken from behind. ( Here’s the NSFW link to the tweet, in case you have somehow avoided it.) The centerpiece? Her incredibly famous behind, a body part so thoroughly dissected by the pop culture sphere that she actually had an X-ray on “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” to prove she didn’t have butt implants.
Anyway, underneath that photo (in which she is inexplicably shiny) the headline simply read: “BREAK THE INTERNET KIM KARDASHIAN.”
Now, that statement is just ridiculous. Kim Kardashian’s butt won’t be the thing to break the Internet because it’s one of the those things that makes the Internet.
Think about it: What would the Internet even be if Kim Kardashian’s butt didn’t exist? It’s the main currency that the Web needs to survive. People’s fascination with its very existence helped make her famous, which made her family famous, which spawned their multimillion-dollar reality show empire and by extension still fuels Web sites and online chatter every day. The Kardashians became the era’s prime example of how to become wildly famous without really doing anything, thanks to the Internet. Hundreds of people have tried to replicate the model with varying degrees of success, and it’s truly what keeps the Web churning along every day.
Paper Magazine addressed this in its explanation on its Web site accompanying the cover: “For our winter issue, we gave ourselves one assignment: Break The Internet,” it reads. “There is no other person that we can think of who is up to the task than one Kim Kardashian West. A pop culture fascination able to generate headlines just by leaving her house, Kim is what makes the web tick.”
The latter statement is true, at least — and as a result, a viral naked photo won’t break anything. What would actually break the Internet? If it didn’t exist at all.

Payrolls rose by 321,000 in November, way above the 230,000 estimated, while the unemployment rate held steady at 5.8 percent, a six-year low.
The report blew past forecasts, but also raised expectations that a rate hike from the Federal Reserve may materialize sooner than previously thought.
Ronald Sanchez, chief investment officer of Fiduciary Trust Company International in New York, said the number was "unambiguously strong," though it "could mean some changes to policy recommendations with the Fed. June 2015 is back on the table for when rates could rise."
Financials <.SPSY> rose 1 percent as higher interest rates would prop up earnings in the sector. Bank of America  rose 2.7 percent to $17.68 while Goldman Sachs  was up 1.8 percent to $195.45, boosting the Dow.

"The day's market action has to be seen in the context of the recovery we've had year-to-date. Payrolls confirm the strength of the economy, but that strength is reflected in stock prices," said Sanchez, who helps oversee $16 billion in assets.
Separate data showed new orders for U.S. factory goods fell for a third straight month in October, pointing to a slowdown in manufacturing activity.
The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> rose 58.69 points, or 0.33 percent, to 17,958.79, the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 3.45 points, or 0.17 percent, to 2,075.37 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 11.32 points, or 0.24 percent, to 4,780.76.
For the week, the Dow rose 0.7 percent and the S&P rose 0.4 percent. It was the seventh straight weekly gain, a streak not seen in a year for both. The Nasdaq fell 0.2 percent on the week.
American Eagle Outfitters  fell 13.8 percent to $11.91 after the teen apparel retailer forecast a current-quarter profit below analysts' estimates and reported its fifth straight drop in quarterly income.

Heres the latest sign net neutrality is becoming a political football in CongressBy Brian Fung November 12 Follow @b_fung
Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) speaks at the South Dakota Republican Convention in Rapid City in June. (Toby Brusseau/AP)
Republicans charged with overseeing the Federal Communications Commission are lashing out at President Obama's proposal for ensuring net neutrality, the principle that all Web traffic should be treated the same by Internet service providers.
In a letter to the FCC, Rep. Fred Upton and Sen. John Thune take aim at Obama's endorsement of aggressive regulation for broadband providers, adding fuel to a growing political dispute between the GOP and Democrats over the future of the Internet.
Highlighting how previous FCC attempts to develop ISP rules led to legal challenges, Upton — who chairs the House Energy and Commerce Committee — and Thune, who is expected to become the top Republican on the Senate Commerce Committee next year, said this time may be no different.
"You are being asked by some to reclassify broadband under Title II of the Communications Act," the members wrote to FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler . "This isn’t sound policy and would almost certainly mean another trip for the FCC to the Court of Appeals."
The letter comes days after Obama called on Wheeler to reclassify broadband, joining consumer groups and tech companies who want " the strongest possible rules " for keeping the Internet free and open. But while Obama cannot directly influence the FCC, which by law is considered an independent agency, a GOP-held Congress would not be bound in the same way. If the FCC pursues aggressive regulations for net neutrality, it could become a political football on Capitol Hill.
"What's likely in the short run," said one industry lobbyist, who spoke on the condition of anonymity Monday because he wasn't authorized to speak on the record, "is that you'll see yesterday's press releases turned into letters, and letters turned into hearings."
Looks like we're getting a taste of that already.

After Ajatshatrus switch  family has a member each in BJP  Cong PDPAmit Shah welcomes Ajatshatru into the BJP.
Written by Arun Sharma | Jammu | Posted: November 13, 2014 12:20 am
On Sunday, when Ajatshatru Singh, younger son of veteran Congress leader Dr Karan Singh, joined the BJP, his former party the National Conference called it “political opportunism”. It runs in the family, said NC provincial secretary Sheikh Bashir, adding it begins with Karan Singh. Dr Singh has been with the Congress, two breakaway factions and the NC.
Ajatshatru says he has joined the BJP for “people’s desire to have a corruption- and dynasty-free government”. His move, however, will mean any one member of the erstwhile royal family will be part of the ruling party, whichever that is. Dr Singh is a Congress MP, his elder son Yuvraj Vikramaditya Singh is the PDP’s face in Jammu, and Ajatshatru is now in the BJP.
Ajatshatru won his first assembly election in 1996 as an NC nominee from Nagrota and was a minister in Dr Farooq Abdullah’s cabinet. After losses in 2002 and 2008, the NC made him an MLC. Congress spokesperson Dr Abdul Rashid Choudhary described his switch as a “personal choice in a democratic setup”.
Karan Singh, son of Maharaja Hari Singh, was appointed regent by his father in 1949, got elected Sadr-i-Riyasat in 1952, 1956 and 1961, and was made governor in 1964. He was inducted into Indira Gandhi’s cabinet three years later, and again in 1971 after being elected from Udhampur. In 1977, he was re-elected from Udhampur as a Congress nominee.
In 1979, he joined the Charan Singh cabinet as a Congress (S) member. The following year, he joined the Congress (U) and got elected from Udhampur. He later quit the party. In 1984, he lost as an independent from Jammu.
In 1989, he was appointed India’s ambassador to the US, but resigned a year later. From 1996 to 1999, he was in the Rajya Sabha as a representative of the NC. This, despite having dismissed, as Sadr-i-Riyasat in 1953, the government of NC founder leader Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah and getting him arrested in 1953. Farooq, as chief minister, appointed him chairman of its Committee for Greater Autonomy. Singh resigned from the committee without holding even a single sitting or making any recommendation.
In 1999, he was re-elected to the Rajya Sabha as Congress nominee. Since then, he has been in the Congress.
National Panthers Party chief Prof. Bhim Singh, once close to Dr Karan Singh, described the party-hopping as “unexpected of the descendants of the secular, democratic Hari Singh”.
Trade union leaders said the family may have been in politics for decades but has never been part of any public movement. “At all times of trouble when the state needed them, they were away,” said veteran trade union leader Krishan Kumar Koushal “They do politics from inside their air-conditioned rooms,” said Ram Kumar Sharma, a former trade union leader, adding that they are in politics only to “safeguard their properties”.

All even: Viswanathan Anand draws Game 4 with Magnus Carlsen  scores tied2-2By: Press Trust of India | Sochi | Posted: November 13, 2014 12:13 am
Five-time World Champion Viswanathan Anand played out an easy draw with black pieces against Magnus Carlsen in the fourth game of the ongoing World Chess Championship in Sochi on Wednesday.
After a crushing win over Carlsen in the third game which level scores, Anand gave nothing away and was a completely different player from the first two games in which he had looked quite vulnerable. The scores are now level at 2-2 after four rounds.
There was pressure from Carlsen yet again but Anand was hardly intimidated as tackled the Norwegian move for move.
Anand changed gears in the opening in the fourth game, shifting to the Sicilian defence, from the Berlin wherein he lost badly in the second game while playing with black pieces.
Carlsen, in his typical style, went for the closed set-up, livening things up at his own will when he wanted and put Anand under some pressure in the middle game.
Anand, this time however did not buckle under pressure, found out a resourceful defence and then the pieces got exchanged in a heap.
The Norwegian was playing against a slightly vulnerable pawn structure but things did not go in his favour thanks to some perfect counter-attack that Anand produced after trading all the pieces except queen.
Carlsen used up some of his time in the second time control after move 40 but decided that there was nothing to play for.
The game ended vide perpetual checks after 47 moves, giving Anand a small psychological advantage ahead of the rest day before the fifth game in the 12-games match that has 1 million Euros as prize money.
Carlsen did not appear quite happy with the result as he said,”I thought I played terribly, it was a draw so that’s ok.”
“It was a difficult game. There was a lot going on based on this weak pawn in the centre. Towards the end, I found this important queen move after which its fine,” Anand said in the post-game conference.
The tide seems to be turning in Anand’s favour if the last two games are any indication. The fifth game will be quite important for the Indian ace to continue in similar vein.
More pressure from Anand could result in a much needed victory as Carlsen does not look the same invincible player he was in Chennai last year.

An editorial in the Organiser argues that Ayurveda is often referred to as an alternative medical science. Just as natural solar energy is considered an alternative source of power while artificially generated power is seen as the main source of energy, in healthcare, the natural is considered alternative. However, the “reality is traditional practices are original and complete in approach; and… Western medical science has emerged as supplementary rather than an alternative… Western medical science has come with better diagnostic technology and vaccines and the important role it can play is to support the natural practices of wellness…” argues the editorial.
It says the distrust between doctors and companions of patients is striking in the multi-speciality or super-speciality hospitals because relatives are not given details of the course of treatment and doctors are not sure of the diagnosis: “The nexus between drug companies and doctors is no hidden fact…” The article argues that the history of “Science of Life Care (Ayurveda)” shows that, conventionally, health was not limited to physical fitness: “It’s only with the evolution of modern Western medical science that the word health is equated with ‘wealth and physical treatments’. It does not mean that the ‘Western modern’ medical practices have had no contribution in wellness.” The editorial urges a holistic concept of wellness, primarily based on traditional wisdom.
CPM to BJP
An article in the Organiser says there has been an exodus of leaders from the CPM to the BJP: “What started as a small rivulet, prior to the Lok Sabha elections 2014, has developed into a major flood with thousands of cadres of [the] CPM holding top posts… flocking to BJP.” It happened in all 14 districts of Kerala in the last six months. Terming the CPM as a “dead party with a failed ideology”, the Hindu cadres have taken the “natural route” to the “resurgent BJP.” It claims that 1,500 people from prominent parties joined the state BJP at a convention on October 22.
The article alleges that the CPM tried to stem this flow and had “masterminded the savage butchery” of an RSS leader, E. Manoj, in Kannur district. “The rattled CPM is even organising Ganesh Pujas and Krishna Jayanti processions to prevent its bulk Hindu cadres from going to [the] BJP. It has granted permission to its cadres to go to temples…” The article also says that since the Congress in Kerala is “pro-Muslim and pro-Christian”, Congress workers are also flocking to the BJP. The BJP has got more than 20 lakh votes in the northern districts of Kerala, where the CPM has been dominating, and its vote share has gone up from 6.4 per cent to 10.8 per cent in the state. “Now, the stage is set for [the] BJP making massive inroads in the 2015 local body polls and 2016 assembly polls. What started as a Modi wave is now a Modi tsunami,” says the article.

Republican lawmakers on Wednesday urged the US Federal Communications Commission against any plan to regulate the Internet more like public utilities.
In a letter to FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler, more than three dozen House and Senate Republicans said that changes to Internet regulations proposed this week by US President Barack Obama were “beyond the scope of the FCC’s authority and would defy the plain reading of the statute.”

U.S. firms invisible tax cutBy Henry Farrell November 12 Follow @henryfarrell
Over the last couple of decades, large firms have become increasingly adept at using complex international arrangements to reduce their taxes. This has become a big political issue in the United States (where there is increasing pressure to get U.S. firms to start paying their taxes) and in Europe (where the incoming president of the European Commission is in political trouble over his possible previous role in facilitating dubious tax arrangements for foreign firms). However, it is difficult to measure the extent of the problem, exactly because these tax-dodging arrangements are so complicated. If, for example, profits pass through a chain of artificial subsidiaries located in a number of different countries (as in the notorious “double Irish plus a Dutch sandwich”) to take advantage of loopholes, then it’s difficult to measure and count them.
Gabriel Zucman, in a new article in the Journal of Economic Perspectives has figured out a possible way to measure the extent to which U.S. firms use tax havens to lower taxes on foreign profits. By looking at national accounts and balance of payment statistics, it’s possible to get aggregate figures on how much money is being funnelled through foreign tax havens. And the answer is — quite a lot. Zucman:
The balance of payments provides a country-by-country decomposition of this total, indicating that 55 percent are made in six tax havens: the Netherlands, Bermuda, Luxembourg, Ireland, Singapore, and Switzerland. The use of tax havens has steadily increased since the 1980s and continues to rise. Moreover, the trend toward more widespread use of tax havens by US-owned corporations shows no particular sign of slowing down. As tax havens rose as a share of foreign profits (to 55 percent today) and foreign profits rose as a share of total US corporate profits (to about one-third), the share of tax havens in total US corporate profits reached 18 percent (that is, 55 percent of one-third) in 2013. That is a tenfold increase since the 1980s …
The figure below shows the increase in profits flowing through tax havens over the last 30 years.
Zucman estimates that these artificial tax avoidance schemes have provided U.S. firms with the equivalent of somewhere between a 6 percent and 8 percent tax cut over the last decade and a half. That’s quite a lot of money.

New York City firefighters rescued two window washers on Wednesday who had been trapped for two hours on broken scaffolding dangling outside the 69th floor of the city's tallest skyscraper, local officials said.
Rescuers cut a hole in a window of the newly opened building, One World Trade Center, and quickly pulled in the two men from the oblong, open-topped platform as it hung almost vertically high above the National September 11 Memorial in lower Manhattan.

The World Health Organisation said today that 5,160 people have so far died of Ebola across eight countries, from a total 14,098 cases of infection.
The numbers supersede figures the UN health agency gave last Friday, when it reported 4,960 deaths and 13,268 cases.
WHO has acknowledged though that the number of deaths is likely far higher, given that the fatality rate in the current outbreak is known to be around 70 per cent.
The fresh toll, which runs through November 9, comes as the outbreak appeared to be spreading in Mali, with four Ebola cases, all of whom died, confirmed or suspected in that country.
The deadliest Ebola outbreak ever meanwhile continues to affect Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone the most.
In its latest toll, the WHO said 2,836 deaths were recorded in Liberia, out of a total of 6,822 cases.
In Sierra Leone, 1,169 people had died from the virus out of 5,368 cases.
In Guinea, there were 1,142 deaths from 1,878 cases.
Data from Nigeria and Senegal remained unchanged, and both countries have been declared Ebola free.
Nigeria had eight deaths and 20 cases, while Senegal had one case and no deaths.
In Mali, WHO reported three additional Ebola deaths, but said they were not linked to the only other case and death recorded in the country – that of a two-year-old girl from Guinea.
There has been one case of infection in Spain, where an infected nurse has recovered.
In the United States, four Ebola cases have been recorded and one person – a Liberian – had died from the virus.
Ebola, one of the deadliest viruses known to man, is spread only through direct contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person showing symptoms such as fever or vomiting.
People caring for the sick or handling the bodies of people infected Ebola are therefore especially exposed.
WHO said today that a total of 564 healthcare workers were known to have contracted the virus, and 320 of them had died.

Azad: PM has to choose between Indias integrity and liftingpartyPrint
Written by Muzamil Jaleel | New Delhi | Posted: November 13, 2014 12:33 am
Leader of the opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad, also heading the Congress’s election committee in Jammu and Kashmir, says the BJP is playing “a dangerous game by polarising Jammu region and clandestinely indulging in unfair means in Kashmir region” to gain a foothold in the state in the elections.
In an interview to The Indian Express, Azad said Prime Minister Narendra Modi has to “choose between unity and integrity of India and strengthening his party at the cost of the country” in J&K and the Northeast.
“It is unfortunate that the BJP is going the whole hog in these sensitive areas without any understanding of the work successive central governments have done systematically to calm things down without compromising on the national interest. And the way they are trying to impose the politics, culture and thinking of the RSS in these areas clearly indicates that for the BJP, power is more important than the unity and integrity of the country,’’ he said.
“From the PM to party leaders, they insist that they want 44-plus seats in J&K by whatever means. In one region they are instigating religious polarisation and in the other they are using unfair means. Is it fair for a national government to play such a dangerous game to impose their party?” He said “in the long run, this exercise will boomerang and jeopardise the national interest”.
Azad said the strategy isn’t going to work. “They did it (communal polarisation) in 2008. The row over the allotment of land to build infrastructure for Amarnath pilgrims led to polarisation of the worst kind, which we witnessed for the first time since 1947. Elections were held in that atmosphere and the BJP’s tally went up from one seat to 11,’’ he said. “What more polarisation can happen? And even if it happens, they will get at the most a few seats more than their 2008 tally. At the most, they can reach 15, but that is highly unlikely.”
He cited his own Lok Sabha contest as an example: “I got a majority in the Muslim-majority assembly segments (eight in Udhampur) and trailed in the Hindu-majority segments (nine). “Even a person like me, whose secular credentials have never been challenged and who is acceptable to Hindus across the country, was affected by polarisation.”
Describing the BJP’s electoral ambitions as dangerous, he said, “They polarised the country and were elected to power. Now they need to understand they are in government; they needed to desist from further polarisation. Instead, they are going into the most sensitive areas… They want to thrust the BJP and RSS upon the people, not realising these regions are geographically, culturally, linguistically very sensitive.”
He added, “Congress governments sacrificed the party’s interests in these regions. The Congress had an overwhelming majority in J&K in 1975 and the National Conference had zero representatives… Keeping in view the sentiments of the people, Mrs (Indira) Gandhi got the Congress chief minister to resign and pave the way for Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah.”
He cited similar examples from continued…

Democrats: Legal basis for Obama to act on immigration clear and substantialBy Ed O'Keefe November 12 Follow @edatpost

Leading proponents of immigration reform are preparing to throw their full political weight behind President Obama as he prepares to use executive authorities to revamp the nation's immigration laws.
Reps. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) and Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.), two of the most vocal proponents for immigration reform, began circulating a letter of support on Wednesday that lays out the economic, political and legal arguments that they hope Obama's allies will be making on his behalf once he takes action and begins facing Republican criticism for doing so.
A draft of the letter is being circulated among Democrats with plans to formally send a copy to the White House later Wednesday or on Thursday. The Washington Post obtained a copy of the draft from a congressional aide. The offices of Lofgren and Gutierrez didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.
Obama said last week that he is planning to use his executive powers to overhaul at least part of the nation's immigration system, dismissing calls by Republican congressional leaders that he delay doing so. Obama is said to be considering a suite of options that could grant temporary legal status to as many as 5 million illegal immigrants, according to several people familiar with his plans. He is expected to act once he returns from his current trip to Asia and Australia and before the end of the year.
In the letter, Democrats tell Obama they "were very disappointed" when he postponed taking action before the midterm elections, but are encouraged that he still plans to do so soon.
"We hope that your actions will prevent the separation of undocumented family members of U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, and DACA beneficiaries and offer protection to others who have long worked in the United States and have established strong ties with our communities. We further hope that they will make our immigration enforcement efforts more sensible and humane," they write.
"Bold and meaningful executive action will provide a boost to our national and local economies," they add later. And they believe that Obama's legal authority to act "is clear and substantial."
They cite the 2012 U.S. Supreme Court case, Arizona v. United States, where Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that the Obama administration retains "broad discretion" to decide "whether it makes sense to pursue removal [of illegal immigrants] at all."
They add that "every past President, starting from President Dwight D. Eisenhower more than half a century ago, has used such authority when dealing with similar issues regarding the national interest."
As for the political fallout, Democrats believe Obama is correct to blame Republicans for congressional delay: "For the past two years it was not Senate Democrats that blocked much-needed legislation, it was House Republicans. That obstacle to sensible immigration reform still remains. Let us also not forget that congressional Republicans previously blocked reform in 2006 and 2007."
In addition to this letter, Democrats are also preparing to hold a series of public events in the coming days to continue building the case for Obama’s executive actions.
Members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus rallied on Wednesday afternoon with members of the military who have benefited from immigration policies that allowed them to become U.S. citizens. And several Democrats plan to begin making floor speeches in support of Obama starting on Thursday, according to aides.
Here's a full copy of the draft letter:
Dear Mr. President:
It is extremely frustrating that Republican leaders in the House refused to allow a vote on the bipartisan immigration reform bill the Senate passed last year. Even today, if Republican leaders allowed a vote, the bill would pass. But they won’t.
When Republicans blocked legislation, your pledge to use Presidential power under existing law to improve our immigration system gave us hope. Without such changes, our economy will continue to suffer and families in our communities will continue to be torn apart.
Although we were very disappointed when you postponed action until after the November election, we were encouraged last week when you reaffirmed your promise to act before the end of the year.
We hope that your actions will prevent the separation of undocumented family members of U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, and DACA beneficiaries and offer protection to others who have long worked in the United States and have established strong ties with our communities. We further hope that they will make our immigration enforcement efforts more sensible and humane.
Bold and meaningful executive action will provide a boost to our national and local economies. It will strengthen communities and promote family unity. It will help the government focus limited enforcement resources on those who pose a true danger to the public. And by providing an opportunity for millions of undocumented immigrants to register with the government—provide detailed biographic information, undergo criminal background checks, demonstrate continuing compliance with tax laws—it will protect American and immigrant workers alike by reducing the threat of exploitation and abuse.
The legal authority for taking executive action is clear and substantial. Just two years ago, the Supreme Court under Justice John Roberts reaffirmed that the administration retains “broad discretion” to decide “whether it makes sense to pursue removal at all.” Arizona v. United States, 132 S.Ct. 2492, 2499 (2012). And executive action in this area is anything by unprecedented. In fact, every past President, starting from President Dwight D. Eisenhower more than half a century ago, has used such authority when dealing with similar issues regarding the national interest.
Like us, you have heard Republicans warn that any actions you take will “poison the well” and prevent them using their upcoming majority in the Senate to address our broken immigration system. However, for the past two years it was not Senate Democrats that blocked much-needed legislation, it was House Republicans. That obstacle to sensible immigration reform still remains. Let us also not forget that congressional Republicans previously blocked reform in 2006 and 2007.
As you said last week, “What we can’t do is just keep on waiting. There’s a cost for waiting.” That cost is measured in the tens of thousands of parents of U.S. citizen children who are deported each year. It is measured in the emotional price children and DACA recipients pay worrying about whether their parents will come home at the end of the day. Our national security suffers whenever we spend precious enforcement resources on hardworking immigrant families, rather than on criminals and those who mean our communities harm.  And American workers’ wages and working conditions are consistently undermined as long as millions of immigrant workers are working in the shadows and off the books. We agree with you, Mr. President. We can no longer afford to wait.
As you have said, it is ultimately the job of Congress to reform our broken immigration system by enacting legislation. But by failing to do their job—and repeatedly interfering with your efforts to do your job—congressional Republicans threaten to take our immigration system hostage and preserve a status quo that everyone agrees is unacceptable. Their failure to act must not inhibit your commitment to governing.
We will stand with you as you take bold and meaningful action, consistent with existing law and historical precedent, to protect American families, strengthen local communities and grow the economy.

Last call for the Passenger  another round for Columbia RoomBy Fritz Hahn November 12 Follow @fritzhahn
It's finally official: The Passenger and the Columbia Room are closing to the public on Jan. 1. The two trailblazing cocktail bars will then take different paths: Derek Brown is moving the Columbia Room a few blocks north to Blagden Alley, where it will occupy the space above chef Jeremiah Langhorne's forthcoming restaurant, the Dabney . The Passenger, meanwhile, will go dark until Tom Brown, Derek's brother, is able to find the perfect place for it in Shaw.
The Passenger's no-frills atmosphere have made it a popular place for cocktails, especially on Tiki Tuesdays. (2011 Photo by Amanda Voisard/The Washington Post).
"When we shook hands with [partner] Paul [Ruppert], we always knew there might be an end to the Passenger and the Columbia Room," Derek Brown said. The block of Seventh Street NW has long been slated for development by Douglas Development, but the developers were happy to let the buildings stay occupied while they finalized plans for an office building on the land. When the tiki bar Hogo closed in August , Tom speculated that the Passenger and Columbia Room could follow by the end of the year. Last week, the brothers got the official notice that construction is going to begin early next year. Both spaces must be emptied by Jan. 4.
Ironically, the bar is preparing to celebrate its fifth anniversary this weekend with a three-day party that will now become an Irish wake.
The Browns had been looking for new spaces in Shaw. In late October, Derek signed a lease for the new Columbia Room in a Blagden Alley building known as "The Gang of Three," because it cobbles together three existing rowhouses into one space. The first floor has been leased by the Dabney, though Brown stresses that "The only connection we have is that Jeremiah and I are friends. We respect the hell out of each other. We respect what they do. But we're not going to be the bar for the Dabney."
If all goes according to plan, the new Columbia Room is "about a year away, by the end of 2015." The new space will be about five times larger than the current setup, which has just 10 reservations-only seats. Brown anticipates having an area for walk-in customers, but hasn't quite nailed down the specifics of how an expanded Columbia Room will remain the same sort of intimate cocktail den that has garnered multiple "Outstanding Bar Program" nominations at the James Beard Awards. "We don't want to change this radically," Derek said. "We love what we do. We want to keep the core and expand around it."
Meanwhile, Tom has had less luck nailing down a new location for the Passenger. "I've been looking at spaces for a while," he said, "but it didn't work out, or it wasn't the right situation. You can't do the Passenger in a new buildout. Right now, unless someone comes up with the magic space in Shaw, I'm not ready to jump into anything."
Brown has other irons in the fire right now, though he's loathe to go into specifics about them before leases are signed. "I might do things in another neighborhood, but Passenger needs to stay in Shaw, even if it goes dark for a while … This neighborhood made the Passenger what it is – the juxtaposition of old and new. You have a lot of tourists in the area, but also a lot of people who live in the neighborhood. We focused on the people who live here, they're our regulars."

While the hunt continues, Tom has talked to other bar owners about hosting "Passenger in Exile" events after January 4. Before that happens, there are a few celebrations to hold.
This weekend, the Passenger marks five years with $5 kimchi dogs, $5 whiskey shots and $5 pints of 3 Stars beer from opening on Friday to closing on Sunday. The two bars also have big plans for New Year's Eve: The Columbia Room will have some "very special cocktails" at its New Year's Eve seatings; reservations will be available starting Dec. 1. The Passenger, meanwhile, is holding its traditional DJ dance party in the Warehouse Theatre space, with a $10 cover charge and no advance tickets.
There's plenty of nostalgia for what the Browns have accomplished over the last five years. Both bars have made it onto numerous "Best Bars in America" lists, and the Passenger has won legions of fans by having some of the area's best bartenders serving top-notch cocktails in an unpretentious atmosphere. "I think we're the first blue-collar cocktail bar," Tom said. "Before we opened, there were speakeasies [like PX and the Gibson] and there were restaurant bars and there were fancy hotel bars. But you could come in here and get a fancy cocktail, and your non-fancy cocktail friend could get a Schlitz. We're trying to appeal to everyone, to have them all come in and sit down and be friends."
"Even though we knew the Passenger only had five or ten years, I kind of always thought it would last," Derek said.
But, Tom added, the brothers realize that while the Passenger and Columbia Room were special, they're only a sliver of the neighborhood's history. Paul Ruppert's family has operated restaurants and stores on the block since the 19th century. "If the Rupperts' hardware store had stayed open, it would be 125 years old this week. We're waxing nostalgic about five years, but the Rupperts are leaving behind generations of memories in this place."

Wi-Fi users agree to terms ... and give up firstborn2
But to see just how little attention we pay when checking that agreement box, F-Secure included a “Herod clause” — one that offered up free Wi-Fi in exchange for the company's permanent ownership of the user's firstborn child.
The experiment was intended to highlight the dangers of connecting to unknown Wi-Fi networks, the Guardian reports. While only six people clicked through the Herod clause, another 33 devices connected once the researchers removed all Terms and Conditions. Meanwhile, users left their personal data — including passwords — completely vulnerable to the network.
A company would probably have trouble getting you to hand over your pride and joy (even if you were technically contractually obligated), so don't panic. But this hapless agreement to terms is pretty common: A 2011 survey found that 58 percent of adults would rather read an instruction manual or credit card bill than go through online terms and conditions. Even the phone book was a more palatable read for 12 percent of those surveyed.
And we know, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that people basically never read the things they agree to online — because if we did, we'd spend about 76 days a year doing it. In fact, this new study isn't the first of its kind: On April Fool's Day in 2010, a host of U.K. shoppers were tricked into signing away their immortal souls.
But hey, wait, what if you always read the terms and conditions? Consider this: In a 2008 study, the Nielsen Norman Group consulting firm concluded that Internet users probably only actually read about 20 percent of the words they “read.” We've convinced ourselves that we're master speed readers, but we're actually just skimming.

NSE Nifty ends at new record high; BSE Sensex gains 35 pts in volatiletradeFPI inflow in equities reaches Rs 1 lakh crore
The BSE Sensex today gained 35 points in a volatile trade while the NSE Nifty settled at record closing high of 8,362.65 points on continued foreign funds inflows ahead of inflation and IIP data tomorrow.
The 50-share Nifty continued its record-setting run for the second straight session and ended up by 18.40 points, or 0.22 per cent, at all time high of 8,362.65. It shuttled between 8,378.70 and 8,321.85 in day trade.
The BSE barometer Sensex opened on a strong footing and rose to intra-day high of 27,996.92.
But later it succumbed to profit-booking at near record levels and touched a low of 27,790.40 before settling at 27,910.06, a gain of 35.33 points, or 0.13 per cent, over previous close. The 30-share index had closed at record high of 27,915.88 on November 5.
A positive momentum after government’s reforms process and a firming trend at global markets buoyed the trading sentiment, brokers said. Global crude prices dropping to four-year low also helped the positive momentum, they added.
Brent crude for the December delivery eased 22 cents to four-year low of USD 82.12.
Foreign portfolio investors bought shares worth Rs 355.30 crore yesterday, according to the stock exchanges’ data.
However, profit-booking at some counters ahead of inflation data for October and IIP numbers for September to be released tomorrow, slowed down the rally to some extent.
Of 30 Sensex stocks, 16 scrips led by Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, HDFC, SBI, HDFC Bank, GAIL, RIL, Maruti Suzuki, M&M, L&T, Tata Power, Tata Steel, TCS and Sun Pharma gained.
On the other hand, Infosys, ITC Ltd, Bharti Airtel, BHEL, Coal India, Dr Reddy’s, Hero MotoCorp, Wipro and Sesa Sterlite finished lower.
Sectorwide, the BSE Realty index gained the most by rising 1.05 per cent, followed by Banking index by 0.74 per cent and Auto index by 0.68 per cent.
Indicating firm sentiments, the breadth of the market was positive with BSE midcap index rising 0.72 per cent and smallcap index by 0.24 per cent.
Indian shares edge higher ahead of key retail inflation data
(Reuters) Indian shares edged higher on Tuesday as rate-sensitive stocks such as ICICI Bank  rose on hopes lower retail inflation data would lead to early interest rate cuts, although profit-taking prevented the indexes from hitting further record highs.
Meanwhile, non-banking finance companies like Housing Development Finance Corporation also rose after the central bank unveiled rules on bad loans and capital requirements that came largely along expected lines.
Traders say volumes will remain muted until India releases data on Wednesday on retail inflation, which is expected to slow to a record low of 5.80 percent in October, according to a Reuters poll.
That is expected to intensify calls for an interest rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India at its next policy review on Dec. 2.
“Market is discounting a fall in inflation and a resultant decrease in interest rates,” said Deven Choksey, managing director at K R Choksey Securities.
The benchmark BSE index rose 0.13 percent to end at 27,910.06.     The broader NSE index rose 0.22 percent to end at 8,362.65, also marking a record closing high.
Rate-sensitive stocks led the gains on hopes lower retail inflation data would enable the central bank to go for early rate cuts.
ICICI Bank ended up 1.6 percent while HDFC Bank  gained 0.4 percent.
Among state-run banks, Bank of Baroda rose 2.7 percent while Punjab National Bank advanced 3.4 percent.
Some auto stocks gained with Mahindra and Mahindra  rising 2.4 percent while Larsen and Toubro gained 1.1 percent.
Non-banking finance companies also rose. India raised the minimum capital requirement for so-called shadow banks and tightened rules on deposits and bad loans on Monday, but the rules were largely within expectations.
Housing Development Finance Corporation gained 1.2 percent, while IDFC ended 2.7 percent higher.
Shriram Transport gained 4.9 percent, Mahindra and Mahindra Financial Services rose 1.1 percent.
However, among decliners, Jet Airways fell 2.5 percent on profit-taking after Monday’s 6.9 percent surge after September-quarter results.

Editorial: Tightening NBFC normsDespite dip, Indian rupee first among equals
Non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) in India are a heterogeneous lot and, to that extent, asking all of them to conform to the same set of rules might seem somewhat harsh. However, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) doesn’t really have too much of a choice but to regulate them broadly on the same lines, differentiating on some parameters for housing financing companies or infrastructure financing ones. The new rules announced on Tuesday—to be put in place in a graded manner by March 2018—are more or less on expected lines; given how financial entities are becoming increasingly inter-linked and how the collapse of one could pose serious risks to others, the central bank has upped capital requirements and tightened non-performing asset (NPA) recognition norms and called for higher provisioning. NBFCs will need to be better capitalised with Tier I capital now pegged at 10% rather than the current 7.5%. Much like banks, they will now need to classify an account, where repayments are due for more than 90 days as NPAs; earlier this was a longer period of 180 days. While stricter NPA recognition norms are a prudent measure, they will hurt those intermediaries lending to small enterprises or those financing the purchase of second-hand trucks. That is unfortunate because such NBFCs cater to borrowers who are unable to access bank funding—the financial inclusion that the government wants to promote—and the central bank needed to find some way to keep their interests in mind. According to Crisil, were the new norms in place today, NPAs for NBFCs would rise from 3.7% as of March 2014 to a whopping 7.8%; in terms of earnings, Crisil reckons this will shave off 40 bps from earnings.
While there can be no doubt that NBFCs need to detect potentially stressed assets earlier than they do now and try to collect their dues faster, the specialised nature of some businesses needs to be recognised. In the case of banks too, the central bank has been putting in place mechanisms that will help them spot risks earlier and has tightened provisioning norms for restructured loans. For NBFCs too, RBI has increased the provisions for standard assets for NBFCs from 0.25% of the outstanding to 0.4% by March 2018. That will mean more capital getting used up; some of them may now need to tap the capital market earlier than they might have anticipated. Which is why RBI could have provided for some flexibility on the borrowing side, maybe access to markets overseas. As of now, NBFCs will have to rely on banks and the bond markets because accessing retail money can be a costly proposition. So unless, the government borrows less and interest rates drop, it is unlikely their cost of funds is going to come down dramatically. Although they have time to adjust, it is going to be a tougher existence for most.

Editorial: Still circling in the skyNarendra Modi’s bottom-up idea to replace Plan panel secures support of CMs
A draft policy, by its very nature, is something upon which comments are invited and, in the case of the one on aviation, the ministry has said 6 to 7 groups of experts would be constituted to interact with stakeholders after inputs are received over the next 3 weeks. Involving experts and detailed interaction with stakeholders is to be welcomed, but it would have been better if the draft aviation policy had been accompanied by a discussion paper to help guide comments. The government has reiterated its commitment to enhancing regional connectivity and reviewing the route dispersal guidelines (RDG)—which state the share of non-trunk routes that have to be flown today—but some facts on how the RDG has fared would have helped. In the past, the aviation ministry had proposed a points system to fly on regional routes using smaller aircraft, and especially to 87 ‘incentive destinations’. The proposal was slammed by most airlines since the government wanted the share of regional routes to be increased from the 33% or so level right now to 50% by 2016, but one possibility would have been to use the points system more imaginatively. One solution would be to use this points system as an incentive instead of as a penalty—so, instead of forcing airlines to fly half their capacity on regional routes (with extra weights being given if smaller aircraft are used or if the destination towns are flown to), a better idea would be to link this with allowing airlines to fly abroad. So, while relaxing the 5/20 rule, allow young airlines to fly more overseas if they fly more on the regional routes.
Another possibility would be to go back to the Essential Air Services Fund (EASF) suggested by the Naresh Chandra committee more than a decade ago. Charge a cess on all aviation travel and use this fund to incentivise airlines to fly on non-trunk routes. The fund could be used in a variety of ways. With various state governments reducing their ATF taxes—one of the avowed aims of the draft aviation policy—if airlines fly to smaller towns, there has been a surge in such flights. SpiceJet, for instance, has launched a Kolkata-Bagdogra-Kathmandu flight in place of a Kolkata-Kathmandu one in order to take advantage of the zero-VAT ATF regime in Bagdogra. So, apart from encouraging states to follow suit—and putting out data on the response to such moves by some states—the EASF could be used to defray ATF levies in regional centres.
The draft policy does well to talk of corporatising and listing Airports Authority of India as this increases the ability of AAI to access more funds from equity markets and to use this to finance more PPP airports – the level of transparency listing demands will also help. It is unfortunate that yet another expert committee is to be set up to develop a future roadmap for Air India since, ideally speaking, it should be part of the list of sick PSUs finance minister Arun Jaitley has said he is open to privatising. Hopefully, by the time the consultations are over, a more practical aviation policy will emerge.

Columns: Powering Indias smart citiesNarendra Modi’s bottom-up idea to replace Plan panel secures support of CMs
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement of his dream of making 100 smart cities, building new or retrofitting the old ones, has stirred many a minds, including investors. Some are asking what is a smart city, is it feasible for India to do it, or is it just a pipe dream? Many others, including foreign investors, are getting ready to invest in this dream and looking forward to making it a reality.
The concept of smart cities revolves around internalising following features: smart energy (smart meters, demand response, co-generation and renewable energy generation), smart transport (intelligent transportation systems, real-time information sharing about traffic conditions and public transport availability), smart water and waste management (digitised distribution of water to minimise leakages by using geographic information systems, and recycling of waste), maximisation of e-governance services and smart buildings (building energy management systems, energy-efficient building designs and retrofitting of existing buildings). However, to keep these systems running, ensuring a sustainable power supply is of prime importance. So, how will India power these 100 smart cities?
India’s resource endowments for energy are not very encouraging: while India supports about 17% of world’s population, it has only 0.4%, 0.4% and 6% of the world’s oil, natural gas and coal reserves, respectively—a gross deficiency, considering that it is the fourth-largest consumer of energy in the world after USA, China and Russia. The fact that India is importing nearly 80% of its crude oil consumption, 15% of its coal consumption and 35% of its natural gas consumption makes it even more challenging to power the dream of 100 smart cities.
The potential answer to these challenges, therefore, lies in innovations, ranging from innovative ideas to processes and products, that are likely to make this dream come true.
One potential innovation would be to dovetail renewable energy into powering cities in a big way. Looking around the world for innovative methods, it may be interesting to note that the Eiffel Tower in Paris, which uses about 7.8 million kWh per year, has recently installed four solar panels that will provide about 50% of the hot water used for the tower. Vertical and hydraulically powered wind turbines are being installed on the first platform of the tower to generate 8,000 kWh/year of electricity. In addition, the tower’s first floor water supply network will have its own water-powered turbines producing 4,000 kW/year of electricity.
India has choices abound in conventional energy sources like coal, oil and gas, and in renewable and clean energy sources like solar, wind, hydro, biomass based electricity and nuclear energy. However, price and availability of these sources are two major constraints that would decide how these cities would be powered.
Coal-based thermal generation is the mainstay of the Indian power sector, contributing roughly 70% of the total electricity generation in 2012. Lately, it has suffered badly due to the fiasco over allocation of coal mines. But the key issue in the choice of alternative technologies is the cost and pricing of power. The price of domestic coal is currently about 40% cheaper than imported coal, despite the fact that India is a net importer of coal, and so is the story of gas pricing. This under-pricing of our energy resources not only makes us more dependent on costly imports but also thwarts the development and spread of non-conventional and renewable energy sources. While the costs and pricing of energy from coal hovers around R4/kwh, that from solar and wind would be almost double of this rate (without any subsidy), and that from diesel, almost 4 times the rates from coal. Although solar power is being motivated under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission, which aims at creating capacity of 22,000 MW by 2022, but it looks very unlikely without correcting the pricing structure, especially for coal that reflects the negative externalities it produces.
Coal-based generation puts high demand on water, pollutes air, and has high health costs. A study by Harvard Medical School estimates that the life cycle effects of coal—extraction, transport, processing, and combustion and the waste streams thus generated cost the US public a third to over one-half of a trillion dollars annually. Accounting for these externalities conservatively would double or even triple the price of electricity from coal per kWh generated. For India, too. this would be no different. But this price correction in coal-based energy is not going to come soon and, therefore, the apparent gap between coal- and solar-based pricing of energy would remain wide for some more time to come.
What is therefore needed is a focussed research and development effort in solar energy, with a view to cut down its costs. In Israel, known as the land of innovations, a solar power company has developed a technology that can store heat from the sun, giving impetus to the solar thermal power industry by enabling plants to run at full capacity night and day. Although in nascent stages right now, the technology claims to produce electricity at a price comparable to that generated by conventional sources of energy. China has also been able to bring down the cost of its solar panels. It is only such technical gains, along with economies of scale, would help solar power become more competitive in the market and, thereby, provide a stable source for powering the new cities.
Within India, Gujarat envisioned the first state-specific solar policy in 2009. Rajasthan, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Chhattisgarh and Uttar Pradesh followed suit. Attracting foreign investments for developing solar power capacities in the country is also key. The Clinton Climate Initiative (CCI) had announced setting up of a 3000 MW solar power plant in Gujarat with an estimated investment of R50,000 crore likely to flow into the state. Similarly, Rajasthan has laid the foundation for another 3000 MW solar power plant at Bhadla of Jodhpur District in 2013. With some amount of convergence, these targets can be tied with the development of smart cities in these states so that the new cities being modelled can derive their power from the energy generated by renewable resources. That would be quite an innovation to synergise the development of sustainable and clean sources of energy along with development of 100 smart cities.

Columns: No point hoarding dead wheat stocksGold futures price falls on global cues
After exporting about 14 million tonnes (mt) of wheat between 2012 and May 2014, India stands isolated in the world market despite having almost 17 mt (as of October 1) of excess stock in the central pool after accounting for the holding under the buffer norm, of 14 mt.
Wheat futures prices, tracked by the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT), fell by 22% in last one year, which cannot be attributed solely to supply-demand divergence or drop in crude oil values. The primary reason for this sharp reduction can be nailed to the Russian—Ukraine (Black Sea nations) conflict and the subsequent sanctions/counter-sanctions.
These two countries export about  35 mt of wheat annually against the  28-30 mt exported by the US. Ukraine alone exports 20 mt of corn. Thus, Black Sea countries are a determining factor for the price discovery of grains, thus, these have a direct bearing on the quotes at CBOT. Logically, bilateral and multilateral geo-political tensions should have curtailed these nations’ capabilities to export, while opposite has transpired.
Post-conflict financial fetters applied by the US and the EU led to 30% and 55% depreciation in the Russian and Ukrainian currencies, respectively. The entire agro complex is thus rattled by lower prices of wheat and corn which have pulled down soybean, sugar, edible oil, ethanol values. Russia and Ukraine also offer blended versions of milling and feed-grade wheat, which can be priced as low as $210-$220/mt fob.
Unless there is a considerable appreciation in the currencies or grain supplies in this region are choked due to harvest losses, drought or war, the revival of prices to the 2012-13 levels (around $350/mt fob) is not foreseen. On the contrary, a higher world output will keep the downward pressure on wheat prices. Pakistan has imposed a 20% import duty from November 5 onwards to curb imports by private traders—who fear further fall in the future values—to protect its domestic supply. The import of at least 1 mt by Pakistan from the Black Sea nations is expected in 2014-15.
The Indian government has been very quick in mopping up stocks, but has always dithered in liquidating the huge inventory. The moot point is whether India wants to remain a silent spectator of market movements or make an effort to bite into the commodity cake through proactive action. For the last 25years, various governments remained inert observers. By keeping stocks dead, the officialdom is displaying very little accountability. The pricing of stocks on a marked-to-market basis means answerability. Why not consider professional opinion on the pros and cons of hoarding dead stocks vis-a-vis a realisation of 85-90% or market-related payment?
If the government is in the business of grains, then it has to mean business and minimise erosion of public funds sunk into the procurement of grains. In this backdrop, does the WTO matters? Yes, it does. India must set aside its tough stance and hail the peace clause which insulates India till 2017 and settle the matter in the larger national interest. It will be a win—win agreement for all.
The prime minister has urged secretaries of various ministries to come up with novel ideas of good and deliverable governance. The food secretary tweeted on November 3, 2014, FCI’s stocks, detailed year-wise till October 2014, from which it can be inferred that FCI has around 6-7 mt of the 2013-14 crop of wheat. This grain will become 3-years old by April 2015, in just five months. It is incurring a carrying cost and is being stored in poor conditions. It is preferable to sell the new crop to Indian consumers while the old one can be disposed of abroad.
For increasing the profitability of the old crop, exclude taxes. Taxes are not exportable. That is the international norm. Recall that at the Heathrow airport in London, VAT is refunded. Discount the carrying cost of two years, if it doesn’t attract buyers. The old crop can be pared suitably by 10%. Match the world price under the WTO peace clause and earn $1.6-1.7 billion (R10,000 crore) by activating exports. If a similar solution is being considered for the private sugar mills, why not for publicly funded grains?
The government lost two valuable opportunities, the first one in Q4FY13, when it dithered in offloading wheat slightly below a $300/mt fob price, and again, in Q4FY14, when it failed to sell at about $270/mt fob. Any lack of action now will leave us stuck with another precipitative fall, to about $ 200/mt fob. Isn’t it better to realise $235-240/mt right now than to keep perpetuating losses by hoarding? Any temporary spikes in the prices should be taken advantage of, provided the authorities are ready with right policy frame work.
The price of internationally-tradable Indian wheat is $235/mt fob at the moment, while the government/FCI estimates it at $265-270/mt, based on current MSP and logistics costs. This underscores how urgently India must move forward.

Government to Address Labour Issues  Infra Deficit Soon: JaitleyMore Steps to Rationalise Subsidies on Anvil: Arun Jaitley
New Delhi: The government plans to address labour issues, infrastructure deficit and high cost of capital soon to meet the "uphill tasks" of raising share of manufacturing in GDP from 15 to 25 per cent, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said on Wednesday.
"I still find in merchandise products, our cost of capital, or labour regime, our infrastructure, the improvements which are required in our trade facilitation-- these still have to be assisted in order to bring down the prices of our manufactured products," he said.
"And as part of 'Make in India' campaign these are special areas which we will have to address and address very soon. We are in the process of doing so," he said.
India is endeavouring to become a global manufacturing hub, he said at an event organised by Ministry of Commerce.
Noting that the real job creation is in the manufacturing sector, he said: "That's why one of our national challenges is that 15 per cent odd share of manufacturing today has to be increased to 25 per cent. But that's an uphill task and therefore that leaves us essentially with the services sector whose growth is a low hanging fruit in India."
Services sector is an area where there is huge space to grow and India has potential to grow, he said.
"I have lurking suspicion that services sector would occupy about 60 per cent of the GDP space...this is one sector where governmental interference is minimal," he said.
The second aspect is that India has proved to be a competent services provider globally.
"Our success in IT and ITes are well known... Several US Presidents have tried to impose restrictive regimes on outsourced services to save jobs in the US.
"But that indirectly translated in simple languages means that you are compelling the US consumers to buy costlier services from within their own country when the same service is available almost in same real time at a fraction of that cost outside. This rules have substantially not succeeded," he said.
Talking about sunrise sectors, the Finance Minister said, India is beginning to create impact in pharma sector.
The other sectors which have potential for growth are health care, Research and Development, tourism and education.
"I think these are areas we need to be aggressive on," he added.

Postal workers to protest plant closings and service reductionsBy Josh Hicks November 12 Follow @reporter_hicks
Postal workers on Friday plan to protest nationwide against proposed plant closings and declining service standards that have led to slower mail delivery throughout the country.
The American Postal Workers Union said it will hold demonstrations at the U.S. Postal Service’s last Board of Governors meeting of the year in Washington and at 100 other locations, including locally in Baltimore, Norfolk, Richmond and Roanoke.
“The cuts would cause hardships for the public and small businesses, eliminate jobs and destroy the world’s most efficient and affordable delivery network by driving away mail and revenue,” the labor group said in an announcement.

The Postal Service is scheduled to close 82 mail processing and distribution centers nationwide in January as part of a plan to cut costs by $20 billion over the next few years. The agency has already shuttered 300 of the facilities since 2006.
The next round of closures is expected to save $750 annually, according to USPS estimates.
The Postal Service also reduced its service standards in 2012 in an effort to save money, increasing the number of days it takes to haul the mail to a given destination.
As an example of the changes, the USPS now aims to deliver mail within three days when an item needs to travel a distance of 12 driving hours, whereas the agency previously tried to deliver mail that distance within two days.
A recent Government Accountability Office report said first-class mail performance has generally declined this year because of the relaxed standards, with the Postal Service missing its target delivery times at a greater rate than before. But the changes have not affected periodicals and packages, according to the USPS.
RELATED: Snail mail is even slower now with Postal Service changes, report says
The Postal Service downplayed the findings in the GAO report, saying they do not represent performance across all districts and adding that severe weather may have contributed to longer delivery times during the first half of this year.
Agency spokesman Toni DeLancey said all of the recent changes are good for the organization and its long-term viability.
“Our mail-processing machines are sitting idly for many hours of the day, and we are losing billions of dollars every year,” DeLancey said. “It would be irresponsible for us not to make the changes needed to adapt to this environment. We owe it to the American economy. We owe it to our customers. And we owe it to our employees.”
The USPS has experienced massive financial losses for the past several years, shedding billions of dollars annually in large part because of declining mail volume and a 2006 congressional mandate that requires the agency to prefund its retiree health benefits at a cost of more than $5 billion a year.
The USPS reported a $2 billion loss during the third quarter of this year alone, and the agency is expected to reveal more red ink when it releases its fourth-quarter financials later this month. USPS officials have already said the organization will have to default on its prefunding requirement for the fourth consecutive year.
Postal unions have been highly critical of the congressional mandate, arguing that the USPS could earn a profit without it. Postmaster General Patrick Donahoe has asked lawmakers to remove or revise the requirement, but agency officials say the organization would still lose money in that case because of debt.
The American Postal Workers Union said service-standard reductions and plant closings are unnecessary, noting that USPS finances have improved for four years in a row. With the agency earning a $1 billion operating profit so far this year, union officials say the organization could stop losing money if not for the prefunding mandate.
“There is red ink, but it stems from political interference, not from the mail,” the American Postal Workers Union said in its protest announcement.
More than half of the Senate and 160 House members have called for a one-year moratorium on the service reductions and plant closings.
RELATED: Half of Senate calls for end to proposed postal cuts in bipartisan letter 
An agreement on postal-reform legislation has eluded lawmakers for several years, with opposition coming from both parties because the plans would involve service cuts such as an end to Saturday mail delivery. It is unclear whether the recent midterm elections, which gave Republicans a majority in both chambers of Congress, will change matters.

The injury that ruled Dhoni out of Brisbane TestMore
Dhoni suffered a 'hairline crack' in thumb
Dhoni was reportedly carrying the injury during the brief ODI series against West Indies where he aggravated it.

The injury that has forced the Indian selectors to rest MS Dhoni for the remainder of the ODI series against Sri Lanka and, more importantly, the first Test against Australia in Brisbane is a hairline crack at the base of his right thumb, ESPNcricinfo has learnt.
A source told ESPNcricinfo that the decision to not play Dhoni for the first Test was taken as a precaution given the proximity of the Australia tour to the World Cup.
"He could well have risked playing in Brisbane but eventually it was decided against playing him in the opening Test since nobody wants the injury to recur or aggravate with the World Cup set to start in a little over two months after the Brisbane Test," a source said.

There was confusion over the exact nature of Dhoni's injury before the selection committee meeting in Mumbai on Monday. On the eve of the meeting, a BCCI insider revealed that Dhoni was recovering from a "right forearm" injury. By the time the selectors finished the meeting, an aide close to Dhoni said it was a "wrist" injury. Two hours later, BCCI secretary Sanjay Patel told reporters that Dhoni had been advised rest after hurting his "right thumb".
Dhoni was reportedly carrying the injury during the brief ODI series against West Indies where he aggravated it. Incidentally, two weeks earlier, while announcing the squad for the first ODIs against Sri Lanka, the board had stated that Dhoni was "rested", but did not reveal the nature of the injury then.
The fact that Dhoni's injury was more serious than it was made out to be was evident from the fact that Virat Kohli arrived for the selection committee meeting. The night before, as stand-in captain, Kohli had led India to their third successive win against Sri Lanka in Hyderabad, sealing the series. The rest of the team moved on to Kolkata for the fourth match, while Kohli along with coach Duncan Fletcher stopped over in Mumbai.
The team for the remainder of the Sri Lanka series was also due to be picked, but the selectors asked Kohli to come down since they wanted him to be a part of the deliberations about the Australia squad as he will be in charge of the team for the first three weeks on the tour. While clarifying that the strength of the squad is actually 18 members - and not 19 as listed in the BCCI media release - Patel said that Dhoni will join the squad in Australia only after the first Test in Brisbane.
Despite his injury, Dhoni has been respecting all his professional commitments, including an ad commercial shoot for a BCCI sponsor, endorsements and BCCI meetings.

Dear FCC: Net Neutrality Is Part of a Social Contractreddit
With his ringing endorsement for strong net neutrality protections, President Obama has joined a public groundswell for the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to reclassify the Internet as a utility. This move would not only enable the agency to remain true to its mandate to regulate in the public interest, it would also, according to the President and many of the nearly 4 million Americans who filed comments with the FCC, promote democratic values of openness, fairness and freedom.
Such overwhelming public support for what may seem like a wonky regulatory debate reminds us that net neutrality is and always has been much more than a technocratic squabble over how Internet "pipes" are managed. It's about the role of media and information in a democratic society, and the role of government -- in this case the FCC -- to help ensure access to information because, as we all learn in school, democracy requires an informed populace. Put simply, this is about a social contract between information providers, society and government.
This contract must include a clear regulatory role for the FCC. Since the market won't automatically provide public goods like information, and since unregulated monopolies can threaten the health of our media system, government oversight is required. Without such authority, the FCC (which celebrated its 80th birthday this year) risks significant constraints and complications going forward. What will be the agency's purpose for the next 80 years, or even the next five? How will the FCC defend the public interest in the digital age -- an age of new digital monopolies? Weak net neutrality regulations risk not only irrelevance for the FCC, but also a loss of legitimacy in the eyes of the public in whose name it regulates.
We've been down this road before. In the 1930s and '40s, commercial radio was roughly the same age as today's commercial Internet. It was seen as a revolutionary force that would democratize society, give voice to the voiceless, and educate the masses. And there was a great debate in this country about how that medium should operate: whose interests it should serve, who should own and control it, whether it should remain predominantly commercial or be publicly subsidized with significant obligations to public affairs and educational content.
Once it became clear that a few corporations would dominate radio, the debate turned to specific regulatory questions: If we give broadcasters tremendous benefits -- like monopolistic use of the public airwaves -- what do they owe society in return? Are they obligated to share this scarce resource to include diverse voices? Is broadcast media primarily an instrument for democracy or for profit? As the medium became increasingly commercialized and ownership more concentrated, regulatory authority became tenuous. Despite admirable attempts to keep broadcasters beholden to the public interest, the FCC fell back on relatively weak regulatory guidelines, like the Fairness Doctrine, and ultimately lost the battle to salvage much of commercial radio and television's democratic potential.
Today we face a similar quandary with the Internet. We're again deciding what information providers are allowed to do with the content that flows through their conduits. Again, we are deciding the future of a key information infrastructure that has a profound impact on our daily lives. And it is, once again, an infrastructure dominated by monopolies. Will we repeat the mistakes of the past and let monopoly power over infrastructure shape the type of content available to the public? Or will we empower the public by safeguarding an open Internet?
Given the technological and economic changes in our communication systems, these questions are especially pressing, and decisions made now may set the Internet's course for decades to come. But without reclassifying the Internet as a telecommunications service, as the President argues, the FCC will not have the authority to maintain an open Internet. Word has leaked that the FCC is considering a "hybrid" plan that would still allow preferential treatment of content with Internet fast and slow lanes -- exactly what the President identified as detrimental to the Internet's democratic potential -- and would likely be overturned in court. Like we saw with broadcast media in the 1940s, a weak decision by the FCC today that allows internet service providers to become gatekeepers might lead us down a slippery slope of unaccountable information providers and ineffectual regulators.
Net neutrality cannot solve all of the problems facing the Internet -- especially lack of competition in the American Internet service marketplace, both from other commercial operators and from alternative models like municipal-owned broadband networks. But without strong protections that ensure all Internet content is treated equally, we may end up with a powerless FCC, few checks on Internet access monopolies who abuse their market power, and a public ill-served by its information system.
The Internet is no longer a luxury for those who can pay or a profitable plaything for a handful of corporations. It is a daily necessity; Americans rely on it not just for entertainment, but also for schoolwork, health and their livelihood. It is much too precious to be left to the mercies of Internet monopolies. It must be protected by an FCC that governs not only in the public's name but also with its consent.

Trotz pleased with Jay Beagles first-line effortBy Alex Prewitt November 12 Follow @alex_prewitt
(AP Photo/Luis M. Alvarez)
The self-awareness upon which Jay Beagle erected his NHL career came buttressed by the fast realization he would never become someone who scored goals. He could skate forever, lungs trained in the thin mountain air of Calgary. He could kill penalties and vulture pucks and summon all manner of puns connecting his surname with the word, “dogged.” As for producing offense? Best leave those tasks to the experts.
“He does all of what I call the grunt work,” Coach Barry Trotz said. “The penalty killing, the draws, those types of things. Those character guys, everybody in the room always cheers for them.”
References to “character” – and other euphemisms like “grit” or “heart,” for that matter – have long been invoked as intangible masks to cover tangible shortcomings, and for that reason many fans balked when Trotz followed his predecessor, Adam Oates, in promoting Beagle onto the top line of the Washington Capitals . The numbers, albeit in limited sample sizes, did not foretell success, and it was fair to wonder how Beagle would handle the assignment for an entire game, rather than piecemeal minutes if the Capitals needed fresh legs, or a healthy body.
The Capitals were not concerned.
“He’s probably the hardest working guy on the team, maybe the NHL,” forward Alex Ovechkin said. “He just wants to compete every single time.”
The shot differential metrics which emerged from Tuesday night’s 4-2 win over Columbus again showed struggles – at even strength, Nicklas Backstrom, Ovechkin and Beagle all posted Corsi-for ratings, a measure of on-ice shot differential, lower than 35 percent, according to War on Ice – but Beagle acquitted himself fine in the spot assignment, knowing it would likely be temporary.
“Playing with two great players, I’m just trying to create space and get them the puck, get the pucks in their hands,” Beagle said.
Once Tom Wilson returns from his lower-body injury, possibly as soon as Friday, Beagle might again return to the fourth line, logging limited ice time and doing what he does best. But he showed flashes Tuesday, no more so than on the tic-tac-toe passing sequence late in the first period.
Near the faceoff circle at center ice, back to the offensive zone, Alex Ovechkin pushed the puck ahead to Nicklas Backstrom. As three Blue Jackets collapsed onto him, Backstrom, without hesitation, flicked the puck to Jay Beagle, who streaked into open space. From there, Beagle needed only a simple wrist twist in finding Ovechkin behind him, the puck passed over his outside shoulder to the shooter armed with perhaps the NHL’s hardest slap shot.
“I just heard him calling, and when Ovi’s calling for the puck I try to get it to him,” Beagle said. “With a shot like that, it was a great play by Backie in the middle of the ice to get it to me. Opened up space and I saw Ovi behind me and he made a great shot. It was pretty cool.”
It was Beagle’s second point of the season, which already puts him 22 percent of the way toward his career-high of nine , set last season over 62 games.
“Laid it up to one of the best goal-scorers in the game ever,” Trotz said. “I like that. I like that. It was good … I’m happy for Beags.”
Beagle nearly added a second assist on a close-range centering pass to Ovechkin, who missed the open net and with it the first Capitals hat trick of the season. Beagle initially considered shooting it, he said later, after the defense took away the early pass to Ovechkin, but thought better.
“Basically the D would be in between us and I could get it to him tight from where the D was” Beagle said. “The thought, if I had a shot, I would shoot that. But I thought the pass was there.”
However, Beagle also committed two penalties, tripping late in the second period and another eight minutes into the third, an offensive zone holding which set up the night’s most pivotal sequence. As Beagle watched from behind the glass, goaltender Braden Holtby made several key stops and defenseman Karl Alzner blocked two shots to stave off Columbus’ comeback.
“It’s an awful feeling to sit in the box,” Beagle said. “You never want to push your team down. It’s a big game and to see Alzie lay down and take three or four shots, and block, and Holtby making huge saves, and the guys killing it off, was huge.”
Beagle also committed a turnover on his first shift, perhaps some nerves from starting the game. Again, though, Holtby came to the rescue.
“You never want to cough the puck up in the middle and give them a 2-on-0,” Beagle said. “It was a huge bailout and I already hugged him for that.”
But Beagle’s biggest moment came when he tabled Ovechkin’s second goal, with a perfect drop pass few knew he possessed. As Ovechkin, Backstrom and defenseman Karl Alzner and Matt Niskanen gathered to celebrate, Ovechkin raised his left arm and pointed toward Beagle. “Yeah, baby,” Ovechkin yelled to his new linemate, with an expletive that preceded it, just for good measure.

India  only major economy  to see improved momentum: OECDBank of India
(Last month, the IMF and the…)
LONDON: India is the "only major economy" that is projected to see a pick up in growth momentum whereas mixed trends are predicted for the developed world, Paris-based think tank OECD said today.
Most of the major economies -- developed and developing -- including the United States, Brazil, China and Russia, are expected to witness stable growth momentum.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said indicators point to weak growth in Europe.
The readings, for the month of September, are based on Composite Leading Indicators (CLI) that are designed to anticipate turning points in economic activity relative to trend.
"India is the only major economy where the CLI points to a pick-up in growth momentum," OECD said in a statement.
In September, CLI for India touched 99.1, the highest since May this year when it stood at 98.6. In August, the same was at 99.
Last month, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank projected 5.6 per cent growth rate for India this year, citing renewed confidence in the market due to a series of economic reforms pursued by the new government.
India's economic growth was below 5 per cent in the last two financial years. Recently, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) forecast Indian economy to grow at 5.5 per cent in 2014-15 and at 6.3 per cent in next financial year 2015-16.
During the April-August period of 2014-15, industrial output growth as measured by Index of Industrial Production ( IIP ) was at 2.8 per cent, as against flat production in same period of the previous fiscal.
Earlier this week, Minister of State for Finance Jayant Sinha expressed confidence that the country's GDP growth would cross 6 per cent in the next financial year (2015-16).
OECD said that CLI points to growth losing traction in Japan even though such a trend may be related to one-off factors.
"Within the Euro area, the CLI continues to point to a loss of growth momentum, with stronger signals of a slowdown in the case of Germany and Italy .
"In France, however, the outlook continues to suggest stable growth momentum," it said.

The S&P 500 is looking to extend its run of record closing highs to six sessions, a string of successes not seen in 17 years.
In late-morning trading Wednesday, it was down about 2 points to 2037.66. It closed Tuesday at a record 2039.68, its 40th record close of 2014.
The last time the benchmark U.S. stock market linked together six record closes in a row was when it posted eight record closes back in June 1997.

Essar Opens Geneva Trading Office  Expands Europe FootprintYou are here: Home Corporates
Essar Opens Geneva Trading Office, Expands Europe Footprint
Reuters | Updated On: November 12, 2014 22:51 (IST)
Buying Iron Ore for First Time in History, Says Tata Steel
London/New Delhi: Essar Group has set up an office in Geneva to trade crude oil, refined petroleum products, coal, iron ore and steel, the head of the new company told Reuters on Wednesday.
The entity, PeaKom SA, began operations in September and will be a global trading platform for Essar, according to chief executive Gilles Sayer.
The opening cements the company's involvement in Europe, bolstering a presence that already includes London-based traders and the 245,000 barrel per day (bpd) Stanlow refinery in the UK.
"At this stage, the company in Geneva will straddle all the commodity flows of Essar," Mr Sayer said, adding that it could grow beyond that. In an emailed statement, PeaKom said it will use its banking relationships and deal origination as a "one-stop-shop" for Essar commodities.
Raman Jaggi, group treasurer of Essar, will serve as PeaKom's chief financial officer, and Guillaume de la Ville, formerly of BNP Paribas and Gunvor, has started as head of trade finance. Tarun Naruka, Essar's former corporate finance lead and Thibaut Barthelmé, formerly of Credit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, are also working with PeaKom.
Sources said the office includes up to ten people, but Mr Sayer declined to comment on the number of staff.
The expansion of Essar's European operations indicate that it is looking to maintain a long-term presence in the region, which could be of comfort to staff at the Stanlow refinery in Britain who watched as the Milford Haven plant in Wales was shuttered last week.
Jobs at European refiners are at risk as analysts say more than 1 million barrels per day of refining capacity in Europe will close due to fierce competition from state-of-the-art refineries opening in the Middle East and Asia.
The Stanlow refinery mothballed a crude distillation unit that accounted for one third of its production capacity in September in an effort to save the plant. Its capacity dropped to around 195,000 bpd from 296,000 as a result.

The world is spending a stunning $ 550 billion on fossil fuel subsidiesBy Chris Mooney November 12 Follow chriscmooney
AFP PHOTO / PATRIK STOLLARZPATRIK STOLLARZ/AFP/Getty Images
Today, the Paris-based International Energy Agency released its 2014 World Energy Outlook , an annual data dump outlining where the world's energy use patterns are heading in the future. The basic upshot is that planet Earth is definitely moving in a cleaner and greener direction -- just not fast enough to save us from dangerous climate change.
First, the good news: In the future the IEA projects that global demand for the dirtiest fuel -- coal -- won't grow nearly as quickly as it has in the past. In fact, coal demand will level off, IEA says, thanks largely to environmental policies being adopted around the world (including the US's own Clean Power Plan ).
Overall coal use is expected to plateau and rise only very slowly after 2020. In this scenario, with coal use declining in the U.S., Europe, and China, India is actually expected to surpass the U.S. and become the second largest coal consumer toward the end of this decade. Or as the IEA puts it in an accompanying PowerPoint :
International Energy Agency, 2014 World Energy Outlook , IEA Publishing. ( License .)
Meanwhile, the IEA also projects a stunning growth in renewable sources of electricity -- wind, solar, and hydropower in particular. By 2040, it expects renewables to power 33 percent of global energy demand, as opposed to the current 21 percent, even as subsidies to strengthen the growth of renewables begin to subside:
International Energy Agency, 2014 World Energy Outlook , IEA Publishing. ( License .)
The report does note, however, that governments around the world are still subsidizing dirty fossil energy much more than they're subsidizing renewables. As of 2013, reports IEA, world fossil fuel subsidies totaled $550 billion, four times the amount devoted to clean energy.
Which partly explains why despite an overall greening of world energy patterns in the next 25 years, the IEA says we are going to miss climate goals and end up with quite a lot of warming (barring a very significant course correction). The agency cites "the failure to transform the energy system quickly enough to stem the rise in energy-related CO2 emissions (which grow by one-fifth to 2040) and put the world on a path consistent with a long-term global temperature increase of 2°C." (It was not immediately clear how much the just announced U.S.-China deal to jointly reduce greenhouse gas emissions changes this picture.)
President Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing on Wednesday announced a plan for curbing pollution. Combined, the two countries make up 45 percent of the world’s greenhouse-gas emissions. (Reuters)
We have some 1000 gigatonnes of carbon left to emit to the atmosphere before locking in a dangerous amount of warming above 2 degrees, and on the current course we'll use it all up by 2040, says the IEA. In order to stop that, we'll need four times the current investment in renewable energy -- an increase up to $ 1.5 trillion annually around the world.
The IEA's conclusion about our carbon budget busting trajectory is highly consistent with that of a 2 page box that was, quite controversially, dropped from the latest "synthesis report" of the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
The upshot of all this? Here's one way to think about it: Right now, when it comes to energy the world is kind of like a person who vows to get in shape, goes  out and spends heavily on exercise gear, gym memberships, and personal trainers -- but never works out enough, and never cuts back enough on the pizza and french fries.
Chris Mooney reports on science and the environment.

5 Ways You Can Earn a Passive Income on the Internetreddit
The internet is a big place, an estimated 3 billion people have accessed the internet at least once in their lifetimes, and given that Facebook publicly gives out information that they've got more than 1.2 billion active users, it's safe to assume that majority of these estimated 3 billion are actually quite frequent users. Now, could you say that you've got access to that many people at once down in your local supermarket? I thought so.
Ever since the web became a thing, one of the hottest discussion topics has been "how to make money online," a phrase that you and your friends have seen at least a couple of thousand times, if not a little more. Making money on the internet, is indeed, possible and actually not that hard to do -- even if you don't have an initial investment.
We won't be looking at full-scale courses on how to generate some additional income, instead -- we'll look into passive income, a term used to describe income that somehow generates itself over time, without having you spend countless hours optimizing, and enriching with content.
Build a Blog Community
I'm sure you've seen this particular suggestion a few times already, stretched into as many variations as possible, but if I didn't have my CodeCondo project up and running; I wouldn't bother recommending it. Blogging is a legitimate way of earning passive income, even full-time income if you're capable of dedicating yourself.
You're passionate about something, use your knowledge and share it with others. Even if you're not making money in the first couple of months, you will make at least a couple of hundred through the course of time. Whenever you're spaced out, or simply bored -- you can fire up your blogging platform and publish something new. You'll be surprised to learn how many people are looking for things related to your passion.
Selling Digital Information
There are various types of online media content that can be sold through third party sites, including your own:
Online Courses (Video, Audio, or Plain-text)
eBooks
Coaching
You can sell (and build, of course) all of these at the comfort of your own home, it might take a few weeks to get it done, but if you build something that people need -- the passive income is going to roll in regardless.
Mobile Applications
The mobile industry is growing at a very fast paced rate, and getting into this market now could secure a nice position for you in the future. You don't have to build premium applications, in fact -- for a passive income, I recommend building simple, free, applications that are supported by ads. Not only is it safe, it's also a lot less work for you.
Create Graphics for Premium Sites
This might be slightly niche-related, but many schools teach graphic design by default, so you must have some idea of how to create images, animations, and other graphical elements. If you've got the knowledge, popular stock images sites such as iStockphoto will be more than happy to pay you the premium for providing them with original and unique photos. Something worth looking into.
Social Media Management
More and more brands, startups and companies are opening their doors to the internet, and believe me when I say that those companies are looking for all kinds of managers, one of the most popular positions that I've come across has been social media managers; they're the people who manage all the social media related stuff for a business. It requires a few hours work a week, and I can net you a decent passive income along the way.
Make sure that you, and the employer, have agreed on the amount of work that needs to be carried out, as not to run into confusion later on.
These are just a couple of ideas that I've been able to interact with on my own journey, and you're more than welcome to share with us in the comments about your passive income earning experiences.

Linda Rottenberg: The Living Proof That Risk Carries Rewardreddit
It was while in a taxi cab in Argentina that Linda Rottenberg was confronted with the fact that while the entrepreneurial spirit is something to be celebrated in the United States, this is not the case in many places across the globe. In fact, her driver, who held a degree in engineering was not even familiar with the word "entrepreneur." When Linda cofounded Endeavor in 1997, it was to help people like this; people with the skills and expertise but without understanding of how to create a business.
Endeavor is a non-profit organization the focuses on fostering high impact entrepreneurs globally. Linda helps focus budding entrepreneurs on a path that allows them to grow their business, grow the economy and then in turn, support the next generation of entrepreneurs. This was unheard of twenty years ago. "If you can't imagine it, you can't become it," Linda explained to Deepak Chopra in an episode of NEWSWIRE.FM 's program ONE WORLD .
"We started out thinking that we would only be needed in emerging markets," Linda recalls. But what started as a small project in Latin America quickly grew as Endeavor started getting calls from entrepreneurs in the Middle East, Europe and in countries across the globe. "When economies turn down, that's when entrepreneurs look up" and with the global economic crisis, Endeavor was able to fill the void and help small businesses begin creating jobs and spurring economic growth.
Linda's new book "Crazy is a Compliment: The Power of Zigging When Everyone Else Zags" chronicles many of the experiences that have made Linda so successful. Linda explains that "the secret has been learning not to expect it to be easy, chaos is your friend, failure is ok, and distress is opportunity." Linda is living proof that risk carries reward and that even when a door is closed in your face, there is still so much opportunity for success.

Goals prove elusive for Blasters and Mumbai

TOPICS
soccer
There were rich rewards for the winner of Wednesday night’s game in the Hero Indian Super League at the Nehru Stadium here. A victory would have helped Mumbai City FC jump to the top of the table from the fourth spot while Kerala Blasters would have moved three rungs to third.
But despite these precious prizes, Blasters and Mumbai could just manage a goalless draw in the league’s eighth round and the one point that each team got helped the two retain their current positions in the table.
It was a game that the home side dominated in front of 40,000 roaring fans and co-owner Sachin Tendulkar but in the end, there was only disappointment.
Games in the ISL have frequently been fought at a hot and frenetic pace in the opening session and tonight’s match was no different. Blasters, which had a goalless draw in the last game too, brought Goan striker Milagres, who had struck the match-winner in the first home game here a few days ago, and the Kerala-born C.S. Sabeeth into the starting line-up.
Sabeeth, used in the left wing in the 4-4-1-1 formation, came up with a steady stream of passes to the penalty area while Godwin Franco produced quite a number of promising high balls from the right.
Best chance
Blasters went on the attack early. And the Mumbai goalkeeper Subrata Paul stopped a dangerous header from Milagres from close in the 10th minute after picking the ball from Sabeeth.
That was probably Blasters’ best chance of the day.
And towards the end of the opening session, Sabeeth trapped Sandesh Jhingan’s cross but Milagres’s attempt was blocked away.
In between, around the half-hour mark, Anelka found a way past three defenders but his shot went for a corner.
The second half began rather quietly but there was a flurry of action soon after the arrival of Canadian international Iain Hume, who replaced Penn Orji in the 62nd minute.
Hume did not take long to settle down and soon, he was in the thick of things with crosses to the left.
One such move, after a cross from Sabeeth from the left and Hume on the right almost saw Milagres scoring. But Mumbai stayed safe.
The Mumbai’s attack, which missed its ISL’s only hat-trick hero Andre Moritz badly, did not look very convincing tonight. And the team’s best chance came a little after the 75th minute. A goalmouth melee ensued after Subash Singh’s shot was cleared by marquee player David James. Immediately after, James stretched fully to push away Tiago’s shot from the left.
Shortly after that, Blasters pulled out Sabeeth and brought in Ishfaq Ahmed, while Mumbai substituted Subash with Nadong Bhutia.
Blasters had another chance in the injury time. Stephen Pearson, Blasters’ star midfielder, came up with a lovely freekick but Rafael Romey’s header was taken comfortably by Subrata Paul.

Websites Promising Jobs and Medicaid Are Instead Bait for For-Profit College Telemarketersreddit
A network of U.S. marketing companies run glossy websites promising jobs, health benefits, food stamps, and heating assistance -- sites with names like localemploymentnetwork.org or medicaidinsurancebenefits.com. But according to former employees of a company connected to these operations, the real purpose of these sites is a classic bait-and-switch: to get low-income people, single mothers, veterans, and unemployed older people on the telephone and push them into high-cost for-profit college programs.
Based on the accounts of these employees, and documents they have provided to Republic Report, the operations may well be in violation of federal statutes prohibiting deceptive marketing and unwanted telephone sales calls, as well as Department of Education laws and regulations barring payment of sales commissions to college recruiters. At the very least, they are guilty of using sleazy tactics to sell poor-quality products.
The for-profit college companies that have obtained leads on prospective students from these questionable operations include many of the biggest industry players: the University of Phoenix, Education Management Corp., Corinthian Colleges, ITT Tech, Kaplan, Career Education Corp., Bridgepoint, and Stevens-Henager -- all of which are currently under investigation by federal and / or state law enforcement for their own alleged internal fraudulent activities.
But these bait-and-switch websites reveal another layer of deceit in the web of companies that find new for-profit college enrollees, each of whom can bring with them tens of thousands of dollars in federal education aid, all financed by U.S. taxpayers.
A Shady Website Leads To a Boiler Room
One such phishing website is localemploymentnetwork.org, which promises visitors they can "Discover the Latest Job Opportunities in Your Area." [UPDATE 11-12-14 2:30 pm and 5:25 pm: Functionality on that site appears to have been disabled 90 minutes after I posted this article. The links in the rest of this paragraph now go to screenshots we saved before we posted. Republic Report also made a functional backup copy of the scam site.] A visitor to the site is prompted to enter her chosen job and zip code. If she does, some job listings may appear on the screen, but they are grayed-out and the the visitor cannot access them without filling out a "Get Started" pop-up box , requiring a phone number and email address, and offering a vague small print legal notice of consent to be contacted "regarding education details."
And with that, the visitor's phone will ring, and someone like Jack Suenram will be on the other end. Suenram worked from 2010 until earlier this year at an operation called EdSoup , whose parent company is called EduTrek LLC, based in Sandy, Utah. As an EdSoup phone rep, Suenram had only one objective: to sell people programs, mostly online programs, at for-profit colleges.
Suenram resigned because he felt that being part of a deception operation was "demoralizing and disgusting." But at the EdSoup call center in Salt Lake City, scores of telemarketers still dial the numbers that visitors enter into websites advertising jobs and other services unrelated to college programs.
Suenram, a retired U.S. Army captain, had worked for Pentagon contractors for a period and then began working in call centers. But he says he had "never seen anything even remotely like EdSoup before."
When Suenram started in 2010, EdSoup employed 20 telemarketers, but by 2013 the ranks had grown to over 100, making some 20,000 calls a day.
The former EdSoup employees report that about 95 to 97 percent of those people called reject the pitch to discuss education opportunities. (Although the localemploymentnetwork site pop-up has a check box to express an interest in education, former EdSoup reps say that people were routed to them whether or not they checked such a box.) The former employees supplied me with the names and contact information for numerous people who complained, often in frustration or anger, that they were not seeking college programs, along with notes of complaints -- "Laquinta ... just wanted housing assistance stop calling please!"; "Mike ... I asked to be put on the DNC [Do Not Call] list and I have been called 14 times I want health insurance"; "Demetri - looking for job on cruise ship ... no ed interest." Some complained of getting 10 to 20 phone calls in a single morning.
The 3 to 5 percent who agree to discuss education opportunities are often steered, in a coercive way, by EdSoup reps toward the programs being sold by client for-profit colleges. For example, Suenram says, if a single mother in Atlanta expressed interest in a hands-on automotive repair course in her area, but the EdSoup marketers had no such program to sell at the moment, they were directed by managers to push the woman into an online business degree. Indeed, most of the programs pitched are purely online, for degrees including medical assisting and criminal justice.
The former employees say they were instructed to make one attempt to change a person's mind after the person said he or she was uninterested in education and didn't want to be called by a school rep.
At least one class action lawsuit has been filed against EdSoup, earlier this year in federal court in northern California, for violation of the federal Telephone Consumer Protection Act, which includes the Do Not Call prohibitions .
Most of the people who agree to EdSoup's push to speak with a rep for one of the colleges, according to Suenram, are low-income African Americans, to whom the pitches seem tailored. EdSoup would have been fine "to screw anyone," Suenram says, "but, in the end, that's who you screw." (Nearly all of the EdSoup telemarketers over the past five years have been white.) Dave Madsen, who worked at the company from 2010 until April 2104 and was promoted to "team leader," says of EdSoup, "They are carpet-bombing the poor, poor South." Others on the receiving end of EdSoup college sales calls included people who were terminally ill or suffering from permanent brain damage.
Sharon Ewer, who worked at EdSoup from 2012 until September 2014, left because "I didn't feel what they were doing is ethical." She says she "felt like I wanted to throw up every single day," because her job was selling "ridiculously overpriced" for-profit college programs to people who often had ended up on the phone because "they don't have enough money for food."
The EdSoup calling operation spoofed outgoing phone numbers, frequently so they appeared on caller ID to come from the prospective student's local area. One person who had given his information on one of the fake jobs sites told the EdSoup rep that the caller ID said "Walmart."
Sometimes the eager rep from the for-profit college, having received electronic notification from an EdSoup rep that the person on the phone had agreed to talk, was already dialing the prospective student before the EdSoup marketer had even wrapped up the initial call.
Madsen says many of the client for-profit college companies listened in to EdSoup calls, micromanaging the pitches, and always pushing in one direction -- for the EdSoup reps to be more aggressive in selling. With one caveat: The schools sometimes expressed concern that the reps not violate the FTC's Do Not Call rules.
In addition to traffic from the jobs and welfare sites, EdSoup got leads on people who responded to scams promising $1,000 Target and Best Buy gift cards, according to the employees.  And beyond peddling predatory colleges, the marketers pushed an online GED program to people who said they had no high school degree and thus weren't eligible for college.
The EdSoup telemarketers were not told by management that many of their leads were coming from the bait and switch sites, but based on their conversations with bewildered and annoyed people in the field, they quickly figured it out. Doing their own research, internally and on the Internet, they found the bogus sites that fueled their boiler room operation.
Who's Behind These Deceptive Operations?
The localemploymentnetwork.org website and similar sites, according to Suenram and Madsen, are operated by a Salt Lake City company called Neutron Interactive. Clicking the "contact us" button on the localemploymentnetwork site brings up "mailto:dave@neutroninteractive.com." Copies of call sheets that Suenram provided me show that many of EdSoup's leads came from Neutron Interactive.
Neutron Interactive's website highlights the company's membership and active participation in the for-profit colleges' main trade association, APSCU. On one page, Neutron brags that "Some Of Our Biggest Fans" include Corinthian's Everest University, Education Management's Art Institutes, and Bridgepoint's Ashford University.
Another bait-and-switch site is  medicaidinsurancebenefits.com , which invites visitors to " Find and Seek Medicaid Benefits In Your Area ." Here, again, before proceeding, the user must provide an email address and phone number, and "agree" to a  small print notice  "to be contacted to discuss job openings, career alerts, legal services, and educational opportunities."  The contact address listed on the site is in the Philippines.
The jobs or other actual information on such sites appear to simply be scraped from legitimate sites operated by other companies.  Other sites that EdSoup employees believe were used for college lead generation in the past include the now-deactivated americanrecoveryresources.com and getmedicaljobs.com.
The shady world of online lead generators seems to have met its perfect mate in predatory for-profit colleges, which take billions annually in taxpayer money and leave tens of thousands of students with worthless degrees and mountains of student loan debt. While celebrities and pillars of the Washington, D.C., establishment -- like Trent Lott, Dick Gephardt, and Colin Powell -- have been paid to be the public face of for-profit colleges as they have fought to avoid accountability for their abuses, the real work of the industry often takes place behind the scenes, in the deceptive, high-pressure boiler rooms of the lead generators and the for-profit colleges themselves.
One former EdSoup employee says of the people the company preys on, "It's really sad because all these folks wanted in the first place was a job, and now they are in a program reluctantly that they will probably never graduate from and have now racked up thousands of dollars in debt that will shackle them the rest of their lives and will not lead them to a job anyway."
If EdSoup employees brought concerns to management about ethical and potential legal violations, says Sharon Ewer, "they would say we were being negative."
Do These Operations Break The Law?
EdSoup telemarketers were driven to herd people into for-profit college programs by a powerful motivator -- cold hard cash, sometimes, apparently, in the form of commissions. The former employees allege that some EdSoup telemarketers were paid a commission for connecting people with colleges, and that client colleges paid EdSoup a commission for each student who provided information about study areas of interest and eligibility for financial aid and then engaged in a phone "interview" with a school rep. The former employees have provided me extensive information about how these commissions functioned. According to their account, managers told new employees that they could not receive commissions because the U.S. Department of Education had changed the rules, barring lead generators like EdSoup, in most cases, from paying marketers based on the number of students signed up. But the managers claimed that some longer-tenured employees were grandfathered and able to keep getting paid on commission.
Federal statutes, plus  2010 regulations and 2011 guidance issued by the Department of Education, provide that third party recruiters may not receive a payment from a college based on a targeted solicitation of a potential student, and nor may such third party lead generators pay sales commissions to their own employees. There is no grandfathering of employees. These incentive compensation regulations also make client schools responsible for violations of the rules by lead generators acting on their behalf.
I don't know what compensation system actually appears on EduTrek's books -- company officials have not responded to my requests for comment (see below) -- but some employees clearly believed they were being paid on commission, and for purposes of the law -- aimed at preventing students from being subjected to high-pressure, commission-driven sales tactics -- that should be what matters.
Other laws are implicated by the bait and switch operations. The Federal Trade Commission Act, as well as state consumer protection laws, prohibit deceptive business practices.  In 2012, a group of state attorneys general led by Kentucky's Jack Conway  shut down the website GIBill.com , which gave the appearance of being an official government site but actually was operated by the lead generation company QuinStreet and steered veterans to predatory for-profit colleges. QuinStreet, an APSCU member, also paid $2.5 million in penalties.
EdSoup logs show that QuinStreet is the name of one of the "portals" or partners where EdSoup can find additional outgoing college leads with which to connect students. EdSoup documents also list an "eStomes MSPortal"; eStomes , is the name of a marketing company whose founder is also the co-founder, with EduTrek's president, of Call Criteria, a company (with operations in the Philippines) that monitors the quality of call centers, including EdSoup. EdSoup employees say eStomes also provided incoming leads of potential customers for EdSoup reps to call.
I reached out to the following for comment but have not yet received a response: Chad Tatton , president and part owner of EduTrek; Christopher Sower , founder and part owner of EduTrek; Raymond Fitzgerald , a New York lawyer and part owner of Edutrek; Dan Caffee , founder and CEO of Neutron Interactive; and  Shaun Ritchie , co-founder and partner of Neutron Interactive. (EduTrek was required to disclose its owners and creditors in a court filing in the California Do Not Call lawsuit, for which their lawyer is Raymond Fitzgerald. Another notable investor in EduTrek is Utah's David T. Cumming .)
I did manage to engage in a lengthy online chat with  Ryan Stomel , founder of Los Angeles-based eStomes, when I was visiting the company's website and got a pop-up saying, "I see you've been here a few times before. Would you like to chat with Ryan?" My answer was yes, please. Stomel, who has an MBA from the University of Southern California and has made presentations at APSCU  meetings, told me he has "no knowledge of how EdSoup runs its operation." When I asked if the company he runs with EduTrek's Chad Tatton, Call Criteria, did call center quality assurance for EdSoup, as former EdSoup employees told me, he said he could not disclose the firm's clients due to "privacy contracts that we have in place." When I asked Stomel, "What is quality assurance in this context of selling college admissions? What are you looking to verify -- speaking generally, and not about EdSoup, if you prefer?" he offered jargon: "Call Criteria verifies the score card generated by our clients." Stomel also says that eStomes has no college sales portals connecting from call centers like EdSoup, and he says he does not know where EdSoup gets its incoming leads.
Presented with information about EdSoup's and Neutron's operations, higher education policy expert Barmak Nassirian said about America's predatory for-profit colleges, "The industry's recidivism is matched only by its creativity in devising new ways to prey on unsuspecting victims. The for-profit sector seems intent on delivering new and innovative examples of misrepresentation, deception, and unfair practices on a continuing basis, and will keep doing so until agencies of jurisdiction step in and enforce the law. It would be outrageous to let taxpayer-supported for-profits and their agents so openly victimize people and get away with it."
An education technology executive who has worked with for-profit colleges said these schemes were not surprising in the least. "The biggest misconception about for profits,"  this executive says, "is that they are schools.  They are call centers that happen to have a school built around it."
Since many of the big for-profit colleges get around 85 to 90 percent of their revenue from federal student aid, and since they spend a large percentage of that revenue on marketing and recruiting, including through lead generators, we taxpayers are funding all these scams. What do you think about that?

No advice through media: Cong to leadersPrint
By: Express News Service | New Delhi | Posted: November 13, 2014 1:04 am
In the second such gag order issued in as many months, the Congress Wednesday directed its senior leaders not to give suggestions to the leadership through the media. The need to enforce ‘discipline’, sources said, was triggered by the “suggestions” extended by some of its leaders which the party felt could be given to the leadership behind closed doors.
Although AICC communication department head Ajay Maken did not take names, the sources said the immediate provocation was the remarks made by Digvijaya Singh and H R Bhardwaj.
While Singh in an interview to The Indian Express said Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi has to be more “hands-on”, the former Karnataka Governor had asked the leadership to give a more active role to Priyanka Gandhi.
P Chidambaram’s son Karti too had ruffled many feathers seeking more autonomy for the Tamil Nadu unit after the party’s split in the state. Congress sources said Rahul has not taken kindly to such public advice. “All leaders should desist from giving their suggestions and views to the leadership publicly when various platforms within the party are available where they can put forth their viewpoints,” Maken said.

Mamata  Left leaders accept Sonia invitePrint
Written by Manoj C G | New Delhi | Posted: November 13, 2014 12:59 am
Congress president Sonia Gandhi has sent invites to top politicians, including Mamata Banerjee, Nitish Kumar, Prakash Karat and Sitaram Yechury, for a two-day international conference organised by the party to mark the 125th birth anniversary of India’s first PM Jawaharlal Nehru. The event will be held on November 17-18 at Vigyan Bhavan.
Sources in the Left parties said that Yechury, Karat and D Raja would attend. While JD(S) leader H D Deve Gowda is likely to participate, other Janata Parivar leaders are yet to decide.
Sources in SP, JD(U) and RJD said the parties have received the invitation, and their leaders will collectively decide on attending. Sources said chances of them attending the conference were “bright”.
“Mamata Banerjee is likely to attend the event. She will be in Delhi on November 17 and 18,” a Trinamool Congress leader said.
Sonia’s list of invitees is seen as an attempt to rally “secular forces” and rebuff Modi, who has been trying to appropriate Congress icons. Significantly, NCP chief Sharad Pawar has conveyed his inability to attend the event.

Israel approves 200 new homes in east JerusalemPalestinians inspect damages of a mosque following an attack in the West Bank village of Mughayer, north of Ramallah.
By: Associated Press | Jerusalem | Posted: November 13, 2014 12:51 am
Israeli authorities gave preliminary approval Wednesday for construction of 200 new homes in a Jewish area of east Jerusalem, a move likely to ratchet up already heightened tensions in the city.
The decision came shortly before US Secretary of State John Kerry was to arrive in neighboring Jordan on a mission aimed at restoring calm in the Holy Land after weeks of unrest.
Much of the recent violence has stemmed from tensions surrounding a sensitive holy site revered by Muslims and Jews. The collapse of US-brokered peace talks, Israel’s bloody war last summer in the Gaza Strip and continued Israeli settlement construction in east Jerusalem have added to it.
Brachie Sprung, a spokeswoman for the municipality, said city officials approved 200 homes in the Ramot area. Sprung said the approval was just a preliminary stage of the planning process – meaning construction would be years away.
She also said city officials approved an additional 174 homes for construction in an Arab neighborhood.
Any Israeli construction for Jewish areas of east Jerusalem risks setting off a diplomatic firestorm – especially in the current fragile environment.
Israel captured east Jerusalem in 1967 and annexed the area in a move that is not internationally recognized.
The Palestinians claim east Jerusalem as their capital. The international community does not recognize Israeli sovereignty in the area and opposes settlement construction. More than 200,000 Jewish Israelis live in developments like Ramot that ring east Jerusalem to help cement Israeli control.
The Israeli announcement came before Kerry was to arrive in Jordan and meet King Abdullah II and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to discuss the situation in Jerusalem. There was no immediate plan for Kerry to travel to Israel.
Under a longstanding arrangement, Jordan holds custodial rights over Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem, including the compound known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary.
Visits by Jewish worshippers to the site have raised concerns among Muslims that Israel is secretly trying to take over the site. The tensions have boiled over into violent demonstrations and deadly violence. Abbas accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this week of leading the region toward a “religious war.”
In the latest unrest, an attack against a mosque in a West Bank village earlier Wednesday ignited a fire that destroyed its first floor. Faraj al-Naasan, the mayor of the village of Mughayer, north of Ramallah, blamed Jewish settlers for the blaze.
Israeli police also said someone threw a Molotov cocktail at an ancient synagogue in the Israeli-Arab town of Shfaram late Tuesday night, causing light damage.
Also Wednesday, Marwan Barghouti, a Palestinian leader serving a life sentence in Israel for his role in the Palestinian uprising last decade, was sentenced to a week in solitary for calling for more violence and continued…

Ebola death toll passes 5000 mark  says WHOThe World Health Organisation said that 5,160 people have so far died of Ebola across eight countries.
By: Agence-France Presse | Geneva | Posted: November 13, 2014 12:35 am
The World Health Organisation said today that 5,160 people have so far died of Ebola across eight countries, from a total 14,098 cases of infection.
The numbers supersede figures the UN health agency gave last Friday, when it reported 4,960 deaths and 13,268 cases.
WHO has acknowledged though that the number of deaths is likely far higher, given that the fatality rate in the current outbreak is known to be around 70 per cent.
The fresh toll, which runs through November 9, comes as the outbreak appeared to be spreading in Mali, with four Ebola cases, all of whom died, confirmed or suspected in that country.
The deadliest Ebola outbreak ever meanwhile continues to affect Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone the most.
In its latest toll, the WHO said 2,836 deaths were recorded in Liberia, out of a total of 6,822 cases.
In Sierra Leone, 1,169 people had died from the virus out of 5,368 cases.
In Guinea, there were 1,142 deaths from 1,878 cases.
Data from Nigeria and Senegal remained unchanged, and both countries have been declared Ebola free.
Nigeria had eight deaths and 20 cases, while Senegal had one case and no deaths.
In Mali, WHO reported three additional Ebola deaths, but said they were not linked to the only other case and death recorded in the country – that of a two-year-old girl from Guinea.
There has been one case of infection in Spain, where an infected nurse has recovered.
In the United States, four Ebola cases have been recorded and one person – a Liberian – had died from the virus.
Ebola, one of the deadliest viruses known to man, is spread only through direct contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person showing symptoms such as fever or vomiting.
People caring for the sick or handling the bodies of people infected Ebola are therefore especially exposed.
WHO said today that a total of 564 healthcare workers were known to have contracted the virus, and 320 of them had died.

Azad: PM has to choose between Indias integrity and lifting partyPrint
Written by Muzamil Jaleel | New Delhi | Posted: November 13, 2014 12:33 am
Leader of the opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad, also heading the Congress’s election committee in Jammu and Kashmir, says the BJP is playing “a dangerous game by polarising Jammu region and clandestinely indulging in unfair means in Kashmir region” to gain a foothold in the state in the elections.
In an interview to The Indian Express, Azad said Prime Minister Narendra Modi has to “choose between unity and integrity of India and strengthening his party at the cost of the country” in J&K and the Northeast.
“It is unfortunate that the BJP is going the whole hog in these sensitive areas without any understanding of the work successive central governments have done systematically to calm things down without compromising on the national interest. And the way they are trying to impose the politics, culture and thinking of the RSS in these areas clearly indicates that for the BJP, power is more important than the unity and integrity of the country,’’ he said.
“From the PM to party leaders, they insist that they want 44-plus seats in J&K by whatever means. In one region they are instigating religious polarisation and in the other they are using unfair means. Is it fair for a national government to play such a dangerous game to impose their party?” He said “in the long run, this exercise will boomerang and jeopardise the national interest”.
Azad said the strategy isn’t going to work. “They did it (communal polarisation) in 2008. The row over the allotment of land to build infrastructure for Amarnath pilgrims led to polarisation of the worst kind, which we witnessed for the first time since 1947. Elections were held in that atmosphere and the BJP’s tally went up from one seat to 11,’’ he said. “What more polarisation can happen? And even if it happens, they will get at the most a few seats more than their 2008 tally. At the most, they can reach 15, but that is highly unlikely.”
He cited his own Lok Sabha contest as an example: “I got a majority in the Muslim-majority assembly segments (eight in Udhampur) and trailed in the Hindu-majority segments (nine). “Even a person like me, whose secular credentials have never been challenged and who is acceptable to Hindus across the country, was affected by polarisation.”
Describing the BJP’s electoral ambitions as dangerous, he said, “They polarised the country and were elected to power. Now they need to understand they are in government; they needed to desist from further polarisation. Instead, they are going into the most sensitive areas… They want to thrust the BJP and RSS upon the people, not realising these regions are geographically, culturally, linguistically very sensitive.”
He added, “Congress governments sacrificed the party’s interests in these regions. The Congress had an overwhelming majority in J&K in 1975 and the National Conference had zero representatives… Keeping in view the sentiments of the people, Mrs (Indira) Gandhi got the Congress chief minister to resign and pave the way for Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah.”
He cited similar examples from continued…

Harry Reid: Dont let yesterday use up too much of todayBy Ed O'Keefe November 12 Follow @edatpost
Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.). (AP/J. Scott Applewhite, File)
Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) didn't dwell too long on his party's historic losses in last week's elections as he formally reconvened the U.S. Senate for the start of a lame-duck session on Wednesday.
Citing the famed humorist Will Rogers, Reid said: "Don't let yesterday use up too much of today. We have a lot of work to do, and no time to linger on the past."
He congratulated Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), noting that they've worked together for years, despite their differences.
"I appreciate his devotion to the state of Kentucky, to our country and to the United States Senate. He knows that I hold him in the highest regard," he said. "I'm ready to work with him in good faith to make this institution function again for the American people. I saw firsthand how a strategy of obstruction was debilitating to our system and I have no desire to engage in that manner."
"I've been able to strike compromise with my Republican colleagues and I'm ready to do it again," he added later. "Regardless of how you interpret last week's election results, it's clear that the American people want us to work together."
McConnell followed up by saying that voters had opted for "a new direction" and "called for change in the way we do things" in the Senate.
The GOP leader said he hoped the Senate would swiftly pass a short-term spending bill, a defense policy bill and continued funding to combat the spread of the Ebola virus.
"Working together requires trust," he said. "I think President Obama has a duty to help build the trust we all need to move forward together, not to double down on old ways of doing business."
He once again faulted the president for plans to move ahead with executive action on immigration, and the deal announced late Tuesday between the United States and China regarding climate change.
"Let's not do things to hurt the possibility of a cooperative partnership," he said. "Let's step back and focus on what can be accomplished together. Let's listen to the American people."

Payrolls rose by 321,000 in November, way above the 230,000 estimated, while the unemployment rate held steady at 5.8 percent, a six-year low.
The report blew past forecasts, but also raised expectations that a rate hike from the Federal Reserve may materialize sooner than previously thought.
Ronald Sanchez, chief investment officer of Fiduciary Trust Company International in New York, said the number was "unambiguously strong," though it "could mean some changes to policy recommendations with the Fed. June 2015 is back on the table for when rates could rise."
Financials <.SPSY> rose 1 percent as higher interest rates would prop up earnings in the sector. Bank of America  rose 2.7 percent to $17.68 while Goldman Sachs  was up 1.8 percent to $195.45, boosting the Dow.
Utilities <.SPLRCU>, a dividend play, fell 0.8 percent as Treasuries yields rose. Energy <.SPNY> fell 1.2 percent alongside a 1.7 percent drop in crude  prices. Most sectors ended well off their highs of the session.
"The day's market action has to be seen in the context of the recovery we've had year-to-date. Payrolls confirm the strength of the economy, but that strength is reflected in stock prices," said Sanchez, who helps oversee $16 billion in assets.
Separate data showed new orders for U.S. factory goods fell for a third straight month in October, pointing to a slowdown in manufacturing activity.
The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> rose 58.69 points, or 0.33 percent, to 17,958.79, the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 3.45 points, or 0.17 percent, to 2,075.37 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 11.32 points, or 0.24 percent, to 4,780.76.
For the week, the Dow rose 0.7 percent and the S&P rose 0.4 percent. It was the seventh straight weekly gain, a streak not seen in a year for both. The Nasdaq fell 0.2 percent on the week.
American Eagle Outfitters  fell 13.8 percent to $11.91 after the teen apparel retailer forecast a current-quarter profit below analysts' estimates and reported its fifth straight drop in quarterly income.
About 5.81 billion shares traded on all U.S. platforms, according to BATS exchange data.
NYSE advancers outnumbered decliners 1,614 to 1,480, for a 1.09-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,809 issues rose and 927 fell, for a 1.95-to-1 ratio favoring advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 98 new 52-week highs and 10 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 168 new highs and 93 new lows.

Regarding Avanti Q3 and Q4 performance everyone knows that Q3 and Q4 are relatively weaker compared to Q1 and Q4 in feeds business.
Drop in shrimp prices is a definitely a concern but only for short term. The only question is whether it is a good buy for long terms and as far as I have analysed the company, management has so far always exceeded shareholders expectations  and created wealth for the shareholders, therefore as long as the company keeps doing that little bit of overvaluation(which I am sure is a subjective criteria itself) should not pose a problem as future earnings would catch up with valuations

Explosive airbag recall increases to 7.8 million vehiclesExplosive airbag recall increases to 7.8 million vehicles
Takata Airbags Lead Toyota, Nissan To Recall 3 Million Cars
Koichi Kamoshida, Bloomberg
Takata airbag that could explode affects 7.8 million more vehicles from the early 2000s, NHTSA says.
Deadly airbag recall affects Chrysler, Ford, Subaru, Mitsubishi, Toyota, Nissan, Honda, Mazda, BMW and GM.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration now says owners of 7.8 million vehicles fitted with airbags manufactured by Japan's Takata Corp. are in danger, and should have those vehicles seen by their dealers immediately.
The vehicles are at risk of airbag failure or, worse, airbag explosions, which could spray metal debris into the driver or passenger area, with potentially fatal consequences.
Many of the vehicles have already been the subject of safety recalls. But many have not been returned to dealers to have their airbags checked or replaced.
If you drive a car made in the early 2000s, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration wants you to see your dealer -- right now. ( Charles Fleming )
The vehicles involved include automobiles made by Toyota, Honda, Mazda, Nissan, Mitsubishi, Subaru, Chrysler, Ford and BMW -- with Honda vehicles making up the bulk of the NHTSA list.
Concerned automobile owners can check their vehicle identification numbers, or VINs, against a NHTSA listing by going to this website and choosing the "Search for Recall by VIN" option.
(The NHTSA website, though, was temporarily shut down mid-morning Wednesday, perhaps as a result of increased inquiries from vehicle owners.)
8
The affected vehicles, many of them manufactured between 2000 and 2004, are equipped with airbags made or containing parts made at Takata factories in the U.S. and Mexico. A problem with the airbags' propellant can cause the safety restraint systems to fail during a collision, or even to deploy when no collision occurs.
Multiple accidents and some fatalities may be connected to the spontaneous explosion of the airbags, and the resulting spray of shrapnel into the driver's seat.
Vehicles being operated in areas subject to consistent high heat and humidity are especially at risk. NHTSA is particularly concerned about cars being driven in Florida, areas of Texas near the Gulf of Mexico, as well as parts of Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and Georgia, along with Hawaii, Virgin Islands and certain South Pacific areas, like Guam, Saipan and American Samoa.
Here is a complete list of the suspect vehicles, along with the number of vehicles included in this warning:
 
BMW: (627,615 vehicles potentially affected)
2000 – 2005 3 Series Sedan
2000 – 2006 3 Series Coupe
2000 – 2005 3 Series Sports Wagon
2000 – 2006 3 Series Convertible
2001 – 2006 M3 Coupe

AAI  Pawan Hans listing plan takes off  AI grounded for nowNarendra Modi’s bottom-up idea to replace Plan panel secures support of CMs
In his bid to put forward a reform-oriented agenda, civil aviation minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju on Monday unveiled a draft aviation policy that aims at listing the state-owned Airports Authority of India (AAI) and Pawan Hans Helicopters. However, the minister stopped short of initiating bold measures such as privatisation of the state-owned, loss-making carrier Air India or even stating categorically that the archaic norm that allows airlines to fly to overseas destinations only after five year of operations (5/20) would be scrapped.
All the minister said was that an expert committee has been set up which will suggest the blueprint for Air India’s revival and that the 5/20 norm would be reviewed.
The draft policy, which would be finalised by January after soliciting stakeholder comments, also includes enhancing regional air connectivity; developing six major metro airports as international hubs’ creating more airports in public-private partnership mode; rationalising jet fuel cost; promoting air cargo, MRO and helicopter operations; and improving passenger facilitation.
“The AAI will be corporatised, followed by listing on the stock exchanges. We have a similar objective for Pawan Hans,” Raju said.
Amber Dubey, partner and India head of aerospace and defence at consultancy firm KPMG, said, “The draft civil aviation policy reads like a feel-good document, bereft of specifics on burning issues like ATF taxes, MRO taxes, airport charges, general aviation, etc. Most of the points are ‘statements of intent’ and are ‘work in progress’ anyway. There will be no ‘open skies’ in India and hence bilateral traffic will continue to be constrained by the ability of Indian carriers to deploy equal capacity. Air India will not be privatised and will be guided by yet another ‘expert committee’ for its revival. The infamous 5/20 rule will continue for now. So will the Route Dispersal Guidelines (RDG).”
AAI, which saw its profit increase 8% to R800 crore in FY14, currently runs 61 of the 132 airports in the country and also has a stake in the Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad airports which are operated by private players. In 2009, KPMG had valued AAI at $4.5 billion.
Pawan Hans, the largest helicopter operator in Asia with 47 aircraft in which ONGC has a 49% stake, currently offers services for offshore oil platforms, remote/hilly regions and tourism/pilgrimage services.
On revitalising flag carrier Air India, Raju said it was essential to ensure that it achieves its full potential but privatisation may not be a viable alternative. To develop a turnaround roadmap for the airline, the ministry is setting up a new expert committee. Air India, which operates the largest domestic fleet of 108 aircraft but has only has a 16.6% market share, may also get a professional management in order to bring about more efficient operations.
“If Air India could get listed, I would be the happiest. We will have to take a conscious decision as it is a delicate matter,” Raju said.
In terms of airport modernisation, the government will also rope in the private sector for modernisation of four airports, at Chennai, Kolkata, Ahmedabad and Jaipur. While Chennai and Kolkata will only be offered for management contracts on a fee basis, the latter two will be offered under PPP through a bidding process.
The draft policy has also underlined the “considerable potential” of developing infrastructure for helicopters in the country as a separate category together with incentives at airports in order to reduce congestion in big cities, and aid medical evacuation, relief operations and law and order activities.
The Business Aircraft Operators Association, an association of all business jet and helicopter operators, welcomed the move. “This will promote greater use by industries to enable business. While we see a major thrust on remote connectivity in the draft, the role of small aircraft operators needs to be given due consideration,” it said.
Separately, the ministry has also said that airports will be developed with the objective of setting up integrated multi-model hubs where rail, metro and bus services can all meet. Meanwhile, the policy also says that steps will be taken with state governments and finance ministry to rationalise taxes on aviation turbine fuel — Indian prices are currently 45% higher than overseas.
For developing the air cargo industry, the policy says that six metro airports will be designated regional air cargo hubs, while air freight stations will be set up across country for faster customs clearance.

A Conversation With Anastasia Zannisreddit
Groomed for stardom from childhood, from the tennis court to the operatic stage, Anastasia Zannis chose a varied musical path. She has sung in places as geographically diverse as Calgary, Canada, where she performed at the Winter Olympics Opening Ceremony; Marathon, Greece for the start of the mythic race; and Carnegie Hall, her biggest triumph to date, sandwiched incidentally between the two. Now she is poised to propel her career into a new orbit while never forgetting the country she calls home.
Anastasia Zannis is not quite ready to speak about herself. While not exactly self-effacing, she preferred to convey her ideas and reveal her dreams to The Huffington Post in a conversation with me...
We are seated in front of my grandmother's Steinway grand piano dating from the 1920s, which I had transported from my family house in Syros, Greece.
E.C. You were just in Syros. Why was that?
A.Z. I am preparing a concert in celebration of the 400 years since the artist El Greco's birth. As you know, Syros houses a fresco by El Greco in the church of "Dormition of the Virgin," but the concert, which will be attended by the President of the Republic, will be in St. Nicholas' church, which features a choir with a storied reputation as one of the best in Greece. Obviously there will be a religious theme. I am going to sing Ave Maria by Shubert and "Amazing Grace".
E.C. From what I understand though, you are moving away from opera?
A.Z. I am much more of a cross-over classical singer. I sing arias but I also try different arrangements to them as Sarah Brightman and Andrea Bocelli have done. I don't tamper with the melody but I prefer modern sounds. It is very much what the great Greek composer "Vangelis "did who wrote the theme for "Chariots of Fire". I admire him greatly.
E.C. Yes I love his work. Does he still compose?
A.Z. Of course. His last concert was at the Katara theatre in Doha in 2012.
E.C. Would you like to sing in the Middle East? Doha is an upcoming cultural hub.
A.Z. Yes I would like that a lot.
E.C. But let's go back to the beginning which was ...
A.Z. I was born in Athens and my father played the role of producer my whole life. On my mother's father's Steinway, I started piano lessons as a discipline when I was 4. My father played me classical recordings and jazz, nurturing my knowledge of opera to follow his own. It was his dream for me to become a soprano.
E.C. Do you have siblings? What about their career dreams?
A.Z. I have a younger brother and yes, ironically, he has a great voice but his focus was the long jump and he became a champion at it representing Greece in the National team with an 8.09 personal record. He is a strong and romantic character. I admire him very much. My mother also had her dreams. When she graduated from the American College in Athens and was about to move to London to study and instead fell in love with my father, they got married and she became pregnant with me. I always feel guilty that I was the reason for her  not to follow her dream. That's why I travel a lot, I follow my dream and try to lead the life my mother never did. Every time I land in a different country my voyage is dedicated to her.
My father wanted me also to excel at sports and I began playing tennis, playing on the Greek national team from the ages of 10 to 18, and I won a silver medal in the Panhellenic games. I also travelled to tournaments all over Europe.
E.C. It sounds as if you were pressured. Were you?
A.Z. I could say that I missed having a childhood, even though it sounds like a cliché. I was not allowed to listen to other kinds of music like my peers. Even though I socialized with other children, I always had this driven focus and deep down I felt different.
E.C. How did you fit in the music and the sport?
A.Z. Well, school was until 2p.m. and afterward I did my homework, from 6 to 9p.m. I had tennis and piano and I also had lessons in English and Italian and French.
E.C. Sounds tiring...
A.Z. Yes but this routine kept me happy and when I get depressed today, I go back and recreate this disciplined life style. I never really got stressed, life seemed like a great game! After 18, I gave up tennis though and went to study opera, got my diploma at the Athens Conservatory with honors. Then I went to London and did some classes at the Royal Academy of Music. I loved that. I went to two musicals a day.
E.C. How did musicals influence you?
A.Z. That's when the crossover happened. I understood I had to take a different path.
E.C. So this was a significant time for you, an epiphany of sorts?
A.Z. Well, I gave up the tennis and I really started rebelling against the disciplined regimen I had followed until now. That's when I started to feel stress and it was the most difficult time of my life. This was between the ages of 18 and 21. All I wanted to do was to go out, go against my father, have the little revolution I didn't have at school. I spent a lot time on the island of Mykonos. Up to then I had socialized a lot with athletes while on the tennis circuit, now I felt a bit unhinged.
E.C. How did this manifest in your life?
A.Z. Well at the age of 22, after graduating, I branched out into folk and traditional Greek music. I really wanted to seem a professional singer so I performed with some really big artists such as the composer Micky Theodorakis, etc. My father was appalled! As I was departing from opera anyway, he wanted me to go to the US and pursue jazz.
E.C. How did he show his displeasure?
A.Z. He never came to hear me sing these folk songs. That was a big shock to me.
So I went to Germany to sing in a gala organized by the tenor Jose Carreras. This was my "crossover" baptism. I sang with a rock band and a symphony orchestra, headed by the great composer Stephanos Korkolis. We toured and recorded the "The Challenge " in Germany and I was very happy. At the same time I recorded 3 songs for the Buddha Bar Collection.
E.C. Well, quite a leap...
A.Z. These Buddha Bar songs somehow just happened of their own accord and these and the German tour, pulled me out of Greece. But not for a long...
E.C. What kept you here in Greece?
A.Z. I fell in love... ! I could have taken off and left definitively but the woman in me won and not the singer.
E.C. Aah ... the woman and the singer struggling against each other - what great soprano does that remind you of? Maria Callas?
A.Z. Oh thank you. But Maria Callas was a legend, I cannot compare myself to her but I feel very close to all the women that are waiting for their prince to come ! Even Callas did! Well anyway, the "in love" came to an end and that's when I appeared on the TV show Fame Story in 2005. It was at its zenith and it proved very beneficial to me. I became very famous and people were calling me by my first name on the street. It was so helpful for me and my self-esteem. But it also had an artistic advantage for me. I sang Fados (Portuguese traditional songs) and songs from Phantom of the Opera.
E.C. Would you advise young people to go on these talent shows today?
A.Z. If the talent shows now were like Fame story was then, then yes, absolutely. On shows in other countries, yes again. But not in Greece, not now. Greeks can be very conservative. The truth is that no one show or fame can give or take away the voice from you. But again after Fame Story, it was time for me to take off again.
E.C. Where did you go?
A.Z. Any place they liked and wanted me. I created my own solo concert, I reacted like I was the producer of myself, so I performed in Tokyo (Keyaki Hall), Hamamatsu, Seoul -- where I won the Best Performance Award -- for the Greek national tourism organization, in Berlin. At the Cesme, Turkey song festival I won the third prize award. I really love traveling!
E.C. Were you alone?
A.Z. I had my musicians for company. I was fine with that. My only regret is that I never had a witness to record all of these experiences. I went to other places in Asia and also to Europe.
E.C. And then to America. When was that?
A.Z. 2011. My parents had really prepared me my whole life for this American dream and when I got there, it felt just like coming home.
E.C. Didn't the competiveness of such a vast country scare you?
A.Z. No, I felt challenged, not intimidated. When I travelled before that to faraway places, I felt the sense of being alone, not followed by anyone. In New York, I always feel I am not solitary, I feel the city is my friend even though I am alone in it.
E.C. Where did you start singing in the States?
A.Z. At the Greek Independence Day parade in Manhattan on Fifth Avenue in 2012-13-14. I sang the Greek National anthem outdoors accompanied by the Evzones, the Greek presidential national guards. There were about 150.000 people watching me and then I was so honored -- they asked me to sing the US national anthem in front of the former US President Bill Clinton. That was a big honor for me. Americans are also very patriotic. They responded so emotionally to their anthem! Performing the anthems and being among all these Greek expatriates I got very connected to them, and got the feeling that they are "missing home."
E.C. You sang the Olympic anthem also at the opening of the Winter Olympic Games in Calgary in Canada and at Ancient Olympia, also in Athens on the Hill of Pnyx. Does singing outdoors have its problems?
A.Z. Not really. Of course we have microphones but the feeling is what counts. The crowd is alert and it's this feeling of an epic event happening, "we are in this together" feeling. I don't get distracted, I feel I am supporting an ideal, I get very emotional with these anthems, I am representing Greece and that counts for me.
E.C. How can we raise Greece's profile?
A.Z. That's one of the major goals of my career. So many international symbols are Greek like the name Nike, the sports brand, which means victory. Opera has its roots in ancient Greek tragedy. All actors dream of performing at the theatre of Epidaurus. It was significant for me to be the hostess at the opening ceremony in Marathon in 2012 and at Ancient Olympia at the start of the torch relay which sent the Olympic flame to the London Games of 2012. The marathon, the Olympics - all of them Greek. We need to spread this message!
E.C. Carnegie Hall - how did that happen?
A.Z. It was organized by the Federation of Hellenic Societies of Greater New York.
A concert dedicated to Archbishop Demetrios of America, to benefit ELPIDA, a charity for children with cancer. I was honored to be accompanied by American Grammy award-winning jazz musicians.
E.C. What was your repertory?
A.Z. Songs from Cole Porter, John Lennon, classical works from Italy and Spain, musicals and Greek poems by our poets Seferis and Elitis set to music by Hatzidakis.
E.C. Was this your best experience?
A.Z. Yes, my personal best!
E.C. And your worst?
A.Z.. At the Jose Carreras gala, I actually asked the producer if I could not go on and that I would pay him for my missed appearance. He told me it would cost $10,000,000 as it was a huge deal with ARD the broadcaster.
E.C. Are you usually not nervous?
A.Z. I like to spend the night before a performance at the theatre to get the vibe of the place. From 1p.m. on the day I perform I want to be alone.  My mother never calls me, she knows I get really aggressive. I would like to appear from nowhere to get on stage as I avoid talking to anyone before I sing. I would have to revert to being me, whereas when I sing I am that performer, nothing to do with me.
E.C. Has your career meant you sacrificed your personal life? Having children?
A.Z. Children have never really been a consideration to me, and yes, it is not in men's nature to follow or support women in pursuit of their dreams. It always comes down to one question - are you taking the plane to another concert or are you staying? I usually say goodbye.
E.C. Who are your heroes?
A.Z. People who surpass themselves. Great athletes, like Roger Federer, who stays at his zenith and is low profile; Maria Callas, who had the temperament to match that amazing voice and who really lived out her passion in her life.
E.C. Anyone else?
A.Z. Yes, Barbra Streisand is a heroine without needing to be tragic, yet she is not boring at all. Her extraordinary discipline has kept her at the top for so long.
E.C. So what is your dream?
A.Z. To sing with her, a song for Greece but in English.
E.C. You care for your country deeply. Do you admire other famous Greeks?
A.Z. Yes, Arianna Huffington. I met her at the launch of her book "Thrive" at a 2-day seminar in New York. She is such a high profile figure, but still she came "home" to Astoria to present her book in Greek. That impressed me. I was reading "Thrive "every morning before going out to face Manhattan. Melina Mercouri was a Greek idol too. Remember the "Never on Sunday" soundtrack, the Oscar, but also her love and her fight for the return of the Elgin Marbles to the Parthenon, a cause supported now by George Clooney.
E.C. So you hope to go far?
A.Z. Yes, I am focusing on where my career will go next but I shall never forget the place I am from and the inspiration it gives me.
E.C. Just to finish with Syros as we started with it - it has a smaller copy of La Scala Opera House, the Apollo theatre. Any plans for either one of these, Syros or Milan?
A.Z. In Milan, La Scala? Amazing - yes arias, but not a full opera. Or maybe a musical if it was permitted. I would be equally proud to sing in either theatre! You know, Eugenia, it's not about being successful. It's our nature that we serve. Our nature is our destiny! This is my motto. It's all about being authentic and honest with yourself, if you achieve that I think you have achieved everything. I have a voice, and my nature is to sing, that's my fulfillment at the end of the day.
And as she shakes her long chestnut hair and smiles a radiant smile you believe that she could be happy in either La Scala.

SC stays Aptel hearing on Adani Powers pleaNarendra Modi’s bottom-up idea to replace Plan panel secures support of CMs
The Supreme Court on Tuesday stayed proceedings before the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (Aptel) which is hearing Adani Power’s appeal over certain unmet demands when power regulator Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) allowed it “compensatory tariff” for supplying power from its Mundra project  because of hike in imported coal prices.
A similar appeal by CGPL,  a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tata Power Company, whose Mundra power  station was allowed the compensatory tariff by CERC, also being heard by the tribunal, hasn’t been stayed,  as it is pending before another bench headed by Justice JS Khehar.
Adani Power and CGPL are demanding that the force majeure and change in law clauses in power purchase agreements should be factored in while deciding the compensatory tariff.
The tariff hikes could have been sharper if the CERC allowed these.  The companies also want the recovery of compensatory tariff for pre-March 2013 arrears.
Meanwhile, Adani’s counsel informed the the tribunal on Tuesday about the apex court’s directions on its appeal regarding condonation of delay in filing appeal against the CERC order.
The Aptel chairman remarked that it will now be not proper to continue further hearing and the matter was adjourned to November 28. The tribunal was hearing on day-to-day basis the firms’ pleas for compensatory tariff towards pre-March 2013 arrears as its chairman, Justice M Karpaga Vinayagam, is due to retire by the end of the month.
While the tribunal has posted the matter for hearing on November 28, the apex court will decide the issue on November 25. Both firms have sought hike in power tariffs on account of “unprecedented and unforeseen” circumstances leading to escalation in imported coal prices from Indonesia.
They had separately challenged a part of the April 2013 order (for non-invocation of force majeure) of the CERC before the Aptel, which rejected their pleas on the grounds of “inordinate delay” in filing appeals. CERC, while allowing compensatory tariff to CGPL and Adani Power last year, had asked the power procuring states to form a panel and decide on the quantum of compensation.
The committee, headed by HDFC Bank chairman Deepak Parekh, had recommended that CGPL be allowed an increase of 45-55 paise tariff in its Mundra plant. Based on the report, CERC had in February 2014 ruled power-generation companies be allowed to adjust the compensation arising out of the increasing cost of domestic fuel and rising dependence on costly imported fuel.
Subsequently, Aptel had on July 21 this year awarded the Tata Mundra UMPP  compensatory tariff at 54 paise per unit and Adani’s Mundra project had got compensatory tariff at 41 paise unit.

Gas regulator wants break-up of MRP from local distribution entitiesNarendra Modi’s bottom-up idea to replace Plan panel secures support of CMs
Gas regulator Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) on Tuesday told the Supreme Court that all city or local natural gas distribution entities (CGD), including Delhi-based Indraprastha Gas, should provide a detailed break-up of the MRP charged by them from consumers, including various cost components.
A bench headed by Justice Dipak Misra, while posting the matter for hearing on Wednesday, observed that prima facie PNGRB didn’t appear to have powers for regulating retail price or transmission tariff and thus cannot compel the government to pass any such notification to regulate prices and tariffs. Stating that IGL may not fall under common or contract carrier category, the apex court also sought to know the impact of the central government’s February 18 notification that directed all city or local natural gas distribution entities to ensure transparency in pricing, the break-up of CNG (transport) and also disclosure of PNG (domestic) price to consumers.
Senior counsel Arvind Dattar, appearing for PNGRB, said such disclosure of transportation tariff based on self-declaration by the entities is in the interests of fair trade.
According to PNGRB, CGD entities, which have been granted authorisation based on competitive bidding after the establishment of the Board, were already complying with the disclosure requirements. Such disclosure norms are equally applicable to entities like IGL, which were authorised by the central government prior to the establishment of PNGRB, and have been conferred with “deemed authorisation” status under section 16 of the PNGRB Act.
It further argued that while it does not have powers to fix the selling price, the statute provides for fixing of transmission tariffs.
However, IGL alleged that PNGRB was adopting indirect means to assume power for regulating prices and it cannot fix transportation cost for city gas carriers. Meanwhile, the government also backed IGL stating that PNGRB is not empowered to determine retail prices.
PNGRB in April 2012 had directed gas utility company IGL to cut it’s network tariff to R38.58 per million British thermal unit against R104.05, down by around 63%. The regulator fixed CNG compression tariff at R2.75 a kg against R6.66/kg charged by IGL.
The Delhi-based gas utility had appealed against this order in the Delhi High Court, which in June last year held that the regulator had no jurisdiction to fix rates or regulate gas tariffs for entities like IGL who have their own distribution network. Aggrieved by this, the gas regulator had moved the apex court, which in August 2012 ordered that for the time being, it would be open to PNGRB to collect all relevant information to fix any component of network tariff or compression charge for an entity but such fixation shall not be notified without its permission.

More safety features in cars will mean less road safety  says Maruti chiefMercedes Benz inaugurates Chandigarh's largest dealership
RC Bhargava, chairman of the country’s largest carmaker Maruti Suzuki, has cautioned the government against falling for any global body’s assertion that safety measures like airbags or disc brakes be made mandatory for all cars, even entry-level ones.
In an interview with FE, Bhargava said recommendations like the recent one from the Global NCAP (New Car Assessment Programme), a private autonomous body, would only expose consumers to more risks. He said that if carmakers incorporate such features in even entry-level cars, obviously the price would go up, which would lead consumers to opt for two-wheelers, which would be more unsafe.
He said that such findings by global autonomous bodies did not take into account Indian conditions and acting on them could be counterproductive.
“The intention should be to reduce road fatalities. Therefore, we have to take a total picture of Indian road issues. If you only take cars, that results in just 3-4% improvement. But this may also do damage somewhere else, because the risk factor of a person driving a two-wheeler is far higher than those driving even old Fiat cars,” he said.
“Are you overall helping or reducing safety? The person who graduates to a car from a two-wheeler is a very marginal guy, a little bit of price increase and he will push the purchase away for the next year. We saw that when the petrol prices went up, these guys could not afford cars,” he added.
Though the road ministry has not come forward with any concrete proposal so far, there have been suggestions at the official level to make airbags mandatory in all cars to increase road safety.
Going by current cost estimates, adding two front airbags to an entry-level and the country’s top-selling car like the Alto 800 would add about R30,000 to the starting price of R2.4 lakh. Further, adding an anti-lock braking system, which reduces braking distances especially in wet conditions, will further push the price up by about R10,000.
In the most recent tests conducted this month, Global NCAP tested the Maruti Swift and Datsun Go. In February this year, it had tested the Maruti Suzuki Alto 800, Tata Nano, Ford Figo, Hyundai i10 and Volkswagen Polo. Besides the Polo and Figo, all other cars completely failed the tests. The agency conducts side impact test, where another car hits the target vehicle at 40 kmph, and a frontal offset test at 64 kmph.
“People are talking of car safety and we have about 1.5 lakh road fatalities, therefore cars should be made more safe. None of these people have established any link between the number of deaths and cars. If you actually look at the data, there is huge difference. One point is that in the EU, 50% of the road fatalities are inside cars, but in India it is 16%. This is because two-wheelers and pedestrians are far higher,” Bhargava said.
He said that a “commercial angle” is always present in pushing such technologies. “Somebody wants to sell an airbag, what does he do? He pushes the safety angle. Nobody has yet proved that unsafe cars are the reason for higher road fatalities,” he said, adding that most companies now offer airbags in the top variants of all car models, so if buyers drive on highways at higher speeds, they can buy that version.
Incidentally, Global NCAP chairman Max Mosley has also written a letter to Nissan chairman and CEO Carlos Ghosn asking the company to withdraw the “substandard” Datsun Go model from India and other markets because its body shell is so unstable that even adding airbags would be pointless.
Bhargava speak
There’s no linkage in India between road fatalities and unsafe cars
Unlike in EU countries where 50% road fatalities are inside cars, in India it is only 16%
There could be a commercial angle in pushing such safety technologies
Such measures can improve road safety by only 3-4%
Features like airbags are offered in higher-end cars

Minority BJP govt in Maha does  unprecedented first   wins confidence motion by voice vote; Shiv Sena ragesAkhilesh Yadav wants equal participation of states, Centre
The 13-day-old Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government headed by Devendra Fadnavis today won the confidence motion in Maharashtra Assembly by a voice vote, amid protests by former ally Shiv Sena.
As the motion seeking vote of confidence in the BJP government moved by MLA Ashish Shelar was passed in the House where the ruling party is in minority, Shiv Sena MLAs stormed the Well seeking division of votes.
“The motion has been passed,” Speaker Haribhau Bagade announced in the din.
Agitated members of Shiv Sena, which had earlier said that it will oppose the trust vote and and had demanded that its leader Eknath Shinde be accorded the status of Leader of Opposition, shouted slogans.
The Speaker later also announced appointment of Shinde as Leader of Opposition in the House.
Earlier in the day, Bagde was unanimously elected as the Speaker of the Maharashtra Assembly after Congress and Shiv Sena withdrew their candidates from the race.
The Speaker had said he would take up the issue of Sena’s demand for LoP’s post after the trust vote as Congress had also staked claim and he would have to study the legal implications. Congress had demanded LoP’s post on the ground that Sena continued to be a constituent of BJP-led NDA.
After Sena members objected to the passing of the trust motion by a voice vote and sought division, Bagde adjourned the House.
When proceedings resumed, the Speaker announced appointment of Shinde as Leader of Opposition in the House.
Sena MLAs led by Shinde registered protest over the confidence motion being passed by voice vote and said it amounted to “strangling democracy”.
“The House should be run as per rules and the Constitution should not be trampled upon. The new government is strangulating democracy. We sought division but the trust vote was passed by voice vote,” Shinde said.
Rejecting his contention, the Speaker said, “The issue is over. The trust vote has been passed.”
Chief Minister Fadnavis joined issue with Shinde, saying, “Although there is the word opposition in your designation, the expectation is that you should not oppose each and every issue and support the government’s pro-people decisions.”
Later, speaking to reporters outside the Assembly, former Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan described the passing of the confidence motion by voice vote as “unprecedented” and demanded that the government seek a fresh vote through division.
“It is a black day in the democratic process in Maharashtra. Never a confidence motion has been passed by voice vote. Until the government proves its majority in the House by division, the government is illegitimate,” he said.
State Congress president Manikrao Thakre held that the motion had “not been “passed as there was no division of votes.
“Being a minority government it was the duty of the government to pass the motion through division. They are around 25 MLAs short (of majority). Atal Behari Vajpayee government fell by one vote in Parliament.
“We will frustrate all attempts to manipulate a majority and not allow the Assembly to conduct any business until the government obtains a fresh trust vote,” Thakre said, adding the party MLAs will call on Governor C Vidyasagar Rao to lodge a formal protest.
“Vidhan Sabha stands tarnished today,” Shiv Sena leader Ramdas Kadam said, claiming since the Fadnavis government did not enjoy majority in the House, it had manipulated the trust vote.
“A division would have made it clear whether they have the support of the majority of MLAs. The confidence motion has not been passed,” he said.
Raising questions about the conduct of the Speaker, Kadam said he would speak to leaders of all non-BJP parties, including NCP, which had declared outside support to the government, whether a no-confidence motion should be brought against him.
“People of Maharashtra will not forgive the BJP government for what they have done,” he said.

Govt to soon take action to counter steel imports from ChinaNEW DELHI, November 12, 2014
Updated: November 12, 2014 16:01 IST
Govt to soon take action to counter steel imports from China
PTI
economy (general)
On the plea of domestic steelmakers, government is soon expected to initiate measures to counter cheap and galloping imports from China, the world’s largest producer.
“Steel companies have written to me and we are discussing the issue which will be resolved soon. Give us time for a day or two,” Steel and Mines Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said when asked if the government was mulling to take measures in view of the rising steel imports from China.
Steel firms and their representative body, India Steel Association, recently wrote to the Steel Ministry seeking its intervention on the galloping imports from China.
Reaping benefit from a host of advantages including lower rate of interest, cheaper raw material and encouragement from the government, Chinese steelmakers are increasingly exporting steel, impacting both large, medium and small steel makers in India.
They are also sending steel right from the basic grade to high-quality bypassing Indian standards and circumventing the existing duties, both levied by India and China, and taking advantage of their lower cost of production, as per the industry.
India levies between 2.5 per cent and 10 per cent on imports of various grade of steel.
According to Joint Plant Committee, a unit under the ministry, imports from China have surged by a whopping 108 per cent during the April-September period of the current fiscal to 1.34 million tonnes (MT). During the period, India’s total imports rose by 27 per cent to 3.86 MT.
“Their export price is at par or even lower compared to the cost of production in India. They are benefiting from a host of advantages such as lower interest rate and cheaper raw material. The Chinese government also encourages exports,” said Ganesh Pai, spokesperson, Essar Steel.
He said most Indian companies are not in a position to bring down their cost of production as domestic iron ore prices are still ruling high even as globally the price of the raw material has nosedived to its five-year low. Chinese mills are getting their raw material cheaper.
There is also a compulsion for the Chinese steel makers to export products in other countries as their domestic demand is slowing down in the wake of a subdued economy.
Production, on the other hand, has been on the rise. It rose to 618 million tonnes in the first nine months of current year, up by 2.3 per cent from the same period a year earlier.
Global production rose to 1,231 million tonnes during January-September period.
A senior economist with a think-tank said that the issue of Chinese export into India has assumed a serious proportion and if the government does not initiate steps now, it will turn out to be a very big problem for domestic steel makers.

India outlook brightens as output rises  inflation coolsNarendra Modi’s bottom-up idea to replace Plan panel secures support of CMs
India’s economic outlook brightened on Wednesday with a surprise pickup in industrial output and further cooling in consumer prices, data showed, boosting Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s bid to end the longest slowdown in growth in decades.
Retail inflation, which the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) tracks in setting lending rates, slowed to 5.52 percent in October from a multi-year low of 6.46 percent a month earlier, helped by slower annual rises in food and fuel prices.
Industrial output unexpectedly grew 2.5 percent year on year in September, its fastest pace in three months, helped by a rebound in the capital goods sector, separate government data showed.
Read Full Report: CPI Inflation
Wednesday’s data is expected to bolster the outlook for Asia’s third-largest economy which is recovering weakly from a two-year spell of sub-5 percent growth.
Economic growth hit a 2-1/2 year-high of 5.7 percent in the quarter to June, prompting some economists to predict 6 percent growth for the fiscal year to March 2015, higher than 5.5 percent projected by the central bank.
But lacklustre industrial production since then has led some to trim their more optimistic projections.
Read Full Report: IIP Growth
Cooling prices will intensify pressure on the RBI to cut interest rates to stimulate consumer demand which powers 60 percent of the economy.
“A rate cut at this juncture will no doubt add to the existing positive growth impulses,” said Prithviraj Srinivas, an economist with HSBC.
“But such a move would also increase the risk that the RBI misses its inflation target … to return inflation back to the level last seen in the period between 1999 and 2005, when CPI inflation averaged just 4 percent.”
Worries that price pressures would revive once food prices pick up due to a weak monsoon and the fading of base effects led the RBI to leave one of Asia’s highest lending rates on hold for a fourth straight meeting in September.
It is widely expected to maintain the status quo when it reviews monetary policy on Dec. 2.
Slowing inflation, however, has bolstered hopes for a rate cut next year, triggering a rally in the bonds market.
COMMENTARY
SOUMYA KANTI GHOSH, CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISER AT STATE BANK OF INDIA, MUMBAI:
“The CPI trajectory is benign and the decline is well entrenched. I expect the next number to be below 4.5 percent.
“But we do not expect an RBI rate cut before mid-2015 as inflation will remain higher than RBI’s 6 percent target by January 2016. The IIP (industrial output) is better than expectation, but this could be a transient number and improve only in the last quarter of the current fiscal year.”
SHIVOM CHAKRABARTI, SENIOR ECONOMIST AT HDFC BANK, MUMBAI
“We see some further downside in inflation driven by base effect. There is strong indication that food price inflation and momentum of core inflation is coming off.
“But that said, trajectory of CPI inflation will only be clear after base effect wears off post-December.
“We expect a status quo on rates in the RBI policy though the statement could be more dovish than in the September policy.
“The industrial production number is high, but the worrying aspect is consumer goods, which is fairly weak. The real improvement in industrial production will be seen next year when inflation comes down, which will spur consumer spending and exports will be higher.”
RUPA REGE NITSURE, CHIEF ECONOMIST, BANK OF BARODA, MUMBAI
“It is a very sweet pair of numbers, but the point is that with IIP (industrial production) one cannot look at it with a high level of credibility because it is a very, very volatile series.
“It has to do with the lumpiness in the capital goods production series. But what really matters is that all other indicators of economic activity actually have slowed in the month of October, whether it is PMI, or credit demand or auto sales. So I don’t think that today’s reading of industrial production is sustainable.
“Inflation, of course, has started moderating but recent data shows that towards the end of October we have seen spikes in vegetable prices as well as in cereal prices because of delayed monsoon. So there’s a big question of sustainability of these readings.
“I stick with my stance that at least in the current financial year there will not be any rate reduction.
R. SIVAKUMAR, HEAD OF FIXED INCOME, AXIS ASSET MANAGEMENT, MUMBAI
“CPI is more or less in line. Post-September we saw a cut in petrol, diesel prices. Along with the ongoing play on the base effect, both have worked on the year-on-year number.
“IIP (industrial production) is a bit above survey, but that doesn’t say much.
“It’s still a very weak reading at 2.5 percent. We had a series of decent reading leading up to the June quarter, but the subsequent quarters have clearly indicated a weak reading, which may point to a slightly low GDP number at the end of the month.”
A PRASANNA, ECONOMIST, ICICI SECURITIES PRIMARY DEALERSHIP, MUMBAI
“The CPI data is positive.
“Next number is also expected to be benign and could be below 5 percent. But base effect will kick in after that, which will push up inflation in the January-March quarter, and average inflation could be at 7 percent by financial year-end.
“As far as RBI is concerned though, inflation is likely to undershoot RBI’s 8 percent target for January 2015. There are still upside risks to the 6 percent target by January 2016 and therefore we expect rates to remain unchanged this financial year.”
SOUMYAJIT NIYOGI, ANALYST, SBI DFHI LTD, MUMBAI
“The unexpected fall in October consumer inflation will mean that the inflation number for the December quarter will likely be less than 7 percent.
“This is heartening and gives RBI scope to consider rate cuts next year. On the IIP (industrial production) front, although the rebound is reassuring, we do expect some moderation in the coming days.
“The 10-year bond has already factored in this substantial fall in inflation, so the incremental gains from hereon in government bonds will be limited. Lastly we expect RBI to cut interest rates only by February next year.”

Advocate R. Krishnamurthy produced a newspaper report before a Bench of Chief Justice H.L. Dattu and Justices Madan B. Lokur and A.K. Sikri and pleaded that the court take suo motu cognisance of the incident.
The CJI told counsel: “The Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh has taken up the issue with the Prime Minister. We cannot take suo motu action. Instead of coming out with a newspaper report, you should have come out with proper papers.”

The Aam Aadmi Party on Wednesday launched 'Delhi Dialogue', an initiative under which the party would encourage people’s collaboration in policy making and preparing the blueprint for making Delhi a world class city.
Launched at a time when assembly elections are just round the corner, the initiative would challenge the conventional practice of releasing manifestos days before polling dates, which, according to party leaders, was to evade discussions on feasibility and scrutiny on delivery.
Instead of telling people what the party can do for them, the AAP volunteers will hold discussions with all kinds of people to understand their needs and aspirations. And the points raised during these discussions will reflect in the party’s manifesto.
“We will hold dialogues with professionals, housewife, students, youth, women, villagers, industrialists, besides residents JJ cluster and unauthorised colonies. We will then prepare a 50-point programme, prepare a blue-print and address these issues. We want the people to tell us how they want their Delhi to be,” former Delhi Chief Minister and party's national convenor Arvind Kejriwal told reporters at Constitution Club here.
Party leader Ashish Khetan said an honest government is the one which lets people have a say in governance, something Congress and BJP, the two parties who have ruled Delhi in the past, have failed to do.
“An accountable and responsive government seeks participation from the people tapping into their immense potential. Delhi is a city where we have a vast pool of those who have expertise in various fields as well as domain knowledge. We want to utilise their skills in government planning to bring the government and the governed there,” he said.
As a part of the initiative the party will hold a rally of the youth in the national Capital on Saturday and address their issues. A similar rally will be held on November 26, party's foundation day, where issues related to women's safety would be addressed. Water, power, health and education are some of the key sector party plans to work on.
Mr. Khetan also said that there will be a sync between discussion and delivery. “If the party forms the government, we will ensure that qwe fix deadlines for each and every project,” said the journalist-turned-politician.
The core team handling Delhi Dialogues comprise Mr. Khetan as well as Adarsh Shastri, who quit his high profile job to contest Lok Sabha ticket and banker-turned politician Meera Sanyal and Preeti Sharma Menon.

Sterilisation deaths: Protesters storm Ch tisgarh streetsComments
Furious protesters took to the streets in Chhattisgarh on Wednesday as activists complained standard procedures and guidelines were not followed in the state's mass government-run sterilisation programme that left 13 women dead.

A team of doctors rushed to Bilaspur to investigate the deaths following the operations performed by a doctor accused of using rusty equipment in an operation theatre that had not been used for four months.
The cause of the deaths was not immediately clear, but officials said the victims showed signs of toxic shock, possibly because of dirty surgical equipment or contaminated medicines. The victims had suffered vomiting and a dramatic fall in blood pressure after undergoing laparoscopic sterilisation, a simple process in which the fallopian tubes are blocked.
"Preliminary examinations suggest septic shock may have caused the deaths," said local government official Amar Thakur. "It looks like the equipment that was used was probably infected. We are waiting for the report."
A total of 83 women, all villagers under the age of 32, had the operations on Saturday and were sent home that evening, but more than 50 became seriously ill later and had to be hospitalised.
The expert team from Delhi's All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) reviewed the clinical details of the women who fell ill, but did not say what led to the deaths.
"All of us unanimously think that the cause of the illness can only be ascertained after all laboratory results and post-mortem findings are available," said Dr Anjan Tirkha, who headed the seven-member team.
Sources said the death may have been caused by drugs prescribed to the patients or internal malfunctioning resulting in renal failure, respiratory failure and liver infections.
The doctor has been accused of operating on more than 80 women in just a few hours with the help of two assistants in an abandoned private hospital, officials said.
Police have filed a case of causing death by negligence against the doctor, RK Gupta, Bilaspur IGP Pawan Dev told HT.  The state government rewarded Gupta on January 26 for accomplishing his target of laproscopic tubectomies.
N Sarojini, founder and director, Sama Resource Group for Women and Health, said the Bilaspur surgeries violated Supreme Court orders saying that a medical team can conduct a maximum of 30 operations in a day with two separate laparoscopes.
"One doctor cannot do more than 10 sterilisations in one day, yet the surgeon in Chattisgarh did an astounding 83 surgeries in a short span of five to six hours… The scale of these deaths and critical morbidity clearly show that these operations were not done under standard protocols," she said.
"The only step that has been taken by the government till now is to announce Rs. 4 lakh compensation for the families of the dead and suspension of some doctors. These steps are not adequate to ensure that such incidents do not happen again. The systemic failures that led to this incident need to be addressed."
Although the surgery is voluntary, rights groups say the target-driven nature of the programme has led to women being coerced into being sterilised. Women are given Rs. 1,000 rupees and men Rs. 2,000 as incentive to undergo the procedure.
Shiv Kumari Yadav, 26, and Parvati Bai, 25, said they would not have opted for the procedure had they known about the surgeries were carried out in an unhygienic operation theatre. "Two women were simultaneously handled on the two parallel beds by the doctors," said one of the patients.
The Chhattisgarh high court has issued notices to the union and state governments as well as the Medical Council of India seeking a detailed report within 10 days.

Chris Hayes highlights Fox Newss extreme coverage of EbolaBy Erik Wemple November 12 Follow @ErikWemple
Yesterday brought the news that physician Craig Spencer, New York’s Ebola patient, had emerged from treatment free of the virus. That means that the United States is now Ebola-free, a prospect that you’d never believe possible, given the cable-news frenzy over the deadly virus earlier this fall.
MSNBC’s Chris Hayes put together a highlight reel from the days of panic. No surprise, the clips fall heavily in the direction of Fox News. The highlights of the highlights:
Fox News host Megyn Kelly: “Breaking tonight with Ebola scares popping up across the country.”
Fox News host Bill O’Reilly: “All flights from West Africa should immediately be discontinued to the USA.”
Fox News host Eric Bolling: “Meanwhile, we have a border that is so porous, Ebola or ISIS or Ebola on the backs of ISIS could come through our border.”
Fox News host Sean Hannity: “Should pets who have been exposed to the Ebola virus be euthanized?” “Yes,” says an off-camera voice.
Fox News host Bill O’Reilly: “That’s where we are. Many people frightened and angry that Ebola may spread throughout the USA.”
Fox News host Jeanine Pirro: “What’s that? You don’t want people to panic. You don’t want us to panic? How about I don’t want us to die.”
The purpose of Hayes’s mashup, of course, was to lampoon all these expressions of panic and concern over Ebola circa several weeks ago. Hayes should be careful, however: Ebola is still raging in some parts of West Africa, and if it and ISIS team up to penetrate the United States, he’ll be sorry.

A ton of people didnt vote because they couldnt get time off from workBy Christopher Ingraham November 12 Follow @_cingraham
64 percent of you didn't even bother this year. (AP Photo/Jack Dempsey)
You've heard the news by now that turnout in the 2014 midterms was the lowest in any election since 1942 , when voters were busy with, you know,  other stuff . In short, only 36 percent of the voting-age population bothered to cast a ballot last week. A large proportion of them simply aren't registered to vote at all. But past numbers suggest upwards of 20 percent of Americans adults were registered to vote, but couldn't be bothered to - what's their excuse?
A new Pew Research Center report has some answers. They tracked down 181 registered voters who said they did not vote this year and asked them their reasons for doing so. While it's a smallish sample and we should be cautious about interpreting it too broadly, respondents gave some illuminating answers. Here's what they said:
A full two-thirds said they simply didn't have enough time to vote. More than half of this group - 35 percent of the total - said that scheduling conflicts with work or school kept them from getting to the polls last Tuesday. Another 34 percent of the total said they were simply too busy, or that they were sick, out of town, or forgot about election day.
Twenty percent said they didn't like the candidates, didn't know enough to vote, or simply didn't care. And another 10 percent said that technical difficulties kept them from the polls - a missed registration deadline, a recent move or lack of transportation.
In short, voters didn't make it to the polls for two overarching reasons - either they were indifferent and couldn't be bothered, or there were structural forces conspiring against them - rigid job/school schedules or difficulties with the voting process overall.
Tackling voter indifference is an evergreen problem - it's why campaigns spend millions on get-out-the-vote efforts. But these numbers suggest we can take steps to ease the structural difficulties with voting, too. Republican vote-suppression efforts have already received plenty of attention , and rightfully so - it's an embarrassment that one political party sees a smaller electorate as the path to victory.
But voters turned back at the polls represent at best a tiny fraction of the 10 percent who didn't vote for technical reasons. Pew's numbers suggest there's a lot of work to be done to help the 35 percent of voters who couldn't accommodate a trip to the polling place in their work or school schedules.
Requiring employers to allow flexible scheduling on voting days would be a good step toward fixing the problem. Federal workers already have some guarantee of this .
But even in the absence of legislation, companies could step up and simply encourage their employees to vote, too. Many apparently have no problem telling their staff  who to vote for,  so they could at least offer a little flex time for employees to consider their bosses' endorsements at the ballot box.
Other fixes range from making election day a national holiday  (Vermont's Bernie Sanders has introduced a bill to do just that ) to requiring eligible citizens to vote , as Australia does. In short there are any number of policy approaches to low turnout, ranging from an encouragement to a nudge to a full-on push. Our embarrassingly low turnout numbers suggest it's time to start seriously considering them.

For some parents of autistic children  Jerry Seinfelds self-diagnosis was a slap in the faceBy Peter Holley November 12 Follow @peterjholley
Jerry Seinfeld on the red carpet at the Kennedy Center on Oct. 19. (Kevin Wolf/AP)
When Kim Stagliano saw an " NBC Nightly News " clip of Jerry Seinfeld saying he’s on the autism spectrum, the first thing she did was get angry.
The next thing she did was get on Twitter.

— Kim Rossi Stagliano (@KimStagliano) November 7, 2014
Some might label her reaction a “rage spiral,” but Stagliano, whose three teenage girls have autism, is not about to apologize. Like many parents of autistic children, Stagliano — the managing editor of the Age of Autism , which covers autism news — said she’s grown tired of people, particularly those in the public spotlight, making autistic symptoms sound fashionable.
Adding to the insult, she said, is that the man who aligned himself with the autistic community made his livelihood by humorously dissecting the social nuances of the human condition, a painfully ironic twist for a disorder marked by sufferers' inability to read social cues and communicate effectively.
“My kids’ lives are irrevocably altered by autism and not in a good way,” she told The Post. “Autism is a neurological condition that requires a clinical diagnosis based on serious behaviors and issues and challenges. It’s a medical diagnosis, not a personality or a gift.”
For many parents, she said, that diagnosis, and the medical services it demands, is not easy to come by.
“Jerry, if you think you have autism,” she added, “come over to my house for a night, and we’ll show you what it’s all about.”
To be fair, Seinfeld never actually said: I am autistic.
"I think on a very drawn-out scale, I'm on the spectrum," he told NBC's Brian Williams. "Basic social engagement is really a struggle. I'm very literal. When people talk to me and they use expressions, sometimes I don't know what they're saying."
Seinfeld was referring to Autism Spectrum Disorder , an umbrella term for a condition characterized by "persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction across multiple contexts," according to the National Institute of Mental Health.
The reaction to Seinfeld’s statement within the autism community was as varied and nuanced as the community itself; opinions ranged from reactions of outright rage to support and gratitude.
“Think about what this does for a closeted autistic person who goes into the workplace knowing that their co-workers have just seen somebody they know, respect, and have a positive opinion of, like Jerry Seinfeld, identify in this way — it’s a valuable and important step in building a greater tolerance for autism,” Ari Ne’eman, the president of the Autistic Advocacy Network who is also living with autism, told NBC News in a statement of support.
But there was an equally loud chorus of condemnation from parents and health professionals who argued that by positioning himself as the face of autism — even inadvertently and temporarily — the funnyman diminished the seriousness of their struggle. At stake, they say: public perception, which influences taxpayer dollars to fund research, education and regional health-care services.
“We go to our congressperson to ask for more funding for Social Security benefits,” Stagliano said. “This community is going to be a drain on our social system for decades because they need help. How can we ask for funding through the Department of Disability Services in each state if the perception is that autism is not a disability?"
Some of those who found Seinfeld’s statements offensive were bothered not only by the fact that he made them, but how he went about doing it. Theresa Cianciolo, a behaviorist with the state of Connecticut who specializes in working with twins, triplets and siblings with autism, said the comedian should have avoided a public self-diagnosis. Instead, Cianciolo said, she would have preferred if he had spoken to a mental health professional before associating himself with the autistic spectrum.
“When your child gets an autism diagnosis, it’s devastating,” said Cianciolo, who has a 9-year-old autistic son. “Your life is now over. Your life is your child’s life, and you are forever bound by that diagnosis.”
During her interview with The Post, she noted that as she spoke, her son was sitting on the floor in front of her and licking his hand, a common form of repetitive stimulation among autistic children.
While admitting that she’s never been in a room with Seinfeld and that some high-functioning sufferers are able to train themselves to appear at ease in social settings, Cianciolo said that while watching the NBC interview , she was struck by elements of Seinfeld’s demeanor that seemed at odds with severe autism symptoms.
Among them: consistent eye contact; social awareness and reciprocity; his apparent ability to block out external distractions and focus on the interviewer’s questions; and, she said, his natural charm.
"A lot of college kids who take a psychology 101 class end up saying ‘I can see a part of myself in that,’” Cianciolo said. “But to hear somebody flippantly align themselves with autism and not sound devastated is hard.”
The reason it’s hard for many in the autistic community, according to Rick Ellis, a clinical psychologist specializing in Asperger's syndrome and autism, is because of the strain autism places on many families. He pointed to a 2009 study published in the Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders that found that mothers of autistic children experience a level of chronic stress similar to combat soldiers.
Factoring in health care, school, therapy and family services, other studies, such as this one from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , have placed the economic burden created by childhood autism spectrum disorders at more than $20,000 a year. To be diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, Ellis said, the symptoms must “limit and impair everyday functioning.”
“It is generally a slap in the face to thousands of parents who have to deal with a child who is non-verbal or severely impacted by autism to compare those children to Bill Gates or any other famous individuals, even of those individuals display some of the minor characteristics of a major condition,” Ellis said.
Based on what the public knows, Ellis said, Seinfeld doesn't appear as if he’d be able to qualify with an insurance company as having a clinically significant disorder.
What should Seinfeld have said, in Ellis’s opinion?
“It would have been more appropriate for Seinfeld to acknowledge that he exhibits some of the characteristics but lacks a diagnosis and is not autistic.”
A representative said Seinfeld was unavailable for comment.
John Robison, an autism advocate, best-selling author and current scholar in residence at the College of William and Mary, acknowledged that while many in the autistic community dismiss self-diagnosis, he sees it as the first step in a process of self-discovery for many psychiatric conditions. But it should be followed up, he said, with a visit to a professional before public declarations are made.
"You have mothers of kids that have severe disability who can’t take care of themselves," said Robison, who is autistic. "When Seinfeld becomes the visible face of autism, they feel like their kids are rendered invisible and unimportant. That said, just because he is seemingly financially successful, we don’t know if his private life is a living hell or a dream world. Robin Williams was another famous successful comedian that everyone loved and who supposedly had it all, and yet, he's dead."
In an article she penned for Salon , Marie Myung-Ok Lee, a writer and parent of a child with severe autism, offers an altogether different solution:
“What I am proposing,” she writes, “is separating the high-functioning end of the spectrum — perhaps calling it something else — so that we can focus on the urgent and looming issue at hand.”

Intermission: Sunny daysBy Alyssa Rosenberg November 12 Follow @AlyssaRosenberg
This morning, I wrote about the refreshing resurgence of niceness on television this fall. The process of putting it together made me think about some of my favorite supporting characters in television, including Elsbeth Tascioni (Carrie Preston) on “The Good Wife,” Andy Dwyer (Chris Pratt) on “Parks and Recreation” and Richie Donado (Raúl Castillo) on “Looking,” all of whom are fundamentally fairly sunny people. And it inspires today’s question: Which film or television characters just make you happy when they show up on screen?

• “ The ‘Gotham’ Problem: Who Cares Where Superheroes Come From? ” by David Sims: Writing in the Atlantic, Sims gets at how hard it has been for “Gotham” to jettison its plotlines about young Bruce Wayne, and just how necessary it is for the show to do so.
“Patton Oswalt had a famous stand-up rant about the Star Wars prequels, centered on the line ‘I don’t give a s— where the stuff I love comes from! I just love the stuff I love!’ That line came to mind as I watched little Bruce Wayne get shoved around by bullies at his private school in this week’s episode of the Fox show,” Sims writes. “David Mazouz, the young actor playing Wayne, is actually pretty decent. His character comes off like a relatively normal, too-smart-for-his-own-good kid with a touch of mournful darkness that we know will eventually spread. . . . But still, Bruce Wayne is the best example of one of ‘Gotham’s’ core problems: It’s a prequel to something bigger.”
• “ An Oral History of ‘Weird Al’ Yankovic’s ‘UHF ,’ ” by Will Harris: “Weird Al” Yankovic is firmly established as part of America’s cultural fabric, but Harris interviewed him and his collaborators on one of his flops.
“We were obviously trying to play to my strengths, so we wanted to use a story that would revolve around doing takeoffs and parodies. And we thought that doing something within the format of me running a TV station would allow for a lot of comedy in that vein,” Yankovic tells Harris. “Writing the script was challenging just because it’s a much larger format than the music videos I’d been doing up to that point. It took us several months just to write the thing. This was before laptop computers, so Jay [Levey] would come to my house, and we’d sit around and pull our hair out and get tired from writing it out in longhand on lined notebook paper. I don’t think I had really collaborated before, because I write all my songs by myself, and it was just a different kind of process to write something with somebody.”
• “ How Straight World Stole ‘Gay’: The Last Gasp of the ‘Lumbersexual,’ ” by Tim Teeman:
“First, straights came for the smooth, pretty gay look recustomized as ‘the metrosexual,’ and now you have come for our hairier brethren,” Teeman laments about straight culture’s inability to generate its own images of masculinity. “What else would you like? What else can we give you? You’ve taken it all. All our cutting asides and repartee, design expertise, gym dedication, fitted shirts, food knowledge, high and low culture snarking, gift-buying nous, and our smarts (‘She’s such a drama queen’)—straight culture has gobbled gay culture as ravenously as Cookie Monster atomizes baked dough.”
• Stopping streaming: In a move I am surprised no one has made sooner, the Motion Picture Association of America has launched Where to Watch , which aims to turn into a comprehensive index of where you can watch movies and television shows legally, whether for free or for money.

Texas hospital that treated first U.S. Ebola patient settles with his familyBy Mark Berman November 12 Follow @markberman
A lawyer for the family of Thomas Duncan, the only Ebola patient in the United States to die, says the hospital that treated him will create a foundation in his name. (AP)
The hospital that treated the first Ebola patient diagnosed in the United States before he died will pay his family an unspecified amount, an attorney for his relatives announced Wednesday.
In addition, Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas said it has agreed to create a foundation honoring Thomas Duncan, the Liberian man who was  diagnosed with Ebola  in September.
Texas Health Presbyterian also apologized again to Duncan’s family for the errors made during his treatment. Duncan had first gone to this hospital on Sept. 25 with a fever and told medical workers he had traveled from Africa to the United States. Despite this, he was released and sent home , which delayed his treatment for nearly three days and meant he was around people during a period when he had symptoms and was contagious.

Duncan returned to the hospital and was isolated for two days before being diagnosed with Ebola on Sept. 30. He  died eight days later , becoming the only person to die from the virus so far in the United States. The hospital had also apologized last month for the mistake it made during this period.
“We know that this has been a terribly sad, difficult and trying time for Mr. Duncan’s family and friends, and they will continue to be in the hearts and prayers of the entire Texas Health Presbyterian family,” the hospital said in a statement Wednesday.
Josephus Weeks, Duncan’s nephew, said Wednesday that everyone makes mistakes and thanked the hospital for owning up to their errors.
“I believe that this facility is an outstanding facility,” Weeks said during the same news conference Wednesday, adding that he would trust the hospital enough to seek treatment there if he was ill.
The memorial fund created in Duncan’s honor is intended to provide assistance to Ebola victims in West Africa, the hospital said. The outbreak there  has killed 5,160 people  and continues to infect many more, according to numbers released by the World Health Organization on Wednesday.
The settlement announced Wednesday ends “any claims” that any family member could make regarding Duncan’s treatment, Les Weisbrod, an attorney for Duncan’s relatives, said during a news conference Wednesday morning. He said that the precise amount of the settlement will remain confidential, But he said it would help take care of Duncan’s four children and his parents.
This settlement will not extend to Louis Troh, Duncan’s fiancee , Weisbrod said. 
“The law in the state of Texas and everywhere would require that there be an actual spouse to recover or that it be a child or a parent of a deceased,” Weisbrod said.  “With regard to a malpractice claim, she doesn’t have any legal right.”
Troh is struggling in the wake of Duncan’s diagnosis and her prolonged quarantine, she told the Associated Press . She was unable to find a home and said that the saga “destroyed my whole life.”

Free market advocates say D.C. is the Uber-friendliest city in the nationBy Emily Badger November 12 Follow @emilymbadger
Washington's city council obviously didn't listen to these taxi drivers protesting Uber. Now the city has the friendliest regulations in the country for the service, according to free-market researchers. (Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images)
Cities have responded to new transportation providers like Uber and Lyft in wildly differing ways, with open arms, or cease-and-desist letters, preemptive bans or legal blessings. If you're someone who travels a lot (or a lobbyist charged with navigating all these places), it's a little hard to keep track of who's in favor of these companies and who's not.
So here is a scorecard , courtesy of the free-market think tank R Street, which has graded the 50 largest cities in the country on how how friendly and open their transportation markets are to newcomers like Uber and Lyft, as well as their traditional competitors, taxis and limos.
By R Street's counting, Washington, D.C., has the freest transportation market in the country. The city just passed regulation legalizing "transportation network companies" that allow people with their private cars to operate like quasi-cab drivers. And Washington has long been a wide-open market for traditional cabs, too. The city doesn't cap the number of cabs that can serve the city, nor does it require drivers to purchase pricey medallions to operate them. For these reasons, Washington gets an A from R Street — for both its friendliness to Uber and its entire relatively open transportation market.
Scroll down in the box below for the rest of the grades (they're shaded by letter, A to F).
Ranking regulatory environments by how open they are to competition is a subjective exercise. One person's over-regulation is another person's consumer protection. So take these grades as what they are: an assessment by folks who think that cities should let the free market do more to provide you transportation.
That said, here's how R Street calculated the scores: It looked at how cities regulate each ground transportation sector in turn, from TNCs to taxis to limos, and then bundled those results into one weighted score. Bonus points went to cities that have passed regulation explicitly allowing companies like Uber to operate (19 of the 50 have). Big deductions went to the places that have issued cease-and-desist letters instead (13 of 50). Cities were also dinged for restricting where and how TNCs can operate, by banning them from airports, for example.
With traditional taxis, cities were penalized for limiting the supply of cabs that can operate in a city, and for charging steep licensing fees for them, as New York does. All 50 cities have some kind of elaborate rules that R Street says "effectively eliminate price competition, suppress supply and degrade service levels." By which they mean just about every city regulates the prices cabs can charge, and the condition of the vehicles themselves.
Washington got an A for being a friendly market to both cabs and Uber cars — just about anyone in the District can apply to operate a cab, or can now drive their own car like one. Chicago got a C because, while it legalized TNCs this summer, its taxi market is strictly regulated and tightly capped. The city that's the worst of both worlds, in R Street's view: Las Vegas, where it's hard to break into the taxi market, and where Uber, under just the last few weeks , had been conspicuously absent .

Why Obama called out the FCC in publicBy Nancy Scola November 12 Follow @nancyscola
President Obama speaks at the APEC CEO Summit in Beijing on Nov. 10. (Wang Zhao/Pool via Reuters)
In his call for the Federal Communications Commission to embrace strong oversight of Internet service providers,  President Obama stressed that the FCC is an independent agency. "I can't just call him up and tell him exactly what to do," Obama previously said of FCC chairman Tom Wheeler. Wheeler agrees. He thanked Obama for weighing in on the net neutrality issue, but also stressed in meetings with tech advocates , "I am an independent agency."
That emphasis on the FCC's independence has surprised and even angered   some  who have closely tracked the net neutrality debate. But there is a good reason for it -- several reasons, actually. And they have everything to do with administrative law, lawsuits and Richard Nixon.
Under administrative law, the FCC is an independent agency, not an executive one -- think of Justice, of Labor, of Health and Human Services, etc.  (A rule of thumb: Most agencies headed by more than one person -- like the five-commissioners of the FCC -- tend to be independent agencies.) The FCC gets its authority from Congress, under the 1934 Communications Act. How much control the president should have over independent agencies has been debated for a long time , but the working principle is that independent agencies operate outside the command of the president.
And given that any far-reaching net neutrality rules will almost inevitably end up in court, the 10-foot-pole distance between the White House and the FCC gives the latter a bit of cover. "One of the challenges it might face is that they did it because they were politically pressured," explains Jonathan R. Siegel, a professor at the George Washington University law school and an expert in administrative law. "As an independent agency, it can't say, 'We did it because the president told us to do it.' They have to say, 'We did it because it's the right thing to do.'"
That's especially more fraught when it comes to the FCC, the country's top telecommunications regulator. That's where Richard Nixon comes in. In the early 1970s, Nixon was thought by some, including then-Washington Post publisher Katharine Graham , to be looking to punish The Post for its Watergate coverage by going after the licenses of two Florida radio stations that the newspaper had purchased.
The Nixon tapes later picked up an exchange between Nixon and White House counsel John Dean and chief of staff H.R. Haldeman in which the president said, "the main thing is that the Post is going to have damnable, damnable problems out of this one. They have a television station...and they're going to have to get it renewed." Told by Dean that the challenges to the renewal process at the FCC had grown more "active," Nixon said, "It's going to be goddamn active here," adding, "Well, the game has to be played awfully rough."
It's never been proven that Nixon influenced the FCC's actions, but the episode has created a wariness in the White House and the commission to even appearing to be in close collaboration. So trying to influence the FCC from behind closed doors? "That's the no-no," says Reed Hundt, chairman of the FCC under the Clinton administration. The best course of action for both the president and the commission is to have their discussions happen as in full public view as possible, he said.
Which is likely one reason Obama made, and widely circulated, a video explaining his new stand on matters under the FCC's watch . If only Richard Nixon had had YouTube.

How this Congress can avoid being the least productive everBy Philip Bump November 12 Follow @pbump
The 113th Congress — this Congress, that is currently back on Capitol Hill for a few days before graduation — has been the least productive in terms of bills passed since at least 1973. That's as far back as GovTrack.us goes, and it's as good a metric as any. This has been the least productive Congress in 40 years, because it has enacted 185 laws — 99 fewer than the 112th Congress, which was reviled as the least productive in history two years ago.
The Fightin' 113th can turn it around. It just (as of 2 p.m. Wednesday) went back into session; the House has scheduled 15 days before the end of the year in which to get things done in a lame-duck session. That means that Congress needs to pass 100 bills over two weeks to not break this ignominious and largely made-up record. That's just shy of seven bills a day.
A look at lame duck sessions over the course of those 40 years indicates that such activity is ... unlikely. The most laws that went into effect between Election Day and the end of a Congress was 58, in the 111th Congress.
What's interesting to note is that most of those bills started their lives in Congress well in advance of the lame duck session. Many of them became law not through action from Congress, but because presidents finally got around to signing off on them. Which offers some hope! Except that, according to GovTrack, there are no passed bills waiting for a presidential signature.
The most bills both introduced and passed in a lame duck is 14, again during the 111th Congress that ended four years ago. Of course, the House could pass one of the 85 bills that have already passed the Senate or the Senate could pass one of the 383 bills that have already passed the House. (That data point has become somewhat contentious .) So there are as many as 468 bills that could be quickly sent over to the president.
Which won't happen. Those bills have all almost certainly been considered for votes at some point in the past — in the sense of thought about briefly and then rejected. The Senate that passed its bills is Democratic (for now) and the House that passed its bills is Republican ( forever ). That's a key reason why the 113th hasn't gotten anything done — and with a brand-new Congress with Republicans in total charge looming, why it almost certainly won't.

Republicans can win over HispanicsBy Jennifer Rubin November 12 Follow @JRubinBlogger
A segment of the anti-immigration right clings to the notion that citizenship should not be extended to those who came here illegally, in part because they are automatic Democratic voters. We’ve argued that such fatalism is unwarranted and goes hand in hand with a refusal to update the GOP agenda. The 2014 election bears that out to a degree.

In the national vote for the House, Republicans got  36 percent  of the Hispanic vote, up from the  27 percent Mitt Romney  got in 2012. Republicans did even better among Hispanic male voters (41 percent). In the midterms, the Hispanic vote (8 percent of the electorate) was about what it was in 2012 (10 percent). Moreover, like every other group, Hispanics rank the economy as most important and put immigration much further down the list.  Pew observes , “About half (49%) of Latino voters called [the economy] the most important issue facing the country, according to the national exit poll. Health care (24%) and illegal immigration (16%) followed.”
In some individual races, the GOP did even better. Texas Gov.-elect Greg Abbott got 44 percent of the Hispanic vote while Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) took 48 percent. Likewise, Florida Gov. Rick Scott (38 percent) and Georgia Sen.-elect David Perdue (42 percent) did better than the party as a whole. (The breakdown for Hispanic voters is not available in the exit polls in many races, either because they were not thought to be competitive or because there are too few Hispanics to sample accurately.)
In sum, when Republicans don’t antagonize voters with talk about “self-deportation,” strong GOP candidates can get a substantial chunk of the Hispanic vote. There is no reason for GOP defeatism, then. There is, however, room to grow.
Resolving immigration is one way to boost appeal, but so is recruiting more diverse candidates. In reelection bids Republican Govs. Susana Martinez (N.M.) and Brian Sandoval (Nev.) got 57 percent and more than 70 percent, respectively, from their states’ voters. West Virginia elected its first congressman of Hispanic origin,  Alex Mooney .
But eligible Hispanic voters are also on average  younger  than whites, and fewer have bachelor’s degrees (17% vs. 33% for whites). It therefore stands to reason that to the extent Republicans can capture millennials’ discontent with Democrats and devise an agenda based on upward mobility and education reform, they will improve their standing with Hispanics.
The GOP’s ceiling with Hispanic voters may be higher than thought after Romney’s debacle. So, yes, by all means — Republicans should show up. But when they arrive in Hispanic communities and when they talk to Hispanic voters, they better have a positive message that is something other than simply cut government, reduce taxes and deport illegals. That message gets you only 27 percent of the Hispanic electorate.

Griffin encouraged by signs of unityBy Mike Jones November 12 Follow @mikejoneswapo

When DeSean Jackson addressed his team following their loss to the Minnesota Vikings and expressed confidence in Robert Griffin III and reminded his teammates of the importance of unity and accountability, Griffin didn’t take the gesture lightly.
Some of the other veterans on the team – safety Ryan Clark and defensive linemen Barry Cofield, Stephen Bowen and Jason Hatcher – echoed Jackson’s sentiments, which also proved touching to the quarterback.
“I take it to heart,” Griffin said on Wednesday, speaking for the first time since Jackson and Clark on Sunday revealed details of the meeting.
The quarterback said he doesn’t necessarily need to be liked by all of his teammates. (He retorted, “Do you like everybody you work with?”) But he took the statements, and the responses from other members of the locker room, as signs that this Redskins team is coming together as one.
“I mean, that’s what teammates do,” Griffin said. “That’s what a family is. I think we’re getting closer as a family on this team, and what DeSean said, like we said before, is just addressing the few. But we don’t know who those guys are, and it doesn’t matter. Everybody’s in line. Everybody’s focused on one goal – winning football games, looking in the mirror and saying, ‘What can I do to help this team win, and what can I do better? What can I cut out of my game? What plays do I need to make?’ Everybody’s going to be that guy, and that’s a good thing to have.”
Griffin finds his team 3-6 for a third consecutive year. In 2012, he led the team on a 7-0 run, and Washington won the division and reached the playoffs. In 2013, the Redskins went 0-7 to finish the season, as Griffin got benched with three games left.
Griffin said that the Redskins have aspirations of ripping off another dramatic turnaround, but to do so, they can’t dwell on past successes, or look too far ahead.
“Every year is a new year. Obviously, we want to do what we did in 2012,” he said. “But we can’t look at the big picture right now. We’ve got to take care of everything we can do every day to get better. It starts with Tampa. They’re not going to come in here and lay down and just let us win a game. We’ve got to take it from them, and that’s what we’re focused on.”
Unity tops the list of ingredients needed for such a comeback, Griffin said, and he believes the Redskins have that.
“I know it’s been pushed and pushed and pushed and everyone thinks [the rumors of division are] from the inside out, but we’re strong in that locker room,” the quarterback said. “We feel like we can’t let any of these reports or anything divide us. Right now, we have to be responsible for what we do. Right now, we’re 3-6, and I think everybody in this room knows it. We have a hunger to win.”

I had seen a post by one of the boarders who had written that he had been ruined as he had bought 2000 Titan after which its price has fallen down very steeply & he did not know what to do now.
I was really saddened at his lose BUT simultaneously been dismayed at few posts suggesting him that its price would reach/pass 400-450 levels within few days.
Would request such advisers that most of the boarders here appear very less educated/experienced in markets & its behaviour & like any normal person want to get rich soon/fast i.e within  a few sessions/days. ALWAYS Remember that your wrong or casual advice may bring unfathomable sorry to the entire family of such ill-advised boarder.

Christie s $100 billion auction
Wilson possible for Saturday; Laich a little more unclearBy Alex Prewitt November 12 Follow @alex_prewitt
(Photo by Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images)
Their winning streak extended to three games, the Washington Capitals returned to practice without Tom Wilson and Brooks Laich , who skated earlier Wednesday morning as their rehabilitation continues from recent injuries.
“We were going to play it day-by-day,” Trotz said. “It was just going to be a decision on how they felt this morning and we had the ice available for them. I knew one of them would probably skate. I wasn’t sure if both of them would. I’d probably say we’re looking more like, obviously the weekend, probably more like Saturday than Friday right now based on where we were today.”
Wilson, who suffered a lower-body injury last weekend against Carolina and left early into the second period, as “got a shot for Saturday” when the Capitals begin a six-day, three-game road swing in St. Louis.
Laich, on the other hand, “is probably a little more unclear.” The shoulder injury incurred Oct. 18 against Florida has not yet disappeared, instead getting re-aggravated last Friday in Chicago, Laich’s first game back.
“Actually on Brooks, I held him back a little while,” Trotz said. “He was concerned, he wanted to play. He says I can go, I want to go. I pulled back on him, because a couple things he said were red flags for me, knowing he didn’t have the strength, quite didn’t have the confidence.”
Laich intimated as much during his weekly appearance with The Sports Junkies on 106.7 The Fan earlier that morning, telling the crew his “frustration level is probably at an all-time high.” Laich said he underwent an MRI Tuesday which revealed “some good news” and added the Capitals had “something planned for today” as far as additional treatment but declined to go into details.
Laich’s injury happened on a routine collision with Panthers forward Shawn Thornton near the Capitals bench. Upon contact, Laich spun around, grabbed his shoulder and immediately exited into the tunnel. He told The Junkies the pain returned after Washington ended its five-game winless streak by beating the Blackhawks at United Center.
“I played the game because it was a game we had to win,” Laich said. “Maybe it was a bit premature to return but I had to play in that game. By the time I left the arena I couldn’t touch my left hand to my face, so obviously it was a bit sore. Since then we’ve been trying to get it to calm down, back to being functional.”
Lower-body conditioning hasn’t been an issue for Laich, who continued to work out with trainer Mark Nemish. But so long as pain lingers in his left shoulder, the Capitals don’t want to rush him back.
“It hurts right around the collarbone area, there’s just very limited mobility, very limited strength,” Laich said.
Added Trotz: “There’s a difference between being hurt and being injured. Hurt you can play through it. Injured that’s a little more questionable. Just through experience, you’ve got to trust the trainers who have done this a long time and know the players probably better than the coaches. Between those three factors, I think you probably evaluate the player, the trainer, then your own instincts, then you make that decision.”

Couple quit Carson s  but credit card issue lingers1
"Since early September I have had abdominal surgery and I am home recuperating," Eleanor Sears said. "These calls continue daily, including Sunday. I don't know what else to do. The charges are not mine and no one seems willing to help without our Social Security numbers."
Frederick Sears said he just wanted the calls to stop.
"I talked to one of them," he said of the callers. "She said 'This is going to affect your credit.' I said, 'Hey, I'm 82 years old. I don't give a damn about my credit.' They still bill us every month and we ignore it. It's a pain in the backside."
The Problem Solver called Kim George, a spokeswoman for Bon-Ton Stores. On Wednesday, George emailed to say the calls should soon stop.
"Mr. Sears has been issued a full credit as of yesterday for the charge on the account," George wrote. "Our credit card provider has removed the late fees and finance charges from Mr. Sears' account. These credits will reduce the account balance to zero and should end the collection calls within 24 hours."
In addition, George said, Comenity sent a letter to Sears asking that he contact the credit card provider to close the account. George said the account must remain open "until either written correspondence or a phone call from Mr. Sears is received."
Frederick Sears said his wife sent Comenity a letter four years ago asking to cancel the account.
"She sent them several letters," he said. "But we'll send them another one. What do we care?"
He said he's happy the calls will stop, but he joked that the resolution will have an adverse effect on the economy.
"It gave these people work," Frederick Sears said. "They could call us (several) times a day and they got paid."

As English cricket returns to a state of relative calm following the fall-out from Kevin Pietersen's autobiography, the three-time losing finalists (1979, 1987 and 1992), can concentrate on their World Cup preparations. Unusually, England won't play any Test cricket between now and the World Cup, instead taking part in a one-day tour of Sri Lanka and a tri-series staged by Australia in a bid to give themselves the best possible chance of winning the tournament for the first time.
But given a lack of proven hard-hitting ODI batsmen -- England are pinning a lot of hope on Alex Hales and Jos Buttler -- as well as bowlers who can run through, rather than, at best, contain, an opposition top-order, it would be a major surprise if Alastair Cook's men made it all the way to the final, let alone won the tournament. However, their fans won't mind too much if they regain the Ashes next year. less

President Mahinda Rajapaksa is ready to pardon the five Indian fishermen sentenced to death in Sri Lanka if the Indian High Commission in Colombo does not proceed with an appeal against the sentence, Sri Lankan Minister Prabha Ganesan told The Hindu on Tuesday.
“The President said he could pardon and release the fishermen in two or three days, but a court appeal would drag the case up to six months,” Mr. Ganesan, who met the President to pledge support in the upcoming elections, said.
Mr. Rajapaksa, the MP said, wanted him to convey this decision to the High Commission. When contacted, officials at the High Commission confirmed having received the call from Mr. Ganesan, Deputy Minister of Telecommunication and Information Technology. The officials said they would decide the next step on Wednesday.
The sudden development came on a day when an appeal was filed against the death sentence in the Colombo High Court.
Mr. Ganesan said President Rajapaksa had told him he had already discussed the pardon with Mr. Modi and that the High Commission was “unnecessarily spending huge sums of money on the appeal.”

Fadnavis-led BJP wins trust vote in MaharashtraChief Minister Fadnavis to seek vote of confidence in Maharashtra Assembly
By ANI | ANI –  Wed 12 Nov, 2014

Mumbai, Nov. 12 (ANI): Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis will today be seeking vote of confidence during the three-day special session of the state assembly, which began on Monday.
State Governor C. Vidyasagar Rao has already administered the oath of office to Jeeva Pandu Gavit as pro-tem Speaker of the state assembly at the Raj Bhavan here.
On the very first day, the Shiv Sena had given clear indications of its aggressive political stance with its newly elected MLAs criticizing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Minister Eknath Khadse outside the Vidhan Bhavan for his decision to permit the use of the Urdu language in Marathi-centric schools.
This session is considered to be crucial for Fadnavis, as the current picture about support being extended to his government from outside is still not clear.
One time BJP ally Shiv Sena is changing its stance from time to time.
Minister of State (MoS) for Parliamentary Affairs Rajiv Pratap Rudy had yesterday, said there is no rift between both parties, and added that the BJP would accept the support of anyone who is in favour of the development of Maharashtra.
According to reports, intense alliance-linked negotiations are still on between the BJP and the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra.
Earlier on Sunday, the Shiv Sena had abstained from attending the expansion of the Union Cabinet in New Delhi. The Shiv Sena had also asked its nominee Anil Desai to return to Mumbai from the national capital.
The BJP and Shiv Sena snapped their 25-year alliance in September ahead of the Maharashtra Assembly polls over a seat-sharing disagreement.
At the moment, the BJP is 22 short of the halfway mark in the Maharashtra Assembly.
Following the polls, the BJP had emerged as the single largest party with 122 seats in the 288-member Maharashtra Assembly.
The Shiv Sena finished second with 63 seats. The NCP, which emerged victorious in 41 seats, has offered the BJP 'external support' to form the government in the state. (ANI)

AAP launches Delhi Dialogue

politics
The Aam Aadmi Party on Wednesday launched 'Delhi Dialogue', an initiative under which the party would encourage people’s collaboration in policy making and preparing the blueprint for making Delhi a world class city.
Launched at a time when assembly elections are just round the corner, the initiative would challenge the conventional practice of releasing manifestos days before polling dates, which, according to party leaders, was to evade discussions on feasibility and scrutiny on delivery.
Instead of telling people what the party can do for them, the AAP volunteers will hold discussions with all kinds of people to understand their needs and aspirations. And the points raised during these discussions will reflect in the party’s manifesto.
“We will hold dialogues with professionals, housewife, students, youth, women, villagers, industrialists, besides residents JJ cluster and unauthorised colonies. We will then prepare a 50-point programme, prepare a blue-print and address these issues. We want the people to tell us how they want their Delhi to be,” former Delhi Chief Minister and party's national convenor Arvind Kejriwal told reporters at Constitution Club here.
Party leader Ashish Khetan said an honest government is the one which lets people have a say in governance, something Congress and BJP, the two parties who have ruled Delhi in the past, have failed to do.
“An accountable and responsive government seeks participation from the people tapping into their immense potential. Delhi is a city where we have a vast pool of those who have expertise in various fields as well as domain knowledge. We want to utilise their skills in government planning to bring the government and the governed there,” he said.
As a part of the initiative the party will hold a rally of the youth in the national Capital on Saturday and address their issues. A similar rally will be held on November 26, party's foundation day, where issues related to women's safety would be addressed. Water, power, health and education are some of the key sector party plans to work on.
Mr. Khetan also said that there will be a sync between discussion and delivery. “If the party forms the government, we will ensure that qwe fix deadlines for each and every project,” said the journalist-turned-politician.
The core team handling Delhi Dialogues comprise Mr. Khetan as well as Adarsh Shastri, who quit his high profile job to contest Lok Sabha ticket and banker-turned politician Meera Sanyal and Preeti Sharma Menon.

Is It Worth a Drive Four Questions to Ask When Deciding on a New Message Vehiclereddit
Let's face it, we are in a world where there is literally a new technology for communication around the corner. From BlogTalk Radio to Google Talk Shows and beyond, there seems to be a new media "Flavor of the Week" to use in order to communicate your expertise and your service.
As a marketing media coach, I sometimes have to literally pull my clients and prospects off of the "Next Big Thing" in new media communication and push them towards a small amount of vehicles I know will profit them and their own prospects and clients better than what I l call the newest Bright and Shiny Object. In this world, we do have more opportunities to communicate but what we don't have more of ( time and energy) shows that a new media vehicle can be more a pain than a pleasure.
When deciding whether the new media agenda is right for your business, ask yourself the following:
Who Are the Current Top Stars of It?
When examining a new media resource as to whether you should use it, look towards who is currently successfully using it.  Not just using it but seeing results in it.  Researching who is currently profiting from the resource as well as who their audience is shows a great deal about whether it is worth your time.  Take a deep look at the current success of the product as well as who is currently using it...they may not be your audience.
Does Your Niche Have Time To Hear From You Through it?
Remember: The only gain you should get from a new communication vehicle is the right people listening on the other end.  A great example: busy moms probably are not fans of the live Google Talk Show but would be interested in a podcast as they can download it on their IPhone and listen to it on their own time.   So before you invest in this new technology, ask yourself: Will the person I am trying to reach be on the other end of that conversation?
Why are You Looking at this New Technology?
Aside from being part of the Shiny Object Syndrome, most of the time people looking at new technologies for their business are blocking issues they have within their current marketing agendas.  Before signing on to the new vehicle, ask yourself why do you believe your business requires it to survive.   A recent prospect of mine was beyond overwhelmed because she was using all the new technology she could get her hands on.  After measuring the results together, we found that 3 out of the over 6 technologies, websites and other media opportunities she was using were the only ones giving her any return on financial and time investment. Her real reason why she signed up for so many was fear of not being heard by anyone, let alone the right prospect.
The moral of this story can be summed up in a very well-known sales phrase: Buyer Beware.  While it is new and possibly a good communication vehicle for business success..make sure it will create the success you desire and not just become another item on the Marketing To-Do List. Always measure the success against the cost (both fiscal and time-wise) and make sure it is the right investment for you.

Drunk UP cop forces dancer to perform at gunpointPrint
NEW DELHI: A police constable allegedly forced a dancer to continuously perform at gunpoint for an hour and showered currency notes worth Rs 30,000 on her at a function in Uttar Pradesh’s Shahjahanpur town.
On Monday night, the cop, identified as Shailendra Shukla, suddenly barged into the cultural function, climbed the stage, loaded his revolver in full public view and put it to the head of the dancer.
The horror played out on stage as the constable picked up his loaded firearm whenever the dancer showed signs of stopping due to exhaustion.
Shukla was also carrying Rs 100 and Rs 500 currency notes which he continuously rained on her, eyewitnesses said, adding that the constable was drunk and threatened both the dancer and audience at the venue.
“The dancer was so terrified that she initially lost her balance on the stage. But fearing for life, she somehow regained her composure and followed his order,” an eyewitness said.
Superintendent of Police, Shahjahanpur, Ramesh Chandra Sahu suspended Shukla on Tuesday evening and ordered an inquiry against the constable.
“We have suspended him with immediate effect and ordered a departmental inquiry against him. He will be attached with the police line till the inquiry is on,” the SP said.
He added that the probe will look into all the aspects of the episode.

Burmas Rohingya camps are closed to the outside world. Heres what they look like.By Annie Gowen November 12 Follow @anniegowen
Once, Burma's majority Buddhists and minority Rohingya Muslims lived peacefully. Today, many Rohingya have been closed off in refugee camps for more than two years after a wave of religious violence swept the country, ­leaving thousands displaced.
President Obama traveled to Burma on Wednesday to begin a visit expected to include talks with rights activists, including Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi. But Obama also has faced criticism from some groups for not pressing Burmese leaders harder on issues such as the persecution of the Rohingya.
Read the full story: New concerns over Burma’s treatment of the Rohingya
More than 3,000 Muslims now live in the Myebon camp. Government health workers come five days a week, but there is no emergency service. Most of the inhabitants subsist on rations from the World Food Program. They are low on firewood because they have cut down all the trees. They have had no soap or sanitation supplies for months.
Here is what this camp, cut off from the outside world, looks like from the inside.
Rohingya children at the camp. About 135,000 Rohingya in the western state of Rakhine are still being held — ostensibly for their own safety — as virtual prisoners in camps with scarce food, water and health care.
Young Rohingya girls are taught needlework.
There are few trees left in the camp because wood is needed for fuel.
Those in the camp made a makeshift mosque.
Burma naturalized citizenship card -- what many Rohingya Muslims hope to get. To be accepted, they must provide extensive documentation and renounce the term Rohingya — embraced by an estimated 1 million people — and allow themselves to be listed as another ethnicity. If they refuse, they could be placed in detention camps and shipped to another country, according to an early draft of the plan.
Rohingyas find water to bring back to the camp.

Manage Conflict Well or It Will Manage Youreddit
Most executives acknowledge difficulty in dealing with conflict. Conflict comes in many guises. It can be person to person or group to group. It can be an in-house clash with direct reports and attendant personnel. Sometimes conflict occurs with external vendors, contractors, and consultants. It's not uncommon for conflict to worm its way into otherwise tight-knit leadership teams or fracture the relationship between community partners and leaders.
Conflict is omnipresent at union bargaining tables, in legal arenas, and is first-row center seat when bureaucrats and businessmen step into the ring. Depending on the size of the organization, conflict can morph into a mighty conflagration with the help of local and international media. Bottom line: any time people work together you have tinder stacked and ready for conflict.
Conflict is inevitable but its outcome depends on how it is managed. So how or when should executives deal with conflict? Sometimes the best decision is not to react and let time-bequeathed amnesia do the job. Sometimes, however, delaying a response can make the conflict worse. Conflict management isn't ever comfortable and is all too-often avoided to the peril of the leader and the business.
Conflict is like a dance when partners step on each other's toes while trying to figure out who's leading or even what dance step to employ. Oftentimes the dancers go back to their respective seats limping and eager to commiserate with other dancers on the maladroitness of their clumsy oaf partner and swearing never to dance with them again. Often, other injured dancers chime in and what was an interpersonal problem becomes class warfare and the embattled leader has to put business goals on the back burners and do foot rubs to keep the conflict under control.
Conflict handled timely and effectively is carried out more like a conversation than a confrontation. And while the conversation may not be easy, doing so timely and consistently and effectively results in better outcomes. It is less likely the other party will feel affronted or surprised if a repeat conversation is needed.
Here are seven ideas and scenarios that may help as you determine a course of action or your intervention:
Make it a habit to keep the issues and conflicts between the parties and practice the art of not talking with others about something that doesn't involve them. As simple as this sounds venting to others typically makes matters worse and often word can get back to the person(s) being talked about. Gossip needs to stop if conflict is to be handled well.
Learning the lesson that anything one says or does can be held against them in a court of law or can show up on the news helps in managing conflict. Be discreet in how and when you speak or send a message that is conflictual.
Stay defenseless. When managing conflict, emotions run high. Staying defenseless and taking an approach to understand versus accuse can reduce emotions which helps to create an environment favorable for conflict resolution.
With customers, own mistakes and mishaps that are the company's to own. Don't try to defend the company; listen and own what you can. If multiple customers, families and friends are impacted, such as in an airplane crash, you may need a strong media plan to deal with communication to interested parties. The larger the conflict or the greater the consequence of it, the more public it becomes.
In the case of union conflict, clear and transparent communication about organizational change and activities is critical to keep union unrest at a minimum. Delaying communication tends to send the message you don't want to communicate or have something to hide. Another tactic that is effective is to keep union representatives informed in advance of a change and activity and if possible obtain union input into the process.
If there are performance issues with a direct report, a vendor, or a contractor, deal with the issues timely or you risk the possibility of escalation into a real conflict. It is easier to ignore an issue or conflict than to deal with it. But when it comes to performance, the issues don't tend to resolve without the performance being discussed. Instead, the issues continue and non-performers remain oblivious to the problem. Procrastinated conflict-resolution can unleash violent reprisals that are out of proportion for the current issue and the employee, vendor, or contractor will be caught off guard.
As the CEO, getting involved in employee conflict should be a last resort unless the conflict has gone through due process and it is now in your hands to hear the concerns and determine appropriate actions. While an employee's anxiety may be dissipated because s/he has been heard by the "top dog", care must be taken in how the CEO resolves the situation to avoid throwing a direct report " under the bus " by taking or being perceived as taking sides.
Make it a habit to embrace rather than avoid conflict. If you deal with anything conflictual early into the process, the results are typically more favorable than letting an issue or conflict fester.

NYC Comptroller s New Program To Let Shareholders Have More Say On Who Serves On Corporate Boardsreddit
On Election Day in America, voters get to choose between at least two candidates and majority vote determines who will serve to represent the constituents.  But in Corporate America, elections don't work that way.  Instead, board members are nominated by insiders, they run unopposed, and management counts the votes.  Incredibly, management-selected directors keep their jobs even if a majority of the shareholders refuse to vote in favor of their election.
Reforms inspired by the Enron-era accounting disasters and the Wall Street failures that led to the financial meltdown put a lot of emphasis on "independent" directors.  But how "independent" can directors be if the insiders not only determine who serves on the board and how long they serve, but also how much they get paid and what information they receive?
Furthermore, while Dodd-Frank included a provision for "proxy access," giving significant shareholders the right to submit nominees for the board and have their candidates included on the ballot circulated to all shareholders by the company, the implementing of that provision has been blocked by a group of corporate executives dead set against reform.
Shareholders--from institutional investors, like public pension funds, to individuals saving for retirement--recognize that cozy, insular boardrooms present a significant investment risk.  That's what makes the Boardroom Accountability Project--an initiative of New York City Comptroller Scott M. Stringer and the City's pension funds--so important. The Project, which launched last week, includes 75 shareholder proposals calling on portfolio companies to give shareowners the right to nominate directors at U.S. companies using the corporate ballot.
Stringer's breakthrough here is making it clear that no matter what their concerns are as investors on behalf of New York City employees, it all comes back to who is on the board and is making sure that those board members understand that their duty is to shareholders, not CEOs.
Of the resolutions filed, with some overlap included, 33 were at carbon-intensive coal, oil and gas, and utility companies, 24 at companies with little to no diversity on their boards, and 25 at companies that received significant opposition by shareholders to excessive executive compensation put to an advisory shareholder vote in 2013.
Corporate directors operate under the broad protection of the "business judgment rule," which provides that, because they are "elected" by the shareholders, courts will defer to their judgment on business decisions, even if subsequent events show that they were wrong. However, if executives continue to allow directors to serve when a majority of the shareholders have refused to vote for them, or if they fight shareholders who want to make the process for nominating board candidates less insular, this will change.
This is a critical step forward, but it is also a measured, even modest one.  In this most tilted of playing fields, executives can ignore even a 100 percent vote in favor of shareholder proposals like these.  Even if the proposals are implemented, shareholders do not anticipate nominating candidates for more than a fraction of a percent of board seats.  They would only exercise that option for the most ineffective boards, those with the most outrageous disparities between pay and performance, the worst sustainability failures, or the least transparent and reliable financial reports.  And exercising the option would not guarantee that their candidates would be elected.  They would still need to get the support of over half the shareholders, reducing any risk that a small shareholder could seize control of the board for short-term gain.
The real purpose of these proposals is to send a message to corporate insiders that shareholders want to see a more robust and transparent process for selecting director candidates.  If the targeted companies are smart, their CEOs will meet with Stringer to discuss ways to achieve that goal.  If they are not, they can expect to see a rise in opposition to the candidates they nominate, and even the possibility of a proxy contest.  One way or another, shareholders will make sure that boards do a better job of protecting the companies they own.

Oops to Eureka! Turning the Unexpected into an Advantagereddit
Most people believe the improvisational skill is something you are either born with or not. But guess what? You do improvise. When your boss calls you into her office and asks you to work on a project you know nothing about, that sounds completely scary, and you say, "Sure, I'd be happy to work on that," -- you're improvising.
One aspect of improvisation that is so helpful to leaders is the ability to deal with the unexpected -- with mistakes -- with surprises. The unexpected is an improviser's stock in trade! We never know what will happen from moment to moment, and we're making it up as we go along. I'm sure that sounds like a lot of your days at work! That flexibility and the sense that anything can happen, keeps us on our toes and ready for anything. It's a critical skill in an ever-evolving, global professional world.
"The model for management that we have is the opera. The conductor has a very large number of different groups that he has to pull together. The soloists, the ballet, the orchestra, all have to come together - but they have a common score. What we are talking about today are diversified groups that have to write the score while they perform. What you need now is a good jazz group." - Peter Drucker
Three steps to dealing with the unexpected:
First, you've got to see it and say it. When the unexpected occurs, many try to sweep it under the rug. Act like nothing went wrong and perhaps no one will notice. All that does is breed an elephant in the room. It's the big, uncomfortable thing that everyone really does know about, but that no one will talk about. In improv, we have to acknowledge everything on stage. What that does is takes the power away from the event and gives it back to the people. By acknowledging an event, even if it's ugly, you regain control.
Next, it's time to flip it. It's often a mental moment. You train your brain to see something as an opportunity rather than a problem. Going to Plan B is not always our preference. Having the discipline to say to your team, "The unexpected has happened. We feel pretty unhappy right now, and that's understandable. Let's take some time to consider how we can flip this. How can this be an opportunity for us?" Penicillin and Post-Its both began as huge failures. It was the ability of scientists to look beyond the "mistake" to see that something great was underneath.
Finally, you must use it. On the improv stage, if a troupe has a train wreck (the common term for a scene going completely wrong) we had to use it. By moving on or ignoring it, we lose the audience. When we're able to use the incident for a better scene, a new character, a plot twist -- the audience is wowed and the show is a success.
Case study
The CFO of a mid-size advertising firm made a million-dollar mistake. The day it happened, she visited me, almost physically ill. She knew she'd have to fire people, beg vendors for extra pay time, and make it right for the client. It might ultimately mean her own job as well. She said, "In the 15 years I've worked at this firm, I've never made such a mistake." I let her have a moment of silence and answered, "And the way you deal with it will define your next 15 years at the firm."
We spent some time talking about all the things she had always wanted to improve, change, turn around at the firm. Why couldn't this stressful event be the catalyst for re-examining all their processes? She began to nod, dug in, and put together a plan for the CEO the next day. It was bold, not only managing the event at hand, but addressing several other looming issues for the firm. Her example helped them leverage a very difficult third quarter into a record-breaking fourth quarter.
Oops to Eureka!
By coming to an issue with an improviser's mindset, a scientist's mindset, you can transform how you and your team manage the unexpected and reap the benefits.

7 Steps to a Fulfilling CareerOriginally published in the Thought Catalog
In the course of my work as a career coach to millennials, I've noticed that everyone has a wildly different definition for success. However, I've found that there's a certain science to having a more fulfilling career. The game-changing moments are rarely the result of harder work and longer hours; they're the product of pushing the boundaries of your comfort zone and defying the fear-based voices that tell you there's only one path to success.  Here are some lessons that -- if implemented -- will undoubtedly change the course of your career and life:
1. Don't stay in limbo. We've all had periods of uncertainty about what we want to do with our lives. However, the choice to stay in limbo lends itself to one of the most powerless states of being. While it's healthy to give your choices some consideration, prolonged indecision is toxic... Why? Because clarity comes from engagement, not thought. As a coach, I support my clients in being powerful; this means making a commitment, showing up and seeing what feedback the universe gives you... It's okay to course-correct along the way; it's never too early or too late to switch gears.
2. Start before you're ready. Perfection paralysis is something I see in my office on a weekly basis. As my clients begin to envision what they want to accomplish, they often get hung up on perceived challenges and roadblocks that make success impossible, which usually sound like "I'm not good enough" or "I'm not ready yet". Their doubts rarely have anything to do with their intrinsic gifts, which are more than ready to be put to work.
There will always be more you can do in the pursuit of self-improvement, but to what end? Does a week-long "how to" workshop help? What about that advanced online training course?  Extra skills are great, but don't put your career on hold for them -- everything  you need is already within you.
When I was getting ready to launch my practice, I worried that I needed to develop my expertise before I could get started. But while QuickBooks and software tutorials might have made me a savvier businesswoman, I was already a coach. That realization empowered me to jump in before I was "ready." Fortunately, my risk was rewarded: The perfect clients always seemed to meet me exactly where I was in my practice; my service fit their needs, and the work fed my soul. As my knowledge evolved, so did my clientele. Don't let your absence of experience distract you from using your gifts... You will be rewarded for your courage.
3. Just say yes -- even if you have no idea how you'll do it. I was in shock for at least an hour after I unexpectedly received my invitation to speak at TEDxBerkeley in October 2013, six months prior to the event.
As soon as the initial thrill wore off, I had to address the unfortunate truth that the majority of my public speaking experience was limited to the banal briefings I used to present to military officials at the Pentagon; this offered me dismal preparation for the task at hand.
How was I going to inspire an audience of 2,000 (plus live streamers!)? But I confidently said yes, because I know an opportunity when I see it.
I expected to be the most anxious speaker that day, but all of the presenters were buzzing with nerves, despite their impressive careers.  This was when I realized that no matter how qualified or experienced I was, pushing myself to tackle new challenges -- especially ones that involve putting my true self out there for the world to judge -- will always be uncomfortable and nerve-wracking.
The growth you experience in the process of saying "yes" to these challenges will always be worth the suffering.
4. Create a professional identity. We are conditioned from a young age to seek acceptance from our peers. I call this the social self, our natural default setting that is driven by the desire to be liked. From a young age, our social identity -- formed by past victories and wounds -- is refined and reinforced, always seeking approval. From a young age, we were fiercely taught the importance of likeability, yet this can be incredibly damaging when it shows up in the workplace. Ask yourself: "Do I want to be liked or respected?" Sometimes you can score both, but there are many times where you have to pick one.
This is where the professional identity comes into play. It may be difficult, but the ability to draw a distinction between your social self and professional self enables you to maintain an intentional career path with boundaries that support you.  Who do you want to be in your professional life? Answering that question and showing up in the workplace with a new identity may feel phony, but there's nothing more authentic than intentionally choosing your professional persona; choice is more powerful than a natural default setting...  This process of creating a professional persona and honoring it enables you to succeed with authenticity and choice, regardless of your natural default settings.  Be intentional about what that identity looks like - what it values, expects, and requires - and honor that vision.
5. Don't place too much value on praise. Praise is lovely and victories are worth celebrating, but after spending years of my career chasing goals -- awards, scholarships, salary increases -- I found that I was never satisfied when I only focused on external goals. The reality is that if you fixate too much on the external, you often overlook the internal. Consider how you want to feel when you're setting goals... If you place too much value on praise, you'll fixate too much on the lack thereof.  This was a powerful lesson as my career developed, because the bigger the game you play, the more critics there will be.
For example, I was elated when I learned that I was going to be featured in the Work & Family section of the Wall Street Journal. The article got thousands of shares on social media, and I received many inspiring emails from those who read about me, but I couldn't have anticipated the negativity that awaited me in the comments section.
The experience taught me that you should never read your own press, and more importantly, that this part of success is inevitable: new level, new devil. As your game gets bigger and louder, so will the criticism. But the harsh words of those nameless, faceless strangers, who sounded vaguely like the voice of my own inner critic, served a valuable purpose. Sometimes criticism will cut to the heart of your insecurities. Take those opportunities to confront them and revisit your sense of self, because once that is once that is solidified, neither praise nor criticism can disturb it.
6. Celebrate others. If you cannot celebrate others who are contributing to the world and experiencing success, you are energetically blocking yourself from reaching their level. Give others the thumbs-up when they are rewarded financially, professionally, or romantically. Let their success inspire you to be better. If you support it, you attract it. Period.
7. Unplug. Nothing is more important than unplugging when you're feeling burned out. You must be at your best to serve others, and stepping back without guilt often creates space for the kind of perspective and inspiration that you need to move your game to the next level. In fact, creative companies such as Google are encouraging their employees to take naps during the day in order to refresh their minds... Innovation can't flourish in a vacuum, so give it the space it needs to thrive and motivate you. If you're feeling lazy, be lazy! Just put an expiration date on it.
I'll leave you with one assignment: stop worrying about what success looks like for other people, and ask yourself, "What does success look like for me?" ...Is it a more flexible schedule? Is it fame? Is it money in the bank account? Then ask yourself how you want to feel when you're successful... These two questions are among the toughest, but most vital, questions I ask in my work as a Career Coach to Millennials.
To find the answers, you have to stop chasing the ever-elusive carrot of external success so that you can focus on getting to know yourself. Assess what satisfies and sustains you... Develop your own metrics.  In a world where we are constantly being told what we should want, tune out the noise and the social pressure to be anyone but you. A purposeful and fulfilling life can only take place from the inside out.

3 Ingredients for Sales Successreddit
"We have a brilliant systems analyst, but we're afraid to put him in front of clients," an IBM executive told me. "He's rude and arrogant. The minute he sits down he starts telling the client what he thinks they need -- never asks what they think, or even listens ."
The best sales people take the time to listen to what a customer or client needs, and then offers a solution. That takes a combination of IQ and emotional intelligence.
Any effective sales person needs enough basic smarts to understand what she is selling -- psychologists call this a "floor effect" for IQ. If her IQ is not high enough, she will fail. On the other hand, a high IQ alone is not enough to succeed in sales -- you need social skills, particularly empathy .
Cognitive neuroscientists tell us there are three kinds of empathy , each grounded in a different system in the brain. All three play a role in sales success.
1. Cognitive empathy -- understanding how the customer thinks about the problem. This means perceiving their mental models of the world. This type of empathy, I'm sure, correlates highly with IQ, but goes beyond. You've got to listen and ask the right questions.
2. Emotional empathy -- sensing how the other person feels about what you are saying and doing. That's where that IBM systems analyst flunked. Emotional empathy holds the key to rapport - being on the same page emotionally. It tells us, for instance, when a sales pitch is falling flat, or what excites -- or scares -- a customer.
3. Empathic concern -- caring about helping the customer. Studies by companies of their star sales people find that the most successful don't just make a sale -- they manage the relationship so that the customer comes back again and again. That means building trust, not just rapport. It means actively helping the customer solve problems -- becoming a consultant to them, so they feel you have their best interests at heart.
That's why I'm unconvinced by an academic study that claimed emotional intelligence accounted for only one percent of sales success, while IQ alone made all the difference. These researchers should consider questioning the assumptions, relevance, and soundness of their measures -- the findings fly in the face of what so many in sales know works.
Take, for instance, how a leader in health care IT responded to that same LinkedIn blog: "After a career lifetime of working with programmers, engineers, and even some sales people who were very bright but possessed the social skills of a set of car keys, I have come to look for and value people who can really listen, are sensitive to social cues, and can honestly put themselves in a customer's shoes."
And as an engineer at Microsoft put it:
"The study only shows how production results correlate to emotional and cognitive intelligence. I would be very interested to see how the career advancement correlated. Do a study of these people and look at their advancement over time. My personal observation is that you might find the roles reversed even in fields like engineering."
How we connect with people makes a crucial difference not just in sales, but in leadership, teamwork, negotiation -- and in life. I'll be joining a group of experts to detail the basic tools for connection -- and if you could use some practice -- or know someone who could -- come connect.

Jesus was married and had children with Mary Magdalene  claims new bookJesus was married and had children with Mary Magdalene, claims new book
PTI  London, November 12, 2014
First Published: 22:31 IST(12/11/2014) | Last Updated: 04:08 IST(13/11/2014)
A new book claims that Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene were married with children.
Advertisement
The authors of The Lost Gospel claim that an ancient Syriac manuscript called 'Joseph and Aseneth', which found its way to the British Library in London back in 1847 from a monastery in Egypt, is the lost gospel that shows Jesus as a human being who courted and then married his wife, had children and even survived an attempt on his life.
"The manuscript helps fill the 30-year gap in Jesus' resume," co-author Professor Barrie A Wilson said at a press conference in London on Wednesday.
"What the Vatican feared and Dan Brown only suspected has come true. There is now written evidence that Jesus was married to Mary the Magdalene and that they had children together," authors Wilson and Simcha Jacobovici write in the Preface of the book.
The authors claim that the manuscript is already known to experts in the field of early Christianity, but only in the later Latin and Greek translations.
They claim to be the first to work with a Syriac version, which they have translated and "decoded" to reach their conclusions.
The authors claim the manuscript is dated to roughly the third century.
Its content was a direct threat to the authority of the Christian establishment and canonical literature, which by then had succeeded in sanitising Jesus, denying him a family life, and portraying Mary the Magdalene, who was actually his wife, as a prostitute.

Auto-rickshaw drivers take  respect for women  message to Delhi s streetsComments
Delhi auto-rickshaw driver Narotan Singh was never interested in the problems faced by women and girls - his only interaction with the opposite sex was with females from his middle-class family such as his mother, wife and daughter.
Weaving through the streets of the Capital, the 37-year-old driver would often frown or stare through his rear view mirror at female passengers wearing tight-fitting jeans or skirts, or make a comment about how they should not smoke or be out at late.
But Singh's chauvinistic ways are now behind him.
Last month, his attitude to women was transformed by a class on gender sensitisation run by the charity Manas Foundation and Delhi's Transport Department.
"When I was told that we have to do this training, I was not happy as I thought it was an unnecessary waste of my time - time which I could use to make some money by picking up passengers," said Singh from the driver's seat of his green and yellow motorised three-wheeler.
"But when I went into the training and understood the problems faced by women on Delhi's streets and that I had the ability to change this, I realised that this is something that everyone should know about."
Singh is one of 40,000 auto-rickshaw drivers in Delhi who have already attended the classes and are helping to spread the message of respect for women across the city, which has become known as India's "rape capital".
According to the National Crime Records Bureau, the number of reported rapes in India rose by 35.2% to 33,707 in 2013. Delhi was the city with the highest number of rapes, reporting 1,441 in 2013.
DELHI'S GATEKEEPERS
Experts say the media attention surrounding the fatal gangrape of a 23-year-old woman on a bus in Delhi in December 2012 helped to raise awareness about safety for women on transport and in public places.
The attack, which prompted thousands of Indians to protest against rising violence against women, also highlighted the need to change the attitudes of men and boys in a largely conservative and patriarchal society.
"We show the city's shocking statistics on rape and then provide anecdotes and pictures to drive home the point of how serious the situation is," said Smita Tewari Pant, a trainer on the gender sensitisation from the Manas Foundation.
"We also explain that... businesses will be affected as tourists will stop coming to Delhi if violence against women continues as it is."
But what has been most effective in engaging participants, said Pant, is the message that auto-rickshaw drivers are, in essence, the city's gate-keepers who have the power to change the situation by making women feel secure and respected.
The message allows drivers to feel that they are not part of the problem, but part of the solution, she added.
 
DON'T JUDGE WOMEN
To secure their annual auto-rickshaw fitness certificate from the Transport Department, Delhi's 120,000 drivers are now required to attend the one-hour gender class every year.
Pant said the course had received a positive response and drivers proudly displayed stickers reading "This responsible rickshaw respects and protects women" in Hindi and English on their vehicles.
Singh said the course had changed his thinking so much so that he now talks to other drivers, as well as his friends and family, about gender equality.
The training should be expanded to taxi and bus drivers, he said, adding that if this kind of sensitisation had started five years ago, the infamous Delhi gangrape may not have occurred.
"After the training, I realise working women's problems much better. They face many issues - they have to manage their home life and they have to deal with pressures at work, so they should at least feel comfortable when they commute," said Singh.
"The training made me and other drivers think twice about our behaviour towards our female passengers.
"We used to think 'I only had a little look at what she was wearing' or 'I only made that comment for her own good' but now we realise that it's really none of our business and we should not judge women, but respect them."

Twitter considers crafting new apps  improving messaging0
Chief Executive Dick Costolo said Twitter also planned to speed up the pace of changes to its product and to add more functions to its private messaging service.
"I strongly believe private messaging virality is important to our long term growth," Costolo said, a reference to when online content goes viral or is popularly shared. He noted that some of the new private messaging features would be introduced in the current quarter.
Executives said the company needed to do a better job helping new users understand how to use the service. An upcoming "instant timeline" will quickly provide new users with content without requiring them to search Twitter for individual users to follow.
Twitter, whose main service allows users to broadcast 140-character messages, appeared to be taking a page from rival Facebook, which in recent years has taken the approach of creating individual apps centered on news, for instance, and also recently beefed up its private messaging.
Twitter has been searching for ways to arrest dwindling user engagement and drive growth. It currently counts 284 million users, compared with Facebook's 1.3 billion.
In October, Twitter reported that timeline views per user, a key measure of engagement, slid 7 percent globally in the third quarter.

China-U.S. deal on emission cutsclimate change
The surprise agreement has brightened prospects for a climate deal in Paris next year
China and the United States have agreed on a timetable to limit emission of greenhouse gases — a decision that will impose fresh pressure on India not to obstruct a binding treaty on climate change next year.
The breakthrough was achieved during talks between visiting U.S. President Barack Obama and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, ending a 20-year discord between the world’s two leading economies on how to combat climate change. In a joint announcement on Wednesday, the U.S. agreed to reduce by 2025 its emission of greenhouse gases by 26 per cent to 28 per cent below its 2005 level. China stated its intent to peak emissions of carbon dioxide in 2030, if not earlier. It also agreed to raise the share of non-fossil fuels to 20 per cent, in its primary energy mix, in the next 16 years. This would entail China shifting towards clean energy generated by nuclear, wind, solar and such zero-emitting resources.
The surprise agreement on Wednesday between the United States and China on a timetable for emission cuts to combat climate change has brightened prospects for a climate deal in Paris next year. The deal can tilt the scales at negotiations at the UN climate conference slated for Paris in 2015.
Three years ago, leaders from 200 countries had agreed to finalise an agreement in Paris, which would replace the Kyoto protocol — the only legally binding treaty on cutting emissions, signed in 1997.
Analysts point out that the U.S.-China deal is in tune with the target of avoiding a dangerous 2 degree rise in temperatures across the globe.
The agreement underscores the complexity of the U.S.-China relationship, which has otherwise nosedived after Washington announced its “Asia Pivot” — a strategic shift, which includes fresh troop deployments in China’s periphery.
The joint announcement could impose fresh pressure on India not to become a deal breaker in the run up to the Paris talks. India’s per capita emissions are estimated at one-tenth of the United States and one-fourth of China, but, without a significant shift towards non-fossil fuels, its carbon footprint could rise substantially between 2020-2040, out of sync with global expectations.
 

Frigid blast grips Central U.S.  cold front reaches East CoastBy Angela Fritz November 12 Follow @angelafritz
Snow falls on South Third St. in downtown Marquette, Mich., Tuesday, Nov. 11, 2014. Michigan’s Upper Peninsula was buried under more than 14 inches of snow — with at least another foot expected before the storm moves out Wednesday.

An Arctic blast has ushered in frigid temperatures across the Central U.S. on Wednesday, while the northern Great Lakes region is buried in up to three feet of snow. The front ahead of the surge of cold air had made its way to the East Coast by late Wednesday morning.
The brisk, early November storm produced up to three feet of snow in the Upper Midwest from Monday through Wednesday morning. Reports of as much as 35.5 inches of snow in Marquette, Mich., had been submitted to the National Weather Service as of Wednesday afternoon. The 16 inches of snow that Marquette received on Tuesday alone was enough to set a daily snowfall record for the location, breaking the previous record of six inches set in 1974. A lake effect snow advisory remains in effect through Thursday afternoon for the northern Great Lakes.
Lows across the Central U.S. and Rockies on Wednesday morning hovered around the zero mark. Single digit lows were recorded from Kansas to North Dakota, while parts of the High Plains dipped below zero, including Casper, Wy., which bottomed out at -26 degrees Wednesday morning.

The surge of Arctic air has temperatures running as much as 40 degrees below average this week in the High Plains, and 20 to 30 degrees below average across the central U.S., from Minnesota and Wisconsin south to Texas.

As expected, surface pressure is climbing as cold, dense air surges south. Surface pressure has surpassed 1040 millibars in many locations within and east of the Rockies, and models suggest that the highs could max out around 1050 millibars on Wednesday afternoon, though this is still short of the record high pressure recorded in the lower 48, according to Christopher C. Burt, who writes :
In the contiguous United States, the highest-pressure reading yet measured is 1064 mb (31.42”) at Miles City, Montana on December 24, 1983. Many people may remember this as the coldest Christmas in modern U.S. history (at least for almost everywhere east of the Rockies).
Chris also writes that the highest pressure anywhere in the U.S. was set in Northway, Alaska – 1078.6 millibars on January 31, 1989.
Now that the front has moved through, temperatures will begin to take a dive in the Eastern U.S. on Wednesday, though without the intensity that it has been showing in the Plains. By Friday, temperatures in the Mid-Atlantic will be running 15 to 20 degrees below average. Highs in the D.C. region will max out in the 40s on Friday and Saturday — definitely chilly, but far from a true Arctic blast.
The weekend’s transition into winter is expected to continue through at least next week, when a series of fronts are forecast to keep temperatures chilly across the eastern states. Tuesday and Wednesday could be particularly brisk, with temperatures running as much as 30 degrees below average in some locations from the Midwest into the Mid-Atlantic.

Everything that happens in the world happens on Twitter, and we’re constantly working to make it easier to create, share, consume and connect to what’s happening right now – whenever and however it’s most convenient for you.
This morning, I had the opportunity to present our plan to deliver on that at our Analyst Day conference. I want to take a moment to share our vision with you and offer some insight into product improvements we’re bringing to Twitter in the coming months.
Earlier this year, we set out to make Tweets richer and more engaging, giving users more ways to Tweet beyond text. We brought videos, Vines and GIFs into the home timeline, and introduced features that let you post multiple photos, tag people in photos and express yourself using emojis . To showcase all of this media, we launched a new profile design . We also introduced a new way for partners to share premium video and audio on Twitter, so you can preview and play with just one tap.
But aside from just watching video more easily on Twitter, you should be able to record, edit and share your own videos natively on Twitter too. Alongside short looping Vine videos, we think you’ll have fun sharing what’s happening in your world through native video. You can expect to see this in the first half of next year.
Right now, what you see of the 500 million Tweets published every day is based entirely on who you follow, and that’s a great model for many people. But with that many Tweets every day, there’s no way even the most avid Twitter user will find everything that’s relevant to their interests in any particular moment. That’s why we’re exploring ways to surface relevant Tweets so the content that is interesting to you is easy to discover – whether you stay on Twitter all day or visit for a few minutes – while still preserving the real-time nature of the platform that makes Twitter special.
For instance, we’re experimenting with better ways to give you what you come to Twitter for: a snapshot of what’s happening. We can use information like who you follow and what you engage with to surface highlights of what you missed and show those to you as soon as you log back in or come back to the app.
We’re also working on ideas such as an instant, personalized timeline for new users who don’t want to spend time cultivating one on their own.
Ultimately, we believe there is something for everyone at any time on Twitter, and we want to make finding your niche simple from the start.
And we haven’t forgotten about Direct Messages. We have several updates coming that will make it easy to take a public conversation private. The first of these was announced today and will begin rolling out next week: the ability to share and discuss Tweets natively and privately via Direct Messages. Stay tuned!
These are just a few examples of projects and focus areas we’re working on. Over the coming months, we are picking up the pace of product changes and improvements. As ever, that will involve a lot of experimentation, and we’ll be listening to your feedback along the way to make sure we build a service you love.

CapitalsCoach Barry Trotz used to share a hotel room with Kenny Albert on road tripsBy Scott Allen November 12 Follow @ScottSAllen

Washington Capitals coach and one-time Metallica fan Barry Trotz joined Bob Mackowycz and Matthew Cauz on Toronto’s TSN 1050 on Wednesday and was asked about his days as a minor league coach with the Baltimore Skipjacks. Specifically, Macko and Cauz wanted to know if it was true that Trotz shared a hotel room on road trips with the team’s play-by-play announcer at the time, Kenny Albert.
Congratulations to new Washington Capitals head coach Barry Trotz #BaltimoreSkipjacks
— Kenny Albert (@KennyAlbert) May 26, 2014
“That is correct,” Trotz said. “In the minors, those are great times. The funniest story I have of rooming with the broadcaster, Kenny, is we were in Utica, New York one time. In the minors, you roll into a city about 3, 4 in the morning. It was really cold, it was snowing, it was sort of a blizzard. We get to our room and we can barely get into the room because there’s a snowbank. So we go to the front desk and we’re staying at a Holiday Inn or something like that. And lo and behold, I go to the front desk and say, ‘Hey, there’s a snowbank in our room, can we get another room?’ And they said we’re all sold out.
“And so that night, we slept in our room and there was a snowbank in our room. You’ve got your sweatsuit on, and you’ve got your overcoat on and you’re under your covers because you’re freezing to death. I heard this voice in the middle of the night, it’s about 4 in the morning. Kenny goes, in this very quivery voice, ‘I am absolutely freezing.’ My response was, ‘You better stay over in your bed.’”
Trotz had positive things to say about Alex Ovechkin, saying that his star player has “bought in” and is “playing more of a 200-foot game than he has in the past.” Trotz also addressed the attention and criticism that Ovechkin receives from the media.
“All the top players either get all the praise or all the criticism,” Trotz said. “Alex is a little bit of a lightning rod because of the fact that I think he gets, maybe sometimes he gets too much praise for when we win, and he gets too much fault for when we lose. He’s one of those guys. One of the things that bothers me in our game a little bit is, a guy like Alex Ovechkin is probably a little more like Darth Vader than someone who is lily white. But he puts people in the stands. We go on the road and that’s why people are paying $300 a ticket in the third level just to see Alex play. He’s done a lot for the game. Sometimes it does anger me a little bit that a player who helps fill the rinks and pay salaries and make our game very entertaining gets so much criticism. I think it’s a little bit undeserved, and that’s part of being a top player, though. You’re going to get a lot more criticism, if you’re a top player in Toronto or Montreal, you’re going to get a lot of heat if you’re not playing well. I get that part, but sometimes we’re hard on our stars that really bring us out of our seats sometimes.”

My conttribution to the NYU Journal of Law and Liberty symposium on Richard Epsteins The Classical Liberal ConstitutionBy Ilya Somin November 12
The NYU Journal of Law and Liberty recently held a symposium on NYU law professor Richard Epstein’s excellent new book, The Classical Liberal Constitution. My contribution, “Libertarianism and Originalism in The Classical Liberal Constitution” is now available on SSRN . Here is the abstract:
Richard Epstein’s The Classical Liberal Constitution is an impressive synthesis of between libertarian political theory and constitutional interpretation.
Part I of this brief essay summarizes Epstein’s important contribution to constitutional scholarship, particularly his sophisticated effort to integrate originalism and libertarianism. In Part II, I consider a possible tension in his theory: Epstein’s desire to leave room for government regulation that cures market failures could potentially be used to justify a wide range of nonlibertarian forms of government intervention that might undermine the very constitutional rights that he seeks to protect.
Part III suggests that the tension in Epstein’s theory can be partially mitigated by greater reliance on originalism with fewer policy-driven exceptions for market failures. Given real-world judges and political actors, this might result in greater economic efficiency as well as stronger protection for individual freedom than under Epstein’s approach. In the process of considering these issues, I focus on judicial interpretation of the Bill of Rights. It may be helpful to look at the original meaning not just in 1791, when the Bill of Rights was first enacted, but also in 1868, when, as a result of the Fourteenth Amendment it became incorporated against state governments. The case of the Public Use Clause of the Fifth Amendment, which Epstein and I have both written about extensively, exemplifies each of these points.
Ilya Somin is Professor of Law at George Mason University. His research focuses on constitutional law, property law, and popular political participation.

Could climate change become key issue in 2016 presidential raceBy Greg Sargent November 12 Follow @theplumlinegs
The ambitious deal to curb climate emissions that the U.S. has reached with China could move us in the direction of fulfilling a long-sought dream of the environmental movement: Making the fate of the Earth just a tiny bit more relevant in electoral politics. It could help ensure that climate change becomes an issue — not a defining one, but one that matters more than it has historically — in the 2016 presidential race.
The deal — in which the U.S. has pledged to escalate reduction of emissions to 26 or 28 percent by 2025, and China has vowed to cap emissions and boost non-fossil fuels to one-fifth of energy sources by 2030 — is already being panned by Republicans. This is hardly surprising: They just won a big election in part by campaigning against President Obama’s alleged “war on coal.” But the new agreement between the U.S. and China — which together produce 45 percent of greenhouse gas emissions — could shift the politics of climate change in interesting ways.
As Brad Plumer explains , a key unknown is whether the U.S. can make good on its goals. This will turn on implementation of the Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed new rules to reduce emissions from existing power plants, and it will require more than that. Mitch McConnell has already vowed that the new GOP majority will fight any such efforts. That could complicate the U.S.’s ability to meet its end of any climate bargain.
This means GOP efforts to block Obama’s climate actions could suddenly take on vast practical implications and result in tangible international consequences. As Jonathan Chait details , Republican politicians have long justified opposing specific policies to curb our carbon emissions by claiming it won’t do any overall good, because China won’t do its part, too. Presuming this deal holds and China honors its end of it — which is uncertain — that excuse has just gone “poof.”
This is why Republicans such as McConnell are suggesting the deal “requires China to do nothing at all for 16 years,” and others are dismissing it as “non-binding” and a “charade.” If these things are true, then even those who are trying to come across as semi-open to accepting science, such as likely presidential contender Marco Rubio , can more easily argue there is still no need to do anything.  (See Chait’s response to those arguments here .)
Obviously it remains unknown whether GOP lawmakers will pay any near-term political price for opposing action on climate. But the timing of what’s coming on the international stage could dovetail with the presidential campaign calendar, forcing the issue on to the national agenda.
The deal with China is a key first step in the run-up to a global climate accord that Obama will try to negotiate in Paris next year. This will happen as the GOP presidential primary is gearing up, and its contenders probably will vociferously oppose any American participation in any such treaty, to appeal to GOP primary voters. What’s more, Obama is clearly undertaking a bid to make climate a major piece of his legacy, which could include more executive actions , further necessitating loud opposition to climate action from GOP presidential hopefuls.
Beyond that, any such treaty could become an issue in the 2016 general election, increasing the stakes around the question of whether — and how — we will go about sufficiently reducing our carbon emissions. “The question for all 2016 presidential candidates will be, Do you support the United States participating in a binding world agreement to address the climate crisis?” says Tiernan Sittenfeld, a senior vice president at the League of Conservation Voters.
Efforts to make climate an issue in the 2014 elections fell flat, leading to a lot of joyous mockery from certain segments of the press corps. But the 2016 map and electorate will be very different from those of 2014. Democrats will be relying more on millennials and socially liberal college educated whites who care about the issue or at least see it as a proof point in a broader contrast between the two parties’ ideological casts and visions for the future. I’m not saying the issue will prove all that important politically. But the deal with China raises the possibility that the fate of the planet just might take on a bit more political relevance than it has in the past.

Are Ginuwine and Sole actually divorced Its complicated.By Helena Andrews November 12 Follow @helena_andrews

R&B singer Ginuwine, the Prince George’s County-native whose hits “Pony” and “So Anxious” dominated senior prom playlists from 1996 to 1999, has split from rapper Solé, his wife of more than a decade.
News of the soul singer’s impending divorce first broke Monday when the New York Daily News  reported that Ginuwine’s lawyer, Bruce Beckner, referenced the divorce during a pretrial hearing in an unrelated lawsuit against the performer. The executive producer of Ginuwine’s debut album, Robert Reives, is seeking $250,000 in what he says are back royalties from the soul singer’s five-album deal with Sony.
“Mr. Lumpkin is very close to declaring bankruptcy,” said Beckner in court, using his client’s given name, Elgin Lumpkin. “He owes my firm a ton of money and a bunch of other people a ton of money. He owes Uncle Sam 300-odd thousand dollars in back income taxes.” Beckner, according to the Daily News, penned the money woes to Ginuwine’s recent divorce.
“All I know is what I told the court,” Beckner, who is based in Washington, told us when we asked about the status of Ginuwine’s marriage. “I do not know any of the specifics,” he said before emphasizing, “I do not represent Ginuwine in any domestic proceedings.”
Gossip outlets immediately took the news as fact, referring to it as a “quiet divorce” since the musical pair hadn’t mentioned the split publicly at all. Soon, though, the online chatter got so loud (and wrong), that Ginuwine addressed the rumors via Instagram, the social media tool that allows celebrities to churn out immediate public statements with the press of a button.
“We are NOT yet divorced, but we ARE currently separated and working towards coming to our own agreement, without lawyers, to amicably and fairly divorce,” wrote Ginuwine in the caption of a somewhat incongruous inspirational quote (“Quitting is just NOT an option”) on Tuesday. He went on to explain that rumors that Solé (real name Tonya Lumpkin) had left the singer broke were untrue. He blamed the split on his “poor choices and actions over many years.”
By all accounts the Lumpkins led an ordinary life in a six-bedroom 5,000 square foot home in Brandywine, Md. The pair, who married in 2003, have two daughters together, Story, 13, and Dream, 12. Ginuwine chauffeured the girls to ballet lessons, showed up at parent-teacher conferences and in church on Sundays. Solé, whose one and only album was released in 1999, is a vegan yoga-enthusiast. A source described the family as “one hundred percent normal.”
According to property records, the Prince George’s estate is still Ginuwine’s primary residence. As of May, Sole’s current resident is a home in Bowie, some 25 miles away.
“They’re really good people,” continued the source, “it’s sad they’re not working out.”

A Delaware Court Decision Threatens Effective Enforcement of Our Nation s Securities Laws  While the SEC Stands Idly Byreddit
A recent Delaware court decision is threatening shareholders' ability to hold corporations and their executives accountable for corporate malfeasance, and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is standing on the sidelines doing nothing to address the problem.
Because the majority of publicly traded companies are incorporated in Delaware, Delaware courts often set standards for what corporations are permitted to do. In May, the Delaware Supreme Court ruled that a corporation's board of directors can unilaterally amend the company's bylaws to include a "loser pays" provision that shifts all litigation expenses to a plaintiff who sues the company for intra-corporate wrongdoing, and does not obtain a judgment "that substantially achieves, in substance and amount, the full remedy sought."  In other words, you could go into court, prove your case, be awarded damages and, if that award is "substantially" less than the amount you sought, end up paying the corporation's legal fees -- fees that could be many times greater than the amount of your award.
As a general rule in the United States, parties pay their own attorneys' fees, but they can agree by contract to obligate the losing party to pay the winning party's fees. Because corporate bylaws are considered "contracts among a corporation's shareholders," shareholders can be bound by the company's bylaws, regardless of whether the shareholders actually approve them. While the watershed case in Delaware considered the application of a fee-shifting provision in a non-stock corporation's bylaws, there is nothing in the opinion that suggests the ruling was limited to those facts.
Stock corporations and their legal counsel apparently agree. More than two dozen stock corporations have changed their bylaws since the decision, and renowned securities law professor John Coffee predicts that those are the "first trickle of water through a leak in a dam."
For a company looking to insulate itself and its board of directors and executives from being held accountable for their actions, changing company bylaws to include a fee-shifting provision is a no-brainer. These provisions are entirely one-sided in favor of the companies that draft them. Specifically, they apply in only one direction, with the plaintiff shareholder paying the defendant corporation. And, as noted above, they may require a plaintiff shareholder to obtain a judgment "that substantially achieves, in substance and amount, the full remedy sought." While it is not entirely clear what constitutes being "substantially" successful, it is likely that winning one out of three claims, or obtaining a judgment for $1 million out of $3 million sought--each considered a victory in any reasonable sphere--might not be substantial enough. That would mean the winning plaintiff shareholder would still be considered the "loser" under the provision and have to pay the defendant corporation's legal fees.
The clear intent of these provisions is to erect virtually insurmountable barriers that immunize companies and their management from having to answer to their shareholders for their conduct, egregious as it may be. Knowing that in all likelihood a plaintiff shareholder will be footing the ultimate bill, a defendant company is likely to engage in a war of attrition, dragging on cases interminably and racking up exorbitant legal fees.  With the threat of having to pay those astronomical fees, no reasonable shareholder is likely to bring suit, no matter how meritorious his or her claim.
Fee-shifting provisions may insulate companies and their management from being held accountable for wrongful conduct to shareholders arising under state claims. For example, fee-shifting provisions could effectively bar suits under Delaware common law when companies' boards of directors breach their fiduciary duties by failing to exercise reasonable care or by engaging in self-dealing transactions. Without the risk of being held accountable for their wrongful conduct, directors will be more likely to engage in wrongful conduct, especially if that conduct is financially beneficial to them.
Fee-shifting provisions also may insulate companies from being held accountable for violating federal securities laws.  Under federal securities laws, registered companies are required to provide accurate and timely disclosure of material information about their businesses and the securities that they are offering. A company that fails to make adequate disclosures can be held liable by an investor who has suffered harm as a result of the inadequate disclosures. However, fee-shifting provisions could effectively bar shareholder securities suits. For example, a company could make a material misstatement or omission in its registration statement, or defraud investors into buying its securities, and not face liability. Thus, the presence of a fee-shifting provision could nullify private enforcement of the federal securities laws, weakening investor protections and undermining the integrity of our nation's capital markets.
Given the SEC's stated goal to foster and enforce compliance with the federal securities laws, it has a clear interest in curtailing the use of fee-shifting clauses. However, thus far, the agency has been unwilling to engage on the issue. If it wanted to, it could refuse to accelerate companies' registration statements if their bylaws include fee-shifting clauses. There is recent precedent for the Commission to exert its authority in such a manner; it just needs the will to act.
A Delaware court imprudently disrupted the landscape of corporate liability. It is the SEC's responsibility to ensure that that Delaware court's decision is not used to subvert the SEC's stated mission and goals.

Tomas bounces back  instylePrint
By: Reuters | London | Posted: November 13, 2014 1:38 am
Knock him down and one thing is certain about Tomas Berdych at the ATP World Tour Finals — he will bounce right up again. The 29-year-old Czech has qualified for the year-ending showpiece beside the River Thames five years in succession and each time he has lost his opening match.
On Monday he crashed 6-1 6-1 to Swiss Stanislas Wawrinka but, true to form, he rebounded to win his second group match at the 02 Arena on Wednesday, outclassing Marin Cilic 6-3 6-1.
Just as his opening match record is lamentable, albeit his tormentors have been Rafa Nadal, Novak Djokovic, Andy Murray and Wawrinka twice, his second match record now reads 5-0. So what transformed the world number seven from a pussycat to a tiger in the space of two days?
“I think that’s the beauty of this event,” he told reporters after keeping alive his hopes of claiming a semi-final spot with a top-two finish in Group A.
“One day you can be swept out from the court like I was and in two days’ time you can come up and play different tennis.
“Basically there were no miracles in that time in between the matches. I just had a good practice session yesterday, good rest, refocused again, and ready to go for another match.”
Berdych was certainly a far different proposition to the one that was thumped by Wawrinka. He broke Cilic’s serve in the first game of the match and, after saving two break points at 4-3, never looked back.
Berdych said he faced “mission impossible” after his opening loss and while he is at least still in the mix, the odds are stacked against him with Djokovic his third opponent.
The last time they played, in the Beijing final a few weeks ago, Berdych managed two games. “I’m going to try to maybe win three, four games. That would be better from the last time,” he joked. “As I said after my first match, it couldn’t be worse than that. So let’s see. It’s pretty much the same scenario for that. It couldn’t be much worse.
“It’s always a huge challenge to play the number one player in the world. The way he’s playing, where we are playing, it’s pretty much all set up for him and for his game. But I’m going to bring all that is left in me.”
Murray’s conundrum
Andy Murray could beat Roger Federer on Thursday and crash out of the ATP World Tour Finals or lose and go through to the semi-finals — such is the conundrum he faces. However, the 27-year-old is glad just to still be in contention after Tuesday’s 6-3 7-5 defeat of big-serving Canadian Milos Raonic.
That victory means all scenarios are possible going into the final round-robin matches.
“For me it depends on the winner of the Nishikori/Raonic match. If Kei wins, then I need to beat Roger, it depends on the scoreline of that match with Kei and Raonic. If Raonic wins, then I know that all I need to do is win the match against Roger continued…

Human remains found at MH17 site but no wreckagerecoveryThe site of the crash in Ukraine. (Source: AP)
By: Agence-France Presse | The Hague | Posted: November 13, 2014 1:38 am
Dutch forensic experts recovered further human remains at the crash site of downed flight MH17 in eastern Ukraine today, but said they could not yet start salvaging the wreckage.
“A small team has recovered body parts at the site after pieces of the wreckage were lifted with a crane,” the Dutch defence ministry said in a statement.
Dutch experts, who are charged with body part recovery and also leading the probe into the fatal July 17 crash that killed all 298 on board, arrived at the site on Tuesday.
They are hoping to recover the debris from the doomed Malaysia Airlines flight, amid fears that full-scale fighting could break out again.
The human remains will now be sent to Kharkiv for a first forensic check and be repatriated to the Netherlands at a later stage, the ministry said.
The Dutch team’s chief official, Pieter-Jaap Aalbersberg, said his small group had “done everything they could” to retrieve body parts and personal belongings.
“To continue, we would now need heavy equipment and far more forensic experts. At this moment it’s not possible,” Aalbersberg said in the statement.
He added the security situation around the crash site “remained fragile”.
Kiev and the West have claimed that the Boeing 777 was shot down in the conflict-torn area by separatist fighters using a BUK surface-to-air missile supplied by Russia. Moscow denies the charges, pointing the finger back at Kiev.
So far 289 victims had been identified through body parts recovered from the site, but no wreckage has been retrieved due to safety issues.
Dutch Foreign Minister Bert Koenders warned over the weekend that the last remains of MH17’s victims may never be recovered as five more coffins were flown back to the Netherlands.
The Defence Ministry said work had not started yet to recover parts of the wreckage for the air crash investigation.
Representatives from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which has been negotiating with separatists on behalf of the Dutch government, “were still in talks”.

Euro qualifiers: Not quite a stroll forheavyweightsPrint
By: Associated Press | Posted: November 13, 2014 1:36 am
Qualifying for the European Championship in 2016 was supposed to be a simple task for the continent’s top teams. It’s not turning out that way.
World champions Germany, Portugal and the Netherlands have made disappointing starts to their campaigns and are all outside the top two in their groups after three games. The top two countries from nine groups qualify automatically for the tournament in France, along with the best third-place finisher.
Italy and England, with three wins from three games, are showing how it should be done, while teams like Slovakia, Northern Ireland and Wales are top of their groups and have a great chance of a rare place at a major tournament.
The Germans, who are third in their group with four points, are expected to rack up the goals against Gibraltar in probably the biggest mismatch in the qualifying campaign. The Dutch have lost two of their three games in Group A, leading to speculation about the future of coach Guus Hiddink ahead of a match against Latvia.
Germany’s players admit they cannot name a single player from Gibraltar, the territory of only 30,000 people that is playing in its first qualifying tournament since being accepted by UEFA. Almost all of Gibraltar’s players are amateurs. “But we have respect for every opponent,” Germany defender Jerome Boateng said.
Injuries to key players are stretching Spain’s squad ahead of the qualifying match against Belarus and a friendly against Germany on Tuesday. Striker Diego Costa has been rested, Cesc Fabregas has been ruled out and Andres Iniesta is also missing. That gives opportunities to others, with midfielders Bruno Soriano and Ignacio Camacho and strikers Jose Callejon, Alvaro Morata and Manuel “Nolito” Agudo fighting for a place up front.
Mario Balotelli’s first call-up to Italy’s squad in the tenure of coach Antonio Conte was somewhat of a surprise. After all, Balotelli has scored only two goals in 14 matches with Liverpool. “This was part of the rebuilding plan, to test different players,” Conte said. “Balotelli is starting for Liverpool. I’m forced to call up many players who are not starters for their clubs.”
Arjen Robben is convinced Guus Hiddink’s job as Netherlands coach is safe. Hiddink has started his second tenure in charge of the Dutch team with a dismal record of one win and three losses, including losing Euro 2016 qualifiers to the Czech Republic and Iceland. The Netherlands are third in Group A behind those nations.
Wayne Rooney is set to make his 100th appearance for England in their home game against Slovenia, which is three points behind in second place in Group H. Cristiano Ronaldo needs one more goal to break the scoring record in European Championship games that he currently shares with former Turkey striker Hakan Sukur and Danish forward Jon Dahl Tomasson with 22 goals. Portugal, third in Group I, host Armenia.

CCI to step up cotton procurement atMSPPrint
By: Express News Service | New Delhi | Posted: November 13, 2014 1:34 am
Cotton Corporation of India (CCI) has been directed to open more centres for procurement of kapas at the Centre’s minimum support price (MSP) to prevent distress sales by farmers.
The agency has already bought 2.5 lakh bales from farmers mainly in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh in the ongoing marketing season.
The Centre has set no cap on procurement and “we will buy whatever quantity that comes to us,” textile minister Santosh Gangwar told reporters following a meeting convened by agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh here on Wednesday. The meeting was also attended by commerce minister Nirmala Sitharaman, labour minister Bandaru Dattatreya, CCI chairman and managing director BK Mishra and senior officials from the concerned ministries.
At the meeting, Mishra informed that while CCI was taking steps to increase its own procurement, the corporation did not have the powers to appoint any cooperative federation to act as its agent. The agriculture ministry has, therefore, been asked to enhance the government guarantee limit of National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation (Nafed) to facilitate the appointment of the Maharashtra federation as a procurement agency.
The agriculture minister asked CCI to release advertisements detailing the locations of its procurement centres and conduct periodic press briefings to assure farmers that the Centre is committed to safeguard their interests.

Regulators fine global banks $4.3 bn in forexprobePrint

Regulators fined six major banks including Citigroup and UBS a total of $4.3 billion for failing to stop traders from trying to manipulate the foreign exchange market, following a year-long global investigation.
HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland, JP Morgan and Bank of America also face penalties resulting from the inquiry that has put the largely unregulated $5 trillion-a-day market on a tighter leash, accelerated the push to automate trading and ensnared the Bank of England.
In the latest scandal to hit the financial services industry, dealers shared confidential information about client orders and coordinated trades to make money from a foreign exchange benchmark used by asset managers and corporate treasurers to value their holdings. Dozens of traders have been fired or suspended
Dealers used code names to identify clients without naming them and created online chatrooms with pseudonyms such as “the players”, “the 3 musketeers” and “1 team, 1 dream” in which to swap information. Those not involved were belittled and traders used obscene language to congratulate themselves on quick profits made from their scams.
Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) fined five lenders $1.77 billion, the biggest penalty in the history of the City of London, and the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) ordered them to pay a further $1.48 billion.

Written by Surabhi | New Delhi | Posted: November 13, 2014 1:30 am
Even as finance minister Arun Jaitley has expressed hope that the long-pending Insurance Laws (Amendment) Bill will be enacted in the Winter Session of Parliament, the proposed legislation has hit another snag and is set to be delayed again.
The expansion of the Union Cabinet and induction of Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi and JP Nadda in the council of ministers last Sunday has left the Select Committee of Rajya Sabha that is examining the Bill, without two members. Consequently, a meeting of the committee that was scheduled for Wednesday had to be deferred. “The meeting will have to take place later. I can not hold a meeting with a truncated committee and we will now wait for nomination of fresh members,” said Chandan Mitra of the BJP, chairman of the Select Committee.
The committee was expected to submit its report by the last working day of the first week of the Winter Session. The report is now expected to get delayed, which would translate into further delay in carrying out legislative business on the Bill.
Naqvi has been appointed as minister of state for minority affairs and Parliamentary affairs, Nadda is the Cabinet minister for health and family welfare.
Sources said that the committee will now have to seek an extension before it can submit its report. “We have to do clause-by-clause discussion, based on which the draft report will be finalised. But now, we can not do anything until there are new members, which is a time taking process,” said another member.

A special court on Wednesday ordered further investigation to probe the role of government officials including former coal secretary HC Gupta in connection with coal block allocation case involving Navabharat Power Pvt Ltd (NPPL).
“I am not entering into a detailed analysis of the evidence… however, I am of the considered opinion that acts of Ministry of Coal officers i.e. HC Gupta, Secretary, KS Kropha, the then joint secretary, KC Samaria, the then director – prima facie fall within the four corners of the offence of criminal misconduct…,” Special Judge Bharat Parashar said.
The court, before taking cognisance against private parties in the case, has ordered further investigation to look into role of public servants in the case and has directed the CBI to file a progress report on December 16.

Dipping crude not to benefit public as govt plans to raise duty to keep pricesunchangedPrint
Written by Amitav Ranjan | New Delhi | Posted: November 13, 2014 1:26 am | Updated: November 13, 2014 10:27 am
The government would mop up further benefits of a sliding international price of crude oil by raising the excise duty on both petrol and diesel by Rs 1.50 per litre so as to leave the pump prices unchanged.
Ahead of a possible reduction this weekend in prices of both decontrolled products, secretaries of finance and petroleum met on Tuesday to consider raising the excise duty matching the proposed cut so as to leave the consumers unaffected while benefitting the national exchequer which is groaning under a lower realisation of indirect taxes.
Moreover, it would partially make up for the loss in revenue from excise and customs duty because of the wider economic slowdown.
The first discussion on this issue was held last week in the finance ministry and the two secretaries Tuesday agreed to a duty hike before the state-run oil marketing companies revise rates of petrol and diesel on Saturday, said sources.
The Centre levies a specific per litre duty, unaffected by the price movement, of Rs 9.20 per litre of central excise duty is levied on petrol and Rs 3.46 per litre in the case of diesel. Apart from raising government revenue, the move is seen as a fund buffer to plug the deficit in case crude prices harden in the future. Also, a stiff price rise in such a situation would create more flutter were the government to pass on the crude price rise in terms of stiff increase in petrol and diesel prices. Petrol has lost Rs 12 per litre in over a year while diesel has gone down Rs 5 per litre in less than three months. A further cut in pump prices would make future upwards revision definitely unpalatable politically, said sources.
Petrol prices are down to Rs 64.24 a litre in Delhi now from a peak of over Rs 76 in September 2013. Diesel is down from Rs 58.97 per litre to Rs 53.35 in Delhi and its fall gave the government leeway to take the politically tough decision to decontrol its price on October 18. Crude oil prices are forecast to dip further in December considering the futures trade, said sources.

Payrolls rose by 321,000 in November, way above the 230,000 estimated, while the unemployment rate held steady at 5.8 percent, a six-year low.
The report blew past forecasts, but also raised expectations that a rate hike from the Federal Reserve may materialize sooner than previously thought.
Ronald Sanchez, chief investment officer of Fiduciary Trust Company International in New York, said the number was "unambiguously strong," though it "could mean some changes to policy recommendations with the Fed. June 2015 is back on the table for when rates could rise."
Financials <.SPSY> rose 1 percent as higher interest rates would prop up earnings in the sector. Bank of America  rose 2.7 percent to $17.68 while Goldman Sachs  was up 1.8 percent to $195.45, boosting the Dow.
Utilities <.SPLRCU>, a dividend play, fell 0.8 percent as Treasuries yields rose. Energy <.SPNY> fell 1.2 percent alongside a 1.7 percent drop in crude  prices. Most sectors ended well off their highs of the session.
"The day's market action has to be seen in the context of the recovery we've had year-to-date. Payrolls confirm the strength of the economy, but that strength is reflected in stock prices," said Sanchez, who helps oversee $16 billion in assets.
Separate data showed new orders for U.S. factory goods fell for a third straight month in October, pointing to a slowdown in manufacturing activity.
The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> rose 58.69 points, or 0.33 percent, to 17,958.79, the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 3.45 points, or 0.17 percent, to 2,075.37 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 11.32 points, or 0.24 percent, to 4,780.76.
For the week, the Dow rose 0.7 percent and the S&P rose 0.4 percent. It was the seventh straight weekly gain, a streak not seen in a year for both. The Nasdaq fell 0.2 percent on the week.
American Eagle Outfitters  fell 13.8 percent to $11.91 after the teen apparel retailer forecast a current-quarter profit below analysts' estimates and reported its fifth straight drop in quarterly income.

US-China climate deal a surprise for IndiaComments
United States and China's agreement to reduce carbon emissions would push countries like India to re-jig its climate strategy but it falls short of driving the world to an ambitious climate agreement in Paris by 2015.
The two biggest carbon emitters of the world - US and China - on Wednesday signed an agreement under which US will cut its emissions by 26-28% of 2005 levels by 2025, and China would peak its carbon emissions by 2030 along with generating 20% of its electricity from zero-emission sources.
The deal will also be a talking point at the G-20 summit in Australia starting from November 15. The European Union, which was first to announce emission cuts of 40% by 2030, has already welcomed the deal but the developing world, including India, was not enthused with the secret agreement, saying it was not enough to have a treaty in Paris to limit the increase in global temperature by 2 degrees by the turn of the century.
"The original base level for reducing emissions for rich nations was 1990 and not 2005 as announced by the US. If one makes calculations, the actual emission reduction by the US will be negligible to the 1990 level," a senior Indian climate negotiator said, who was unwilling to be quoted as India has not officially reacted on the deal.
The US promise, if delivered, would mean its carbon emissions would be at 1990 level, much higher than what it told the world when the Kyoto Protocol was agreed upon in 1998. The US eventually didn't sign the agreement as it failed to get it ratified by its Senate.
India which had indicated distancing itself from China in climate talks on insistence of Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu will now have to come up with an independent stand.
Terming the deal as "smart politics" by the G-2, Navroz K Dubash, a senior fellow at Centre for Policy Research said the reason for hope is that the move really infuses energy into the global process.
The environment ministry will be conducting a series of negotiations with experts from within and outside the government over the next week to strategise for the Lima Climate Summit.

64 percent say Obama is a liberalBy Aaron Blake November 12 Follow @aaronblakewp

President Obama's losses in the 2014 election come as an increasing number of Americans view him as a "liberal," according to a new post-election survey from the Public Religion Research Institute.
The poll shows 64 percent of Americans view Obama as a "liberal" — up from 57 percent after Obama's reelection two years ago and from 53 percent during the 2008 campaign. Another 19 percent say Obama is a "moderate," while 12 percent label him "conservative" or "very conservative."
Back in 2012, 27 percent viewed Obama as a moderate.
By comparison, fewer Americans — 52 percent — see Hillary Clinton qualifying as a liberal, while 54 percent call Mitt Romney a "conservative." Obama is also seen as slightly more ideological than former president George W. Bush, whom 61 percent of Americans define as a conservative.
 
But for Bush, just 12 percent say he's "very" conservative; for Obama, about one-third of Americans — 34 percent — say he's "very" liberal. And at the end of Bush's presidency, his "conservative" number -- 56 percent -- was lower than Obama's is today.
In fact, Obama scores more liberal than than the Democratic Party as a whole (62 percent "liberal," including 24 percent "very") and about as ideologically extreme as the tea party (60 percent "conservative," including 36 percent "very").
Obama's record in the Senate was one of the most liberal in the chamber, but he campaigned as a uniter who could bring together Republicans and Democrats.
Six years later, the former is the prevailing image of his presidency.

The gross things coworkers do in the bathroom stall next to you(Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)
Eat. Text. Not wash hands.
These are the activities that an unsettling percentage of people say they do in the bathroom at work, according to the 2014 Hygiene Matters Survey conducted for SCA, a Swedish-based global hygiene product company.
A business intelligence firm and research company did online polling of 13,000 people from 13 different countries, including a representative sample of 1,058 adults in the United States.
Their findings of American workplace bathroom habits  are a mixture of gross and sad:
10 percent said they only "sometimes" wash their hands after using the toilet, with 1 percent admitting they never do it. Please, for the love of all things, wash those hands!
25 percent said they have gone to the bathroom to text, while 23 percent said they did the same to talk on the phone. That's actually surprisingly low.
8 percent said they use their workplace bathrooms to eat. Um, eating literally anywhere else is less disgusting. Why would you do that to your food?
7 percent go to the bathroom to exercise. How big are these bathrooms?!
5 percent said they smoke in the bathroom, the same percentage that goes to their work bathrooms to sleep. Hopefully not at the same time.
Almost half of Americans don't ever wash their hands after arriving at work.
Globally, one in 10 adults said they've gone to their workplace bathrooms for "taking a break to cry" and 15 percent said they would actually tell co-workers that they had poor hygiene. (So any of you with running mental lists of people who don't wash their hands after using the toilet: Maybe it's time to call out those co-workers.)
As bad as Americans' habits may seem, people in other countries are way more unsatisfied with the state of their work toilets, especially in China and Italy. A majority of Russians also wish that their employers would pay more attention to bathrooms at work.
By comparison, Americans were the most satisfied with their work bathrooms — 87 percent said so.
And 13 percent of Americans said they actually preferred their work bathrooms to the ones they had a home. I'm certainly not one of those 13 percent; after seeing these numbers I'll stick to my bathroom at home, where people aren't eating and leaving with unwashed hands.

Watch out for these credit card problemsPrint
When it comes to financial matters, it is always better to be informed. After all, problems can arise mid-way and we may not know a way out.  
At times like this, don’t let a lack of knowledge or negligence cost you a hefty price. Here’s a list of the most common credit card issues and a way to resolve them.
1) Misplaced credit/debit card: Anyone can misplace a credit/debit card. And when this happens, immediately report it to your bank with a request to block the card. Not doing so can cost you heavily, because if someone uses your card before lodging the complaint, the loss is borne by you. In case, you’ve lost the PIN (personal Identification Number), write an application to the bank requesting them to issue a new PIN.
2) Card statements and ATM disputes: It may happen that your credit card statement contains incorrect charges or your ATM dysfunctions. For example, you could be charged twice for the same purchase or for an item you never purchased. Maybe, you failed to receive a credit card statement for the month altogether or that your ATM machine dispenses no money or dispenses a lesser amount. Don’t worry. Credit card companies and banks are liable to compensate this loss.  Always lodge a written complaint, and submit a photocopy of all receipts and bills. Don’t forget to mention your account number, credit/debit card number, and give precise timings for failed ATM transaction, if that be the case. If the bank keeps dilly dallying the issue for over a month, immediately write to the banking ombudsman, where banks have to report to for not resolving customer related banking issues.
3) Breach of consumer privacy: Banks are required to act as custodians of your personal information, but sometimes they may fail to do so. For example, they could issue unsolicited (not asked for) cards without taking your consent. This card could even be misused by a wrong person before reaching you. Sometimes, a bank could offer unsolicited loans and credit facilities without taking consent or unilaterally upgrade your credit card and enhance credit card limits. You could then be charged for these.
If you’re billed for any unsolicited payments from a card, the bank has to reverse the charge. They may also have to pay a penalty, which could be twice the value of the charge reversed. You should also receive compensation for time lost, expenses incurred and the mental anguish suffered, according to the Banking Ombudsman Scheme, 2006.
4) Persistent phone calls despite the ‘Do Not Call’ request: For random marketing calls, file a written complaint with the bank. Every bank has to maintain a ‘DO NOT CALL’ registry, where they register names of people who do not wish to receive any product marketing calls from the bank.

Dear Sir,
I value your inputs on Dynemic Products but will you let me know is there any scalability for this Co?
Where do you see the sales of Dynemic Product reaching in couple of yrs time...!
Have a look at Tirupati Inks.
Sales 336 cr last year, Mcap is just 35 cr,produces Inks for packagings in different manner suitable to the vendor.
Last eps was 4.88 and available at just at p/e of 3!
And topline is moving up every year.
As investors are buying stocks in e-comm play like Gati, Snowmen Ligistic, Sical Logistic, and packaging Co like Majushree Plantation, Moldtek Pack,I think the producer of INK for packaging material will and should have a place in them as well.....

(1)  When Avanti Feeds was quoting around Rs.20, if someone mentioned that it might breach Rs.2,000 (100 bagger) in 5 years, he would have spent the rest of his life in a mental asylum !!! Dynemic (the spelling is correct !) has a similar potential. It has, among others, USFDA certification for its 2 plants and most products. 70% of its TO is exports. It has paid dividends w/o a break for over 10 years. It is growing 30% every year. It has all the trappings of a multi-bagger in the making. It needed a YP to draw this gem to my attention and I will always acknowledge this fact.

The Story Of A Surgeon Who Enlisted At Age 61 Following His Sons Death In Iraqreddit

As soon as Bill Krissoff glanced out the front window during breakfast to see who had rung his doorbell at eight on a Saturday morning, he knew. Three Marines, ramrod straight in their dress blues, stood next to an Army chaplain.
Nate, Krissoff's elder son, twenty-five years old, had deployed to Iraq with an elite reconnaissance battalion as a first lieutenant in the Marine Corps.
"We regret to inform you," one of the Marines began saying once Krissoff opened the door. He doesn't remember the rest. His head spinning, his body seized with shock, he stumbled through the house to wake up Christine, his wife. Soon they were sitting together on a living room sofa as the Marines explained, with grim solemnity, what had occurred a half day earlier half a world away from their home in Reno, Nevada.
Nathan M. Krissoff, a counterintelligence specialist, had been returning to his base from a village near Fallujah when his Humvee drove over a bomb buried in a dry riverbed. The brunt of the blast hit the vehicle's right side. Nate had been in the right rear seat.
The Marines sat stoically, awaiting the next question Bill or Christine would ask.
The Krissoffs wanted to call their other son, Austin, at the Marine Corps' Officer Candidates School in Quantico, Virginia.
Less than three years younger than Nate, he was following his brother's trail from an elite prep school in Pebble Beach, California, to a small New England liberal arts college, and then into military service.
The Krissoffs aren't one of those families in which every male for the last four generations has worn a uniform. Bill, who came of age during the Vietnam War, wasn't drafted and didn't volunteer. Nate hadn't been on the military track. In high school, he wrote poetry, played in the school symphony, and enjoyed wild-water kayaking. At Williams College in Massachusetts, which doesn't have an Army or Marine ROTC program, he captained the swim team and majored in political science.
Then came September 11, 2001. He was a junior. The father of his best friend on the swim team, a New York banker, did nothing for six weeks but go to funerals. Nate's carefree ways began to turn more serious. A year after he graduated, he applied for a job with the CIA. At his interview, the recruiter was impressed with Nate's education and aptitude but urged him to get some seasoning before pursuing such a career. Crestfallen, Nate contacted a friend from Williams who had become a Marine intelligence officer. If he wanted seasoning, his friend said, the Marines would give it to him.
In June 2004, as the Iraq war was becoming ever more perilous for American troops, Nate told his father that he wanted to become a Marine officer. Bill was more than a little apprehensive.
"Do you fully understand what this means?" he asked his son. "Do you understand the risk?"
Nate said he did.
Three months later, Nate was marching across the parade field at Quantico, a newly commissioned second lieutenant. Bill and Christine sat in the bleachers, as proud as the other parents, but understandably anxious. This is the real deal, Bill thought to himself as he watched his lanky son in the distance, standing at attention, his thick, dark hair shorn into a Marine-regulation high-and-tight buzz cut under his cap.
But before Nate could be called into a battle zone, there would be Basic School, where he was taught the art and science of leading Marines. Then intelligence school. Then an assignment on Okinawa. It was there that he talked his way into an Iraq deployment with the Third Reconnaissance Battalion.
As he headed to Iraq in September 2006, he sent an e-mail to his parents and Austin, who had graduated from college and was preparing to enter Marine officer school.
Almost five years to the day after September 11, 2001, I have the chance to put my money where my mouth is in terms of service ... I'm constantly reminded of that famous quote from Tom Hanks' character at the end of Saving Private Ryan: "Earn this." Earning it will mean sacrifice, determination, doing my job to the best of my ability. I chose this, and I wouldn't have it any other way.
The complexities of the conflict and the shifting perceptions of the world are all but totally irrelevant to the fact that we fight for the men at our side; my success will be gauged by the responsibility to safeguard Marines and accomplish the mission, not by any other metric. I'm lucky to be deploying with such a phenomenal, savvy group of guys.
Several weeks later, Nate wrote to Austin, who had started school at Quantico, with a description of an attack that killed Sergeant Jonathan J. Simpson, a much-admired member of the recon battalion.
Why do I tell you this? Because Sgt. Simpson and many all-Americans like him are the ones you will be entrusted to lead, protect and stand in front of. Never forget that all the trials and training you and the other candidates (eventually Second Lieutenants) go through is not about you. America's sons and daughters will be entrusted to your care. You owe them competence, discipline, courage, judgment, etc. Post Sgt. Simpson's memorial picture, perhaps up on your squad bay read-board, tell your fire team and squad and platoon about him -- as a clear reminder of what this is all about. Keep it with you through the trials ahead. Because when you hear the final roll call, the long bugle playing taps, and the bagpipes wailing -- we better have done everything short of the hand of God Himself to accomplish the mission and bring Marines home. It is a sacrifice he and many like him have made fighting for each other. Earn it.
When Nate became the 2,924th American service member killed in Operation Iraqi Freedom on December 9, 2006, Austin was almost finished with officer school. He wanted to stay with his training platoon, "the only people," he thought, "who understood what happened." But the staff at Quantico put him on a flight to Reno.
His mother hoped he would reconsider his decision to be a Marine -- the service offered him the choice of walking away because he was his parents' only surviving child -- but he would not change his mind. Nate "would have wanted nothing more than for me to carry on the mission," he said. But to partly assuage his mother's concerns, he decided that instead of going into the infantry as he had planned, he would specialize in intelligence, as his brother had, though in a noncombat role. A week after he arrived in Reno, he was commissioned as an officer in a low-key swearing-in at his parents' house.
On the Saturday before Christmas, the Krissoffs held a memorial service for Nate in Reno. White-gloved Marines hoisted a flag-draped coffin containing an urn with Nate's cremated ashes. The national anthem was played. A teacher at Nate's high school recalled his warmth, his love of literature, and his mischievous side. "As a young man Nate was, indeed, Dickens' Pip, Salinger's Holden, and Twain's Huck. But he was also Ferris Bueller." A friend from Williams described him as "goofy, hilarious, and charismatic on the outside but disciplined, insightful, and focused on the inside." Captain Michael Dubrule, who had led Nate through intelligence training, told the mourners that Nate skillfully collected information to help save the lives of American troops and innocent Iraqis. "I want you all to know that Nate died doing what he loved, leading men in combat, saving lives, and making a difference in the lives of so many," Dubrule said. "No greater epitaph can be written, no greater sacrifice can be made."
After a few weeks, Bill threw himself back into his work as an orthopedic surgeon. Chris joined him in the office, where she ran the business side of his solo practice. He returned to the operating theater. Grief welled inside him, but his skill as a physician was undiminished. Soon, however, treating busted shoulders and bum knees -- as he had for twenty-eight years -- began to feel unfulfilling. One day that spring, a patient came in complaining of minor knee pain, the sort of ache that would go away with some rest or a varied workout routine.
Why, Bill thought, am I spending my time hearing people complain about nothing?
A few months later, Nate's battalion commander, Lieutenant Colonel William Seely, traveling the country to visit the parents of his fallen Marines, came to see the Krissoff family. Bill and Austin took him for a hike around Lake Tahoe's Emerald Bay, and Bill asked Seely about medical care for Marines in Iraq. Seely told him that every Marine battalion deploys with a surgeon and numerous medics, all from the Navy. As Seely described the role of the battalion surgeon, the penny dropped for Bill.
That's what I want to do, he thought. I want to be a battalion surgeon.
Bill was as lean as his boys. He stayed fit by biking, hiking, kayaking, and skiing. He figured he could meet the military's physical requirements, so he called up a Navy recruiter in San Francisco and offered up his services. The recruiter posed a series of questions. Finally, he asked how old Bill was.
"Sixty," Bill said.
"Um, that's a problem," the recruiter replied. "You're too old." Anyone over forty-two who wants to join the Navy Reserve medical corps needs an age waiver, the recruiter explained. He wasn't optimistic about the possibility of a sixty-year-old obtaining one.
Undeterred, Krissoff called an Air Force recruiter. He got a similar answer. So he went back to treating sore knees.
That August, he and Christine received a voice-mail message from a White House aide inviting them to meet with President George W. Bush after he spoke to an American Legion convention in Reno the following week. They attended the speech with Austin, standing in the back and laughing at the president's self-deprecating humor. As the president was concluding his remarks, they were ushered into a small room with several other families. All of them were "gold star" parents and siblings, those who had lost sons or daughters, brothers or sisters, in Iraq or Afghanistan.
Bush strode in a few minutes later and shook everyone's hand. He spoke at length about the war, explaining his strategy and lauding the sacrifice of his audience's fallen relatives. The Krissoffs listened intently. Iraq was being torn apart by a civil war. U.S. troops were getting attacked daily. Hundreds of Americans had come back in caskets since Nate's final journey home. The war had become deeply unpopular: fewer than four in ten Americans still believed it was worth fighting. When Bush asked for questions or comments, Bill spoke up. He knew what had driven Nate to join the Marines, to find his way to Iraq. He didn't want his son to have died in vain.
"Let's stay the course," he told the president.
Bush approached each family individually and asked if there was anything he could do to help them. Several made small requests for assistance in dealing with death-benefits paperwork. An aide dutifully jotted notes.
Then Bush walked over to the Krissoffs and posed the same question.
"Yes, sir. There is one thing," Bill said. "I want to join the Navy medical corps and serve, but they told me I was too old. No disrespect, but I'm younger than you are."
Bush's eyes widened. He looked at Christine.
"What does Mom think?"
Christine said she and Bill had talked about his desire to serve.
She wasn't thrilled with the prospect of his traveling to a war zone, but she wouldn't stand in the way if going might help her husband heal. "I'm on board with it," she said.
Bush turned to Austin, who had driven up from Camp Pendleton to accompany his parents to the meeting. He was skeptical, but he, too, didn't want to sabotage his father's quest. "He'll be pretty good out there," he told the president.
Bush said he would be meeting with General Peter Pace, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in two days and would mention Krissoff's request. He summoned Karl Rove, one of his top aides, to collect the necessary information from Bill.
"I'll see what I can do," Bush said.
Three days after meeting Bush, Krissoff received a phone call from the same Navy recruiter who had scoffed at his request to join a few months earlier. "I have orders to meet with you by the end of the day," the recruiter said. When Krissoff replied that he was trailering a horse with his wife and could not immediately drive down to San Francisco -- three hours away by car -- the recruiter was undeterred. "I'm coming up to see you," he said.
Krissoff took the recruiter to dinner, filled out a stack of paperwork -- and waited. A month later, he got word that he had been accepted into the Navy Reserve for his dream assignment: a Marine Corps medical battalion.
Although he was required to train once a month, Krissoff treated his reserve duties as a full-time job. For him, joining the military wasn't about wearing a uniform and attending to Marines on the home front. He wanted to go to Iraq, as Nate had done and Austin would be doing soon. And that meant spending as much time as possible learning how to be a combat physician. He had decades of medical experience, but none of that involved treating blast wounds.
He and his wife moved to the San Diego area in early 2008 so he could be closer to the Navy hospital on the Marine Corps air base in Miramar, where he signed up for every combat-medicine course he could take. He traveled to Morocco that summer to participate in a military exercise during which he practiced working in a field hospital. He attended advanced workshops at an Army hospital in Texas, and he joined Marines on heart-thumping hikes through the rocky Southern California hills to prove to superiors a generation younger that he could withstand the rigors of deployment.
When his training felt grueling, he thought back to a letter Nate had written while he was at officer school:
0 dark 30. 4:30 a.m. Then it began. Platoon staff formally introduced us and then took charge. Imagine tables flipping, chairs getting thrown against walls, instructors screaming. A volume that shocks the body. PT has been harder than any work I've done in my life ... Pain is constant here. Honor, sacrifice, integrity aren't just fairytale phrases. They're earned every day in sweat, tears, blood, etc., by these people. The values of the USMC are one of a kind. Keep shit straight ... The more you sweat in peace, the less you bleed in war.
Austin, who was stationed at Pendleton at the time, came by to watch his father put on his uniform. "He'd shake his head and redo everything," Bill said with a chuckle.
Bill Krissoff and his son Nate.
Eighteen months after meeting President Bush, in February 2009, Bill Krissoff arrived in Iraq -- as a lieutenant commander in the Navy -- to spend seven months treating orthopedic injuries at a field hospital on the sprawling al-Taqaddum Air Base near Fallujah, less than ten miles from where Nate had been killed.
For Bill, the decision to go to war at sixty-two had nothing to do with seeking closure after his son's death. The term itself provoked him. "'Closure' is for somebody else," he said. "That's not for people who have lost sons and daughters. Your life has changed. Forever changed ... You don't just have closure and move on with your life."
Shuttering his lucrative medical practice, joining the Navy, and deploying to the western Iraqi desert was about "turning that loss into something positive." Nate's commitment to service -- to his nation, to his fellow Marines -- and Austin's decision to follow in his brother's path had not just filled Bill with pride. Their devotion had humbled him. As he took stock of his life in the bleak months after losing Nate, he concluded that he needed to be more like his boys. He possessed skills that could help save lives and limbs in a land of IEDs. He needed to put himself to better use, even if it meant leaving his luxurious home, his comfortable job, his devoted wife.
"In most cases, fathers inspire sons," he said. "In this case, sons inspire Dad."
By the time Bill reached Iraq, the war was winding down. Sunni Muslim tribesmen in Fallujah, Ramadi, and across the western desert, once mortal enemies of the United States, were now collaborating with the Marines to beat back al-Qaeda militants. The hospital at al-Taqaddum, which had been among the busiest trauma centers in the country just two years earlier, could go a full week without a serious casualty. Bill found himself treating sore knees and shoulders, just as he had back home, and teaching young corpsmen how to attend to orthopedic wounds. He had time to visit Austin, who was stationed at another large Marine base in western Iraq.
When Bill returned home that fall, his wife and son assumed his thirst for deployment had been satiated. They knew he wouldn't be going back to his Reno practice, but they expected him to transition to full-time work at the Pendleton hospital, which he did -- for a few weeks. Then he got word that a position was open on the next rotation of doctors to Afghanistan. The captain in charge, one of the pioneers of combat surgery, wanted Krissoff to join him. Bill hadn't even unpacked his bags from Iraq.
"I know I've been gone, but this is probably an opportunity that won't come up again," he told Christine. "I'm not getting any younger. And I'm all trained up."
She looked him in the eyes. "Well," she said, "you better go."
*
Krissoff began work at the main trauma center at Camp Bastion, in southwestern Afghanistan, in February 2010, the same month Marines commenced a bloody assault on Marjah, a Taliban sanctuary riddled with snipers and makeshift antipersonnel mines. His first case was a triple amputee. Over the next seven months, he would serve as the primary or assisting surgeon on 225 serious casualties. He lost count of the number of amputations he performed.
He had expected a caseload unlike anything he had experienced in the civilian world -- before joining the military, he had performed only one multiple amputation in his career, on a drunk who had fallen onto a train track -- but nothing could have prepared him for the frequency of horrific injuries that rolled through the trauma bay doors at the hospital at Camp Bastion. There were times when all five operating tables were in use, and Krissoff had to scurry among them. He and his fellow doctors once performed twenty-four surgeries in a single day. "All you're thinking about is how to patch them up," he said. "You're cranking."
Back then, Afghanistan was an orthopedic surgeon's war. In the southern deserts that were the focus of President Obama's troop surge, the Taliban's weapon of choice was a five-liter plastic jug packed with homemade, fertilizer-based explosives, buried in the ground and triggered with a balsa-wood pressure plate. It was crude but ingenious: because the only metal parts in the device were tiny pieces of wire, it was nearly invisible to American bomb detectors. If a U.S. or Afghan trooper stepped on one, the force of the explosion was usually enough to sever a leg or two, and perhaps an arm.
A generation ago, such wounds were often fatal. By 2010, however, all U.S. service members in that part of Afghanistan kept two or more tourniquets affixed to their ballistic vests, allowing comrades to stanch the bleeding from severed limbs. Medical evacuation helicopters would bring the wounded to Camp Bastion in less than an hour. Then the really difficult work would begin: agonizing about where to amputate; cauterizing blood vessels; searching for shrapnel inside the abdomen; combating infections; trying to ensure young men would be capable of fathering a child when they healed. If a patient arrived at the Camp Bastion hospital with a heartbeat, he or she had a 97 percent chance of surviving.
When he wasn't working shifts that could stretch to sixteen hours, depending on the pace of medevac choppers alighting at the hospital's landing pad, Krissoff slept in a tent he shared with ten other medical personnel. He didn't have more than a few days off in seven months.
"There wasn't any 'No, I'm not doing that today. I'm off.' Everybody just works when you need help."
Despite the intensity and privation, the daily exposure to the horrors of war, those seven months were the most rewarding time in Krissoff's three-decade-long orthopedic career. It wasn't the challenge or the adventure. It was about the Marines and others in his care. He chatted up those who could talk, reveling in their stories.
He treated one sergeant who had been shot in the arm in Marjah and was missing a chunk of his bicep. "Doc," the Marine told him, "you need to know one thing: I returned fire." Krissoff cleaned out the bullet hole -- it was the simplest case he had treated in weeks -- and told the Marine he'd be sent home. "What do you mean 'home'?" the Marine said. "I'm going back to my unit."
To minimize the chance of infection, military doctors prefer to leave many wounds open for several days, with just a gauze cover, as opposed to stitching them up right away. Krissoff struck a deal with the Marine: once he closed the wound, the Marine could return to Marjah.
A few weeks later, Krissoff treated another Marine from the same unit. "How's that sergeant doing?" he asked.
"He got shot again -- this time, in the hip," the other Marine said. "But he got treated in Kandahar, and he's back on duty again."
Where do we get these guys? Krissoff thought. He's a war fighter. He's not going to give up. He's not going home. His guys are still there. You can't explain that to most civilians.
Marines who learned Krissoff's story would come up to thank him in the dining hall. He'd always turn it around. "Thank you for what you are doing," he'd often say. "Your service humbles me."
Military doctors in field hospitals are loath to take sole credit for treating patients. "It's a team effort. You don't do this stuff by yourself," Krissoff said. But senior officers familiar with his work readily volunteer what he is too modest to divulge: he led or assisted surgical teams that saved dozens of American, British, and Afghan lives.
"He made an enormous contribution," said Stephen F. McCartney, a now-retired Navy captain who served as the command surgeon to the Marine brigade in southwestern Afghanistan when Krissoff began his deployment. McCartney said Krissoff's age was an invaluable asset. "He brought experience and judgment that can only come with many years of practicing medicine," McCartney said.
Major General Larry Nicholson, who had been Nate's regimental commander in Iraq, served as the top Marine general in southern Afghanistan for the initial months of Krissoff's time at the Camp Bastion hospital. "Bill made a difference for good every day," said Nicholson. "There can be no greater act of love by a father for his fallen son than to take his place in the ranks in the midst of war."
*
For James Raffetto, as for so many of those who wound up on Krissoff's operating table, it was horrible luck that got him there. A single footfall on a bit of earth in southern Afghanistan that was home to a bomb.
Raffetto was a strapping, Pennsylvania-raised Navy medic. Not a medical doctor like Krissoff, but a corpsman. He traveled with elite reconnaissance Marines in the field -- as Nate had -- treating wounds until the medevac birds arrived. His platoon had been patrolling a small desert village used by the Taliban as a staging area for attacks on Marine units based in nearby farming communities. It had been an easy day. The houses suspected to be insurgent hideouts were empty, and residents had been willing to talk to the Marines. (Taliban intimidation usually tied their tongues.) One father even asked Raffetto to examine his sick daughter.
As they departed from the last insurgent compound, Raffetto spotted a box of gauze on the ground. Ah, this must be a Taliban field hospital, he thought. He took a step toward the box, and the ground rose with an earsplitting boom. He flew into the air. A second later, he slammed into the ground facedown. He tried to turn over, but he couldn't. As he winced in pain, a platoon mate flipped him on his back. Raffetto opened his eyes and looked down.
Left leg gone.
Left arm dangling by a tendon.
Right arm intact, but battered and bleeding.
"Doc," one of the Marines called out, "tell us what to do."
Raffetto knew that if he was to survive, he needed to cut off the blood gushing from his limbs. With his right hand, he grabbed a tourniquet off his ballistic vest and wrapped it around his left arm above the elbow. Then he directed his comrades to do the same for his legs, and to shoot him up with morphine.
They strapped a standard-issue nylon and plastic tourniquet on his left thigh. Then they tried to do the same on his right side. But so much of his leg was gone that they needed to cinch the band near his hip, at the widest part of his meaty thigh. The tourniquet broke. As did a second one. As death from blood loss grew imminent, a quick-thinking sergeant took off his canvas belt and pulled it around Raffetto's thigh. Then he grabbed a spare machine gun barrel, pushed it between the belt and the leg, and twisted it around to tighten the belt and cut off the flow of blood.
Through it all, Raffetto remained conscious.
I'm fucked up, he thought, but I don't think I'm gonna die.
As they waited for the medevac chopper, he joked with his buddies, who knelt around him. "Survive!" he said to them -- and himself -- doing his best to imitate Sergeant Lincoln Osiris in the movie farce Tropic Thunder. And he asked them to give a message to his wife. "Tell Emily I love her."
A British evacuation helicopter arrived in less than fifteen minutes. As Raffetto was hoisted aboard, the flight nurse asked him how he felt.
What a charming accent, he thought. Then he passed out.
When Raffetto arrived at the Camp Bastion hospital, Krissoff didn't know where to begin. He had seen terrible trauma, but nothing like this. His patient was a pile of bloodied flesh atop a gurney.
"This guy is in bad shape," he muttered to himself. Treating such grievous wounds sometimes prompted a quiet doubt. What are we doing? Are we saving people who are going to have no life? But he pushed the thought out of his head. Here was a fellow American. A sailor. A young man who had volunteered to serve his nation. Krissoff vowed to do all he could to save the patient.
He and his fellow physicians sealed off blood vessels. They cleaned the exposed tissue. They sought to salvage as much of Raffetto's right hand as possible.
A day later, Raffetto was bundled on a C-17 transport aircraft and flown to the Army's hospital in Landstuhl, Germany, and then on to the Navy's medical center in Bethesda. Unlike Krissoff's patients in the civilian world, whom he would check up on in the days after surgery, he knew he would not see Raffetto again. That was true of most of his patients. Did they bounce back quickly? Suffer more complications? Succumb to the injuries? He usually had no idea.
A little more than a year later, after Krissoff had returned to his home in Rancho Santa Fe, California, he tracked down Raffetto's phone number. When he called, Raffetto's wife, Emily, picked up. They had been married for just four months before James deployed. But she never wavered when he returned to America covered in bandages, connected to half a dozen tubes, and missing three limbs. She remained by his side as he convalesced in Bethesda for two years, first as an inpatient and later as a daily member of the rehabilitation center, where he was fitted with prosthetics and slowly, painfully learned to walk again.
Krissoff asked Emily if he could talk to his former patient.
"I'm sure he'd like to," she replied. "But we're on our way to renew our vows."
Later that afternoon, clad in his Navy dress uniform, Raffetto walked down the aisle with his bride.
Eventually, doctor and patient did connect. When they did, Raffetto told Krissoff that he was learning to drive a handicap-enabled truck and looking for work.
"You're just amazing," Krissoff told him.
"Thanks to you," Raffetto replied.
Krissoff began calling periodically. It wasn't medical curiosity that drove him to keep in touch. He admired the young man's perseverance, his don't-dwell-on-the-negative attitude. As Raffetto shared milestones in his recovery -- landing a full-time job with the federal government, fending for himself for three weeks while Emily was on a trip to Europe -- Krissoff's cheers were valuable reminders to Raffetto that he wasn't just healing, he was thriving.
As amazed as Krissoff was at Raffetto's recovery, Raffetto was similarly awed as he came to learn Bill's story through their calls.
"To join the military at sixty -- wow," Raffetto said as he zipped through his kitchen in a power-assisted wheelchair. "And not like he tried, someone said no, and he said, 'Well, all right.'"
Raffetto pulled up to his dining table and thought for a moment.
"You can be a war hero even if you never fired a weapon in combat," he said. "What he did -- now, that's uncommon valor."

Kohli to play with a lighter batMore
Kohli to use lighter bats in Australia
The sweet spot in these bats is slightly higher to tackle more bounce in Australia. Oldstyle pads will provide better grip.

Kohli going light Down Under.New Delhi: To tackle the extra pace and bounce of Australian pitches on the upcoming tour, Virat Kohli will be using lighter bats and, for the first time in Test matches, will wear old-fashioned leg guards with steel buckles that provide better grip.
The stand-in India captain will be carrying about 10 bats, six of them new, customised with the ‘sweet spot’ shifted to the middle, ahead of the four-Test series beginning in Brisbane on December 4.
Kohli, 26, will also use specially made batting gloves to get a firm hold on the thin bat handle that helps him play those blistering cover drives, which make him one of the most feared batsmen in the world.
The only time the Delhi batsman has played Tests in Australia was in 2011-12, when he took time to find his form in testing conditions. In the four Tests, he tallied 300 runs, scoring a solitary century in the last match in Adelaide.
With changes in his gear specifications, he aims to do better this time around.
Kohli’s new bats are made out of top quality English willow, and are about 15 grams lighter than those that he’s using in the ongoing home ODI series against Sri Lanka, disclosed Aneesh Gautam, vice-president of Cornerstone Sport & Entertainment Pvt. Ltd, the company that manages the player.
“For the Test matches, he uses a lighter bat which is around 1,140gm to 1,150gm and for one-dayers, he uses bats weighing 1,150gm to 1,160gm. For the Tests in Australia, I’ve got these bats made 10gm to 15gm lighter than what he was using in Tests in India,” Gautam, who has been working with Kohli for three years, told Mail Today.
There’s no change in Kohli’s bats for the one-dayers.
“Virat wants light bats that have good pick-up, and I select the willow for them in a factory in Meerut. When he plays in India or in the other Asian countries, the sweet spot is lower down the bat and the bottom part is heavy,” Gautam, who has been managing players’ gear for about 20 years, pointed out.
“For the Australian tour, the ‘sweet spot’ in the bats is slightly on the higher side as the ball climbs on to the bat because of the bouncy pitches there.” Gautam said Kohli would see the new bats after the ODIs against Sri Lanka.
“He’ll be carrying eight to 10 bats to Australia. I’ve got eight bats made for him. Out of these, there’ll be taking five to six new ones that I got made yesterday and about three of his old bats that he’s using currently. I’ll keep the rest as back-up,” he said.
“Out of thousands of willows I select one, and it takes me almost two days to do that and the carpenter a whole day to make one bat,” he said.
Kohli will be using old-fashioned pads with buckles in Australia, and he is trying them out in the ongoing ODI series.
“The reason is that they give a better, firm grip [on his legs] and they don’t shift while with Velcro one has to stick and stretch it and, at times, it comes off the pads. Buckled pads are long-lasting and can go for four or five series, and Virat is very comfortable with them. But it’ll be the first time he’ll be using them in Tests,” Gautam said.
Kohli’s gloves, too, are customised, and the palm area is made of petard sheep leather. A fibre sheet is inserted in the leather, providing a very firm grip on the thin handle, while there’s good protection for all 10 fingers.

Arizona Threatened To Search Pro-Choice Advocate s HomeArizona Threatened To Search Pro-Choice Advocate's Home
Posted:
reddit
Last month, Kat Sabine received a letter from Arizona Department of Health Services that she found deeply troubling. The letter alleged that she was providing healthcare services in her private home without a license, and notified her that government officials could come to investigate.
But Sabine doesn’t practice medicine. She’s the executive director of NARAL Pro-Choice Arizona, a political organization that advocates for reproductive rights but does not perform any medical services, including abortions.
“It seemed to me this is an intentional effort by people in the Department of Health to target me because of the work I do,” Sabine told The Huffington Post.
The letter Sabine received said that health officials had “received a complaint alleging that you are providing services that would indicate you need to be licensed as a healthcare facility.” (The agency offers online complaint forms .) The letter did not specify what those services were.
The letter, which Sabine provided to The Huffington Post, included a list of licensing exemptions that she could fill out. But the letter is missing the last exemption included in the Arizona statute , which seems to apply to NARAL: “Community education, advocacy or recovery support groups that are not owned or operated by or contracted to provide services with a healthcare institution.”
The Arizona Department of Health Services did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
The issue of state health officials investigating abortion clinics came under scrutiny earlier this year, when Republican Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer signed a law that allows DHS officials to conduct unannounced inspections of abortion clinics without a warrant, like they can do with other kinds of health facilities.
Cynde Cerf, a spokesperson for Planned Parenthood Arizona, said the organization has had three warrantless inspections at clinics that provide abortion and two such inspections at health centers that do not provide abortions since the law was implemented in July.
"It appears that they [DHS] are certainly much more conservative in how they're handling health centers,” Cerf said. However, Emily Wood, a spokesperson for Desert Star Family Planning, which also provides abortions, said the center hasn't "really experienced any problems” under the new rules.
Nonetheless, on Oct. 22, Daniel Pochoda, senior counsel for the ACLU of Arizona, wrote a letter to the Arizona Department of Health, noting that “any search of Ms. Sabine’s home by surveyors would constitute an unreasonable search in violation of Ms. Sabine’s rights under the Fourth Amendment.” The ACLU has since made a public records request to get more transparency about how DHS fields licensing complaints.
On Nov. 4, Connie Belden, bureau chief of the Bureau of Medical Facilities Licensing, wrote to the ACLU to let them know that the department had closed out the complaint. “We have made a note of the organization’s role and that it does not meet the definition of a healthcare institution,” she wrote. (Belden did not respond to a request for comment.)
Sabine found the response frustrating.
“There should be a process in place by which spurious accusations and claims about individuals should be stopped,” Sabine said. “Who in the Department of Health thought it was good idea to pursue my home?”

Spotify CEO Pushes Back Against Taylor Swift s Claimsreddit
Spotify's CEO on Tuesday defended his streaming service in the wake of some pretty harsh comments from current pop goddess Taylor Swift.
Swift pulled her music from Spotify last week.  "I'm not willing to contribute my life's work to an experiment that I don't feel fairly compensates the writers, producers, artists, and creators of this music," she said in an interview last week.
Spotify's chief executive Daniel Ek took issue with Swift's claims, writing that Spotify has paid labels and publishers $2 billion since 2008.
"When I hear stories about artists and songwriters who say they’ve seen little or no money from streaming and are naturally angry and frustrated, I’m really frustrated too," Ek writes.
He says that an artist like Swift (mega huge pop-star) would be on track to earn more than $6 million this year via Spotify.
Ek compares Spotify to good old-fashioned terrestrial radio. If a song is played on a moderately-sized U.S. radio station, around 500,000 people hear it and the label makes no money, he says. Labels and publishers make between $3,000 and $4,000 for 500,000 plays on Spotify, he explains.
Spotify has said that it pays rights holders between $0.006 and $0.0084 each time a song is played. The company pays 70 percent of its revenue to rights holders and keeps 30 percent.
The comparison seems spot-on (yes we punned there), but consider that streaming is gradually taking over as our preferred way of listening to music. People are listening to Spotify instead of paying for music. On-demand streaming (like Spotify) was up 42 percent in the first half of 2013 while digital song sales fell 13 percent. So this cheaper system isn't really competing with terrestrial radio but with a service like iTunes, where artists are generally better compensated.
Swift is hardly the only artist calling out Spotify: Musicians say that they're paid incredibly little from streaming sites, even when their songs are popular. Musician Damon Krukowski of Galaxie 500 and Damon & Naomi wrote an essay for Pitchfork a few years ago saying that each writer of Galaxie 500's song "Tugboat" was paid 35 cents for the 5,960 times it was played on Spotify.
Ek says that Spotify shouldn't be Swift's enemy, piracy should be. Her new album was the most popular one on Pirate Bay last week, he writes. Yet, the decision to remove her music from Spotify has clearly worked out for Swift, though. "1989" was the first platinum album of 2014 , selling 1.287 million copies in its debut week.

Social Media and the Introverted Leaderreddit
The building conversation about introverts in the business world strikes a chord. Though few who have met me in person would guess it, I am one, with a capital "I." Interestingly (and fortunately), using social media has been key for finding the balance that lets me think, work and connect most productively. Thanks to this tool, my ability to build a profile in my particular focus area, sustainability, is not hindered by the fact that I live in "remote" Seattle (compared to cities like NYC, Boston or San Francisco, I mean).
Even with my strong introvert tendencies, I still feel very connected the 70 percent of time I'm alone in my office working. From my social media dashboard, I can "talk" with and learn from many smart thinkers, gather information and develop authentic relationships that also make my 30 percent "in public" time productive and rewarding both personally and professionally.
Still, as Susan Cain has written in her fantastic book, Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking -- and as the many more introverts who have gone public since she (bravely) raised the issue have experienced for themselves -- extroversion is more culturally accepted. The woman who wrote this piece on President Obama's introversion put it well:
"I understand the judgments extroverts often make about us. I too thought there was something wrong with me as I recoiled from what felt like the mania of others. Until I was able to learn to value introversion, I thought of myself as lazy, disengaged and an observer rather than a participant. That's what it means to be an introvert in a culture where being social and outgoing are prized above all else."
Introversion As Weakness
Take that up a notch when you start to look at what culture expects of a business leader. Most leaders' schedules are full of meetings, speaking engagements, traveling and socializing, but do not include much time for being alone to process and/or to simply think. If it doesn't look or measure as action, it is perceived as less than productive. Still, there is a whole group of people who struggle with these expectations and on whose wisdom and leadership capabilities the world is potentially missing out. Integrating introverts and celebrating their strengths should be part of that "diversity" we are ever more intently seeking (if business media and conference coverage of that topic is any indication).
Though questions of race, gender and sexual preference are far from resolved, at least (I think), our culture is softening toward a new and better situation (see the increasing discussion around getting more women on corporate boards , and note Tim Cook's recent announcement ).
Yet, introversion has not yet even made that diversity checklist (and that has inspired a revolution Cain is now spearheading). Perhaps it seems like some sort of attitude problem that any dedicated professional could "work on" to "overcome" more than a deep seeded cultural problem. But, an almost institutionalized cultural problem it is.
With all of these -- race, gender, sexual preference and introversion/extroversion -- striving for diversity is about combining different worldviews, experiences and backgrounds, not about diluting the combination of those into one big soup. So, knowing that all of these diversity issues, but perhaps introversion even more, can involve long haul transitions, what can help introverted business leaders -- right now -- to leverage their natural ways in developing their careers and sharing their wisdom?
Enter Social Media
The way I see it, the power in using social media well may prove to be a bigger bonus for introverted leaders than the traditionally extroverted ones (who may more naturally use social media, but with less intention). If introverts value authenticity and getting to know a few people well versus collecting a lot of acquaintances and knowing them not-so-well; and, if they are a bit more strategic in how they use their time, getting comfortable using social media can truly forward the values, wisdom and causes of leaders who happen to be somewhere along the more "quiet" spectrum. The tools and tips are out there for everyone, but business leading introverts should have more motivation to get comfortable and savvy with the practice of social media engagement. They have to counter a culture, as it were. And, engaging with social media helps us introverts build trusted connections and have deeper conversations, even with the limited amount of time we can be "out there" online or off.
Whether introvert or extrovert, by using social media, you can more intentionally:
Create and manage expectations of when and how long you will be "on" any particular network
Engage when you are on a network, and not be blindsided/interrupted when you prefer to be "off"
Build trust through intimate one-on-one relationships
Decide which conversations to join
Plan for purposeful real-life meetings/engagement at conferences
Focus in on exactly the topics that most energize you (and that you have the most to contribute to)
Walk away from it altogether whenever you need down time
Create and curate content and conversations that have personal meaning or business value
Energy-sapping things introverts can avoid by using social media:
Having to be out and about - in real life - too much
Superficial conversations
Spending time on topics that don't forward the learning/growth you seek
Building followers for the sake of the number
Trying to be more "social" as an obligation
Hmmm... Wouldn't that sound great to anyone - introvert or extrovert (or anywhere in between)?
Ultimately, social media engagement is an amazingly powerful and rewarding way to build powerful and authentic social capital .
The Introvert's Advantage
Introversion is not about being aloof or anti-social, even if it may sometimes appear that way (as per the continuing perception of President Obama). It is about knowing where your energy is, how and when to tap it, and how you can best manage that flow between "on" and "off."
Learning to use social media effectively will help anyone to be more authentic, to waste less precious business-day time and to tend the more meaningful exchanges and information sources toward doing their best work. While any leader should see it as a powerful tool, introverted leaders can put social media to use to balance their perceived weaknesses. In that, managing introversion becomes an absolute strength.

Be a Mobile Superhero (Hint: All You Have to Do Is Find Your Hidden Superpower)reddit
Mobile is disrupting almost every aspect of our lives. By now, our phones are just like another organ in our body. It's not only a physical extension of our hand, but also an extension of our brain. The emotional attachment we have to it (more than 90 percent of people keep their phone within arm's reach) keeps us connected 24/7. This powerful technology shifted the playing field for businesses as well. By now, most companies realize that their traditional products are no longer good enough and that mobile presents additional opportunities to offer superior experiences to their customers and members.
Mobile-savvy companies embrace the complexities of mobile (e.g. OS fragmentation, multiple screen sizes and cellular connectivity) and transform those into competitive advantages. The best ones go beyond mobile-first. They invest in a platform-first approach focused on OS-centric design, specifically Android and iOS. Companies that realize that these operating systems are intrinsically different understand that each requires a unique user experience. Designing the same product for both platforms means that you are leaving a lot of value on the table.
One of the biggest new paradigms that mobile created was in product design. The screen constraint became a catalyst for innovation -- it 'forced' products to be simple. As a result, companies started re-thinking their core and how it can be translated to mobile. Most companies reduced functionality while others started completely fresh by introducing new mobile-first functionality.
Another popular trend is the portfolio approach across platforms and use cases. With product unbundling, products are not only offered across various platforms (desktop, mobile, tablet), but also across various applications. The unbundling of applications allows companies to build better and simpler experiences for each of their value propositions with a unique set of functionality. However, to deliver a seamless experience, you have to care as much about the integration of your products as you do about the functionality of your products. 'The Incredibles' family in the Disney movie is a useful way to think about this: every member of The Incredibles has his or her own unique superpower, but at the end of the day they are one family, a single unit. The same goes for the platforms and applications your company builds. Each app can have its own superpowers, super suit and value proposition. However, when you look at the entire suite of apps together, they should all feel like they are part of the same 'family.' As new platforms and use cases evolve, it's important to realize their full potential (superpower) as well as their connective tissue (product family).
Mobile-centric companies (i.e. companies that embrace mobile) see mobile as a phenomenal way to engage current and new users to drive growth, retention and monetization for their businesses. Help your products, and your employees find the super suits, and the superpowers that fit them best. By adopting mobile into your work habits, from planning to execution, creating a mobile-centric culture will quickly become a personal goal for everyone on your team.

Google calls for U.S. to extend Privacy Act protections to EuropeansBy Hayley Tsukayama November 12 Follow @htsuka

Google on Wednesday called on the federal government to allow European citizens to challenge the misuse of their data by the U.S. government in U.S. courts, a right already enjoyed by Americans in the European Union.
The proposal would help heal rifts that have appeared between the U.S. and Europe in the wake of surveillance revealed by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden, Google chief legal officer David Drummond wrote in a company blog post.
The call by the search giant comes ahead of a Washington D.C. visit from representatives of the European Commission.
Several large technology firms, including Google, have been vocal about the damage the rift between the U.S. and Europe on data privacy matters has had on their business, following the Snowden disclosures. Last December, technology executives warned President Obama that the spying programs had damaged their reputations abroad and at home.
"Google and many other technology companies have urged the US to take the lead and  introduce reforms  that ensure government surveillance activity is clearly restricted by law, proportionate to the risks, transparent and subject to independent oversight," Drummond wrote. "Sadly, we’ve seen little serious reform to date. "
At a speech in Athens last July, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said the "the Obama Administration is committed to seeking legislation that would ensure that...EU citizens would have the same right to seek judicial redress for intentional or willful disclosures of protected information, and for refusal to grant access or to rectify any errors in that information, as would a U.S. citizen under the Privacy Act."
Holder's words were met with some skepticism. At the time, then-EU justice commissioner Viviane Reding told  the Guardian , "Words only matter if put into law. We are waiting for the legislative step."
Privacy advocates, such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center, have long called for these reforms in the past. These changes would mirror rights that U.S. citizens already have in the European Union, said EPIC executive director Marc Rotenberg.
"From the EU perspective, one of the oddities of US law is that the Privacy Act distinguishes between US and non US citizens," he noted. "There is no similar distinction in EU law."
To date, there has not been any legislative movement on this issue, said Khaliah Barnes, administrative law counsel at the privacy. However, EPIC has asked the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board to prioritize Privacy Act enforcement. The PCLOB board is holding a public meeting Wednesday on some of these issues in a panel called "Defining Privacy."
 

How that viral catcalling video flattened a serious issue into just another Internet memeBy Caitlin Dewey November 12 Follow @caitlindewey
A screenshot from the video shows men urging Shoshana B. Roberts to “smile!” as she walks through New York City.
In the two weeks since the actress Shoshana Roberts walked around New York for 10 hours as a woman , countless other people have walked countless other cities as women, men and costumed characters of indeterminable gender identity.
Women repeated the stunt in Mumbai , Auckland and Rome .
A male model in New York walked the city to push back against the (well-established!) idea that catcalling is harassment; a man in Austin, meanwhile, strolled that city “ as a hipster .”
And just yesterday, in one of the more popular copycats of recent days, an actress dressed as Princess Leia walks around Manhattan, fending off come-ons from other members of the Star Wars universe. (“I am your father,” Darth Vader heaves at one point. “Gross,” Leia replies.)
All told, it would appear that well over 50 people have produced their own catcalling copycat videos, each of them riffing off Roberts’s much-debated, and much-viewed, original: As of this writing, more than 35.6 million people have watched that video, which its sponsor, the anti-street harassment organization Hollaback!, hopes will spur increased awareness about catcalling and other forms of casual harassment.
Whether that’s actually happening, of course, is another story entirely.
The problem, it seems, is that the catcalling video’s rampant, viral popularity is both its blessing and its curse. The blessing bit should be pretty obvious: The purpose of PSAs is, duh, that they be seen by as many people as possible. But the more the video is seen — the more it becomes a phenomenon in its own right — the more the issue at its core fades into the background.
See, the propagation of memes relies on their loyal reproduction. (I wrote about this a bit Monday, when I looked at why the “Harlem Shake” is inexplicably immortal .) The meme lifecycle has four parts: The meme is made; it’s passed to a new person; the person understands it; the person passes it on. The problem with the Hollaback video is that the meme is mutating at points in the cycle, and it’s mutating away from its creators’ original intention.
Look at the things that each new copycat takes from the original: the unsteady camera, the intro and outro screens, the approximate script, the jump-cut editing. Those parts of the meme have been understood and passed on.
But the whole street-harassment-of-women thing? That’s been lost in the churn. Whereas the original video may have communicated something serious — “street harassment is a near-universal issue worthy of our discussion/consideration” — so many of the follow-ups have amounted to only, “Hey, that catcalling video was crazy, right?”
Incidentally, this is a problem that surfaces whenever anyone — nonprofits, activists, politicians, what have you — try to meme-ify a cause. It’s essentially the Catch-22 at the heart of modern Internet advocacy.
Sure, a viral video like the ice bucket challenge , or a trending hashtag like #BringBackOurGirls , will go pretty far in the fight for awareness. But are people aware of the Internet trend, as such, or are they sharing based on some deeper, more nuanced concern for the complex issues behind the meme?
Millions of people have shared the original Hollaback video — so surely, in this case, it’s some mix of both. Still, it can’t be reassuring to activists that, behind their original, the most-watched catcalling video on YouTube consists of a man strutting around New York and only using the phrase “street harassment” in air quotes. It’s been viewed more than 6 million times.
“Is this harassment or compliments?” the video asks.
A better question for our purposes, perhaps: When causes morph into memes, does it help them — or hurt?

Joe Biden  Elizabeth Warren to address gathering of wealthy liberal donorsBy Matea Gold November 12 Follow @mateagold
Sen. Elizabeth Warren is sworn in by Vice President Biden, right, as Warren's husband, Bruce Mann, looks on during the opening session of the 113th Congress at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 3, 2013. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)
Vice President Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) are set to address a group of wealthy liberal donors gathering in Washington this week for a private meeting to determine the direction of their political investments in the coming years.
The four-day conference of Democracy Alliance is expected to include dissections of what went wrong for Democrats in last week’s midterm elections, as well as a wide-ranging discussion about adopting a new, long-term strategy to reverse GOP gains in the states.
Biden is set to be the keynote speaker at the alliance’s closing event Friday night at the Newseum, according to people familiar with the schedule.
Despite the dismal showing for Democrats in this year’s races, president Gara LaMarche said that he does not believe the results demoralized the party’s financial backers.
“I feel people are disappointed,” he told The Washington Post in an interview Wednesday at the Mandarin Oriental, where the conference is being held. “I don’t think they felt their money was wasted. I think they feel you make the good fight, you do what you can, and sometimes you lose.”
The alliance – an invitation-only group  that makes funding recommendations to political contributors on the left – is in the process of reassessing the current portfolio of groups that it endorses, a process that could end up directing resources to new organizations active in state-level organizing. The group’s board, chaired by veteran labor leader John Stocks, will approve a new portfolio in early 2015.
Since it launched in 2005, the group’s roughly 100 members have directed about $500 million into helping build an infrastructure of think tanks, research organizations and political support groups on the left. The group’s partners, which are required to give at least $200,000 a year, help finance organizations such as Media Matters for America, a media watchdog group; America Votes, which coordinates the efforts of allied interest groups; and Catalist, which provides voter data.
Democracy Alliance officials believe there is a need to substantially increase investments in states to help Democrats claw back more legislative and gubernatorial seats from Republicans by 2020, when the next congressional redistricting process begins.
Also on the agenda for this fall’s meeting are panels about the role of race as an electoral wedge issue, challenges to voting rights, developments in the climate change battle and policies that reflect the needs of “the new American majority” – women, youths and people of color, according to a copy of the schedule obtained by The Post.
Warren is scheduled to give an address Thursday afternoon about economic injustice, as first reported by Politico. Supporters of the liberal firebrand are pushing her to challenge expected 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton, who was not invited to this week’s meeting.
LaMarche said the invitation to Warren did not indicate any preference by the alliance in the upcoming White House contest.
“As Secretary Clinton herself said recently, Senator Warren is a leading economic voice in the party,” he said. “We want to have a strong emphasis on the economy and we asked her to kick off that section.”
“DA is scrupulously neutral in presidential politics,” LaMarche added, saying he expects that Clinton will speak at an alliance conference over the next year or two.

Unable to comprehend peculiar British accent of witness  SIT seeks hisrecallPrint
Written by Satish Jha | Ahmedabad | Posted: November 13, 2014 2:33 am
The Supreme Court-appointed Special Investigation Team (SIT) on Wednesday filed an application in a district court, seeking recall of the complainant and key witness in the post-Godhra riot case of the killing of British nationals near Prantij, Imran Dawood, on the ground that they had not been able to comprehend his British accent in the testimony.
Four years year after Dawood testified before the special court, on video from London, the SIT failed to understand it, even as the court had termed the accent as “peculiar”.
Dawood visited India for the first time, along with his UK-based uncles, Saeed Dawood, Shakeel Dawood and Mohammed Aswat, in 2002. On February 28, the four were returning to their native village Lajpur, near Navsari in Gujarat, after visiting Agra and Jaipur, when a mob attacked them near Prantij. Saeed, Shakeel and Aswat Nallabhai, along with their driver Yusuf Sulaiman, were burnt to death on the NH-8 on while Dawood sustained injuries and was saved by patrolling policemen. Britain has been pushing for speedy justice, with the latest being British foreign secretary William Hague raising the issue before External Affairs Minister for Sushma Swaraj during his visit to India in July.
The SIT moved the application before the principal district judge IC Shah, Himmatnagar, to recall Imran Dawood after efforts to understand his statement, recorded in April 2010 through video conference, failed.
The court is also learnt to have sought extension for disposal of the case.
In August, the SC directed the court to wrap up the case in three months. The deadline is November 25.
Two former UK diplomats have also testified through video conferences, including former Deputy British High Commissioners Ian Reakes and Howard Parkinson.

CPI mounts veiled attack on CPI(M)demonstration
Party does not intend to be privy to corruption: Pannian
After failing in its efforts to get the Opposition Left Democratic Front (LDF) to launch a joint stir for the ouster of Finance Minister K.M. Mani over the bar bribery allegations, the State unit of the Communist Party of India (CPI) on Wednesday took out a Secretariat march on its own, with the declaration that it was not ready for ‘fixed’ agitations.
Addressing party workers who converged before the Secretariat, CPI State secretary Pannian Ravindran and assistant secretary Prakash Babu said the CPI was forced to launch the agitation on its own because it did not wish to be privy to corruption. “There is a talk that Mr. Mani is a good person and fit to be the Chief Minister. That will not wash with us,” Mr. Ravindran said, in a veiled reference to reports that the Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI-M] wanted to make Mr. Mani the Chief Minister.
Tax burden
Mr. Ravindran said he did not wish to say much about how the LDF stir against additional taxes levied by the Oommen Chandy government recently ended prematurely.
The government had proposed taxes aimed at mobilising Rs.1,499 crore in the Budget. Subsequently, it increased various taxes twice in the name of bridging the shortfall on account of liquor sale ban.
It also increased power charges and bus fares. All this had placed a heavy burden on the people, he added.
Mr. Ravindran said the CPI did not believe that the ongoing Vigilance probe would bring out the truth about the bribery charge raised by bar owners.
Legal action
The party was determined to carry on with its agitation to press for Mr. Mani’s ouster.
It would adopt legal measures as well as agitations to achieve this. Mr. Mani should quit. In case, he does not, the Chief Minister should expel him from the Cabinet.
The State government should immediately order a judicial inquiry into the allegations against Mr. Mani and also who got the remaining Rs.4 crore.
It was clear that the money was paid to Congress Ministers, the CPI leader said.

Chenault: Digital transformation
Mood flakes possible Thursday nightBy Jason Samenow November 12 Follow @capitalweather
You can literally feel the cold air seeping into the region behind today’s cold front, and that sets the stage for the chance of a few snowflakes Thursday night, after some possible rain.
So what exactly are “mood flakes,” you ask? These are flakes which set the mood for winter, but cause absolutely no disruption.  That is, they don’t accumulate or stick.  I use mood flakes here the same way I use “conversational snow” – another way to describe snowflakes that people can see and talk about, but that are harmless.
The drivers of the possible snowflakes are a disturbance moving in from the west and a weak wave of low pressure developing along the Arctic front off the East Coast.  As these two areas approach the region, a period of precipitation is possible (40-50 percent chance), particularly between about 4 p.m and 1 a.m.  During this window, precipitation – if it occurs – would probably fall for just a few hours.
Any precipitation would likely start as rain and then, before ending, could mix with and/or briefly change to snow.
GFS model shows the possibility of a little snow over the region after a little rain Thursday evening (WeatherBell.com)
The European model, which was holding out on the chance of rain or snow yesterday, now suggests it’s possible – joining the GFS, SREF, and Canadian models.
Temperatures will fall through the 40s as any precipitation falls, back into the mid-to-upper 30s, ensuring that if rain changes to snow, it won’t stick or cause meaningful slipperiness.

Bank stocks and other sectors tied to the pace of growth led on the day, though continued weakness in crude oil weighed on energy shares. While major indexes ended off their highs of the session, both the Dow and S&P closed at records.
The state and city pensions would be solvent now if the state and city had put in there share and this sustained rise in the market.

Payrolls rose by 321,000 in November, way above the 230,000 estimated, while the unemployment rate held steady at 5.8 percent, a six-year low.
The report blew past forecasts, but also raised expectations that a rate hike from the Federal Reserve may materialize sooner than previously thought.
Ronald Sanchez, chief investment officer of Fiduciary Trust Company International in New York, said the number was "unambiguously strong," though it "could mean some changes to policy recommendations with the Fed. June 2015 is back on the table for when rates could rise."
Financials <.SPSY> rose 1 percent as higher interest rates would prop up earnings in the sector. Bank of America  rose 2.7 percent to $17.68 while Goldman Sachs  was up 1.8 percent to $195.45, boosting the Dow.
Utilities <.SPLRCU>, a dividend play, fell 0.8 percent as Treasuries yields rose. Energy <.SPNY> fell 1.2 percent alongside a 1.7 percent drop in crude  prices. Most sectors ended well off their highs of the session.
"The day's market action has to be seen in the context of the recovery we've had year-to-date. Payrolls confirm the strength of the economy, but that strength is reflected in stock prices," said Sanchez, who helps oversee $16 billion in assets.
Separate data showed new orders for U.S. factory goods fell for a third straight month in October, pointing to a slowdown in manufacturing activity.
The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> rose 58.69 points, or 0.33 percent, to 17,958.79, the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 3.45 points, or 0.17 percent, to 2,075.37 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 11.32 points, or 0.24 percent, to 4,780.76.
For the week, the Dow rose 0.7 percent and the S&P rose 0.4 percent. It was the seventh straight weekly gain, a streak not seen in a year for both. The Nasdaq fell 0.2 percent on the week.
American Eagle Outfitters  fell 13.8 percent to $11.91 after the teen apparel retailer forecast a current-quarter profit below analysts' estimates and reported its fifth straight drop in quarterly income.
About 5.81 billion shares traded on all U.S. platforms, according to BATS exchange data.
NYSE advancers outnumbered decliners 1,614 to 1,480, for a 1.09-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,809 issues rose and 927 fell, for a 1.95-to-1 ratio favoring advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 98 new 52-week highs and 10 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 168 new highs and 93 new lows.

Indian companies need to innovate technologies like apple, google does not matter innovation comes through automation or manual but new technologies should be target point.
Automation resources will cost 5 times more than manual resource. Again automation scripts continuously need upgrade so 5 times costly resources need to maintain those automation scripts.
When infosys started that time competition was almost zero. So whoever can write any program benefited that time. But now competition too high so only innovation is the differentiators.

Americans Are Not Remotely Financially Ready For RetirementAmericans Are Not Remotely Financially Ready For Retirement
Posted:
reddit
The median American heading into retirement has just enough wealth to live on for a little more than three years, according to a new paper by the Center for Economic and Policy Research’s David Rosnick and Dean Baker.
These Americans are the first 401(k) generation: Their prime working years coincided with the 3 1/2 decades since the introduction of tax-deferred retirement accounts. And yet most of them have accumulated a relatively small amount of wealth, if any, outside of owning their home.
For Americans ages 55 to 64, net worth, the equity they own in their homes, and the value of other assets they own are each falling at precisely the time in their lives when they should be rising.
It’s a “pessimistic picture of economic progress since the end of the recession,” Rosnick and Baker write. The path of Americans’ net worth, including those about to stop working, hasn’t been a continual downward slide. In fact, Rosnick and Baker note that net worth grew significantly for more than two decades. But then, it was hit with the dual blows of a stock market and housing crash.
Net worth for the middle 20 percent of soon-to-be-retired Americans has fallen every year since 2004, and it is now just under $170,000. (The median is $165,700.) That might seem like a lot, but it’s just enough money to live at the median U.S. income of $52,000 for a little over three years. And when most of that wealth is tied up in a home, it's unclear how many of those in their upper 50s and early 60s plan to stay afloat without working or selling their home for what could easily be 20 or more years of retirement.
The poorest of the soon-to-be retirees have been hit the hardest. In comparison, the richest group is in an excellent position.
That is a chart of the wealth-destroying wrath of the housing crisis. It destroyed billions of dollars of net worth, and disproportionately hurt the poor, who are less likely to have any wealth outside their home.
Fewer Americans in the bottom 60 percent of wealth who are close to retirement own their homes than used to: In 1989, 77 percent of this group owned their homes, the researchers found. In 2013, that number was 60 percent.
And the poorer you are, the less of your home you own. This, the authors write, “implies these households will be paying off mortgages long into retirement, if they stay in their homes.”
Poorer near-retirees also own less outside of the value of their home than their wealthier counterparts:
The wealth, or absence of it, among Americans on the brink of traditional retirement age is another manifestation of a stock-market-led recovery. The stock market has boomed back from the financial crisis. Housing prices have recovered with it, but on a relatively smaller scale. Despite a more than 30-year commitment to tax-deferred personal retirement saving, stock ownership is not widely distributed across the American wealth spectrum. “House prices,” the authors write, are “a larger share of assets for the bottom three fifths of Americans.”
Recent years have shown that tying your net worth to your home’s price is, in fact, risky. Homeownership should not be a retirement plan.

Rajasthan bowled out for 35 versus RailwaysMore
Rajasthan plummet to 35 all out
Rajasthan's one-day form touched a new low on Tuesday as the team was bowled out for 35 against Railways in Nagpur.

Railways 39 for 1 beat Rajasthan 35 (Anureet 5-16, Mishra 5-18) by nine wickets
If Rajasthan's build-up to the domestic season, mired in uncertainty due to Rajasthan Cricket Association's internal tussles and those with the BCCI, was bad, then their start to the campaign has been worse.
Rajasthan's one-day form touched a new low on Tuesday as the team was bowled out for 35 against Railways in Nagpur. It was the second-lowest total in India's domestic one-day cricket, after Saurashtra's 34 against Mumbai in 1999-00. However, the duration of the Rajasthan innings, which lasted just 15.3 overs, was the lowest for a completed innings in Indian domestic cricket.
Railways, whose new-ball bowlers Anureet Singh and Amit Mishra had claimed five wickets each, then overhauled the target of 36 in just 5.3 overs, handing Rajasthan one of the biggest losses in one-day cricket. The demoralising loss came on the back of comprehensive losses against Vidarbha and Uttar Pradesh earlier in the tournament.
Despite being disappointed with his batsmen, Rajasthan captain Pankaj Singh wasn't overtly critical of his team-mates. "There is not much one can say when the team suffers from such a huge loss," a dejected Pankaj told ESPNcricinfo. "Obviously everything went wrong with our batting. I would attribute it to lack of application. Both the Railways bowlers bowled well but when none of the batsmen try to apply, then you are bound to be bowled out cheaply."
Railways captain Mahesh Rawat lavished praise on his bowlers. "Yesterday, we played at the same ground and both teams scored in the range of 240-plus. So you can't simply blame the pitch," he said. "The pitch was fine and there were no demons. Our opening bowlers were brilliant from the start. We have young Bilaspur boy Amit, who bowls outswing at a decent pace and we had Anureet, who is a seasoned campaigner at this level.
"The areas that our new ball bowlers bowled was brilliant and it became difficult for their batsmen. They wilted under pressure created by our bowlers."
The first four batsmen in the Rajasthan batting line-up fell for a duck and at 17 for 8 in the 12th over, Rajasthan were in danger of being bowled out for the lowest total in domestic one-day cricket. Robin Bist , the senior-most Rajasthan batsman in the one-day squad, agreed with his captain. "We played very bad cricket," Bist told ESPNcricinfo. "They bowled very well, one or two balls were exceptional but we didn't apply ourselves. Most of us lost our wickets due to poor shot selection."
Rajasthan players were in danger of missing out on the domestic season as late as the first week of October when the court appointed selection committees and directed BCCI to field the team as Rajasthan XI. As a result, after playing a selection tournament before Diwali, the Rajasthan team had a short 10-day camp in Jaipur before entering the tournament.
Still, Pankaj refused to blame a lack of preparation for the recent results. "We had a good camp and some of us played in the Duleep Trophy as well so we cannot say we were not prepared," Pankaj said. "Anyway, traditionally Rajasthan have struggled in the one-day format, so I just hope we can end the campaign with a victory in our last game and learn from our mistakes going into the Ranji Trophy."
The last time Rajasthan qualified for the all-India knockouts of the one-day competition was in 2006-07 when they lost to Mumbai in the final. Since then, despite winning two Ranji Trophy titles, Rajasthan have failed to finish in top two of the Central Zone one-day league.
Even Bist, who along with Pankaj and Ashok Menaria helped Central Zone with their first Duleep title in ten seasons last week, agreed with Pankaj but said that due to a lack of match practice the team was still trying to gel. "The more a set of boys plays together the sooner it gels. Since we missed all the pre-season preparatory tournaments, we are aware that it would take us a little while for this new team to get together," Bist said.
This is the first time in seven years that Rajasthan are entering a domestic season without the services of a professional. As a result, the Rajasthan team is full of new faces, most of whom have been competing for places in the team.
The only positive for Rajasthan during this year's league has been Pankaj's spell of 6 for 50 in their opener against Vidarbha. It was the best bowling spell by a Rajasthan bowler in one-day cricket, bettering Shamsher Singh's 5 for 26 against Vidarbha in 1998-99. "Records and achievements don't mean anything if the team isn't doing well," Pankaj said. "I just hope that we can lift ourselves in the coming season. It's going to be a long season and it's just the beginning. We just have to be positive about our game and give our best."

Clark takes a dig at India ahead of Australia seriesTweet

Sydney: Former Australian Test seamer Stuart Clark Tuesday said the decision to rest skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni from the first Test against Australia shows that India place greater emphasis on the 2015 World Cup rather than the upcoming series, both to be played Down Under.
India are scheduled to play four Tests, starting Dec 4 and then a One-day International (ODI) series also involving England in the build-up to the World Cup, beginning Feb 14. Clark does not think retaining the Border-Gavaskar Trophy is the top priority for India this summer. Instead, they are more preoccupied with defending the World Cup they won in 2011, he believes.
"I'd suggest India are very, very concerned about the World Cup," Clark was quoted as saying by the Sydney Morning Herald.
"That's a big thing in their cricket calendar, one-day cricket and the World Cup. The Test series is big but at the end of the day if they do well in the World Cup no one will care about the Test series over there."
Dhoni's absence from the series opener has frontline batsman Virat Kohli leading the side for the first time at a venue where the hosts haven't lost a Test for 26 years. Dhoni has been rested to overcome a thumb injury that has sidelined him from the ongoing ODI series against Sri Lanka.
Does Stuart Clark have a point here? (Getty Images)
Clark said India will struggle if they think they can exploit Australia's weaknesses against slow bowling Down Under.
And he does not believe off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin will be able to replicate his heroics of last year when he topped the series wicket-takers' list in India against the Aussies.
"If India are going to come out and bowl spinners at us I think we'll come out and smash them everywhere," Clark said.
"They're going to Brisbane first. Other than Shane Warne, no spinner has ever really done a lot there and been overly successful. In Adelaide they'll be OK, but Sydney the last couple of years has been quite pace-friendly - it's been carrying through and seamed around everywhere."
"They'll play Ashwin - he's a good bowler in Indian conditions but I can't see him being overly successful here."
India lost 0-4 in Australia two years ago despite not playing a Test at the Gabba.
India's reputation away from home has traditionally been poor, with just one victory in nine Tests and series defeats in South Africa, New Zealand and England in recent times.

The Human Rights Campaign is featuring people of faith in a public awareness campaign in Mississippi launched this week.
The campaign includes six ads airing for four weeks on television and online. The ads feature Mississippi residents like one Southern Baptist mother whose son came out as gay, a Baptist pastor, and a transgender student at the Mississippi University for Women.
“According to Gallup, Mississippi is the most religious state in America, and an estimated 55 percent of its population is Baptist,” the group said in a press release . “It would be nearly impossible to successfully engage a large majority of Mississippians about LGBT equality without discussing it in the context of faith.”
There will also be outdoor advertising, door-to-door, and direct mail components of the campaign.
The group is spending $9.5 million to influence public opinion in the South. The campaign in Mississippi will cost $310,000, the group said.

Spacecraft lands on comet: European Space Ag...European Space Agency's probe first to land on comet, but fails to anchor down
By AP | 13 Nov, 2014, 11.23AM IST
The European Space Agency says it has succeeded in landing a spacecraft on a comet for the first time in history.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
DARMSTADT/GERMANY: Landing with a bounce after traveling 4 billion miles, a European spacecraft made history Wednesday by successfully reaching the icy, dusty surface of a speeding comet - a cosmic first designed to answer big questions about the universe.
The landing by the washing machine-sized craft after a decade-long journey required immense precision, as even the slightest error could have resulted in stellar calamity.
Indications were that the spacecraft touched down almost perfectly, save for an unplanned bounce, said Stephan Ulamec, head of the lander operation.
"Today we didn't just land once. We maybe even landed twice," he said with a chuckle.
Ulamec said thrusters that were meant to push the lander, called Philae, onto the surface, and harpoons that would have anchored it to the comet failed to deploy properly. Initial data from the spacecraft indicated that it lifted off again, turned and then came to rest.
Scientists were still trying to fully understand what happened and whether those failures would affect the lander's ability to remain on the comet, called 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko . But so far, most of the instruments were working fine and sending back data as hoped, Ulamec said.
We're signing off shortly, but we leave you with replay hlighlights of this afternoon's events https://t.co/K4IRFgsn2y
— ESA (@esa) November 12, 2014
"Tomorrow morning we should know a lot more," he said.
The landing team at mission control in Darmstadt had to sweat through a tense seven-hour wait that began when Philae dropped from the agency's Rosetta space probe as both it and the comet hurtled through space at 41,000 mph (66,000 kph).
During the lander's descent, scientists were powerless to do anything but watch, because its vast distance from Earth - more than 300 million miles - made it impossible to send instructions in real time.
Finally, at 16:03 GMT (11:03 a.m. EST), the agency received a signal that the lander had touched down.
While it may take a while to determine the exact state of the 220-pound (100-kilogram) lander, the fact that it was resting on the surface of the comet was already a huge success - the highlight of Rosetta's decade-long mission to study comets and learn more about the origins of these celestial bodies.
The head of the European Space Agency underlined Europe's pride in having achieved a unique first ahead of its U.S. counterpart, NASA.
"We are the first to have done that, and that will stay forever," said the European agency's director-general, Jean-Jacques Dordain.
NASA contributed three instruments to the mission and its Deep Space Network of giant radio antennas has been key to communicating with Rosetta.
Eight-time spacewalking astronaut John Grunsfeld, now associate administrator for science at NASA, called the landing "a breakthrough moment in the exploration of our solar system and a milestone for international cooperation."
"The data collected by Rosetta will provide the scientific community, and the world, with a treasure-trove of data," he said in a statement.
Scientists have likened the trillion or so comets in our solar system to time capsules that are virtually unchanged since the earliest moments of the universe.
"By studying one in enormous detail, we can hope to unlock the puzzle of all of the others," said Mark McCaughrean, a senior scientific adviser to the mission.
The insight gleaned will give researchers the opportunity to test the theory that comets brought organic matter and water to Earth billions of years ago, giving them a key role in the evolution of life on our planet, said Klim Churyumov, one of the two astronomers who discovered the comet in 1969.
Rosetta and Philae will accompany the 2 {-mile wide comet as it races past the sun and becomes increasingly active in the rising temperatures. Between them, they will use 21 different instruments to take 3D images, analyze the comet's chemical composition and electrical properties, and even probe its internal structure with low-frequency radio signals.
Mission manager Paolo Ferri said there was no time to celebrate, because the lander had only enough battery power to operate for up to 64 hours. After that it will have to recharge, using solar panels to eke out an extra hour of operations each day.
Ferri said communications with the lander also needed to be stabilized, as there were intermittent connection problems after the touchdown. In the meantime, all the data that Philae collects is safely being stored for later transmission, he said.
Rosetta, which was launched in 2004, had to slingshot three times around Earth and once around Mars before it could work up enough speed to chase down the comet, which it reached in August. Rosetta and the comet have been traveling in tandem ever since.

Hundreds of millions of miles from Earth, a European spacecraft made history by successfully landing on the icy, dusty surface of a speeding comet - an audacious cosmic first designed to answer big questions about the origin of the universe.
The European Space Agency celebrated the cosmic achievement after sweating through a tense seven-hour countdown that began when the Philae lander dropped from the agency's Rosetta space probe toward the comet as both hurtled through space at 66,000 kph.

The agency then received a signal at 1603 GMT from the 100-kilogram Philae lander after it touched down on the icy surface of the comet named 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Philae had drifted down to the comet and latched on using harpoons and ice screws.
"We definitely confirm that the lander is on the surface," said flight director Andrea Accomazzo.

Further checks needed to ascertain state of the lander
While further checks are needed to ascertain the state of the lander, the fact that it is resting on the surface of the speeding comet is already a huge success.
It marks the highlight of the decade-long Rosetta mission to study comets and learn more about the origins of these celestial bodies.

Mohammed Shami - coming back from a toe injury.New Delhi: India’s tour of Australia is a shot at redemption for the team suffering one debacle after another on its travels. However, judging by the personnel going Down Under, the omens are not very encouraging.
A lot of attention has gone to skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni being ruled out of the first Test in Brisbane starting on December 4 due to a thumb injury. The captain has skipped the ongoing one-day series against Sri Lanka, but if he has to miss a game to be held more than three weeks from now, one can easily surmise that the injury is serious one.
One wonders if Dhoni will be able to lead the side in the second Test in Adelaide (starting December 12). But there are several other players who are currently out with injury or are returning from one.
The pace department, especially, provides a worrying look. Mohammed Shami, Varun Aaron and Ishant Sharma are gracing the treatment table, while Umesh Yadav is never too far from one.
The selectors have picked 19 players for the four-Test series, but if any of the main pacers breaks down at the start of the tour or during a match, the visions of the 0-4 reversals in England and Australia may return to haunt Indian fans.
Australian pitches are known to aid quick bowling, and the likes of Yadav and Aaron regularly cross the 90 miles per hour mark. But it seems to take a lot out of them, and they invariably break down soon after. Indian fans will keep their fingers crossed that such a nightmarish scenario does not play out Down Under, as it will put a lot of pressure on India’s most reliable seamer Bhuvneshwar Kumar.
With Australian pitches not known to aid spinners, options for the captain will be severely limited.
In Dhoni’s absence, Wriddhiman Saha will don the gloves. The Bengal wicketkeeper is himself coming back from a thumb injury. He did play in the three ODIs against Sri Lanka, but how will he fare if the Aussies keep India for a long time in the field in Brisbane A lot is expected of Umesh Yadav in Australia, but he is susceptible to injuries.
Even the batting line-up is not without its concerns. Rohit Sharma should be in the running for a middle-order berth, but the stylish Mumbai batsman has just recovered from a broken finger.
The Aussies will be smarting after a 0-2 debacle of their own against Pakistan in the Gulf. They will also remember the 0-4 defeat in spin-friendly conditions when they toured India last year.
It is imperative that India are in the best possible shape when they take on the likes of Michael Clarke, Mitchell Johnson and David Warner on their home patch. Somehow, it seems not to be the case.

Why Control Is a Trap That Will Slow Your Business Growthreddit
Tom owned a successful computer equipment wholesale company.  To the outside world he had "made it."  His business enjoyed sales of $5 million per year and Tom was earning over a million of profit per year.
But he was burning out fast.  The 80-hour weeks he was working was impacting his health, his marriage, and his role as a father.  He just felt stuck.
He knew he needed to find a way out from the crushing pressures of running his business day-to-day, but he didn't want to step back because he feared his business would suffer.
Have you ever felt that way?  Like you're trapped by your business?  Either you continue to put in the hours and make all the key decisions, or you step back and the business might falter?
This is a false dilemma.  You don't have to choose between having your life while your business suffers or having your business grow but sacrificing your life.
In fact, the long-term solution lies in making a clear decision to grow your business to be independent of you.
Let's get real here -- most business owners (myself included) started our companies because we wanted to be in control of our own business lives.  Either we were tired of working for someone else or we had an idea that we wanted to build a business around.
So we set out and built a company that revolves around us.  Sure we have staff who work for us, but they are there to leverage us, to execute our ideas and implement our decisions.  We think we're supposed to stay in control.
What most business owners don't realize is that control comes with a hefty price tag, both for the business and for the business owner.  For the business it means you'll be the critical constraint that limits growth and the key vulnerability that could cause the business to fail if you get hurt or just plain burn out.  For you the business owner, the price is that you must be there daily to exercise that control.  If you're not there, the business suffers.
This is so prevalent in the business world that I have a name for this.  I call it the "Self Employment Trap."  This is when the business owner is so essential for the business that they haven't built a company, they've built a self-employed job for themselves.
So what's the way out?  To build a business, not a job.  This requires that each quarter you take simple steps to lesson your business's reliance on you.  You incrementally replace yourself from the key functions in your business with sound systems, a strong team, and intelligent internal controls.  Notice that I'm not suggesting that you just "hire your replacement" to manage your business.  This is a losing strategy that merely moves the critical dependency from your shoulders to those of your single key manager.
By systematizing the core functions of your business and having simple internal controls that help your team self-manage and your managers more effectively oversee, what you're doing is you're increasing the odds that your staff will be able to take on more and more of the key roles inside your company.  Rather than being reliant just on a person, you're building multiple people.  And rather than just throwing multiple people in as the solution, you're empowering them with the systems and controls (i.e. structure) that will help them succeed and help your business make sure that the right things get done at the right times.
Let's return back to Tom and hear the end of the story.
Tom took this advice to heart.  Initially he (and later he enlisted his management team) started to systematize the core functions of the business.  Tom cataloged where his business was currently reliant on him, and each quarter he consciously chose the top ways that quarter he could incrementally reduce the company's reliance on him in a scalable way.
After 18 months he had grown his company to $8 million per year in sales and reduced his working hours in half (down to 40 hours a week.)
After four years he had grown his company to $23 million per year and had reduced his working hours to under 10 hours per week.
All of this starts with a simple decision that you the business owner must make -- the decision to build a business, not a job.
Next you have to follow up this decision by asking yourself, "What three things can I do in the next 90 days that would do the most to reduce the business's reliance on me in a critical area?"
Finally you need to execute on the ideas you come up with, enlisting your team to do this with you.
Quarter by quarter you'll reduce your company's reliance on you, and in so doing realize that the real goal of a business is not to have the business owner stay in control, but rather, to build a business that can profitably create value in the market in a scalable way.

Executives Who Trashed Evidence Must Go to Jailreddit
Let me start with a warning. This is really going to piss you off.
Alarmed by a report a decade ago that one of its airbags had ruptured and spewed metal debris at a driver in Alabama, the Japanese manufacturer Takata secretly conducted tests on 50 airbags it retrieved from scrapyards, according to two former employees involved in the tests, one of whom was a senior member of its testing lab.
The steel inflaters in two of the airbags cracked during the tests, a condition that can lead to rupture, the former employees said. The result was so startling that engineers began designing possible fixes in preparation for a recall, the former employees said.
But instead of alerting federal safety regulators to the possible danger, Takata executives discounted the results and ordered the lab technicians to delete the testing data from their computers and dispose of the airbag inflaters in the trash, they said.
The whistleblowers were two former Takata employees with a combined four decades at the company. They have remained anonymous. The tests -- described by one of the whistleblowers as "hush-hush" -- were conducted in absolute secrecy at Takata's U.S. corporate hub in Michigan. They were done at night and over the weekends so as not to attract attention. When the results came in, the bosses abruptly said , "Pack it all up, shut the whole thing down."
And what has happened since this cover-up, and since these faulty airbags were installed in cars made by multiple manufacturers and sold across continents (16 million cars have been recalled )? Four Americans are dead. One of them is Hien Tran. She died just last month in Orlando, Florida, after a car accident. The accident, however, didn't kill her. Her car's malfunction did. Upon impact, her airbag didn't deploy as a cushion to protect her head and face. Instead it blew apart, and shards slashed her neck: "It looked like a stabbing."
Our government must thoroughly investigate the charges brought by the Takata whistleblowers. If they are found to be credible, I believe the executives who ordered the cover-up must face the charge of murder by negligent homicide . And the company must pay dearly as well (a class-action suit was filed against Takata and Honda just over a week ago, thus before news broke of the secret tests and cover-up), so that other CEOs will understand that creating an environment in which such behavior takes place will bring crippling penalties and hurt their corporate bottom line. Otherwise, these crimes and cover-ups will keep happening, and people will keep dying.
The larger point here is about holding white-collar criminals responsible for their crimes. In the wake of the financial crisis of 2008, which, as some may recall, plunged our country into the worst economic crash since the Great Depression, a few loan officers and a single investment banker went to jail -- but no top executives of financial firms. None of them even faced any serious attempts to prosecute them on criminal charges. Not one.
That's very different from what happened after the savings and loan scandals of the late 1980s. For a comparison, here's what William Black, who helped throw a bunch of the scoundrels involved behind bars, had to say :
The savings and loan debacle was one-seventieth the size of the current crisis, both in terms of losses and the amount of fraud. In that crisis, the savings and loan regulators made over 30,000 criminal referrals, and this produced over 1,000 felony convictions in cases designated as "major" by the Department of Justice. But even that understates the degree of prioritization, because we, the regulators, worked very closely with the FBI and the Justice Department to create a list of the top 100 -- the 100 worst fraud schemes. They involved roughly 300 savings and loans and 600 individuals, and virtually all of those people were prosecuted. We had a 90 percent conviction rate, which is the greatest success against elite white-collar crime (in terms of prosecution) in history.
In the current crisis, that same agency, the Office of Thrift Supervision, which was supposed to regulate, among others, Countrywide, Washington Mutual and IndyMac -- which collectively made hundreds of thousands of fraudulent mortgage loans -- made zero criminal referrals. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which is supposed to regulate the largest national banks, made zero criminal referrals. The Federal Reserve appears to have made zero criminal referrals...And the FDIC was smart enough to refuse to answer the question, but nobody thinks they made any material number of criminal referrals [either].
In the aftermath of the Wall Street crash of 1929, the Pecora Commission's investigation resulted in the head of the New York Stock Exchange doing time. After the dot-com bubble of the 1990s, a number of top corporate executives ended up contemplating whether orange was, indeed, the new black. But not after 2008. On a related note, given the results of last week's midterm elections one can certainly ask if bringing to justice at least some of those who committed the frauds that led to the 2008 crash might have helped Democrats at the ballot box. We'll never know.
Whether it's auto executives covering up design flaws, or Wall Street executives lying about everything from their balance sheets to their exotic yet bogus mortgage securities, if they know they might end up in jail, fewer of them will end up committing crimes that destroy lives. Will white-collar crime disappear if we prosecute more of the criminals? Of course not. But just because homicide still exists doesn't mean it isn't a good idea to punish murderers.
White-collar criminals know what they are doing. They have made a calculated decision, they have weighed the costs and the benefits of lying. If they expect that the cost of getting caught is minimal, they are far more likely to lie. This is simple human nature, at least when we are talking about people without a real moral compass, people who would put the lives of their customers in jeopardy rather than risk bad news for their corporation.
Speaking more broadly, this is why government must vigorously regulate businesses and punish violations. When regulators are too lenient -- as is likely when so many of them are drawn from, and want to return to, the top ranks of the industries they regulate -- the rest of us get hurt. Not only that, but weak regulations mean that all businesses are then forced either to cut corners themselves or risk being destroyed by competitors willing to do so. Many corporate executives are no different from 5-year-olds. Give them an inch, and they'll take a mile.
Assuming the whistleblowers are telling the truth, sending these Takata executives away would be a matter of achieving justice for Hien Tran and the others killed and wounded by the criminals who threw their lives into the trash 10 years ago. Equally importantly, doing so would send a message to would-be white-collar criminals: It doesn't matter if you wear a suit and tie, if you break the law you will go to prison. Sending that message would make all of us safer.
But we haven't been doing that consistently enough in America in recent years. And that's got to change. Now.

What s Apple worth Sky s the limit as stock hits new highsEMAIL
(AFP/Getty)
Apple (AAPL) shares are hitting another record high. And it seems like there’s nothing that can stop it — not even price targets.
Shares of the smartphone-maker keep blasting blast analysts’ price targets almost as fast as the analysts can raise them. Apple’s breathtaking rally this year — powered by strong uptake of the iPhone 6 smartphone — continues to mock analysts’ price targets rooted in fundamentals and valuations as emotion and speculation takes over.
Shares of Apple Wednesday closed up $1.55, or 1.4%, Wednesday to $111.25. That already tops the $108.10 18-month price target that analysts had just two months ago. Analysts have been scrambling to keep ahead of the soaring shares of Apple — but the stock seems to have no bounds. Perhaps the analysts saying Apple is the first “risk free” stock are on to something after all?
Apple at $110 a share is just below analysts’ current $116.69 18-month price target on the stock. And that average price target has been collectively raised 4.4% just over the past month.
Certainly, there are degrees of optimism, even among analysts. The highest 18-month price target on Apple is currently $143 a share. That might seem outlandishly high, especially since the stock is already trading at 17 times its earnings the past 12 months. But analysts have learned the hard way that you’re either bullish on Apple, or you’re wrong.
Earlier this week, UBS tech analyst Steven Milunovich took his price target up nearly 9% to $125 a share. He pointed to “strong buying intentions for the iPhone 6 … appreciation of the brand and ecosystem and interest in Apple Pay,” as drivers for the ever-rising stock price in a note to clients.
Computerized tools continue to be more guarded about the trajectory of Apple’s stock. Trefis , a tool that measures how much a company is worth by looking at the present value of expected cash flow, pegs the stock’s value at $110. But even that’s been raised more than 10% over the past few months.
How high can the stock go? Seems like it has a mind of its own — one that even the analysts can’t read.

Need a crystal ball: 2015 market outlookHow to evaluate 2015 market outlooks

2014 is nearing an end. And that means Wall Street stock market strategists will start peering into their crystal balls and making predictions about where the stock market is heading next year — and why.
Here’s a cheat sheet on key things to watch:
1. Year-end S&P 500 price target. This is basically where strategists think the stock market, as measured by the benchmark Standard & Poor’s 500 index, will end 2015. It basically gives you an idea if the strategist is bullish or bearish on the market’s prospects. The S&P 500 closed Tuesday at 2039.68. So, a year-end 2015 target of 2240 basically equates to a 10% gain. A year-end target for next year that’s lower than where the market ends 2014 means the strategist is predicting a down year.
2. Key investment themes. Price targets alone don’t provide much information. What an investor really wants to know is what could drive stock prices up — or down. For example, listen closely to what Wall Street has to say about the Federal Reserve’s transition to higher interest rates and whether that will cause turbulence. Or the effect of a Republican-controlled Congress. With U.S. stocks at record highs, is the U.S. still the place to be? Or are there foreign markets trading cheaper that offer better long-term opportunities. Are there any potential shocks out there?
3. Profit forecasts. Profits are the gas that drives the market engine. What’s the 2015 earnings outlook? What will drive profits?

The Financial Times has declared that Thomas Piketty's Capital In The Twenty-First Century is the best business book of the year, which kinda-sorta makes up for that time it declared the book was riddled with errors.
In fact, the FT editor who criticized the French economist's blockbuster, 700-page tome on inequality is sticking by his critique, even after his newspaper on Tuesday named Capital the winner of the 2014 Financial Times and McKinsey Business Book of the Year Award .
Capital, for the uninitiated, warns that unfettered capitalism tends to widen the gulf between the haves and the have-nots, and that the major economies of the world could be doomed to Gilded Age-style inequality if they don't take steps to stop it. It was, unexpectedly, a red-hot bestseller , exposing broad public anxiety about the fairness of the global economy.
It was not universally praised. Back in May, FT economics editor Chris Giles started a weeks-long brawl with Piketty by saying the book was "undercut by errors" and that "the rock-star French economist appears to have got his sums wrong."
After a lot of back-and-forth between Giles and Piketty on the Internet, several economists came to Piketty's defense , saying Giles' critique had not landed any real blows on the work.
Now the FT itself seems to have come down on Piketty's side, too.
"Capital in the Twenty-First Century emerged after vigorous debate from an incredibly strong field," FT editor Lionel Barber, who chaired the panel of judges that picked the book, said in a press release. "While not everyone agreed on the policy prescription, we recognised the quality of the scholarship. It’s a challenging but ultimately important book."
That has not stopped criticisms of the book's data and conclusions. Salim Furth, an economist at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, criticized Piketty's data on Swedish inequality on Wednesday, in a Wall Street Journal blog post.
Giles himself continued to slam the book's data, in a Policy Exchange panel discussion on Tuesday. "Truth-telling with data is important, and I don't think this book does it," Giles said.
In that talk, which happened just hours before the FT's announcement of the business-book award, Giles took a moment to acknowledge the strangeness of the situation: "It is perfectly possible, given the eclectic organization that the FT is, that we will say Capital is the business book of the year and also sort of slagged it off at the same time this year."
The Financial Times did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Giles declined additional comment.
This post has been updated to reflect that Giles declined to make additional comment.

Microsoft fixes 19-yr-old undiscovered Windows bugIBM Corp
(Microsoft Corp issued patches…)
Microsoft Corp issued patches on Tuesday to fix a bug in its Windows operating system that remained undiscovered for 19 years.
The bug, which is present in every version of Microsoft Windows from Windows 95 onward, allows an attacker to remotely take over and control a computer.
IBM Corp's cybersecurity research team discovered the bug in May, describing it as a "significant vulnerability" in the operating system.
"The buggy code is at least 19 years old and has been remotely exploitable for the past 18 years," IBM X-Force research team said in its blog on Tuesday.

PTI Nov 13, 2014, 12.58AM IST
(The notification also said…)
CHENNAI: AIADMK chief Jayalalithaa is disqualified from contesting elections for ten years, the Tamil Nadu government has said in a gazette notification.
"Consequent upon the conviction of Selvi J Jayalalithaa, Member of the Legislative Assembly, she stands disqualified for being a Member of the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly from the date of conviction, i.e., the 27th day of September, 2014 for the period of her sentence (four years)," the gazette notification dated November 8 read. It was issued by Speaker of the Tamil Nadu Assembly P Dhanapal.
It also said that she "shall continue to be disqualified for a further period of six years since her release in terms of the existing Section 8 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951."
The notification also said that Srirangam Assembly Constituency, represented by Jayalalithaa "shall be deemed to have become vacant from the date of her conviction," September 27.
Although media was given to understand on November 9 that a notification declaring Srirangam seat as vacant was issued, only today it has been officially released by the state government.
Also, the details pertaining to disqualification has become known only today.
Jayalalithaa was convicted and sentenced to four years in jail besides a fine of Rs 100 crore in a 18-year-old disproportionate assets case by a special court in Bangalore. She was released from jail in Bangalore on October 17 as per the Supreme Court order granting her bail in the case.

Yahoo’s (YHOO) $640 million purchase of digital video ad firm BrightRoll is the latest big purchase by the company looking to reassert itself in a changing media world — by buying smaller companies.
The media company has bought or invested in 49 different companies with a disclosed value of $2.1 billion since CEO Marissa Mayer took the CEO role on July 17, 2012, according to a USA TODAY review of data from S&P Capital IQ. Yahoo disclosed the buyout values of eight of the 49 deals, so the total spent is higher than $2.1 billion.
BrightRoll ranks as the second largest buy Yahoo has made under Marissa Mayer’s leadership at $640 million. The only deal that was larger was $1.1 billion buyout of online app Tumblr announced in May 2013.
Much of Yahoo’s ability to aggressively buy smaller companies with promising technology is connected to the company’s good fortune in owning a large stake of Alibaba (BABA) shares. Yahoo raised $8.3 billion by selling 121.7 million shares in the Alibaba initial public offering months ago. That added to Yahoo’s financial firepower — giving it the ability to go on a shopping spree. Yahoo reported having $111.8 billion in cash and short-term investments as of September, giving the company a massive warchest to pursue deals.
And there’s more where that came from. Yahoo is still sitting on 401.8 million more shares of Alibaba that are worth $47.8 billion at Alibaba’s current price of $119 a share.
Investors appear to approve of Yahoo’s latest purchase. Shares of Yahoo are up $1.50, or 3%, to $50.54. Shares are up nearly 25% this year.

Have you hugged a cured Ebola patient todayBy Abby Phillip November 12 Follow @abbydphillip

If there’s one thing we’ve learned since Ebola hysteria took hold of the American public, it’s that Ebola patients need hugs. Lots of them.
There is an art to Ebola hugs. The proper method is face first, arms open. If you’re giving a cured Ebola patient a side hug, you’re doing it wrong.
The point of the exercise is chest-to-chest contact — the kind that clearly signals openness and confidence that the patient is free of the deadly virus.
When hugging a newly cured Ebola patient, you are providing a few invaluable services to society. The patient in question has probably spent weeks bereft of human touch. Ebola victims are essentially isolated in their own skin, touched only by the cold sting of a needle and latex gloves.
Even the sight of a human face is a rare occurrence. So hugging one, touching one, must feel like getting cup of hot chocolate from your mom on a rainy day.
In the West Africa countries where the Ebola epidemic has been raging for months, only the lucky few who survive are able to provide much needed human comfort in Ebola wards.
Then there’s the part where you, the hugger, provide a service to humanity by galling the people who believe that recovered Ebola patients who are  virus-free are still contagious . You probably should hug an Ebola patient anyway, but that’s an added bonus.
Here are a few examples of doing it right:

D.C. museum launches crowdfunding campaign to raise money for Jacob Lawrence websiteBy Peggy McGlone November 12 Follow https://twitter.com/PeggyMcGlone
Jacob Lawrence with Panel 55 from The Migration Series, c. 1941. US National Archives and Records Administration, Harmon Foundation Collection.
The Phillips Collection wants to share its vast collection of scholarship, photographs and interviews with preeminent African-American artist Jacob Lawrence by creating a special website devoted to his life and work.
But it needs the public to chip in to pay for it.
Phillips’ officials have raised $80,000 of the $125,000 required for what they are calling a “robust microsite” featuring images of all 60 panels of Lawrence’s masterwork, “The Migration Series,” as well as unpublished interviews conducted by Phillips curators in 1992 and 2000, just before his death.
The museum is asking the public to cover the $45,000 balance, and has set up an appeal at the crowd-funding website , Indiegogo.com. The campaign continues through Dec. 10.
The Lawrence microsite will debut next summer, marking the opening of the exhibition, “Jacob Lawrence: The Migration Series,” at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. The show will move to the Phillips in the fall of 2016.
“The Migration Series” depicts the northern exodus of African-Americans from the rural south between the world wars. The Phillips hosted Lawrence’s first solo museum exhibition in 1942, and the following year it purchased the odd-numbered panels. MOMA has the other half of the series in its collection.
“To this day, ‘The Migration Series’ resonates with the American experience – themes of struggle, freedom, and the search for a better life,” Phillips Curator Elsa Smithgall said in a statement announcing the campaign. The site will allow the public to understand the series “within the dynamic cultural context of its time.”
The Phillips has organized several national tours of the Lawrence’s work, including a 2000 retrospective and a National Endowment for the Arts American Masterpieces exhibition .
Phillips officials created this video to show their plans for the site.

Fast Food Marketing Disproportionately Targets Kids In Black Neighborhoods  Study Findsreddit

New York City artist, Sally Davies, bought a Happy Meal six months ago on April 10, after observing and photographing it daily, the meal showed no sign of deccomposition. A McDonaldï¿½s spokesperson said, ï¿½This is nothing more than an outlandish claim and is completely false.ï¿½        AFP PHOTO/Karen BLEIER (Photo credit should read KAREN BLEIER/AFP/Getty Images)
Kids are a lucrative prize for the fast food industry: Studies have found that kids can form strong bonds with certain brands, and that those bonds can last for their entire lives.
A new study from Arizona State University has found that fast food restaurants more aggressively target certain kinds of children with marketing: specifically children living in middle-income neighborhoods, rural communities and majority black neighborhoods. The research will be published in the December edition of the American Journal of Preventive Medicine.
For the study, researchers from Arizona State University, the University of Illinois at Chicago and Barker Bi-Coastal Health Consultants, Inc., analyzed 6,716 fast food restaurants around the country. The researchers studied fast food chains with at least 20 restaurants, and did not distinguish between corporate-owned and franchised outfits.
The study looked at interior marketing tactics, like play areas and displays of meal toys, and exterior strategies, like posters of cartoon and movie characters and images of toys displayed outside the restaurants. The study did not analyze advertisements for children in the media, including tactics like TV commercials and digital ads.
The researchers found that one-fifth of the fast food restaurants they studied utilized the in-store child-directed marketing tactics they were looking for. And the stores that did were more likely to be located in certain communities: Fast food restaurants in predominantly black neighborhoods were about 67 percent more likely to use child-directed marketing than those in white neighborhoods. Additionally, restaurants in rural areas were 40 percent more likely to use these tactics than those in urban areas.
Fast food restaurants in poor neighborhoods only used child-directed marketing about 4 percent more than restaurants in high-income neighborhoods, the researchers found. But middle-income neighborhoods, defined as the 25th-75th percentile of median incomes, stuck out: Restaurants in those areas were 28 to 34 percent more likely to use interior and exterior marketing focused on children than restaurants in upper-income neighborhoods.
Chain restaurants were more than 6 times more likely to use these strategies than independent restaurants, the researchers found.
Fast food restaurants allocated roughly $700 million to market towards children and teens in 2009, Punam Ohri-Vachaspati, the lead researcher on the study and an associate professor of nutrition at Arizona State University, said in a press release about the research .
"Marketing food to children is of great concern not only because it affects their current consumption patterns, but also because it may affect their taste and preferences," Ohri-Vachaspati said. "We know that consumption of fast food in children may lead to obesity or poorer health, and that low income and minority children eat fast food more often."
While it may seem counterintuitive that researchers found more child-focused marketing in rural areas than in urban ones, Sriram Madhusoodanan, a spokesperson for Corporate Accountability International, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group, told The Huffington Post that the "lack of access to fast food alternatives" in rural  and low-income areas drives fast food companies to enter the communities and market more intensively. Madhusoodanan's group pushes for fast food companies to be subject to tighter marketing and health standards.
Madhusoodanan drew a parallel between the tactics of fast food chains and tobacco companies.
"This really the same cradle-to-grave marketing strategy that tobacco used: Hook them early and hook them for life," said Madhusoodanan.
Over the last 30 years, childhood obesity has doubled and adolescent obesity has quadrupled. Forty percent of 12-to-19-year-olds eat at a fast food restaurant on any given day, according to a November 2012 study in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine.

LOS ANGELES -- Remember the Fisker?
It was only a couple years ago that auto designer Henrik Fisker was perceived as being fender-to-fender with Tesla Motors when it came to developing a plug-in car. But Fisker fell apart as Tesla soared.
Now Fisker is back, teaming Galpin Auto Sports in Los Angeles, the performance arm of the nation's largest auto dealer, on a new venture that comes billed as the "ultimate American muscle car." Other than that it is being made of carbon fiber, few other details are being disclosed. It appears, though, that it's not a whole new car. Rather, it's believed to be Fisker and Galpin's riffs on a Ford Mustang.
This much is sure: It will be unveiled at next week's Los Angeles Auto Show. The teaser drawing shows a low-slung fastback. As for Fisker, he is best known for the only model his company produced, the Karma, an attractive plug-in hybrid. A second, smaller model, the Atlantic, never got off the ground.
So far, all we have is a teaser photo. But there will be more, much more.

CNN  Fox News: Two networks  two diametrically opposed audience viewpoints on cops and raceBy Erik Wemple November 12 Follow @ErikWemple
(screen shot)
On his Fox News program last night, King of Cable News Bill O’Reilly launched an elbow at claims that the police in this country discriminate against black people: “All over the U.S.A., liberal pundits continue to say that blacks are being mistreated by society in general, but especially by the police,” said O’Reilly , for whom “liberal pundits” is longhand for “weenies.”
Those words coincide with the publication of a stunning little set of data courtesy of the Public Religion Research Institute . Along with many other questions, a survey by this organization asked folks whether they agreed or disagreed with the notion that “Police officers generally treat blacks and other minorities the same as whites.”
Those who named O’Reilly and his colleagues as their most trusted TV source, found the survey, agreed to the tune of 71 percent to 25 percent.
For CNN? Simply flip the numbers: Just 26 percent of those who named CNN their most trusted TV source agreed with that idea, as opposed to the 72 percent who disagreed with it.
Stunning? Not as a general proposition, given that everyone knows that in 2014, cable news networks cater to different self-identities. The nearly symmetrical mirror image, however, is jarring.

Perrys presidential platformTexas governor — soon to be ex-governor — Rick Perry (R) is heading to New Hampshire this weekend. News reports previewed what may become the core of a presidential campaign message :
Gov. Rick Perry shakes hands with National Guard troops in August. (AP Photo/San Antonio Express-News, William Luther)
Perry outlined the three areas where he thinks Republicans should focus their attention: Energy, tax policy and securing the border. He also criticized Obama’s foreign policy and spoke about the need to rebuild the U.S. military.
Republicans in the U.S. Senate can show leadership by voting to approve the Keystone XL pipeline and working quickly to secure the border, Perry said. At the federal and state level, Republican lawmakers should revamp corporate tax laws, he said. Perry also said the country’s foreign policy is “mired in confusion and lacking in clarity,” and he named Russia, Iran and the Islamic State group as threats to the United States and world stability.
“If peace is what we seek, the answer is not to withdraw from threats abroad,” he said, according to prepared remarks.
It is a promising start. While he has said he won’t decide until May or June if he will run, he is further along than many potential candidates, having established leadership bona fides in recent border and Ebola crises and heightened his credibility as a conservative hawk. If he wants to continue putting distance between himself and other potential candidates and show he has a serious and detailed agenda, he might consider:
1. Declaring flat-out that he will not implement any Iran deal not ratified by Congress and not conforming to the president’s own previous standards (e.g. disable Fordow and the Arak facilities, dismantle centrifuges, obtain a full accounting of Iran’s past illicit nuclear activities).
2. Proposing a specific defense spending plan, which at minimum follows the pre-sequester budget plan put forth by former defense secretary Robert Gates.
3. Being clear that the current war plan for fighting the Islamic State is patently insufficient and that time is not on our side as the terrorist forces gain resources, confidence and strength. Promising to restore the relationship between civilian and military leaders.
4. Pledging to return to the 2008 regulatory status quo with regard to the Environmental Protection Agency and then consider which, if any, subsequent regulations are necessary. An regulations reinstated or subsequently enacted must include cost and the effect on jobs in the assessment.
5. Proposing a reform of unemployment insurance that encourages the unemployed to move where the jobs are and helps them do so.
6. Pledging to keep the Internet free from government regulation.
7. Promising to block-grant Medicaid to states like Indiana that can provide superior care while cutting costs.
8. Setting out a pro-jobs agenda: Expanding the earned income tax credit for the working poor, designating new prospects for free-trade agreements and increasing H1-B visas for high-tech jobs that cannot be filled by Americans.
9.  Eradicating every Obama executive order and beginning anew.
10. Promise an era of good manners with no feet on the desk and no gum-chewing .

Cofield eager to rejoin RedskinsBy Liz Clarke November 12 Follow @lizclarketweet
Nose tackle Barry Cofield last played against the Texans on Sept. 5. (John McDonnell/The Washington Post)
Freshly activated from Washington’s short-term injury list, Washington nose tackle Barry Cofield spoke Wednesday about how hard he has worked to recover from surgery to repair a nagging groin strain, and rehabilitate a high-ankle strain on top of that.
But Cofield told reporters they’d be making assumptions to presume that he’ll reclaim his starting spot at the center of the defensive line, which has been ably filled by third-year player Chris Baker in his absence, for Sunday’s game against Tampa Bay.
“We’ve got some creative coaches, so you never know what formation we’re going to be,” Cofield said. “We have position versatility, so we will be all over the place.
“[Baker] has been playing great at nose, so why would I come in and bother that situation? We’ll see how it shakes out. Sunday hopefully the Buccaneers will be guessing to try and figure out where I’m going to be lined up at.”
Under NFL rules, Cofield, 30, couldn’t have returned to Washington’s active roster before this week. He said he needed the full time, in retrospect, to recover from two injuries this fall. He also underwent surgery on a hernia in the offseason.
“It was a beast, especially with the groin surgery and the ankle — it’s like you can’t attack either one because you have to be cognizant of both,” Cofield said. “I used every single day. The rehab was perfect, and I feel great now.”
Cofield said that he was in middle school the last time he went nine weeks without playing football in the fall. Forced to watch the Redskins’ first nine games rather than take part, he said he came away feeling the defense was close to being good, noting its ranking — 10th in the NFL — in terms of yards allowed.
But with Washington 3-6 , he quickly noted, obviously the unit need to do better at holding down opponents’ scores.
“You’re not a top-10 statistical defense in this league by mistake; you’re doing some things right,” Cofield said. “But at the same time, you give up points — there’s a problem.”
Regardless of where coaches use him, Cofield said he just wants to get back on the field and bring all the energy, effort and confidence he can to “hopefully help get us over that hump.”

Surat buffalo delays Rajdhani now  even as airport chief shuntedoutPrint
By: Express News Service | Surat | Posted: November 13, 2014 2:49 am
What’s large, black, hairy and can slow/stop a train/plane? In an unusual, if morbid, coincidence, buffaloes in Surat have managed to run into giant transport machines twice in the space of six days.
Unfortunately, both animals died, and appear to have been disowned by their owners, who have not come forward to take responsibility or claim compensation so far. Fortunately, no human was hurt.
Around 7.40 pm on Monday, as the Mumbai-Delhi Rajdhani Express neared Bhestan in Surat, a buffalo came in its path. The driver slowed down and dragged the carcass for about a kilometre to Udhna, where he reported the incident to Deputy Station Superintendent B M Maheria. The train was inspected and an angle lock between the engine and the first coach was found damaged. Following repairs, the Rajdhani went on its way.
On November 6, a stray buffalo on the runway at Surat airport had hit a SpiceJet aircraft seconds before take-off, causing greater damage, putting at risk 140 passengers, grounding the battered aircraft, and stopping indefinitely all SpiceJet flights from Surat.
On Wednesday, responsibility for the accident was fixed: the Airports Authority of India transferred Surat airport director S D Sharma to Lilabari airport in North Lakhimpur, Assam.
The action followed a visit to the airport by a team led by the Director General of Civil Aviation (Western Region) A K Sharma, which found that not only had the boundary wall collapsed, even the temporary fencing was broken at several places, giving free passage to cattle to enter the airport.
Runway lights were insufficient too. Sharma himself said, “I know the reason for my transfer, but I have learnt a lot from my experience in Surat.”

They seem to send a lot of people on cricket tours these days. Eighteen to England for a five-Test series and now eighteen to Australia for five weeks of Test cricket.
I can see the thought behind it. When you play at home you have a lot of options and this is another way of providing the tour selectors more choices. But the job of the national selectors is to pick teams, and while this has been a really good selection committee, what they have ended up doing, really, is shortlisting players. And so, with budgets no longer a constraint, you could pick twenty, or a couple more.
It could well be that the fringe players in the Test team are contenders for World Cup spots and that the thinking is that they are better off getting acclimatised rather than playing four-day cricket on Indian pitches. It could well be that you need more quality bowlers in the nets. Or that players will benefit from closer interaction with the coaches. But picking everybody has its side-effects too. Players who know they have no chance can become uninterested tourists and that is natural. Everyone wants to play, that is almost the reason for your existence, but if you are merely hitting a few balls after everyone has gone, it is not much fun. When you are one of sixteen you are probably one injury away from getting a game, in your mind you are sharp.
Having said that, there are a couple of interesting selections. Medium pacers have been done away with, for a start, and so there is no room for Pankaj Singh, Ishwar Pandey or Dhawal Kulkarni. These are not bad cricketers, but on the demanding surfaces in Australia you need to put in a lot to get results. Only Bhuvaneshwar Kumar remains from the medium pace brigade, but he has played himself into a different league. Australia is very different from England though, and it will be interesting to see how he adapts to the conditions. The urge to play three quicker men will be strong.
Karn Sharma is a positive selection, too. He is quicker through the air than Amit Mishra and his leg breaks are a little more muscular, but he is one of three spinners in a team that is unlikely to play more than one in the playing eleven. If the idea is to pick a wicket taking spinner rather than someone who blocks one end, which seemed to be the role Jadeja was assigned in England, it is a good move, but otherwise he will be short of cricket at an age when he should be playing as much as he can.
Suresh Raina is the other interesting pick. It is a big vote of confidence and I won’t be surprised at all if the input has come from Ravi Shastri. We spent continued…

At 37 years, Jayawardene’s career is nearing its end. This is his last visit to India as a cricketer, for he will hang up his boots after the World Cup. Sri Lanka have brought in Lahiru Thirimanne, Dinesh Chandimal, Ajantha Mendis and Shaminda Eranga for the last two matches. Can they lift the team morale? Jayawardene believes there’s still a lot to play for, dead rubbers notwithstanding. In the pre-match press conference on Wednesday, he touched upon many issues. Excerpts:
On his last trip to India
It’s always been a wonderful place to come and I’ve thoroughly enjoyed playing cricket here in India. The memories have been formed from way back in 1998, which was my first tour with the national team. Since then, I’ve been a regular visitor. I’ve very much enjoyed myself. The hospitality is great and the cricket is fantastic. I’m going to enjoy this too, and have good, fond memories.
On Lanka’s Performance
We won both the Test and ODI series in England. But if you see, there are about six-seven players missing from that squad due to injuries and various other reasons. Because of that we gave opportunities to other players. That’s what international cricket is all about. We had a fantastic year so far. We won the Asia Cup and the World T20 before winning in England. The only series we lost was to South Africa at home but we had beaten Pakistan. You can’t take away all the good work that we’ve done throughout the year just because of three bad games we have had here. We will analyse and see what went wrong. Obviously, the performance in all three departments hasn’t been up to the mark and we accept that. Once we get all our players back from injuries and other situations, we will play some good cricket. I’m looking forward to that.
On WC preparations
Things are on the right track. If you take the last two editions of the World Cup, in 2007, no one gave us a chance. At the end of the day, India went out of the group and we came through and went all the way. In the last edition, we handled the pressure and came all the way again. I think we have that knack of rising to the big occasions and handling the pressure… What we need to do is to make sure our preparations are good. After this, we have seven ODIs against England at home, and then another seven matches in New Zealand. That will give us much better preparation.
On the final two continued…

Egypt issues law on extradition of foreigndefendantsBy: Press Trust of India | Cairo | Posted: November 13, 2014 2:40 am
Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi today issued a decree on the extradition of foreign defendants and convicted people to their countries to be tried or serve their sentences.
The law specifies that the General Prosecution has to request the transfer of the defendants and the cabinet has to approve the request, state-run MENA news agency reported.
“The law was issued to uphold the interest of the state and to maintain the international image of Egypt, taking into account that the defendants’ spending to some or all punishment period within their countries will facilitate the process of their social reintegration after serving their sentences,” Presidency Spokesman Alaa Yousef said.
The move comes after an international uproar over the detention of Al-Jazeera journalists in Egypt on charges of supporting the blacklisted Muslim Brotherhood, and spreading false information.

Murali yet to receive Rs 3 crore fromKochiEx- Sri Lankan off-spinner Muttiah Muralitharan is to receive Rs 3 crore approximately. (Source: PTI)

Three years after the termination of the Indian Premier League (IPL) team, Kochi Tuskers, cricketers who represented the franchisee are yet to be paid 35 percent of their fees.
The Indian cricket board, which terminated the contract with the Tuskers after the owners failed to provide a bank guarantee, owe players Rs 9crore of which Rs8.3 crore is to be paid to international cricketers.
Sri Lankan off-spinner Muttiah Muralitharan is to receive Rs 3 crore approximately. “I’ve around Rs 3 crore pending from Kochi Tuskers for the last three years,” Muralithanran told The Indian Express.
“I contacted them but they said because the BCCI took their bank guarantee, they couldn’t pay. I contacted BCCI as well but nothing has happened so far. When the franchise was disbanded, Mr N Srinivasan (the then BCCI president) said the players won’t be affected and their dues will be cleared. At the end of the day, this is the Indian cricket board’s responsibility,” Muralitharan added. The off-spinner was bought for $1.1million at the auction.
Apart from Muralitharan, prominent players like Ravindra Jadeja, VVS Laxman, Mahela Jayawardene and Parthiv Patel too have been waiting for their dues. The BCCI owes Indian players Rs 70 lakh.
A domestic player who did not wish to be named said that a group of cricketers had approached IPL CEO Sundar Raman last year but his response was same as before. “They have been telling us that as the matter is under arbitration,the board can’t encash the bank guarantee. International players are handsomely paid but for domestic players this money counts a lot,” the domestic player said.
BCCI secretary Sanjay Patel wasn’t available for comment but another official on condition of anonymity said that the players will have to wait until the arbitration process is completed to receive their payments.

I colored the new Ted Cruz coloring book so you dont have toBy Sarah Larimer November 12 Follow @slarimer
Today, at approximately 1:20 p.m., I was told to go color.
Specifically, I was told to go color Ted Saves America , the supplement to the Ted Cruz coloring book which is … sort of hilarious. I mean, sure, also patriotic and stuff. But mostly just hilarious. And also, yes ANOTHER indication of the interest in building the Cruz #brand before his
inevitable
likely presidential candidacy. If people buy a Ted Cruz coloring book, how could they not buy his presidential bid? Right? Right?
Anyway, coloring. What an ace way to spend an afternoon, right? Not to be all show-y off-y, but there was also a little celebration down in sports today, which means I got to color while eating cake. It was like reliving the greatest day of kindergarten, minus the recess and the jam hands. But I still felt pretty bad about it.
See, I only joined The Fix's internal Washington Post chatroom yesterday, then almost got myself kicked off by sending too many messages about hockey, and now I'd been given the best assignment. This is not a great way to make friends!
"I'm really good at coloring," Aaron Blake said, as I glumly trudged from the office printer, feeling fairly guilty about how I'd lucked out. I believe him, too! I mean, Aaron wears a tie. I bet he stays in the lines 100 percent of the time.
If this was a contest, Aaron would win. But it's not, which means I win. And so do you! Because man, these new pages are amazing. My efforts are posted below. And shoutout to the guy from graphics who gave me his crayons. You are the true hero of today, sir. You, and Aaron Blake.

Trilateral highway gets ModipushPrime Minister Narendra Modi during 12th India-ASEAN Summit in Nay Pyi Taw in Myanmar on Wednesday. (Source: PTI)
Written by Anil Sasi | Nay Pyi Taw | Posted: November 13, 2014 3:01 am
For India, it could prove to be the reopening of the famed ‘Road to Mandalay’. The proposed India-Myanmar-Thailand trilateral highway, part of which entails linking India to Myanmar and then further to Southeast Asia, is a strategic project that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has taken up as priority.
The progress on the proposed infra link came up for discussion at the PM’s meeting with his Thai counterpart Wednesday on the sidelines of the Asean summit meeting. “The PM is very keen that the infrastructure connection is completed soon,” MEA spokesperson Syed Akbaruddin said on Thursday evening.
A strong push for the completion of the 3,200-km trilateral highway, which could drastically enhance the connectivity between the Mekong sub-region and India and prove to be a game-changer for India’s northeast region, is an important component in the government’s plans to ramp up its “Look East” policy to the newly coined “Act East” policy. The link is expected to be ready by 2018, about two years behind schedule.
The highway project, which is to run from Moreh in Manipur to Mae Sot in Thailand via Mandalay in Myanmar, will ensure that India’s eastern border is opened to a new bus route from Imphal to Mandalay, which would enable travellers to board a bus from Manipur’s capital to reach Mandalay in just over 14 hours. The trilateral highway project, along with the Kaladan multi-modal transit transport model, is one of the cornerstones of the new government’s “Act East” plan.
Kaladan transit
The Kaladan project, when implemented, will connect Kolkata to Sittwe port in Myanmar, and then further to Mizoram by river and road. India and Myanmar had signed a framework agreement in 2008 for its implementation. The construction of a critical section of a ‘port-cum-inland waterway’ Sittwe port with India is about three-quarters complete and is likely to be wrapped up by April. The project is of critical economic and strategic importance to India.

UNSC holds 26th emergency meeting onUkraineThe UNSC is holding its 26th emergency session on Ukraine amid worries about a renewal of full-scale conflict.
By: Associated Press | United Nations | Posted: November 13, 2014 2:55 am
The UN Security Council is holding its 26th emergency session on Ukraine amid worries about a renewal of full-scale conflict in the rebel-held east.
Wednesday’s meeting comes hours after NATO’s top commander said new columns of Russian troops and tanks have rolled into eastern Ukraine, which Moscow promptly denied.
The main eastern city, Donetsk, has seen its heaviest shelling in recent weeks despite a cease-fire signed two months ago between Ukraine and Russia-backed separatists. The cease-fire has been violated almost daily.
US Ambassador Samantha Power told the council that Russia “talks of peace, but it keeps fueling war.”
The Security Council has met repeatedly on Ukraine since the crisis began early this year, but little action can be taken as permanent member Russia has veto power.

Jayant Sinha joins finance ministry  eyes growth uptickJayant Sinha joins finance ministry, eyes growth uptick
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, November 10, 2014
First Published: 23:43 IST(10/11/2014) | Last Updated: 07:25 IST(11/11/2014)
Comments
Jayant Sinha, 51, assumed office on Monday as the minister of state for finance, days before the government begins the formal spadework for next year’s budget, which Prime Minister Narendra Modi has hinted could be “transformational”.
Sinha, son of former finance minister and BJP leader Yashwant Sinha, is being seen by many as the perfect foil, as junior minister, to finance minister Arun Jaitley, amid signs that the government will walk the talk on critical reforms such as easing of land rules, hiking the foreign direct investment cap in insurance and introducing tax restructuring.
“We are expecting growth to pick-up and be on the accelerating trajectory. Hopefully we will cross 6-6.5% next year,” Jayant Sinha said soon after taking charge.
The Indian economy, which until recently was an engine for global growth, has shown signs of clawing out of its deepest slump in 25 years. It grew 5.7% during April-June 2014, from the sub-5% expansion in the last two years.
India’s most ambitious tax reform initiative, the goods and services tax (GST), has entered its final leg. If implemented, GST will dramatically alter tax administration by stitching together a common national market and subsuming local levies such as octroi and excise into a single tax.
The government plans to introduce the Constitution Amendment bill for GST in Parliament’s Winter Session that begins on November 24.
“(GST Bill) has gone through years and years of preparation and consensus building...We are sure of some positive results in this session,” Sinha said.
There is also heightened expectation that the government will be able to get the long-pending Insurance Laws (Amendment) Bill passed in the next session, lifting the foreign investment cap to 49% from the current 26%. “When it comes to Parliament we are confident we will get the support that we require,” he said.
Sinha said creating jobs and keeping inflation low remains the government’s topmost priorities.

No pressure from import lobby  this is the Modi govt: Oil ministerComments
Dharmendra Pradhan, minister of state (independent charge) for oil and gas, wants to provide the common man with affordable LPG cylinders and turn India into an oil refining and petrochemicals hub. He spoke to HT on a range of issues affecting the sector. Excerpts:
You have talked of reforming LPG distribution to benefit the common man. How will you do this?
Targeting LPG subsidy at the right audience after freeing diesel prices is my priority. The direct benefit transfer (DBT, which will transfer subsidies directly to the bank accounts of consumers) for LPG will be implemented across the country on January 1, 2015. Consumers will have to pay the full price of Rs. 810 per 14.2-kg cylinder at the point of purchase.
The subsidy of Rs. 393 per cylinder (for 12 cylinders per year) will then be transferred to the bank accounts of consumers.
Can every consumer afford to pay Rs. 810 at one go? It is a large amount for a large section of our population. So, we need innovative marketing strategies to deliver cylinders to the masses. A large section of society wants LPG in small packs of 2 kg or 5 kg, at a price that he can afford.
So, borrowing a common marketing practice from FMCG companies, which sell shampoo sachets at Rs. 2 each, if I can provide LPG in smaller cylinders, I will make cooking gas affordable for 160 million consumer base.
I am directing state-owned oil companies to make available 5-kg subsidised LPG cylinders on an all-India basis. This will put an end to the black marketing and pilferage of 5-kg cylinders that are currently available only for consumers in hilly and remote locations. That is what I would define as a reform measure that benefits the common man.
Your UPA predecessor, Veerappa Moily, had said the import lobby threatens every oil minister against taking decisions that can cut India’s rising oil import bill, which stood at about $145 billion last year. Your comments?
(Shakes his head vigorously in denial and laughs) My answer to that is: this is the Narendra Modi government.
Have you received any specific proposals from global investors?
Saudi Aramco (Saudi Arabia’s national oil company and one of the world’s largest hydrocarbon majors) is keen to invest in India’s refining and petrochemicals sector after the decision to free the prices of petrol and diesel. The petrochemicals sector offers tremendous growth opportunities for investors.
We need to look beyond our buyer-seller relationship with oil and gas producing countries. India has certain inherent advantages — it is a large market close to the oil and gas producing countries in the Gulf; then, it has a large base of intellectual capital. Many global majors such as Shell and Saudi Aramco have their R&D bases in India (Bangalore).
We can position India as an oil refining and petrochemicals hub to feed other big markets like China, Japan and Korea. Over the last 10 years, we have ignored the economic development. We missed the bus but let’s not waste any more time and act.
When are you coming out with the next round of auctions for oil and gas blocks?
The 10th round of oil and gas blocks offerings (or NELP-10) will come with a new look as we are completely revamping the previous policies and addressing the major concerns of all stakeholders. I’m in no hurry to announce the round till these concerns are addressed. First, the geology of India’s oil and gas blocks has to be mapped scientifically to provide investors with a fair idea on the prospects of blocks.
Then, given our past experience, we are revamping the existing production sharing contracts. We will have to decide whether we will give out the blocks in return for a share of revenues or share of production. I don’t want to commit anything till these issues are addressed. Several blocks were given out in the past but many of them haven’t produced a drop of oil.
I want to look into all these issues before I come out with another round of auctions. All I can say now is that my policies will be transparent and investor friendly.

The NSE Nifty on Tuesday set a fresh high of 8,362.65 points at close while the benchmark BSE Sensex edged higher by 35 points as rate-sensitive realty, banking and auto stocks rose ahead of inflation and IIP data.
The 30-share Sensex resumed higher at 27,911.25 and hovered in a range of 27,996.92 and 27,790.40 in a volatile trade. It closed at 27,910.06, showing a gain of 35.33 points or 0.13%.
The 50-share Nifty closed at historic closing high of 8,362.65, a gain of 18.40 points or 0.22%. It shuttled between 8,378.70 and 8,321.85 in day trade.
"Among day's major market moving news, Brent crude was seen trading below USD 82 per barrel after hitting its four-year low," Rakesh Goyal, the senior vice president of Bonanza Portfolio, said.
Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) bought shares worth a net Rs. 355.30 crore on Monday, according to provisional data from stock exchanges.
"Investors were keeping cautious approach ahead of two crucial data - CPI inflation and IIP data, which is scheduled on November 12, 2014," Religare Securities president of retail distribution, Jayant Manglik, said, adding that the upcoming data would provide the trigger for next directional move.
As many as 16 scrips of the 30 Sensex pack ended higher while 13 finished lower. Tata Motors ended flat.
Major gainers were M&M (2.35%), Tata Steel (1.84%), Gail India (1.63%), Axis Bank (1.42%), HDFC (1.09%), ICICI Bank (1.02%), Larsen & Toubro (0.86%), Reliance Industries (0.85%) and Sun Pharma (0.59%).

Among sectoral indices, the BSE Realty index gained the most by rising 1.05%, followed by Banking index by 0.74% and Auto index by 0.68%.
"Profit booking was seen in the market which dented the movement of indices. Indian corporate earnings are also losing its pace which has forced investors to stay away from the markets," Jignesh Chaudhary, head of research, Veracity Broking Services said.
Indicating firm sentiments, the breadth of the market was positive with BSE midcap index rising 0.72% and smallcap index by 0.24%.
Total market breadth turned positive as 1,579 stocks close in the green while 1,433 finished in the red. The total turnover dropped to Rs. 3,285.02 crore from 3,867.10 crore on Monday.
Among global markets, Japanese stocks led gains which rose by 2.05% on speculation that Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will delay a sales-tax increase in the country. Key indices in Hong Kong and South Korea also rose.

Sensex conquers Mount 28K; don t see a big rally next year: AnalystsBSE sensex
(Most analysts expect the…)
NEW DELHI: After rallying over 200 points in intraday trade, the Sensex lost momentum in late trade, but enthused investors as it closed above the crucial 28,000-mark.
The Sensex closed the day at 28,008.9, up 98.84 points. The Nifty ended the day at 8,383.30, up 20.6 points.
What lies ahead? Analysts say we should not expect a big-bang rally in 2015.
Benchmark indices, namely the Sensex & the Nifty, have rallied over 32 per cent so far in the year 2014, but a similar performance next year might be a little difficult as a lot of positives are already being factored in the price, say analysts.
India has been the top beneficiary of strong foreign flows when compared with other emerging market peers, largely on account of strong macros, stable currency and the Modi factor.
Most analysts expect the market to rally probably by 10 per cent to 15 per cent, while some even expect a negative or flat return for the year 2015.
"Eyeing a 20 per cent return in the next 12 months is far too optimistic and you are absolutely right in saying that India has been one of the top performing markets this year. Year-to-date the Sensex is well above 30 per cent," says Robert Parker, Senior Advisor, Credit Suisse.
"The upside in the Indian market, taking a 12-months view, is probably limited to a further 5 per cent to 10 per cent. Having said that, I reiterate my positive outlook for the Indian economy," he adds.
On Tuesday, global investment bank UBS recommended a target of 9,600 on the Nifty by end-2015, which presents an upside of nearly 15 per cent from current levels. That is half of what the markets delivered in the year 2014.
They remain bullish on Indian equities for the year 2015 considering the fact that the economic growth recovery is underway, which will sustain current valuations.
Unlike the last three years, UBS expects FY16 and FY17 earnings growth estimates of over 15 per cent to be met. The Nifty target of 9,600 is based on top-down expectation of 15 per cent earnings growth in FY16E and 18 per cent growth in FY17E (on a base of 13% in FY15E), explains UBS.
The S&P BSE Sensex rallied to 28,000 for the first time last week and is well on its way to touch 30k by the end of this year, and probably 35000 by December 2015, which only provides an upside of 25 per cent from current levels
According to an ET Now survey of 15 brokerage firms, conducted last month, reveals that most analysts are eyeing a level of 30000-35000 in the next 12 months.
As per the poll, 33 per cent of respondents are of the view that the Sensex could see the levels above 35000 in the next 12 months, while 50 per cent or majority of the respondents see the index trading in the range of 30000-35000. And, only 17 per cent of the respondents see the index hovering in the range of 26000-30000.
The government is making the right noises, moving the right levers, albeit a little slowly, but very-very steadily. But achieving a growth rate of over 6 per cent may take a while.
"Unlike what most market participants would like to believe, running a country is a little different from running the markets. So it is going to take a while to change," says Dipen Sheth, Head-Institutional Research, HDFC Securities.
"It is a huge country. We keep on talking of 125 crore people or what have you, and to get things to steer this big ship around is a little different from taking a quick U-turn on a scooter. We want to see everyday excitement on our screens and that is not going to happen," he adds.
There are some experts who think that the present momentum may not continue for long or in the next year, as the Reserve Bank of India may take a while before it starts cutting rates and the US may well hike interest rates, which would put some bit of pressure on the emerging markets, including India.
"Momentum may not continue as interest rates are going to be raised in the US next year. The RBI is not going to cut rates before FY16. So we can expect significant volatility," says Yogesh Nagaonkar, VP-Institutional Equities, Bonanza Portfolio Ltd.
"The Nifty can give no or negative returns in the next 1 year," he says, adding that the Budget will be the next big trigger for the Indian markets, and if the next Budget fails to live up to the expectations of the market (implementing key reforms such as GST ), then the market will react negatively.
Markets running ahead of fundamentals?
Most economists across brokerages feel that the economy has bottomed out, but will take time to pick up. With factors turning favourable, the growth is expected to gain momentum in FY16.
While the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) has lowered India's growth forecast to 5.4 per cent from 5.7 per cent estimated earlier for the current year, it expects the Indian economy to expand 6.4 per cent next year compared with 5.9 per cent estimated less than two months back in its September'14 interim outlook.
"In terms of underlying economic activity - whether it is credit off-take, auto sales or earnings numbers- it is clear that the economy has not really turned meaningfully," says Saurabh Mukherjea, CEO-Institutional Equities, Ambit Capital.
"My reading is that the second quarter growth will come in well below the Q1 number of 5.7 per cent. We are looking at a number closer to 5%. So there is a concern that the economy has not actually turned in a significant way," he adds.
Mukherjea is of the view that this is a slow recovery and it will take time to overcome the fundamental issues of the economy. The best way to make profit it is buy good-quality names, which will stand the test of time, because you will need to be patient to make money in India, he adds.

Net neutrality  to benefit small cos | Full...'Network neutrality' to benefit small companies, IAMAI backs it

(As subscribers shift to…)
BENGALURU | MUMBAI: Internet businesses and content creators in India have reason to cheer US President Barack Obama's latest endorsement of "network neutrality", the notion that all internet traffic should be treated as equal by service providers.
"We believe that even the smallest player should have non-discriminatory access to the pipes," said the Internet Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) in a statement.
Unlike the US, network neutrality has not become the subject of a major public debate in India yet. However, as subscribers shift to data-based services, telecom operators have been wanting to strike revenue-sharing deals with companies such as WhatsApp and Skype. Telecom operators hope to make up for the income they lose from traditional SMS and voice with these.
Proponents of network neutrality fear that allowing service providers to strike such deals could create a discriminatory environment as comp
anies with money can buy faster internet speeds to reach users and new businesses will lose out in the process.
Delhi-based media entrepreneur Nikhil Pahwa, who has been closely tracking the discussion on network neutrality in India, said, "I'm worried that telecom operators will create gateways to the Internet."Pahwa said that if telcos -- also large internet service providers in the country -- create such gateways, it will stifle new internet businesses. "Big companies will succeed and people like me will have to sign deals with them just to make my content accessible," said Pahwa of Medianama.
The practice of providing free access to certain services such as Facebook, as its founder Mark Zuckerberg proposed on his recent visit to India, is also being questioned for being discriminatory.Telecom company Airtel recently launched One Touch Internet, which al l lows access to a limited set of services for first-time internet users. That could raise the issue of restrictions on access.
"You get a walled garden where you get a set of services and that is also problematic from a neutrality point of view," said Prasanth Sugathan, counsel at Software Freedom Law Center. "People should be given the entire Internet," he said. IAMAI said, "When the network is congested, neutrality will be an issue j and ISPs should facilitate all legitimate internet traffic rather than to block it for commercial or other interests."
On Monday, Obama called for a free and open internet and asked the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to keep the internet neutral by regulating it. Obama said that the internet should be considered as a utility like water or power and all internet traffic should be treated as equal. The CEO of a digital company, who did not want to be named, said, "If the Net isn't neutral, and telcos give their preferred services lower cost of access or faster speed of access, the level of innovation we will see on digital will dramatically reduce, and consumers will only get exposed to services that the telco picks." Internet operators in the US have been lobbying to charge Web companies to facilitate faster access to their services. Telcos in India are yet to take a public stand on the issue.
"As an industry, we are engaged in the debate, but it is hard to take a position before the definition is there," said Rajan Mathews, director general of the Cellular Operators Association of India, the GSM lobby group.
In August, the Trai conducted a seminar on regulating so-called over-the-top (OTT) services such as WhatsApp after telecom companies approached the regulator citing loss of current and future revenue due to data-based services.
However, Trai has said that while it is watching the space, it has no intention of regulating OTT players as of now.

Boxer Sarita Devi faces long ban for refusing medalBoxer Sarita Devi faces long ban for refusing medal
By CHRIS LINES | Associated Press –  Wed 12 Nov, 2014
Print
NEW DELHI: The Indian boxer who refused to accept her Asian Games bronze medal in a protest over the judging can expect a heavy punishment, the head of the sport's governing body AIBA said Wednesday.
L. Sarita Devi lost in the semifinals of the women's lightweight competition at Incheon, South Korea, in September, and tried to give her medal to her opponent at the presentation ceremony as a protest.
Devi and three coaches received indefinite bans — taking in the current women's world championships in South Korea — pending a final ruling of a disciplinary commission.
AIBA president CK Wu told The Associated Press that the commission will make its ruling "very soon" and forecast a strong penalty.
"She will be heavily punished, there will be zero tolerance," Wu said in a telephone interview from Jeju, South Korea, ahead of the AIBA congress. "If you accept being the winner, you have to accept being the loser. If everyone behaved like that, what type of competition will we have?"
Devi, upset about the decision in the 60-kilogram bout, refusing to bend down to let the medal be placed over her neck. She then took the medal and slipped it onto the neck of Park Ji-na, who had been declared the winner of their semifinal bout. The South Korean boxer, an eventual silver medalist, tried to give the bronze medal back to Devi, then left it on the podium.
Sandeep Jajodia, president of Boxing India, last month urged AIBA to revoke Devi's provisional suspension, saying "It was purely an emotional reaction and not pre-planned."
"We don't deny that it was disrespectful toward the code of conduct for athletes but she tendered an unconditional apology," Jajodia said at the time.
But Wu said there can be little forgiveness.
"I said to them, that (apology) doesn't matter, you need to think before you act," Wu told the AP. "She probably will be banned for some time because we want to consider the case that all the referees and judges' decisions need to be respected."
Wu said the controversies over scoring at the Asian Games and allegations of impropriety were possibly caused by a misunderstanding of the new scoring system and heightened measures to prevent influencing of judges.
The new scoring method is a 10-points system like that used in professional boxing, rather than the previous method of counting scoring blows. Judges are now randomly selected from a pool of officials just prior to each bout. And while there are five judges for each bout, only three of the scorecards are randomly chosen by computer to contribute to the result.
"This prevents any possible manipulation because you don't know who are (going to be) the judges," Wu said.

Rohit  Uthappa set for India returnMore
Different goals for rejigged teams
Having already secured the series, India will be targeting a 5-0 sweep to move two points clear of South Africa at the top of the ODI rankings.
By Andrew Fidel Fernando | ESPNcricinfo –  Wed 12 Nov, 2014 5:33 PM IST
Start time 1330 local (0800 GMT)
Big Picture
Virat Kohli during practiceWhere does the series go from here? The three matches so far have almost been carbon copies. India's top order gets runs, with  Shikhar Dhawan  leading the charge; Sri Lanka's bowlers threaten briefly before wilting; Sri Lanka lose wickets early in their innings, then after a short recovery, treat the batting Powerplay like a cliff to hurl themselves off.
It is not easy to work out what either team has to gain from the two remaining matches, so the potential rewards stray into the realm of records and statistics. For India, a 4-1 series win will allow them to retain their rank atop the ODI table, while a whitewash would send them two points clear of second-ranked South Africa.
Virat Kohli  has more time to bed himself in as captain ahead of the Australia tour where he will lead in the first Test, while the likes of  Ajinkya Rahane ,  Ambati Rayudu  and Akshar Patel can further strengthen their World Cup case.
Sri Lanka, meanwhile, have even more nebulous incentives. They can salvage some pride by not going down 5-0, but they will also seek to build momentum ahead of a home series against England, where their World Cup preparation begins in earnest.
Following the third loss, a frustrated  Angelo Mathews  said Sri Lanka could not afford to have their young players so routinely spurn opportunities to win places in the side. With new personnel now having been injected, he will hope the door stops revolving.  Dinesh Chandimal  and  Lahiru Thirimanne have come into the team with some form and match practice from an A-team tour, and Sri Lanka are desperate for them to indicate they are ready for World Cup responsibility.
The match will also be part of Eden Garden's 150th anniversary celebrations. Stamps featuring Cricket Association of Bengal, Jagmohan Dalmiya, and another of the ground itself, have been issued to mark the occasion.
Form guide
(last five matches, most recent first)
India:WWWWW 
Sri Lanka:LLLWW
In the spotlight
Rohit Sharma  will likely return to the top of the order after 10 weeks out with a fractured finger. With  Ajinkya Rahane  now having showcased his opening chops with centuries against England and Sri Lanka, Rohit will want to impose himself on return, to stave away the competition. He does have form on his side, having walloped 142 from 111 balls in the practice match against Sri Lanka, in Mumbai.
The mark of experience is often the ability to contribute to the team, even during a lull in form, and though  Tillakaratne Dilshan  has visibly been some way from his best in the series, he has struggled his way to some runs, hitting a 35 in the second ODI and 53 in Hyderabad. With Sri Lanka having so much trouble finding a reliable opening partner for him, Dilshan knows he is under pressure to provide stability to the top order.
Teams news
India's rejigged squad means  Shikhar Dhawan , the series' top-scorer, will be unavailable for selection alongside wicketkeeper-batsman  Wriddhiman Saha , and  Ishant Sharma . Rohit and  Robin Uthappa  are sure starters, and  Stuart Binny  could also find a spot as an allrounder. With Karn Sharma and  Vinay Kumar  being drafted in for the final two ODIs, India have quite a few options to tinker with their bowling attack. Uthappa will take the gloves, even though he has only kept wicket in eight List-A matches. He has regularly kept in the IPL, however.
India (probable): 1  Ajinkya Rahane , 2  Rohit Sharma , 3  Virat Kohli  (capt), 4  Ambati Rayudu , 5  Suresh Raina , 6  Robin Uthappa  (wk), 7  Stuart Binny  , 8 Akshar Patel, 9 R Ashwin, 10 Dhawal Kulkarni, 11 Umesh Yadav
Thirimanne and Chandimal have a good chance to step into the middle order, while Ashan Priyanjan may have run out of rope.  Ajantha Mendis  and  Shaminda Eranga  may also play, in order to shake up what has been an ineffective attack.
Sri Lanka (probable): 1 Kusal Perera, 2  Tillakaratne Dilshan , 3  Dinesh Chandimal  (wk), 4 Mahela Jayawardene 5  Angelo Mathews  (capt.), 6  Lahiru Thirimanne , 7  Seekkuge Prasanna , 8  Thisara Perera , 9  Nuwan Kulasekara , 10  Ajantha Mendis , 11 Lahiru Gamage/  Shaminda Eranga
Pitch and conditions
Almost everyone, including the Eden Gardens groundstaff, have learned by now that a flat pitch means "bad news for the visitors". Another belter, with "no margin of error for the bowlers" is being prepared in Kolkata. A sunny day is forecast, and dew may be the only meteorological impediment.
 
Stats and trivia
If Sri Lanka win the last two ODIs, it will have been the first time they win more than one match in a bilateral series in India
 
If India win both matches, it will have been the first time they have whitewashed Sri Lanka since 1982.
Ajanthha Mendis has played more matches (17), and taken more wickets (32) against India, than against any other opposition. He averages 23.68 against them, and took 4 for 60 in their last meeting during the Asia Cup this year.
Quotes
"There have been times in the past when I've just been a part of the side - not leading - and you feel like: "Why is that not happening?" or "That could have been done". Captaincy gives me and opportunity to actually open up my vision and the ideas I have, and actually implement them on the field. I strongly believe in whatever I do on the field, and that's why more often than not, we're able to execute those plans."
India captain  Virat Kohli
"We have had a 80% win percentage this year, before this series, and we've been a very consistent team. Three matches here have been disappointing, but it doesn't take away all the good work we've done through the year."
Mahela Jayawardene wants everyone to look at the big picture

U.S.-China climate dealBy Philip Bump November 12 Follow @pbump
President Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing on Wednesday announced a plan for curbing pollution. Combined, the two countries make up 45 percent of the world’s greenhouse-gas emissions. (Reuters)
The climate deal between the United States and China that was announced late Tuesday night won't solve the problem of climate change. It won't, by itself, solve President Obama's political problem of opposition from Republicans and members of his own party. But it does potentially kneecap a potent argument by his opponents, and may represent one of the first big shifts back toward action on the climate.
Potentially. May.
Others have good backgrounds on the deal; the White House produced an outline of the agreement written in White House-ese. In short, it's a handshake deal for China to stop expanding its emissions by 2030 and for the United States to reduce emissions by 2025 further than the mark set by the administration several years ago. How this is done is still a bit nebulous. It includes expansions of clean energy systems and an exploratory carbon capture and storage (CCS) project in China backed by the U.S. and investors.
But the handshake is an important thing. It's the first time the premier of China has agreed to set an upper limit on emissions, after his country's emissions spiked well above the rest of the world in recent years, a side effect of its economic shifts. Combined, China and United States account for more than a third of global carbon dioxide emissions. China was already likely to peak in 2030 anyway ; the U.S. has a number of climate actions already scheduled. Reductions by the two countries are not only essential to try and prevent the warming that science links to increased emissions but also set a path forward for other countries.
That point is key domestically. A staple of opposition to American action on climate change has been the economics at stake; particularly, the idea that if we acted to curb emissions, other countries would be given an economic advantage. Republicans have frequently pointed to the lack of action by major emitters like China and India as a reason for the United States not to step up -- so much so that climate activists put this video together last year.
If China won't cut emissions, the argument went, American reductions wouldn't solve the problem of climate change anyway and we'd be handing them an advantage. This week's agreement deflates that.
The agreement more subtly undermines another key argument against taking climate action: that it would hurt the economy. Analysis of the extent of that damage tends to vary. (Here's international analysis ; when Obama announced planned rules to cut emissions from power plants in June, the Chamber of Commerce and the Natural Resources Defense Council had competing analyses.) The idea of China and the United States pushing more heavily into clean energy means a big, rapid expansion of a market. There's isolationism at play (China and the United States have battled over tariffs on solar power), but things like the inclusion of that CCS project, with the dangling carrot of private investment, could split opposition based on economics.
Much of the opposition to action on climate change is based less on the evidence at hand than on the emergence of climate change as a part of American political culture. That China is acting will almost certainly evolve into, well, let's see when they actually start reducing emissions and/or fine, but what are India and Indonesia doing? This agreement will at best slightly shift the American political landscape over the short term, as was made clear in a statement from Senate-Minority-Leader-for-now Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). McConnell attacked the deal , including turning President Obama's campaign trail words against him: "The president said his policies were on the ballot, and the American people spoke up against them" in last week's elections, McConnell said.
This is an oversimplification, of course, perhaps colored by McConnell's win in coal-friendly Kentucky. National exit polls indicated that 58 percent of voters were concerned about climate change -- even in a conservative electorate. (Long-time climate change opponent and recently reelected Sen. James Inhofe (R-Okla.) has an expectedly energetic dismissal of the plan.) But political wariness extends to Obama's own party. Democrats are still balky about climate issues, thanks in part to concern about where the public stands (or will stand on Election Day). In order to bolster the shaky reelection campaign of Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.), Democrats are considering a vote to approve the Keystone XL pipeline , a key project opposed by the environmental movement.
Even if the agreement simply lets some wind out of opponents' sails, it could be more important internationally. UN Secretary General Ban-Ki Moon praised the deal , suggesting it could crystallize more international action at upcoming talks. Which could, itself, undermine the "we can't act alone" mantra even further.
But it's also a reminder of more concrete risks for Obama. He's got 26 more months as president, a blink in the timescale of climate action (and effects). If, say, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) is sworn into office in two years, will he maintain his skepticism about climate action in light of international circumstances?
You may recall the last time a Republican president took over for a two-term Democrat who'd made an important international agreement on climate action. That was George W. Bush, who quickly scuttled any action on the Kyoto Protocol . The politics in 2001 were very different than they are today. The politics on January 20, 2017, could be very different, too.

Govt to complete coal block allotment by Fe...Anil Swarup
(The government is planning…)
NEW DELHI: The government is planning to complete coal block allocation through auction by February next year, a top official said today.
"As per our plan, as of now, we plan to complete the exercise (of coal blocks allotment through auction) by February 28...We have defined timelines for each set of activities," Coal Secretary Anil Swarup told a private TV news channel.
"I can't give you the exact date of auction because we are debating on a few issues and once we are able to do that we will be probably able to announce the date as well," he said.
Around 74 coal mines are likely to be put up for sale in the first round of auction.
The Supreme Court had in September had quashed allocation of 204 coal blocks alloted to various companies since 1993 terming it as "fatally flawed", and allowed the Centre to take over operation of 42 such blocks which are functional.
Replying to another question, Swarup said the target of doubling the domestic coal production from current 490 million tonnes was "eminently doable" and within a month's time the ministry will come out with a strategy paper for taking it to one billion tonnes annually by 2019.
"We are trying to identify such dimensions which will enable it ( Coal India ) to double its production and hopefully within a month's time we will come out with a clear-cut strategy paper to see how it could be doubled in the next five years," he said.
He said the problem is not the availability of coal but its evacuation
When asked whether the government has prepared any blue- print on evacuation of coal he said: "Ya, absolutely...our strategy papers will incorporate more details, let me give you example of three critical railways lines each in Chhattisgharh, Jharkhand and Odisha which when they are fully operational will add evacuation to the tune of around 200 million tonnes."
Swarup also expressed hope that the critical rail link in Odisha will be operational in December 2017.
"Railway line in Odisha will be operational in December 2017 much before 2019 that we are talking of. So there is lot of interaction with railways. We are discussing with state governments to resolve the issues....similary we are looking at various other aspects."
He said the government is planning to more than double the rakes used for coal evacuation. At present, about 200 rakes are being used for evacuating coal.
The Secretary also expressed hopes that the coal blocks auction would be successful.
"What we are trying to do is first interact with all the stakeholders...We are in touch with various federations, associations. We are digging a lot of input. So we are hopeful that given what we experienced in the past and given these inputs these auction should be successful," Swarup said.
When asked will the public sector entities will pay the exact price that is arrived at through the auction, he said, "There will be no auction of such mines that are going to be alloted to state government or entities...Reserve price will have to be predetermined and they will have to pay that reserve price."
On pooling the price of domestic and imported coal, he said, "We are at this point in time not considering it because we are focusing on the auction."

IT services ind should look into new heights...CeBIT India 2014
(Sikka, who has the ardent…)
BENGALURU: Infosys CEO Vishal Sikka , who has the ardent task of reviving the company, today criticised the Indian IT industry's business practice of "doing old things cheaper" and said firms should innovate more.
"As I speak to you it is my 100th day as the CEO of Infosys. I was not deeply familiar with the services industry until recently. As I had thought about the opportunities in front of us and the current state of Infosys, I see a tale of two cities," Sikka said.
In his recorded key note address through video at CeBIT India 2014 here, he said, "I find that on the one hand we have a great opportunity in front of us to help accelerate the reshaping of world with software. But at the same time, I also see the reality that we are currently in - that is a somewhat depressing reality."
"I find all of us in the industry find ourselves on a downward spiral. It's like a treadmill of increasingly lower cost, hiring people faster and faster from more and more mediocre places, training people less and less, putting them into job faster and faster. I think that is a wrong direction," he added.
Sikka, the first outsider who has not been part of the co-founder's club to lead the Bangalore-based firm, became the CEO of the company earlier this year at a time when fortunes of once-IT-bellwether were down and rivals were doing relatively better. He has come from US-based SAP.
CeBIT India, billed as world's largest business IT and ICT event, is being held in association with Bangalore ITE.biz, India's flagship ICT event of Karnataka Government.
Stating that there is a better direction Sikka said, "I think we can do better than that. I think that we can be partners of our clients not only Infosys, but all of us in the industry, to be strategically relevant to them."
"To work with them on the challenges that they face not only on lowering costs, labour arbitrage and staff augmentation. They are depressing ideas. I think we can do better than that,"
Sikka said, "We can be much greater strategic partners to our clients on the basis of innovation, intelligence, automation and techniques, instead of looking at doing old things cheaper, we should look at doing new things."
Sikka is part of the business delegation that is accompanying Prime Minister Narendra Modi on his three nation tour to Myanmar, Australia and Fiji that is on currently.

ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
NEW DELHI: The second mission to Mars could be between 2018-2020, but may not be similar to the Orbiter Mission launched last year, ISRO chief K Radhakrishnan said today.
"MOM is not an end, but a beginining of our next scientific mission. The next mission to Mars may happen between 2018 to 2020. It may necessarily not be an Orbiter Mission like MOM. We need to get feedback from the scientific community on what kind of project would this be," he said.
The ISRO chief was speaking at a book launch of 'Reaching for the stars: India's journey to Mars and Beyond' authored by eminient science journalist Pallava Bagla and Subhadra Menon. The entire team of senior ISRO scientists who had played a key role in the Mars Mission was present at the launch.
Kiran Kumar, Director, Space Applications Centre of ISRO said that the ISRO was "checking and cross checking" the data sent by MOM as it had to undergo through rigorous process of experiments to be accepeted by the world. "Science does not come easy. Observations needs to be validated," he said.
Radhakrishnan said that the next mission would also focus on Chandrayan 2- the Moon Mission- in which India will have a lander and a rover in three-year's time and Aditya, ISRO Sun Mission.
"In one year, we will also launch Astrosat satellite, a multiwave observatory," he said.
In an interaction with the scientists, S Arunan, Project Director, MOM said that while undertaking the mission, ISRO had studied failures of the mission undertaken by other countries. India is the first country to have achieved success in its first attempt.
"For some 2-3 months we studied from the failures of other countries who had undertaken the mission. So, we learnt from the failures of others. Risk was well mitigated in advance," he said.

Goa CM s son gives Cong leader  last warning  on FacebookGoa CM's son gives Congress leader 'last warning'
By Indo Asian News Service | IANS –  Wed 12 Nov, 2014
Print
Panaji: Goa's new Chief Minister Laxmikant Parsekar may have barely completed a day in office, but his son Rishi created ripples on Facebook by issuing a "last warning" to a Congress leader.
Late Tuesday, Rishi took to the social networking site to rebut allegations made by a Congress leader, accusing him of being present at an illegally organised bullfight in his father's legislative constituency of Mandrem.
Rishi, 21, whose social media profile claims he is a singer, musician, student and a real-estate businessman, claims that the charge levelled by Congress organising secretary Durgadas Kamat was baseless.
Rishi issued him a "last warning", and signed off the Facebook post as "CM's Son".
Rishi's clarification post says: "Dear Durgadas Kamat, Please reveal the rest of the photos too... let me see myself at a venue when actually I do not exist there. I seriously wont tolerate this kind of shit. Please take a note of it..!! boss DK (i mean to say Boss durgadas kamat) (adds a smiley), get correct information first and then post on fb! Regards, 'CM's Son'."
Earlier during the day, Kamat, uploading two photos of buffalo and bull fights with people ringed around the animals in both instances, alleged that the fights (dhirio) were held in Mandrem.
"Dhirio in presence of CM's Son," Kamat said while appealing to animal lovers to condemn the fight. Rishi, however, does not feature in the images uploaded by Kamat in his Facebook post.
Later, while hash-tagging another friend into the comments section, Rishi says: "This gona b last warning for him.. if again he does then i won't waste time showing him real me (adds smiley)."
Once a popular tradition, bull fights or dhirio were subsequently banned by the Bombay High Court bench in Goa on grounds of cruelty to the specially reared fighter bulls.
But that has not stopped the bull fight aficionados from organising fights illegally using Facebook, Whatsapp and SMSes to alert eager audience about a scheduled bull fight mainly in coastal Goan villages, like Agacaim, Mandrem, and Benaulim.
Incidentally, the person who first alerted the media about a bull fight being organised in Parsekar's constituency was Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator Vishnu Wagh.

Posco to invest $20 mn in Guj: Korean ambass...Anandi Patel
(South Korean steel giant…)
AHMEDABAD: South Korean steel giant Posco will establish a coil mill in Gujarat with investment of around $20 million, the country's Indian envoy said today.
"Posco is a big name in steel, they have decided to start a coil mill, probably steel coil, in Gujarat. That investment will be about 20 million. I do not know the area where they will start it. The project is already decided," Ambassador Joongyu Lee told reporters.
Lee, who was here to mark celebration of Korea day, also said that the state government had proposed `Exclusive Industrial Zone' for Korean companies. He added that there is already an exclusive industrial zone for Korean firms in Rajasthan.
Earlier in the day, Lee met Chief Minister Anandi Patel . A delegation of about 15 industrialists accompanied him.
"Apart from the big industries, I am encouraging SMEs (small and medium enterprises) to come and start business here in Gujarat," he said, adding that even the giants like LG and Samsung can think of Gujarat as a destination.
"We are going to do such event (Korea day) every year in two Indian states and this time we are doing it here in Gujarat and in Maharashtra.
He also praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi's `clean India' and 'make in India' campaigns.
"I always recall (when thinking of Modi) our late president Park Chung-hee. He did huge work for Korea. He always used to address the economic development and also did such campaigns. I very strongly feel Modi is like the late president Park Chung hee," Lee added.
"Korea's total investment in India, at present, is 3.5 million dollars but I am not satisfied with the amount with the inauguration of Modi government and with the new government policy I expect rapid investment in India in future," Lee said.

10 Reasons to Focus on Your Strengths -- No Matter What Your Job Description Saysreddit
Have you ever found yourself stuck in a job you really weren't enjoying? Perhaps you needed the money?  Or maybe you needed to stay for your resume?  Or possibly you weren't sure what else you wanted to be doing?
Several years ago my boss asked me to take on a project I really didn't want to be doing for a host of good reasons: it wasn't work I enjoyed; the team's morale was at rock bottom and; it had already failed several times.  Unfortunately, being promoted to the job of my dreams required me to deliver this project successfully.
Desperate for an effective way through this project, I decided to see if working from our strengths -- those things we were good at and actually enjoyed doing -- would make delivering the expected results any easier.
You see a growing body of research is finding that people who use their strengths more at work:
1. Are happier - studies have found they report lower levels of depression, higher levels of vitality and good mental health.
2. Experience less stress - studies have found they report higher levels of positivity; and in particular the character strengths of Kindness, Social Intelligence, Self-regulation and Perspective appear to create a buffer against the negative effects of stress and trauma.
3. Feel healthier and have more energy - studies have found that greater endorsement of character strengths is associated with a number of healthy behaviors including leading an active life, pursuing enjoyable activities and eating well.
4. Feel more satisfied with their lives - studies have found individuals who are satisfied with life are good problems-solvers, show better work performance, tend to be more resistant to stress and experience better physical health.
5. Are more confident - studies have found that both strengths knowledge and strengths-use are significantly associated with self-efficacy, self-esteem, self-acceptance and self-confidence.
6. Experience faster growth and development - studies have found that positive self-monitoring and strengths building are particularly suited to circumstances when you're learning something new, something difficult or something perceived as difficult.
7. Are more creative and agile at work - studies have found that the feelings of authenticity, vitality and concentration created by developing strengths help people to better adapt to change, engage in more creative and proactive behaviors, pay more attention to detail and work harder.
8. Feel more satisfied and experience more meaning in their work - studies have found that people who use four or more of their top character strengths at work are more likely to experience job satisfaction, pleasure, engagement and meaning in their work.
9. Are more engaged in their work - studies have found that employees who have the opportunity to regularly use their strengths at work each day are up to six times more engaged in what they're doing.
10. And managers who focus on people's strengths experience improved team performance and greater success. Studies have found that leaders who focus on the strengths of employees benefit from lower levels of staff turnover, higher levels of productivity, more satisfied customers and greater profitability.
Developing our strengths wasn't a requirement mentioned in any of our job descriptions, but by finding small ways each day to do what we did best we were able to start feeling more engaged and energized about this dreaded project.
There was nothing expensive or difficult in our approach; we simply learned to value and work to our strengths. For example, we channeled our strength of Curiosity to find more effective ways to communicate; we unleashed our strength of Creativity to better connect with people's hopes around the project; and we focused on our strength of Gratitude to attract more resources and supporters for what we were doing.
As a result, not only did we manage to deliver the project on time and on budget, but we exceeded every independent measure of success that had been set for employee engagement and customer satisfaction.
Each of my team members still describe this project as one of the highlights of their careers.   As for me, I scored the job of my dreams and went on to teach thousands of other employees across our organization how to use their strengths at work.
What might you achieve if you -- and your team -- had could find small ways each day to do what you do best?  For more than 70 different ideas to apply your strengths at work grab this free e-book .

Seven Ways to Climb Out of Your Boxreddit
I'm sure you've heard the phrase "think outside the box." It's become a cliché among Americans today. We must remember, however, that clichés can be true, even if they're overused. In this case, "think outside the box" contains a timeless truth that leaders must understand if they wish to remain effective in their organizations.
In short, boxes represent conventional thinking: they are assumptions that confine our creativity and ability to see new options. Of course, some assumptions are necessary. We can't make it through a day without assuming the traffic light will turn green or that our desk chair will support us when we sit down. But when assumptions become rigid (or like a box, closed), they can keep us from seeing new possibilities or perspectives.
Take some common assumptions for a moment. Did you know that more people are killed each year by hippos than bears, lions or sharks? It's true, but we don't think of hippos as deadly creatures like we do sharks. What's more, coconuts kill more people each year than sharks. In fact, you are 15 times more likely to be killed by falling coconuts than by sharks. So why don't we fear coconuts as much as we fear sharks? Because we don't view them as deadly. It's an assumption. And ever since we saw the movie, Jaws, we have been paranoid about sharks. (Thank you Stephen Spielberg).
So how do we break out of our box?
Let me offer some simple suggestions you can employ today to stay out of the box:
1. Find mentors outside of your industry.
From time to time, choose people to meet with who work completely outside of your world. They will enable you to see new angles as they're not confined by your boxes.
2. Question everything.
Reflect on all the realities and routines you embrace everyday -- and begin to question all of them. You may hold on to some, but by questioning why you do them, you may find better ideas.
3. Read books outside your normal field of interest.
This one has helped me every year. I will pick up a book that I wouldn't normally consume and power through it. If nothing else, it clears the cobwebs of my current thinking and can give me new perspectives.
4. Learn something new everyday.
This enables you to stay open and teachable, to keep your mind soft and receptive to new ideas and new ways of thinking. Deliberately pursue educating yourself in some new topic or trend, and tell someone what you learned.
5. Do something strange.
I realize this sounds crazy--but sometimes doing something out of the ordinary can get you out of the box. When Dr. Seuss got stuck while writing, he would go to a secret closet filled with hundreds of hats and wear them till words came.
6. Learn to combine unrelated ideas.
Real creativity is usually about combining two existing ideas to make a new one. Steve Jobs said, "Creativity is simply connecting things." Try this exercise: jot down two completely unrelated objects and discover what they could do together.
7. Attempt a goal that's big and different.
Winston Churchill said, "Change is as good as rest." This simply means by changing what you're doing, it's like resting your mind. I have found if I assign myself a project or goal that is unique and gigantic, it pushes my mind in new ways.
When creating the Habitudes® series, I practiced this list. I had been teaching leadership for years, but with limited success. Once I got out of my conventional box and combined my love of art, my love of principles, and my love of interactive learning, a whole new world opened up. When I tried utilizing images, conversations and experiences, something clicked. Today, Habitudes -- Images That Form Leadership Habits and Attitudes are being used in thousands of schools and organizations worldwide. All I had to do was climb out of my box.
Do you ever feel stuck "in the box?" How do you break out?

How to Create a Virtual Summit in 4 Simple StepsAs a leader, you need to be recognized for your passion, magnetism, and ingenuity. You can build this reputation by connecting with other thought leaders, facilitating informative discussions, and getting involved with charitable organizations.
Or you can host a virtual summit to seamlessly accomplish all these tasks at once.
Virtual summits combine the convenience and connectivity of the Internet with the valuable educational opportunities of conferences. But instead of packing a dense block of interviews and discussions into a few days, you can spread them out over several weeks. Viewers can absorb the information in the comfort of their own homes through new levels of interactivity and community.
You don't need access to a massive network and resources to put together a successful virtual summit. I organized the Life on Fire Virtual Summit in just four simple steps that are easy to replicate.
1. Anchor Your Summit
An anchor is a thought leader who's well-known and respected in a particular industry. This person must have a natural ability to attract audiences and followers. If you can secure an influential speaker first, drawing the right people to your virtual summit will be much easier. On the other hand, locking in unrecognizable speakers could make the assembly process more difficult.
Compound your anchors to build a lineup of speakers who will naturally draw your intended audience. Who you choose is crucial because it will dictate the turnout and overall success of the summit.
2. Offer Exceptional Value
Many of the speakers who'll be presenting or interviewing for your virtual summit will likely already have books or webinars available, so you'll have to differentiate your event to encourage attendance. Make sure you emphasize the exclusivity of your summit and the insider information each expert will bring to the sessions.
With virtually no overhead costs, you can make your summit budget-friendly. Highlight its affordable price tag and the flexibility it offers attendees. Members of your audience will be much more inclined to participate in a summit that works with their schedule rather than a two- or three-day marathon of meetings.
3. Partner With a Noble Cause
The educational opportunities your summit offers will already be attractive to potential attendees, but tying your virtual summit to an admirable charity -- something that aligns with your personal and professional values -- will add another dimension to your event.
For the Life on Fire Virtual Summit, I teamed up with Adam Braun from Pencils of Promise and committed to donating the summit proceeds to help build schools in Guatemala. After visiting Guatemala, I was devastated by the fact that children didn't have access to education, capable teachers, or even basic school supplies. When I heard about Pencils of Promise, I could relate to its mission and knew it was the perfect fit.
For your summit, find a charity you're passionate about. It should also coincide with your brand story so the partnership feels natural and authentic to your target audience.
4. Promote Your Summit on Social Media
Be clear about who your target audience is, and use the power of social media to aim your message at those specific people. Envision a detailed persona -- or "customer avatar" -- that embodies your ideal attendee. Consider details such as where they live, which careers they're pursuing, which Facebook Pages they like, or any characteristics that will help zero in on these individuals.
Then, with a highly targeted marketing strategy, you can reach this audience on social media faster and on a smaller budget.
Advertise the charity you've partnered with to this group, and it will elicit an overwhelming amount of interaction with your online content. Outline exactly how attending your event will impact the organization, and broadcast the charitable goals on fundraising platforms such as Indiegogo or Kickstarter to build excitement.
Your event gives people the chance to come together under one virtual roof and engage in one-of-a-kind learning opportunities with little commitment. Remember that advertising an early roster of reputable speakers and a noble cause will generate organic buzz around your virtual event. And with a little social media magic, your summit will be a recipe for success.

Who is still uninsured under Obamacare  and whyBy Jason Millman November 12 Follow @jasonmillman
Open enrollment season is coming. (Photo by Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg)
With open enrollment for Obamacare coming up Saturday, it's a good time to take stock of the tens of millions of people who still don't have insurance coverage.
An additional 10.3 million people gained health insurance in the first year of expanded coverage under the Affordable Care Act, according to an analysis published in the New England Journal of Medicine this summer. We still won't have the most official count from the U.S. Census Bureau until next fall, but that's the number the Obama administration is using. And that, according to the Department of Health and Human Services, leaves about 32 million people still lacking coverage heading into this ACA open enrollment period.
Here's what we know about who's still uninsured and what's kept them from getting covered.
The big picture
One of the best looks at the uninsured right now comes from the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index, which has been tracking the uninsured rate since 2008. The most recent survey from October found that the overall uninsured rate dropped from 18 percent before last year's open enrollment period to 13.4 percent after the sign-up period ended in April. And the rate has remained steady since then.
What about the young invincibles?
There was a lot of attention paid to the young adults in the last enrollment period. They lack insurance more than any other age group, and they're an attractive demographic for insurers to cover because they're relatively healthy. The Gallup survey shows they made coverage gains over the past year, but people between 18 and 34 years old still trail other age groups.
Coverage gains across racial groups
An earlier Gallup poll from June also showed declines in the uninsured rate among whites, blacks and Hispanics. There has been a particularly strong emphasis on enrolling Hispanics, who have the highest rates of uninsurance of any demographic. They're a comparatively younger population, but they also pose enrollment challenges . Gallup showed that their uninsured rate dropped 5.5 percentage points by the end of April.
Geography matters
As expected, the uninsured rate has dropped faster for adults in about half the states that expanded their Medicaid programs, according to the Urban Institute's Health Reform Monitoring Survey. This effect is particularly noticeable in the southern states, which have resisted the Medicaid expansion and is now home to a greater share of uninsured adults. About 4 million people aren't eligible for either Medicaid coverage or the ACA insurance marketplaces in the 23 states that haven't expanded Medicaid.
Slowing progress for kids
The uninsured rate has dropped for pretty much every demographic group this past year — except children , according to another Urban Institute analysis. And it seems that the children's uninsured rate has been leveling off over the past couple of years, according to the Center for Children and Families at Georgetown University. How this rate looks in the future also depends on whether Congress next year reauthorizes the Children's Health Insurance Program, which provides low-cost health coverage to children in families that aren't poor enough to qualify for Medicaid. 
(Georgetown University Health Policy Institute)
Enrollment period? What enrollment period?
As the most recent Kaiser Family Foundation tracking poll shows, it's going to take some extra effort to reach the remaining uninsured. About nine in 10 uninsured adults potentially eligible for marketplace coverage didn't know the enrollment opened again in November. About two-thirds said they knew "only a little" or "nothing at all" about the marketplaces, and just more than half (53 percent) said they didn't know the ACA offers financial assistance to help people purchase insurance.
Why aren't they signing up?
About two-thirds of the uninsured didn't bother looking for coverage in the past enrollment period, according to a report this summer from Enroll America, the national industry-backed group. The most frequent reason people offer for being uninsured — and this is true of basically every survey on the topic — is affordability of coverage. Another Kaiser poll from earlier in the year, just after the first Obamacare enrollment period ended, also showed some confusion about people's obligations to get covered under the law.
Jason Millman covers all things health policy, with a focus on Obamacare implementation. He previously covered health policy for Politico.

Keep feminist aliveBy Alyssa Rosenberg November 12 Follow @AlyssaRosenberg

Time Magazine has made a tradition of asking readers which word they feel they would be well-rid of. And on the list this time is the word “feminist,” which poll conductor Katy Steinmetz dismisses in a rather flip fashion. “You have nothing against feminism itself, but when did it become a thing that every celebrity had to state their position on whether this word applies to them, like some politician declaring a party?” she writes. “Let’s stick to the issues and quit throwing this label around like ticker tape at a Susan B. Anthony parade.”
This is lazy outrage bait. But I am biting anyway, because while Time could have trolled readers by calling a ban for the word on “feminist” any time, the magazine is considering it in a year when the conversation about the meaning of the term is as rich as it has been in some time–even if some of that conversation is being conducted through mass culture.
For Beyoncé Knowles, who released a self-titled album last December and then took it on a tour with her husband that involved her standing behind the word “Feminist” in giant, glowing letters, the meaning of the word seems to be drawn from Chimamanda Adiche’s TED talk , which Knowles quotes extensively in her song “Flawless.”
“We teach girls to shrink themselves, to make themselves smaller. We say to girls, ‘You can have ambition, but not too much. You should aim to be successful, but not too successful, otherwise you will threaten the man,’”  “Because I am female, I am expected to aspire to marriage. I am expected to make my life choices always keeping in mind that marriage is the most important thing. Now, marriage can be a source of joy and love and mutual support, but why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage and we don’t teach boys the same? We raise girls to see each other as competitors, not for jobs or for accomplishments, which I think can be a good thing, but for the attention of men. We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings in the way that boys are. Feminist: the person who believes in the social, political, and economic equality of the sexes.”
That is a useful explication of both the basic principles of feminism and the contradictions women must try to reconcile in pursuit of “social, political, and economic equality.”
Taylor Swift’s declaration of feminist identity in the Guardian this summer hewed to that same basic statement of principles, and dispelled one of the persistent myths that has dogged the movement since its early days.
“As a teenager, I didn’t understand that saying you’re a feminist is just saying that you hope women and men will have equal rights and equal opportunities,” she explained to Hermione Hoby . “What it seemed to me, the way it was phrased in culture, society, was that you hate men. And now, I think a lot of girls have had a feminist awakening because they understand what the word means. For so long it’s been made to seem like something where you’d picket against the opposite sex, whereas it’s not about that at all.”
And Emma Watson, speaking at the United Nations , argued that feminism is a men’s issue–and a men’s label–too.
“I’ve seen my father’s role as a parent being valued less by society despite my needing his presence as a child as much as my mother’s,” she argued. “I’ve seen young men suffering from mental illness unable to ask for help for fear it would make them look less ‘macho’…I’ve seen men made fragile and insecure by a distorted sense of what constitutes male success. Men don’t have the benefits of equality either. We don’t often talk about men being imprisoned by gender stereotypes but I can see that that they are and that when they are free, things will change for women as a natural consequence.”
The multitudes contained within “feminist” and “feminism” are confounding. And the debates over them, whether between second-wave feminists who find Knowles’ sexual self-presentation disconcerting and her many third-wave adherents, over feminism’s priorities and solidarity or lack thereof with other movements, and over language and inclusivity are rich, sometimes painful, and often productive.
As Roxane Gay wrote in her best-selling essay collection “Bad Feminist,” “I openly embrace the label of bad feminist. I do so because I am flawed and human. I am not terribly well versed in feminist history. I am not as well read in key feminist texts as I would like to be. I have certain . . . interests and personality traits and opinions that may not fall in line with mainstream feminism, but I am still a feminist. I cannot tell you how freeing it has been to accept this about myself.”
The meaning of “feminist” is not just debated and dissected among its adherents. The Facebook and Tumblr sites Women Against Feminism have become a place where women who do not ascribe to the movement discuss why, and in the process further try to define what these protean terms mean to them. The Gamergate movement may have been, for some of its participants, about ethics in gaming journalism, but it also staged a high-profile fight over what feminism is and what feminist art criticism consists of.
As plenty of observers have pointed out, the issues that feminism is meant to address are still painfully relevant: Susan B. Anthony could not have imagined online harassment, and she would have been a less than productive participant in conversations about the struggles particular to women of color. But even if we are only measuring the extent to which the words on Time’s list are vibrant and meaningful terms, “feminist” is far too unsettled and contested a word to be tarred with the staidness Steinmetz ascribes to it. Our debates would be poorer for its loss, and for the lost opportunity to grapple with what women’s liberation really looks like.

Dow, S&P 500 slip, retreat from records

Stocks closed mostly lower Wednesday as the major indexes pulled back slightly from record highs.
The financial sector was a drag on the markets after six big banks were fined $4.3 billion in a settlement over foreign exchange manipulation charges ,
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 2.70 points, or less than 0.1%, to close at 17,612.20. The blue-chip index broke its 6-day winning streak.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index was lower for the first time in six trading days as it dropped 1.40 points, or 0.1% to 2038.25. The Dow and S&P had previously closed at record highs for the past five consecutive sessions.
Bucking the trend, the Nasdaq composite index was up 14.58 points, or 0.3%, to 4675.14.
Among the banks being fined by U.S. and European regulators were: Citibank (C) , JPMorgan Chase Bank (JPM) , Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) , HSBC Bank (HSBC) and UBS (UBS) . The investigation is not over, with Barclays (BCS) among the banks that have yet to settle on a fine.
Forex traders plotted strategy in secret chats
"The fines from the watchdogs took some of the wind out of the market," said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital Management. But a slight dip following six days of record highs "is actually healthy," he said. "That's the sign of a good bull market. Going straight up every day would be reckless."
Retail stocks were also in focus as Macy's (M) jumped more than 5% to $61.57 after reporting earnings that beat estimates . The retailer's earnings report was not all rosy though as the company reported a sales shortfall and cut its outlook.
J.C. Penney (JCP) reports after the bell Wednesday and Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) and Kohl's (KSS) are expected to report results on Thursday.
Oil prices were lower as benchmark U.S. crude oil was down 1.5% to $76.81 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.47%, up from 2.36% in the previous session.
Overseas, Japan Nikkei's 225 hit a seven-year high, rising 72.94 points, or 0.4%, to close at 17,197.05 as the yen continued to slide amid rumors that the government will postpone an upcoming tax hike.
The rumors and their effect on Japanese stocks "will be a key focus for Asian markets today," said Ric Spooner, chief market analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney. "If true, this move will better synchronize government fiscal policy with central bank stimulus initiatives, improving confidence and the outlook for the domestic economy in the medium term."
Hong Kong's Hang Seng index gained 129.90 points, or 0.6%, to finish at 23,938.18 and the Shanghai composite rose 24.8 points, or 1.0%, to close at 2494.48.
European benchmarks were lower: Britain's FTSE 100 was down  0.3% to 6611.04, Germany's DAX tumbled 1.7% to 9210.96 and France's CAC 40 dropped 1.5% to 4179.88.

Best Buy s $20 million Chicago facelift0
To entice shoppers, stores in Lincoln Park and Orland Park became the first in the country to feature 6-foot-by-8-foot Samsung Center Stage touch screens where shoppers can pull up specs and test washing machines and refrigerators against different decor, swiping images on the digital screen much like a CNN anchor on election night.
In addition, Best Buy in summer debuted premium brands at new Pacific Home and Kitchen stores inside Chicago-area Best Buys in Downers Grove, Joliet, Schaumburg, Aurora, Vernon Hills and Bloomingdale, for the first time offering products from Wolf, Viking and Bosch. Best Buy, which bought California appliance retailer Pacific Sales in 2005, has 120 in-store Pacific Home locations nationwide that sell high-end appliance brands and offer custom kitchen design.
Best Buy is trying to position itself as a premium seller in several areas. It is expanding its Magnolia Design Centers in its stores in Downers Grove, Schaumburg and Bucktown, which offer high-end entertainment brands and custom home theater design and installation.
It has added Camera Experience Shops to stores in Downers Grove and Schaumburg among 36 nationwide, where it offers almost triple its regular assortment of cameras, including dozens of high-end digital SLR lenses, aiming to cater to photography fans or professionals left in a lurch as many dedicated camera stores across the country have closed.
With 69 percent of shoppers saying they buy consumer electronics online, more than any other category, according to a Walker Sands survey, Best Buy is trying to leverage its associates' expertise and the ability for shoppers to compare across brands.
"As technology gets more advanced, having that associate on the floor to answer your questions becomes all the more important," Curley said.
With sales of CDs and DVDs, once Best Buy's bread and butter, atrophying as many people buy their music and movies digitally, the retailer has had to explore other avenues for growth. Revenue was $8.9 billion in the most recent quarter, down 4 percent from a year earlier, while net income, at $145 million, was down from $266 million a year earlier, though much of last year's profit stemmed from a legal settlement. Sales at stores open at least a year were down 2 percent, in line with industry declines.
Some of the company's efforts have had success.
Appliances sales, which represent 9 percent of the business, are up 8.2 percent, according to Best Buy's most recent earnings statement, and the company says appliances have posted gains for the past 15 quarters.
But persuading customers to view Best Buy as an appliance option may take work.
As he lingered in a DVD aisle at the Lincoln Park Best Buy, Doug Jensen, a longtime customer, balked at the idea of buying appliances there.
"You buy appliances at an appliance store," Jensen said. "I trust them for their electronics expertise."
Muscling into the high-end market also presents challenges given that specialists, such as Glenview-based Abt Electronics, are broadly trusted as the experts.
Delivering the level of service and product knowledge that high-end customers demand is difficult when it is not a store's primary focus, said Mike Abt, co-president of the family business. He noted that several retail chains have tried to enter the premium market — Sears with the Great Indoors, Home Depot with Expo — and ended up closing those divisions.
"I commend Best Buy for trying new things, but (premium) is a real hard market. People are real demanding," Abt said. "It's hard to treat people right at that level."
Curley said Best Buy's premium offerings aren't meant to appeal just to new high-end customers, but existing customers who want more.
And if Best Buy, which has offered online price-matching since last holiday season, can beat its high-end competitors on price, it could carve itself a place in the market, said Eric Penicka, research associate at Euromonitor International.
"A lot of people do go to those specialty stores to pick out an appliance, but it's not where they end up buying it," Penicka said. "If Best Buy can compete on price, it can get those shoppers."

Fox examines whether Huckabee political activities breached network standardsBy Tom Hamburger November 12 Follow @thamburger

Fox News is reviewing the political activities of former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee to see whether they violate network rules for commentators.
Huckabee, an ordained Southern Baptist minister who has a weekly show on Fox, has been considering a possible 2016 presidential run. The Washington Post reported Wednesday that he has begun using a recently formed non-profit advocacy group to hire campaign advisers who are starting to search for potential presidential campaign headquarters offices in Little Rock.
Huckabee is traveling in Europe this week with more than 100 pastors and other Christian activists from early presidential caucus and primary states.
“We are taking a serious look at Governor Huckabee’s recent activity in the political arena," said Bill Shine, executive vice president for programming at Fox. The network, he said is "evaluating his current status. We plan on meeting with him when he returns from his trip overseas.”
A Fox News spokesperson also noted that the former governor's "Huckabee" show for this Saturday night was already pre-taped prior to publication of The Post story.

Prabhu incentive: Finish projects on time  claim 2 pc of cost as rewardPrint
Suresh Prabhu takes charge as the Union Minister for Railways at Rail Bhawan in New Delhi on Monday. (Source: PTI)
Written by Avishek G Dastidar | New Delhi | Posted: November 13, 2014 3:51 am | Updated: November 13, 2014 12:55 pm
To ensure that rail projects do not languish for years and officers find a way to complete them within targets, Railways Minister Suresh Prabhu, who took charge this week, has decided to give two per cent of project cost to the project teams and their chiefs as reward. But if projects miss the deadlines, adverse comments will be entered in the Annual Confidential Report of the officials concerned.
The decision has been communicated to the Railway Board and Board members are currently working out a way to prepare this policy, according to documents accessed by The Indian Express.
Depending on the nature and size of the project, the incentive can be lower but never more than 2 per cent. The money will be worked out as part of the project cost. “The system of reward and penalty should be introduced,” Prabhu told Board members in a meeting.
The decisions, taken at top speed, over the course of just two meetings, have made Prabhu’s intentions and style of functioning clear to top officers in the Railways, sources said.
As availability of funds remains a problem area, Prabhu has also evinced interest in “securitizing” railway land for sourcing funds from external sources. The Railway Board has been asked to provide “details of encumbered land and its value” across the country.
Even before restructuring of the Railway Board takes place formally, Prabhu has directed Board members to carry out complete delegation of powers to field officers with proper checks and balances in a way that “Railway Board should only monitor closely”.
It has been instructed that tenders and such commercial matters will be decided up to the level of zonal General Managers only and do not require the ministry’s interference. The Board is now to prepare a formal revision of delegation of powers policy.
For a complete turnaround of the Railways, Prabhu has directed that each area of rail operations should come up with a global benchmark which should be on a par with global standards. The task given to each department is assess their performance against such spelled out benchmarks every year for a period of five years.
The Board will now prepare a White Paper on its finances to be presented before the Consultative Committee on Railways on December 1. The White Paper will be discussed in Parliament, before presentation of Prabhu’s first rail Budget next year.
As Prabhu heads to the G-20 summit to assist Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Railway Board will be busy preparing a presentation for the minister focusing on a three-year plan based on “benchmark of global standards in respect of Safety, Projects and Customer Satisfaction”, documents reveal.
In the past 30 years, as many as 676 projects were sanctioned worth Rs 1,57,883 crore. Of these, continued…

A Little India in Myanmar  with Hindi classes and an RSS branchThe Indian-origin population in Zayawaddy is about 70,000.
Written by Esha Roy | Zayawaddy Grant (myanmar) | Posted: November 13, 2014 3:49 am
In between Myanmar’s two erstwhile capitals Yangon and Mandalay lies Zayawaddy Grant, a cluster of villages and a small township. At first glance it is no different from any other small town in this country, that not too long ago was closed to the rest of the world. A wide concrete highway cuts through and all around are strikingly green pastures and small, rain-drenched rolling hills. Cycle-rickshaw drivers wearing conical hats with pom poms line the streets.
Look closer though and the difference is apparent. Tucked between traditional wooden Burmese huts raised on stilts are two-storey concrete homes that could belong to any Indian small town. Wearing traditional Burmese shirts tucked into lungis and savouring samosas and jalebis at tea stalls are many Indian faces, while sari-clad figures rush about holding hands of children returning from school.
Numbering over 70,000 in Zayawaddy town and surrounding villages, they are the descendants of farmers brought by the British from India — mostly from Bihar, but also Uttar Pradesh — to cultivate land in these parts. In the years that the military junta ruled Myanmar with an iron thumb, they largely escaped the authorities’ attention and have now become Myanmarese citizens.
The Little India has a Hindu Kalyan Sahyog Samiti to take care of religious affairs, Hindi is taught to children at a sprawling Gandhi Hall and in nearly a hundred schools, a temple with idols of Shiva, Lakshmi and Radha-Krishna draws many faithfuls, and there is an RSS branch to “liaise” with the authorities.
An idol of the Buddha is also housed in the temple, “to show respect to the local religion”.
Around 1,500 of the Indian descendants are Muslims.
One of the elders and leaders of the community, 73-year-old Shiv Das Verma, says farmers from UP and Bihar were the first settlers on this land. “The first batch of 3,500 farmers was brought in 1889, and then another 4,000 farmers joined them in 1902. The land was a dense forest then and they were told to cut down the trees and start cultivation. We have heard accounts of tigers, elephants, pythons, Cheetahs and bears roaming these lands, and sometimes attacking the first settlers,” he says. A sugar factory considered Myanmar’s first was later started here by the British as sugarcane is one of the staple crops here.
The farmers were brought by Raja Keshav Prasad Sinha of Dumraon (from Ara, Bihar), who had been gifted 20,000 acres of land in and around Zayawaddy for services rendered to the British, on a 30-year lease. He handed over the land to his dewan, Harihar Prasad Sinha, who took charge of cultivating it under the supervision of the British. “Farmers from Bihar were invited here. There were some families who came from UP as well, mostly Azamgarh,” says Shiv Das.
According to him, only those who could count till below 100 were selected. “Even those who made continued…

Hospital trust had no clue about campPrint
Villagers protesting outside the state health minister's residence against underwent sterilization surgeries, in Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh on Tuesday. (Source: PTI)
Written by Ashutosh Bhardwaj , Abantika Ghosh | Bilaspur/new Delhi | Posted: November 13, 2014 3:42 am | Updated: November 13, 2014 7:36 am
Four days after the Chhattisgarh government’s Health Department held a sterilisation camp in Bilaspur that led to the death of 13 women, two more chilling clues have emerged that could further unravel the story behind the tragedy.
The laparoscopic tubectomies, conducted inside the crumbling premises of a private charitable hospital that was shut down in April, took place without the knowledge of the trust that ran the facility.
Preliminary reports obtained by the Union Health Ministry suggest that the deaths were caused by the use of non-sterilised surgical equipment. Several doctors of the State Health Department, including some of those who were suspended for their role in the camp, told The Indian Express that the government used to conduct camps at Nemichand Jain Charitable Hospital, when it was operational, with the permission of the management. They admitted that these camps continued to be held there even after the facility was shut down six months ago.
“We have no information that they conducted surgeries in the hospital. We locked the hospital down in April,” the trust told The Indian Express in a statement. “We do not know how they (health officials) entered inside and did it.”
The trust added that the hospital was “never fully functional” and was closed because of a lack of enough patients and qualified medical personnel. Sources said that the chief trustee Nemichand Jain was unwell and is recovering in a Delhi hospital.
Bilaspur Collector Siddharth Komal Pardesi did not respond to phone calls and messages from this newspaper seeking comment on the issue.
Records confirm that this was not the first time that such camps were held here since the hospital shut down. In fact, Dr R K Gupta, who headed the camp four days ago, had conducted similar sterilisation camps in the premises at least twice in the recent months – in July and September.
The abandoned hospital is now surrounded by thick bushes, and the facility itself presents a grim picture with cracking floors and rusted furniture strewn around inside the rooms.
Not surprisingly, preliminary reports available with the Union Health Ministry show that the women who died had gone into “hypovolemic shock” (haemorrhagic shock) caused by excessive blood loss, which suggests they might have suffered from an infection. A credible picture will emerge only after the blood culture reports are obtained.
On Saturday, Dr Gupta conducted laparoscopic tubectomies on 83 woman, 50 of whom are still in various hospitals in the city. According to the central government’s guidelines, a medical team cannot conduct more than 30 such tubectomies in a day, with three separate laparoscopes ? that means not more than 10 tubectomies with a single instrument, as each instrument needs to be properly sterilised after every operation.
A team of doctors from Delhi’s AIIMS is now in Bilaspur to conduct a probe into the reasons behind the deaths, and the state government has continued…

NASAs new capsule at launch pad for test flightFuture Orions are meant to carry astronauts on missions of deep-space exploration, including trips to Mars.
By: Associated Press | Cape Canaveral | Posted: November 13, 2014 3:42 am
NASA’s new Orion spacecraft is now at the launch pad for next month’s test flight.
The spacecraft was moved 22 miles (35 kilometers) overnight at Cape Canaveral, Florida, and reached the launch pad early Wednesday. It was then hoisted into place on top of a Delta IV rocket for the Dec. 4 launch.
The test flight will last just over four hours and propel the unmanned capsule 3,600 miles (5,800 kilometers) away from Earth, before returning it for a splashdown in the Pacific.
Future Orions are meant to carry astronauts on missions of deep-space exploration, including trips to Mars. Astronauts are expected to start flying on Orion in 2021. The capsules are built for four passengers, one more than the old Apollo spacecraft.

Even after deaths  26 more tubectomies were done in one hour at another campThe grieving mother and sister of Chaiti Bai, a member of the protected Baiga tribe.
Written by Ashutosh Bhardwaj | Bilaspur | Posted: November 13, 2014 3:31 am | Updated: November 13, 2014 9:12 am
Even as the women who underwent laparoscopic tubectomies in Takhatpur reported complications and were admitted to hospital on Sunday, the government went ahead with another sterilisation camp in Gaurela hospital of Bilaspur on Monday. If 83 women were operated upon in five hours in Takhatpur, 26 tubectomies were done in an hour in Gaurela — about one every two minutes.
One woman who was at the Gaurela camp died on Wednesday, while at least 20 have reported post-surgery complications. Fifteen were brought to the Bilaspur district headquarters today.
The woman who died has been identified as Chaiti Bai, a Baiga — a protected tribe. With their population showing a dip over the years, the state government has banned the sterilisation of members of this tribe, who are primarily forest dwellers. Several schemes worth crores are being run for their welfare.
Yet, Chaiti was among the women taken to the sterilisation camp. At least one more Baiga woman, Mangli Bai, who also underwent the operation in Gaurela, is reported to be critical.
“I don’t know anything about the operation. Mujhe kya pata usne kyon karvaya (I don’t know why she did it),” said Chaiti’s sister, Lalli Bai. Their mother, Nan Bail, stood outside the mortuary of the Bilaspur district hospital with her granddaughter crying in her arms. They were waiting for the body, so that they could make the long journey home — their village of Dhanauli is about 150 kilometres away. Chaiti’s husband, Budh Singh, was waiting at the village with their other daughter.
As was the case with the Takhatpur surgeries, the two women did not know about the operation. They said someone had persuaded Chaiti to go to the camp.
Meanwhile, the Takhatpur death toll increased to 13 on Wednesday, as one more woman, Shiv Kumari, died at a Bilaspur hospital. Nearly 50 women are still admitted in Bilaspur hospitals, and over 20 are reported to be critical.
Taking suo moto cognizance of the incident, the Chhattisgarh High Court on Wednesday asked the state government to file a detailed report within 10 days. The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) also issued a notice to the state government directing it to file a report within two weeks. The Supreme Court, however, refused to take suo motu cognizance, saying “the Chief Minister has taken up the issue with the Prime Minister”.
With their condition showing little change even after over 48 hours of intensive care, the Chhattisgarh Institute of Medical Sciences, where many of these women have been admitted, has now decided to examine the matter afresh.
“The matter is now turning very complicated. Earlier, we thought it was a case of faulty procedure that caused septicemia and subsequent deaths. But now it seems that septicemia alone cannot cause so many deaths and severe illness to almost all of them,” continued…

Israel says wont cooperate with UN Gaza inquiryIsrael will not cooperate with a United Nations inquiry into its 50-day war with rocket-firing militants in Gaza, said a government official.
By: Agence-France Presse | Jerusalem | Posted: November 13, 2014 3:25 am
Israel will not cooperate with a United Nations inquiry into its 50-day war with rocket-firing militants in Gaza this summer, a government spokesman said today.
“Since the Schabas commission is not an inquiry but a commission that gives its conclusions in advance, Israel will not cooperate with the UN Commission on Human Rights over the last conflict with Hamas,” foreign ministry spokesman Emmanuel Nahshon said in a statement.
In August, Canadian lawyer William Schabas was named as the head of the UN commission, angering Israel, where he is widely regarded as hostile to the Jewish state over reported calls to bring Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu before the International Criminal Court.

Modi at ASEAN: SidelightsPrint
Narendra Modi in Myanmar for the ASEAN summit.
Written by Anil Sasi | Nay Pyi Taw | Posted: November 13, 2014 3:19 am | Updated: November 13, 2014 12:45 pm
Instagram debut
PM Narendra Modi marked his Instagram debut Wednesday after posting a picture from Myanmar with the message: “Hello World! Great being on Instagram. My first photo…this one from the ASEAN Summit.” Modi was seen taking the picture of the Asean billboard at Myanmar International Convention Centre, venue for the 25th Asean summit, which started Wednesday.
READ: PM Narendra Modi joins Instagram; posts first picture from Myanmar
Turning point
The summit is being termed historic for the bloc of 10 nations, with its secretary-general Le Luong Minh terming it “the most important turning year deciding the achievement of the Asean Community”. One of the key reasons is that there is barely a year to go before the member states launch an Asean Community, including the Asean Economic Community, which aims for greater economic integration and freer movement of resources.
Tight security
Myanmar has deployed about 20,000 police personnel to secure the summit. Apart from the regular restrictions at entry points, passengers on highway buses are being thoroughly checked. Myanmar is the rotating chair of Asean for the first time this year after joining the group in July 1997. The security cordon around the capital is so tight that about 20 per cent of the Myanmar Police Force is deployed to ensure security in Nay Pyi Taw.
Well-planned city
In terms of sheer planning and execution of a Greenfield project, Myanmar’s capital Nay Pyi Taw would put any Indian city to shame. The city is organised into a number of zones. The residential areas are segregated and organised, with apartments allotted according to rank and marital status. The roofs of apartment buildings are colour-coded by the jobs of their residents. But many of the city’s residents live in slums on the outskirts. Then there’s a military zone, where military officers live in a restricted zone away from regular government employees in a complex said to consist of tunnels and bunkers. Interestingly, all government ministry buildings are almost identical in appearance.
Open for business
The economy of Myanmar is officially open for businesses and investors from abroad, a message that President U Thein Sein and his administration is increasingly eager to sell. The opening up of Myanmar to business has been followed up by a slew of high-octane announcements from global investors — Japan’s Nissan and Suzuki Motor plan to set up factories to manufacture cars, US car major Ford has opened a dealership and Coca-Cola already has a local bottling plant. But, on the whole, the foreign investor community is said to be waiting and watching for clear indications of greater political certainty and improvement in infrastructure before placing their bets, and money, on the newly opened up economy.
Telecom rush
In Myanmar, till a couple of years ago, there used to be just one major mobile phone operators — the state-owned Myanmar Posts & Telegraph. It has the largest geographical network reach, but its services are quite on the lines of continued…

Pact to make n-deal with Australia operational wont be signed this timePrint
Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Written by Shubhajit Roy | New Delhi | Posted: November 13, 2014 3:10 am | Updated: November 13, 2014 11:13 am
Two months after India and Australia signed the bilateral civil nuclear cooperation agreement, a pact on the administrative arrangements — key to operationalising the uranium supply deal — is not likely to be signed when Prime Minister Narendra Modi visits Australia from November 14 to 18. However, officials said the two sides are aiming to conclude the deal in the first-half of 2015.
The pact on administrative arrangements is important for the Australian government to put it before the Australian parliamentary committee on treaties. After the committee examines the civilian nuclear deal and the administrative arrangements and prepares a report, it goes to the Australian parliament for approval. Only after the parliamentary nod can the Australian companies get into commercial negotiations with Indian counterparts for uranium supply.
Australian High Commissioner Patrick Suckling, who signed the agreement in September this year when Australian PM Tony Abbott came to India, said, “The negotiations (on the administrative arrangements) are proceeding very well. The objective is to conclude it by first half of next year.”
Suckling had signed the agreement on “Cooperation in the Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy” with R K Sinha, secretary in the Department of Atomic Energy, in the presence of Abbott and Modi.
In the joint statement signed in September this year, the prime ministers had welcomed the signing of the agreement as a “concrete symbol” of the bilateral partnership. They also directed the negotiators to conclude the administrative arrangements at an early date, a joint document had said.
While the nuclear deal may not have fructified, Modi’s visit is likely to witness signing of at least five agreements — on transfer of sentenced prisoners, a pact on combating narcotics, a social security agreement and MoUs on tourism and cultural cooperation.

A history of lame duck sessions. And complaining about lame duck sessions.By Jaime Fuller November 12 Follow @j_fuller
(J. Scott Applewhite/AP)
This week, the lame ducks are returning to Congress for their last bit of legislating. But no one seems too excited to see them.
The Oxford English Dictionary defines a "lame duck" as "a defeated member in the short session of Congress after a November election" or "a ship that is damaged, esp. one left without a means of propulsion." In the late 19th century, reporters credited President Abraham Lincoln with coming up with the nickname. The OED traces the political meaning of the word back to an 1863 issue of the Congressional Globe , which sneered that "In no event .. could it [sc. the Court of Claims] be justly obnoxious to the charge of being a receptacle of ‘lame ducks’ or broken down politicians."
Will Rogers updated the definition in 1932 in a letter to the New York Times.
Source: New York Times, 1931
Regardless of when it began, everyone agreed it sounded like the worst thing that could befall someone in Washington. In 1875, the New York Times painted a portrait of life after Capitol Hill so loudly depressing you can hardly hear the world's tiniest violin playing in the background.
Source: New York Times, 1875
Nearly 40 years later, the life of a lame duck legislator did not seem much more stimulating.
Source: Ottumwa tri-weekly courier, April 8, 1913
In 1883, the New York Times  explained  that lame ducks had two options if they wanted to stay in Washington and not go home to a "simply intolerable" life. (Niiice.) They could try to get a government job, or they could become a lobbyist.
The latter avocation is more congenial to them than any other; it keeps them in Washington, and they hang around the Capitol, half-persuading themselves that nothing has happened to them.
The fact that these losers got nice jobs was another sore spot.
Source: Baxter Springs News, May 4, 1911
 
Before their job in Washington officially ended, people had even fewer nice things to say about the lame ducks. If the party that benefited most from the election was not the one in charge during the last lame duck session, the image of a "repudiated Congress" passing legislation that would have no chance of success only months later was seen as downright undemocratic.
Source: The Labor World, Dec. 9, 1922
They were called a "national menace."
Source: The Farmington Times, 1922
In 1911, one small newspaper said that "the most pitiful of the sights at the National Capital are the Has Beens."
Source: The Times Dispatch, March 7, 1911
In 1917, The Washington Post added another bird to the post-election zoo in Congress. Rare birds, they said, "are the wise or bored shining lights of the lower house who are lame ducks of their own volition. They are rare because they quit public emoluments without being asked to."
Not only is contempt for lame ducks nearly as old as our government, the government has been trying to banish them for a long time too. In the early 20th century, Congress tried to think of ways to eliminate that last lame duck session in Congress. As Colby Itkowitz reminds us at In the Loop , the efforts culminated in the 20th Amendment in 1933. The swearing-in of both presidents and new legislators was moved to January. The amendment drafters assumed that no elected official would give up their sweet Thanksgiving and Christmas vacations to come back to Washington. However, this calculation did not predict the popularity of air travel, as a professor told Post reporter David Fahrenthold when he explained  why the heck we have lame duck sessions four years ago (our antipathy for lame ducks is not matched by an ability to remember why they exist, it seems).
So we're stuck with the lame ducks, although for a far shorter time than back in the old days. The complaints don't seem to have softened much.
Source: New York Times, 2010
And don't forget that lame ducks aren't limited to Congress! President Obama is also in that weird in-between spot where he has no future elections to keep him chipper. And unlike the few legislators roaming around the Capitol for the next month, his lame duckness lasts years, not weeks.
It can be lonely, as soon-to-be-former President Bill Clinton reminded everyone at his last White House Correspondents Dinner.
We might make fun of the lame ducks and complain about them, but remember that they probably feel like this on the inside too.

Breitbart Completely Botches Attack On Obama s Attorney General Pickreddit
In a now- removed article criticizing Loretta Lynch, President Barack Obama's nominee for attorney general , conservative news site Breitbart achieved two remarkable feats: it attacked the wrong Lynch, and issued one of the best correction notices of all time.
Breitbart alleged that Loretta Lynch, the New York federal prosecutor Obama has nominated, was a part of the defense team for former President Bill Clinton during the 1992 Whitewater scandal. She wasn't.
Breitbart cited a 1992 New York Times article that "reported that Lynch was one of the Clintons' Whitewater defense attorneys as well as a 'campaign aide.'" But the Loretta Lynch in the 1992 Times article is a California-based attorney and former California Public Utilities Commissioner , and not Obama's attorney general nominee, as Media Matters points out .
The Lynch nominated for attorney general never worked for the Clinton campaign. During the Clinton administration, Lynch served as the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, Brooklyn's top federal prosecutor -- the same job she holds today .
Obama announced Lynch as his pick to head the Department of Justice on Saturday, saying of her, "It’s pretty hard to be more qualified for this job than Loretta." If confirmed by the Senate, Lynch would be the first black woman in the job and would follow the first black attorney general.
Breitbart updated the Whitewater story along with another that also referred to the wrong Lynch, Talking Points Memo notes , before taking the Whitewater down late Sunday night.
But before the article was removed, it was given a correction notice, placed at the bottom. Here it is, in all its splendor:
Correction: The Loretta Lynch identified earlier as the Whitewater attorney was, in fact, a different attorney.
CLARIFICATION: Language has been changed to reflect that the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York is, in fact, the top federal prosecutor in Brooklyn, and they are not as initially suggested two separate positions.

7 Ways to Get Better Results From Your Online Businessreddit
In case you haven't noticed, there are a ton of people online talking about the same things. Building an online business isn't easy, and there are some hard realities you need to realize CopyBlogger tells us.
I know I'm not telling you anything new. Having said that, I LOVE the freedom an online business can provide. As you're reading this, I'm writing this article from a Starbucks that's one block away from the ocean in Maui, Hawaii.
While I'm writing this, people are buying my books and other products on my website. I'm making money passively while enjoying the amazingness of Maui. If this is your dream, there are seven things you can do to get better results from your online business.
1. Stop copying other people
People buy from someone they know, like, and trust. They don't buy from strangers. If you are the clone of someone else, they'll never get to know the real you. When they want to buy, they will buy from the person you are copying. Use frameworks that work, but don't be a clone. Let your voice come through, and build a business that's yours.
2. Be clear about who you serve
If you try to reach the whole world, you'll end up reaching no one, because your efforts to reach customers will be scattered. You won't be able to help people where they are if you're not speaking to a specific target audience.
The more specific you can get with your target audience, the easier time you'll have marketing, which is what ultimately grows your business. When you do, you will be focused with your strategy.
3. Keep it simple
Keep your website simple and clean. Even though Wordpress has a variety of options for widgets and plugins, you don't need ALL of them. When someone visits your website it shouldn't confuse them.
When it comes to your business, keep it simple too. Build traffic to your website. Learn the biggest struggles your target audience is facing. Create products and services that help solve those problems. Rinse and repeat. Yes, it can be that simple.
4. Don't rely too heavily on social media
While you can't ignore social media, you can't make it your number one strategy for traffic and leads. New York Times best-selling author, Crystal Paine, clearly illustrated this . I also wrote about how social media marketing is overrated for the Huffington Post .
The bottom line is you want to build your business on your platform, not someone else's. You want people to sign up to your email list, and interact with you personally, not just on social media.
5. Focus on what's important to where you are
There's a wealth of information you can learn online. Most of these things aren't important to where you are in the process. If you're building, you probably shouldn't be learning about SEO.
If you guest post, and build your audience in other ways, the SEO will naturally come, so your time is better spent writing guest posts.
Sit down, and evaluate where you're at in your journey, and stick to what will help you where you are. Don't fall victim to information overload because it can easily keep you from making progress. Speed of implementation is what makes you successful in business.
6. Don't be afraid to charge a fair price
It would be great to help as many people as possible for free, but you have a family and bills to pay. If you create something that adds value and helps people, you should charge a fair price for it. Remember, you're building a business; it can't be a business if it doesn't make money.
There are people online that should be ashamed at what they're doing and charging, but you'll find that in any industry. As long as you focus on serving and adding value to people's lives, your prices will be justified.
7. Keep pushing forward
At the end of the day, if you want this to work, you have to determine right now that you'll keep going no matter what. Perseverance is what makes your business grow. Even if you haven't made the process you wanted to make at this point, you can't give up. Build this business one relationship, and one sell at a time.
Have patience. This takes time to build. With focused effort you can build a powerful online business. Use these seven things to optimize your building efforts. Have patience, and build something that helps your target audience. Focus and you will do this.
Which one of these do you need to work on?

What s The Best College Saving Strategy When You Have Young Kidsreddit
Dear Carrie,
Help. I have three young children ages 2, 5 and 10 and haven't started saving for college for any of them. Is it too late?
Dear Reader,
Of course it's not too late. Your children are still young -- even with a 10-year-old you have almost 12 years to save counting the four-plus years your child may be in college. On the flip side, there's no time to waste since college costs seem to be growing right along with your kids.
And as important as it is to start saving for college, it's equally important to be strategic about how you do it. From tax considerations to investing to understanding financial aid formulas, there are ways to get more mileage out of your money.
Set a realistic monthly savings goal
First, don't get discouraged by the high cost of college. There are many ways to pay for education. In fact, according to the 2014 national Sallie Mae study, How America Pays for College, parents' income and savings cover only about 30 percent of college expenses.
So determine what you can realistically afford to put towards education each month. You can try using an online calculator to help you estimate how much your savings can grow over time. Then, after you explore college savings accounts, you might consider apportioning funds to each child according to their age and the years before they'll enter college.
Choose a tax-smart account
There are two tax-advantaged choices for education savings -- a 529 College Savings account and a Coverdell Education Savings Account (ESA). Both provide tax-free growth potential as well as tax-free withdrawals if the money is used for what the IRS has determined to be qualified education expenses (tuition, fees, books, room and board, etc).
I favor a state-sponsored 529 account. There's no annual contribution limit and the lifetime limit per beneficiary is upwards of $300,000 depending on the state. While you don't have to choose your own state's plan, some states offer a partial or full state income tax deduction if you do, so always consider your own state's plan first.
Another plus is that anyone -- parents, relatives and friends -- can contribute to a 529. In fact, anyone can open a 529, so your children could potentially benefit from more than one account if, for instance, a grandparent wanted to help you save.
For the record, if you think your child will attend a public in-state school, there are also prepaid 529 plans that allow you to pay for tomorrow's tuition at today's rates. The details go beyond the scope of this column but it could be worth looking into. A good source of information is savingforcollege.com .
An ESA offers similar tax benefits but has an annual $2,000 contribution limit, plus income limits for opening one. On the positive side, while 529 withdrawals can only be used for post-secondary education expenses, an ESA can be used for certain elementary- and high-school costs. You could have both types of accounts to cover all your bases.
Whatever your choice, ideally you'd open a separate account for each child -- and set up automatic monthly payments.
Be aware of gift tax rules
Contributions to education savings accounts are subject to gift tax rules, which currently require that any annual individual contribution over $14,000 ($28,000 per couple) to a single beneficiary be reported on your tax return.
However, a special gift tax exclusion allows an individual to contribute a lump sum of up to $70,000 ($140,000 per couple) to a 529 Plan. This is treated as a five-year gift, so any gifts beyond this amount to the same beneficiary during the five years would be subject to the gift tax.
Invest aggressively in the early years
Once you've set up accounts, consider investing for maximum growth potential, especially for your youngest children. Of course, you have to be careful about the investments you select and maintain a close eye on their performance, but investing more aggressively when the kids are young can potentially result in better returns over time.
A 529 account may offer a choice of investment portfolios, some of which are designed to automatically become more conservative as your child approaches college age. With an ESA, investment selection is up to you.
Understand what affects financial aid decisions
Assets in either a 529 or an ESA belong to the parent or other adult account owner, so there's minimal impact on financial aid. Only 5.64 percent of a parent's assets (excluding retirement accounts and home equity, which are not counted at all) are considered available for college expenses, as opposed to 20 percent of a student's assets.
However, distributions from 529s other than one set up by a parent are considered income to the beneficiary. Fifty percent of a student's income is considered available for college expenses, so a withdrawal from a 529 set up by a grandparent could potentially affect a student's financial aid eligibility. As kids approach college age, it can sometimes be better for others to contribute to the parents' 529, or simply make a direct payment to the school.
Get started
Talk to your financial institution about the 529 plans they offer, and check into your state's plan. Collegesavings.org is another good resource for more in-depth information. And don't delay. Your kids will be looking at college brochures in no time. I know from experience!

I m a Pop Singer and Spotify Works for Mereddit
The Internet is buzzing with the news of Taylor Swift's big move away from Spotify. Artists are firing up their torches and grabbing their pitchforks to slay the gnarling, evil dragon that is streaming. Now, as much as I love the idea of sticking-it-to-the-man and challenging the system and whatnot, I think I'm gonna stick with my boy, Spotify, on this one.
Taylor's benefit from removing her music from Spotify is simple -- she is making her product virtually unavailable for free, which will (in theory) cause more people to go pay for her albums, not to mention the press she's getting around her new release. I'll get to why that applies to virtually no one but her a little later, but I'm not here to talk about Taylor Swift. I'm here to talk about Spotify, and how it is a crucial tool in the development of my indie-pop career.
Streaming services, Spotify in-particular, are a completely different beast from iTunes and other online retailers. Spotify does one thing that many don't take into account (or don't take seriously enough), which is apply the social aspect of music to the listening process.
Artists and listeners can create and share playlists with followers, connect with Twitter and Facebook, follow friends, and discover new music organically. As an indie artist, I'll jump at any opportunity to connect my name and music with fresh ears. Every time I upload something to Spotify, my followers get a notification. When they listen to it, their Facebook friends see my name and may very well give it a listen themselves. From there my songs have an opportunity to spread like wildfire, or at least a juicy rumor. In any case, those are listeners that I had no access to before. Every time someone adds me to a playlist, with millions of subscribers or just a few, it's an almost guaranteed play. Today it seems to be less about selling records and more about getting plays. With the obvious shift in the music business in mind, Spotify becomes a service that would be silly to brush aside.
Here's an example. One of my songs currently has 1,513,757 plays on Spotify. The plays just started rolling in one day, seemingly out-of-nowhere. After a few weeks of rapid increase in streams, I was told by a friend from high school that she heard it on a Spotify playlist called, "Smart is the New Sexy." After that playlist, it popped up on a few more, and now, less than a year later, my song has well over a million plays. Over a year ago, I played the song on daytime television and it aired nationally three times that day, which gave me a tiny sales spike and a handful of Facebook likes, but nothing significant. Since then I haven't really promoted the song at all. I don't even play it at my shows. It's from my first release, and the sound of it just doesn't really fit in with what I'm going for right now. My opinion on the song aside, it's now kicking ass with virtually no effort on my part. One playlist put that song in business for me.
Now I could go on all day about how great Spotify is for music discovery (for artists and listeners), but I know what everyone really wants to talk about is Taylor Swift and money. All of the reasons for loving Spotify I've stated above mean nothing to an artist like Taylor Swift. People hear her music without trying. Discovery isn't an issue there. Her music (and face) is everywhere- radio, advertisements, movies, news outlets, blogs on blogs on blogs. Right here! I'm sitting here writing this and you probably clicked on it because of Taylor Swift. Girl does not need any help getting her name out there.
But, I maintain that Spotify can still be a useful tool for even the biggest stars, even if snubbing it won't hurt them. There's no denying that radio is still the titan. Everyone listens to it (obvi) and it's curated, so no one has to worry about if what they're listening to is good or cool -- they know it is because it's on the radio. No searching for new music or scanning blogs and record stores. Just turn it on and there you have it: a hit song ready for your ears. But with more and more people getting sick of hearing the same five or six songs all day, virtually every car being produced with streaming capability, and iPhones essentially glued in people's hands, I see Spotify playlists becoming something of a powerhouse for curated music. I'm not gonna get ahead of myself and say that Spotify playlists could out-do the radio, but I'm not gonna say they couldn't.
The fact of the matter is it doesn't make any sense to snub Spotify while releasing through other digital retailers, because the revenue sharing is on the exact same scale. Thirty percent goes to the service, 60 percent to the owners of the master, and 10 percent to publishing. Whether or not that is fair is a different discussion, but these are pretty set, standard rates. If Spotify pays $0.005 per stream, it takes roughly 200 plays to match the $1 my song cost on iTunes. When you think about how many times you listen to songs that you love, over time, 200 plays isn't really that hard to reach. Say a person listens to an album 1000 times. That's buying the album five times. HypeBot published a great article about this where they compared this idea to that of buying vs. renting.
So why is everyone so up in arms? Change is hard, I know. Selling records made piles of money for a good amount of people in the glory days, but things done changed. Our amazing ex-boyfriend that didn't quite pan out is now engaged. And we can stay in denial that he'll leave her and come back to us, but we all know the chances of that happening are slim-to-none. We've got to get over it.
The music industry very clearly isn't what it used to be. People don't see music as something you can buy or own. They treat music like air -- absolutely vital, and basically free. And yes, you could suffocate people until they pay up, but that could get messy. Spotify and other streaming services are offering us the opportunity to be a part of this shift, rather than victims of it. To really make a living in this you've got to be a businessperson as much as an artist. Record sales alone wouldn't be enough even if people were buying records. You've got to tour, sell merch, market yourself.
To independent artists it doesn't matter what Taylor Swift does on her Spotify account. As far as I'm concerned, she's just freeing up some space on the top playlists for the little guys. To spend more of our time trying to push people back to buying records is an exercise in futility. The smart ones will find a different way. Spotify could be that way, and if it isn't, it can definitely help transition us into a world where streaming is key, and CDs are just plastic circles.

SeaWorld SEAS
Entertainment, still rattled by declining attendance in the wake of  the documentary Blackfish,  sank 9.4% to $16.85 Wednesday after posting a 28% drop in quarterly income and an 8% fall in revenue.
The theme park operator said attendance fell more than 5% in the quarter, blaming negative media attention and competition in the Florida market.
Seaworld has been navigating negative publicity since last year’s release of Blackfish, which alleged negligence and poor treatment of its killer whales and tied their treatment to the deaths of  three trainers.
The company earlier said it planned to expand its killer whale habitats. It’s also embarked on a $50 million cost-cutting program and boosted marketing spending by $10 million to burnish its brand.
“Consistent with the update we provided in August, the attendance trends the company experienced in the latter part of the second quarter continued into the third quarter. Clearly 2014 has been a challenging year, but I am confident we are taking the necessary steps to address our near term challenges and position the Company to deliver value over the long term,” CEO Jim Atchison said.
Shares bottomed at a 52-week, $16.16 low in early Wednesday trading. Year-to-date, SeaWorld is off  41%.
Given on-going issues, S&P Capital’s Tuna Amobi cut his 12-month price target to $14 from $18.

Sarah Palin and my sexist double standardBy Jonathan Capehart November 12 Follow @capehartj
This image provided by Newsweek shows the news magazine’s Nov. 23, 2009 cover, featuring a photo of former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin. (Brian Adams–Rapport/AP/Newsweek)
The conservative Twitterverse reacted strongly and negatively (quel shock!) to my defense of Valerie Jarrett . The resulting “instalanche” featured all sorts of personal insults and righteous umbrage. I made liberal use of Twitter’s block feature. But there were numerous accusations of hypocrisy that cannot go ignored — because they were right.
Many of the snarling conservatives pointed to a piece I wrote about Sarah Palin in July 2011. I recall having fun writing it because it combined politics and fashion and contemplated how the latter impacts one’s viability in the former. Yet, I couldn’t help but wince at some of what I wrote.
Folks want to be able to envision someone sitting in the Oval Office. They don’t necessarily want to envision them in the pages of Esquire magazine’s “Sexiest Woman Alive 2011” or Maxim. She can’t possibly be taken seriously as a presidential contender dressed like that, especially since this is the second time she has graced Newsweek in a less-than-presidential pose.
As a good liberal, I should know better than to comment on a woman’s appearance, especially professionally. It should have no bearing on her abilities or competence. At least, that’s the point many conservatives who usually pooh-pooh accusations of sexism or rail against “war on women” rhetoric were making. The motivation behind calling out my sexist double standard isn’t important. What is important is that I acknowledge it.
My problem with Palin was never about her clothes. It was about her substance — or lack thereof. How she dressed for two magazine covers was irrelevant compared to her utter lack of preparation to be the 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee, her willingness to ditch the governorship of Alaska after only half a term and her inability to articulate a vision for her party and the country that rose above pablum and snarky one-liners. My argument against her would have had a stronger foundation had I kept the focus on that.

Big Banks Must Dare to Think the Unthinkablereddit
It is about time the role of asset management , also known as investment management, within big banks be reconsidered.
My proposal is a business model for big banks that will ensure a truly independent and conflict-free asset management, free from the influence of the bank's House View.
My suggestion is not driven by regulatory or political interests that also came with the "too big to fail" idea. Instead, it comes solely from a desire to create added value for customers and, consequently, also for the financial institution.
The clear objective is and must be, to improve the quality of services and competitiveness of large banks.
A more radical proposal is to think the unthinkable and spin-off asset management, using only various best-in-class independent asset manager partners. The big banks would then put the focus on private banking without in-house asset management.
Some banks have already made their asset management business independent of the bank group through spin-offs. The reasons for spin-offs are to protect banks from unforeseen events, to strengthen independence credibility, to reposition the bank, or to raise bank valuation.
However, major banks should ensure that a high proportion of asset management services does not come from the spun-off unit. And only then can real diversification, a so-called 'true' open offering architecture, take place.
For smaller banks, however, this constellation without in-house asset management often already exists but is mostly driven for two main reasons.
First, some banks have consciously decided against maintaining or owning an asset management unit and, therefore, rely on spun-off partners or external partners. Secondly, the others are missing, besides the necessary expertise and infrastructure, simply, the competitive edge.
The radical proposal with not owning an asset management unit can perhaps be ignored by big banks if they can show credibly that their asset management always acts independently and autonomously in their investment decisions.
However, even then, an independent asset management as a truly separate entity is always the more credible business model. In addition, the in-house excuse that asset management performance has suffered through the house view will not hold true anymore.
With independence, the asset management must face tough competition, and that will benefit the clients and also itself.
The sharp focus on core competencies and strengths is the secret of successful companies such as Apple, Google, or Facebook. It is there where the secret of the future of big banks lies.
Apple stands as a good example of how successful the outsourcing of some of its key production elements to its best-in-class partners, sometimes even with main competitors such as Samsung, can be. Apple focuses on its core competencies and assigns the rest to its strategic, outsourcing partner.
In this proposal, I shall only discuss the advantages of large banks, which see their future in the private banking business model without their asset management.
A financial institution will continuously grow assets through its new success, become stronger, and add corresponding and specific know-how, from which customers will increasingly benefit.
Furthermore, clients will also benefit from having access to the best asset managers and the best research. These are benefits that cannot be easily replicated by most clients.
The clients benefit because they will most likely enjoy, due to the independence of the asset management firm, better best-in-class products and services and thus achieve higher returns in their portfolios.
The disadvantages for a big bank to not own and control an asset management unit lie in lower risk control and lower income through the use of third-party providers. However, the overall benefits for the bank outweigh the disadvantages.
The bank will be perceived by clients as a useful and necessary long-term advisor and thus form the basis for a reliable and trusted relationship. In addition, the brand will strengthen.
In order to strengthen the banking business model for some big banks, it begs the question whether the current strategy with the given structures of in-house private banking and asset management will result in potential sustainable future growth.
Competitive or preferably outstanding returns are the key factors and drivers that decide the success or failure of the asset management business model.
What asset manager would go to a restaurant where the food - speak performance - is not good, even if it has a great reputation or name attached to it? They might visit it once more, but if it disappoints again, never again. The consequences of word-of-mouth effect can be imagined.
Banks should decide either to take the banking role or the asset management role. Only then will the big banks and asset managers play to their strengths and succeed together.
Successful new economy companies like Facebook, Google, Apple, or Amazon have recognized early on the need to focus on generating innovation within their consciously narrow niche competence boundaries.
This proposal may sound radical, but the approach to thinking the seemingly unthinkable is consistently pursued.
"To achieve the possible, we must attempt the impossible again and again."

Israel says wont cooperate with UN GazainquiryIsrael will not cooperate with a United Nations inquiry into its 50-day war with rocket-firing militants in Gaza, said a government official.
By: Agence-France Presse | Jerusalem | Posted: November 13, 2014 3:25 am
Israel will not cooperate with a United Nations inquiry into its 50-day war with rocket-firing militants in Gaza this summer, a government spokesman said today.
“Since the Schabas commission is not an inquiry but a commission that gives its conclusions in advance, Israel will not cooperate with the UN Commission on Human Rights over the last conflict with Hamas,” foreign ministry spokesman Emmanuel Nahshon said in a statement.
In August, Canadian lawyer William Schabas was named as the head of the UN commission, angering Israel, where he is widely regarded as hostile to the Jewish state over reported calls to bring Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu before the International Criminal Court.

Modi at ASEAN:SidelightsPrint
Narendra Modi in Myanmar for the ASEAN summit.
Written by Anil Sasi | Nay Pyi Taw | Posted: November 13, 2014 3:19 am | Updated: November 13, 2014 12:45 pm
Instagram debut
PM Narendra Modi marked his Instagram debut Wednesday after posting a picture from Myanmar with the message: “Hello World! Great being on Instagram. My first photo…this one from the ASEAN Summit.” Modi was seen taking the picture of the Asean billboard at Myanmar International Convention Centre, venue for the 25th Asean summit, which started Wednesday.
READ: PM Narendra Modi joins Instagram; posts first picture from Myanmar
Turning point
The summit is being termed historic for the bloc of 10 nations, with its secretary-general Le Luong Minh terming it “the most important turning year deciding the achievement of the Asean Community”. One of the key reasons is that there is barely a year to go before the member states launch an Asean Community, including the Asean Economic Community, which aims for greater economic integration and freer movement of resources.
Tight security
Myanmar has deployed about 20,000 police personnel to secure the summit. Apart from the regular restrictions at entry points, passengers on highway buses are being thoroughly checked. Myanmar is the rotating chair of Asean for the first time this year after joining the group in July 1997. The security cordon around the capital is so tight that about 20 per cent of the Myanmar Police Force is deployed to ensure security in Nay Pyi Taw.
Well-planned city
In terms of sheer planning and execution of a Greenfield project, Myanmar’s capital Nay Pyi Taw would put any Indian city to shame. The city is organised into a number of zones. The residential areas are segregated and organised, with apartments allotted according to rank and marital status. The roofs of apartment buildings are colour-coded by the jobs of their residents. But many of the city’s residents live in slums on the outskirts. Then there’s a military zone, where military officers live in a restricted zone away from regular government employees in a complex said to consist of tunnels and bunkers. Interestingly, all government ministry buildings are almost identical in appearance.
Open for business
The economy of Myanmar is officially open for businesses and investors from abroad, a message that President U Thein Sein and his administration is increasingly eager to sell. The opening up of Myanmar to business has been followed up by a slew of high-octane announcements from global investors — Japan’s Nissan and Suzuki Motor plan to set up factories to manufacture cars, US car major Ford has opened a dealership and Coca-Cola already has a local bottling plant. But, on the whole, the foreign investor community is said to be waiting and watching for clear indications of greater political certainty and improvement in infrastructure before placing their bets, and money, on the newly opened up economy.
Telecom rush
In Myanmar, till a couple of years ago, there used to be just one major mobile phone operators — the state-owned Myanmar Posts & Telegraph. It has the largest geographical network reach, but its services are quite on the lines of continued…

SC frowns on linking Toyota brass to non-dep...Tweet
SC likely to take a final decision on the issue today. The outcome could leave some effect on how overseas investors look at India’s judicial system.
NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday frowned on making all directors of the Indian unit of Toyota Motor parties to a criminal case filed by the owner of a Toyota Fortuner SUV, who accused them with cheating, forgery and criminal conspiracy saying that the airbags of the vehicle didn't deploy in an accident as assured by the company.
The court is likely to make a final decision on the matter Thursday and the outcome could leave some effect on how overseas investors are looking at India's judicial system. Panicky foreign investors had questioned an earlier SC order asking Samsung Electronics Chairman Lee Kun-Hee to come to India and face criminal charges after a supplier to the Korean major's unit accused it of failing to pay.
Gautam Sharma, the SUV owner, claimed that the non-deployment of the airbags had led to the death of his driver and him sustaining injuries in a November 2012 accident in Uttar Pradesh. He filed an FIR under sections 420 (cheating), 468 (forgery for the purpose of cheating) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) against Atul C Kirloskar, Vikram S Kirloskar, Shekar Vishwanathan and Sandeep Singh, all directors of Toyota Kirloskar Motor . The company was not made an accused.
The directors first moved the Allahabad High Court which dismissed their pleas on the ground that charge sheets had been filed against them in the trial court and that the court had already taken cognizance of the matter. The quartet then moved the top court.
An SC bench, comprising Chief Justice HL Dattu and Justices Madan B Lokur and AK Sikri, on Wednesday asked Sharma's lawyer Vivek Tankha to rethink his legal options. "Directors cannot be proceeded against vicariously," Justice Dattu said. "There's no such thing as vicarious criminal liability," he said. "You can't make all the directors party without first making the company a party to the case." Justice Sikri observed that he had to attribute a particular role to a director before making him a party to the case.
The court suggested that the complainant settle for compensation for his agonies and for the driver's family. Toyota, represented by senior lawyer Fali S Nariman , agreed to pay adequate compensation.
Tankha, Sharma's lawyer, resisted saying that those at the helm of affairs of a manufacturing company must be made accountable for any defects. "If your manufacturing centre is producing defective cars, isn't it negligence," he asked. He kept insisting that the courts ensure that some standards are adhered to by manufacturing companies and that they should not mislead consumers. The court observed that though his "fight" was "for a principle", it ought to be against the "correct, proper person" and gave him a day's time to rethink. The court will take up the matter again Thursday.
According to the complaint, the owner's manual had claimed that the car was fully safe and its airbags and seatbelts would save the lives of persons sitting in the car in the event of an accident. The company's claims were corroborated by the dealer, it had said. Since the car toppled over, and did not have a head-on collision, the front air bags which are supposed to inflate on impact did not open.
Sharma charged that the Toyota directors and the dealer were complicit in inducing him to buy the car with an objective to getting monetary benefits and hence should face prosecution for cheating and criminal conspiracy. In their plea seeking top court intervention, the directors argued that there was no "inducement" or "deception from inception" to make out a cheating case against them.

View Photo Gallery —A big issue before President Obama is a proposal to approve a pipeline carrying fuel from Canada’s oil sands through America’s heartland to Texas. What’s at stake? Here’s a quick overview from “Down the Line: A Journey Along the Controversial Pipeline and Into America’s Energy Frontier.’’
Whether Congress can authorize constructing the pipeline has been the source of debate between Republicans pining for its construction and environmental groups who say the powers rest solely with Obama.
But supporters say that Congress can use its power to regulate commerce with foreign countries to authorize the project. The legislation, as written, would authorize constructing the pipeline and use a January 2014 environmental-impact report by the State Department to satisfy federal requirements that the project be studied for adverse effects.
After their midterm losses, there is little political fallout for Senate Democrats to worry about. Landrieu, Manchin and at least nine other Democrats support building the pipeline, and Republicans are expected to make up the bulk of the votes approving the plan in the Senate next week. Even if it doesn’t pass this year, the GOP has long vowed to approve the pipeline once they win total control of Congress.
But in recent days, several Democrats and Republicans have cited authorization of the oil pipeline as a modest proposal that could be used to restore bipartisan cooperation in the fractured Congress. Party leaders agreed suggesting that it could be voted on next year in the new Congress.
Landrieu had other ideas.
“I don’t think we necessarily need to wait until January,” she said Wednesday in a floor speech that lasted almost three hours. Landrieu made no attempt to hide her motive. “I’m going to do everything in my power here and at home on the campaign trail, where I’m still in a runoff, as you know, to get this project moving forward,” she said.
And later, she secured an agreement from Democratic and Republican leaders to hold a vote authorizing the pipeline as early as next Tuesday. House Republican leaders also announced plans to hold a vote as early as Thursday to authorize the pipeline, the ninth time the GOP-controlled House has voted to approve the pipeline in the past six years.
Before her remarks, Landrieu was spotted riding the escalator alone up from the Senate trains that carry lawmakers between their offices and the Capitol, toward a row of elevators. She was stone-faced and declined to answer questions from reporters. Once she reached the top level and stepped off, Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), one of his party’s top campaign strategists, walked over.
Smiling, he asked Landrieu to step aside for a private conversation. She shook her head and moved briskly toward the elevator. As she did, she pointed to her phone, saying she had a call. Schumer paused for a moment as she moved away. His smile dropped, and he turned to follow her. “Mary, Mary,” he said, a few steps behind, asking her to speak with him. When she kept moving and ducked into an elevator, he hustled and jumped in to join her as the doors closed.
A few minutes later, Landrieu took to the Senate floor to vent her frustrations and to try to shift the political winds in her direction.

Wendy Davis campaign was even worse than you thoughtComments
By Jay Root, Texas Tribune November 12

Consultants for Democrat Wendy Davis warned her campaign months ago that the Fort Worth senator was headed for a humiliating defeat in the Texas governor’s race unless she adopted a more centrist message and put a stop to staggering internal dysfunction.
The warnings are contained in two internal communications obtained by the Texas Tribune and written at the beginning of the year by longtime Democratic operatives Peter Cari and Maura Dougherty.
After the drubbing Davis got from Texas Gov.-Elect Greg Abbott last week, they seem eerily prescient.
“The campaign is in disarray and is in danger of being embarrassed,” Cari and Dougherty wrote in a lengthy memorandum Jan. 6. “The level of dysfunction was understandable in July and August, when we had no infrastructure in place — but it doesn’t seem to be getting better.”
Addressed to then-Campaign Manager Karin Johanson, the memo warned that the Davis campaign had “lurched to the left,” was failing to communicate a positive message and offered virtually nothing to the swing voters the [state] senator would need to win statewide.
“There is not a model where a candidate who appears this liberal and culturally out of touch gets elected statewide anywhere in the south — much less in Texas — without some inoculation,” the consultants said.
Dougherty and Cari, founders of the national consulting firm Prism Communications, had helped guide Davis to two tough Senate wins in a Republican-leaning North Texas district, and they were deeply invested in her campaign.
But the media strategists complained that they and other consultants who had been involved in her past races, and who knew her strengths and background, were being sidelined and had been unable to communicate directly with Davis.
In a telephone interview with the Tribune, Dougherty said she and her business partner wrote the memo in a last-ditch attempt to right a listing campaign ship. She said she often did not know about major campaign developments until she read them in the news.
“Thank God for Google alerts, because I wouldn't know what was going on in this campaign without them,” she said.
Calls and e-mails directed to Johanson were not immediately returned.
The Prism consultants concluded that the campaign was either desperately broken or that the hierarchy had decided to portray Davis not as a Texas moderate but rather a “national Democrat, appealing to liberal donors in the mistaken belief that there is a hidden liberal base in Texas that will turn out to vote if they have a liberal candidate to support.”
“Either scenario means that real changes need to be made, and quickly,” they wrote.
Not long after that January memo, the campaign indeed made changes, but not the ones Prism Communications had in mind.
About a month later, the firm was let go, Dougherty said. In a blistering follow-up letter to Johanson on Feb. 11, Dougherty and Cari described more dysfunction and mismanagement. And they predicted Davis's margin of defeat within a single percentage point.
They wrote that the campaign was failing to portray Davis “like a Texan” and had turned her into a generic Democrat who would only have a chance in a state with a recent history of electing Democrats. The party hasn't won a statewide election in Texas since 1994.
“Running Wendy Davis as a generic national Democrat is not only the quickest path to 38 percent, it’s also a huge disservice to Wendy, her record and the brand she has built,” they wrote. Davis got 38.9 percent of the vote, compared to the 59.3 percent of voters who cast ballots for Abbott.
Given the national wave that swamped Democrats around the country, including in governors races that Republicans won in traditionally blue states such as Maryland and Massachusetts, it’s highly unlikely that any political strategy would have ushered Davis into the Texas governor’s mansion.
But Dougherty said it didn’t have to be such a rout.
“It’s possible to lose and still look good,” she said in the phone interview. “Our worry in January was it was setting Wendy up for embarrassment throughout the course of the campaign. I think the way the campaign played out was far, far worse than it should have been.”
Texas Democrat Wendy Davis, who faced long odds in the contest for Texas governor, conceded to Republican Greg Abbott Tuesday night, telling her supporters "your work is not in vain" during her emotional speech to supporters. (NBC)

1D DLF is due to release its Q2 results this Thursday and that is likely to be quite a stormy occasion, given the recent Sebi action against the company. Since the October 2014 order that banned the real estate developer and its chairman K P Singh from accessing the capital markets for three years, the real estate major has struggled. It was traded at about Rs 150 just before the Sebi order. It dropped to a low of Rs 100 a couple of sessions after the order and it has since recovered to about Rs 135. Every real estate company in the country is cash-strapped at the moment. DLF had announced its intentions of raising substantial funds from the market prior to the order. It can no longer do that via either equity or debt markets. Nor can it set up REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) closing another avenue of potential funding. This lack of access to funds will put more stress on its balance sheet. The question mark about the management`s probity is also a negative if it is looking for funding in the future. Ho

Segment wise performance and outlook:
The agrochemicals intermediates group performed better in terms of volume growth but had to compromise on margins.
The main competition in the Phosphonates market was from China and this year, the reduced availability from China
and the rupee depreciation helped the Company to recover a good portion of the market lost earlier. We also increased
the share in the Pharma intermediates through higher production and also by developing new customers. The biocides
demand saw a good jump thanks to the Company’s efforts in developing a new application in the preservation of wood

All the efforts are slated to sustain and grow so that the Company can attain higher than ever capacity utilization in the
coming year. The relative slowdown in the Chinese Economic growth and the increasing controls on Industrial Pollution
there offers a vast opportunity for growth in India. The Company has taken steps to produce highest ever tonnages of
several products and will succeed in checking the imports. The FDA approval received in early 2014-15 will boost the
output and value realization from the Pharma plant.

The rise of the megacycleThe Roundabout Blog | 11 November 2014
Five new bikes that upend motorcycle performance
By  Dan Carney
2015 Kawaski Ninja H2R. (Kawasaki)
Call them motorcycles if you must, but these ultra-performance two-wheelers are nothing less than megacycles.
Related
Nine easy riders, resurrected
Just as the motoring universe has begun to assimilate the incredible performance of cars such as the Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat , Chevrolet Corvette Z06 and Nissan GT-R Nismo , it now must prepare for an emerging crop of incomprehensibly fast motorcycles.
Street-legal, two-wheeled hyper-speed is not new; the Kawasaki Ninja 900, Suzuki GSXR1100 and Honda Hurricane 1000 of the 1980s eradicated all prior performance benchmarks for street motorcycles. Such was their potency that a bill calling for their ban was introduced in US Congress. It failed.
Motorcycle performance has since crept incrementally upward, with horsepower for the fastest machines rising by a percentage point or two annually – that was, until 2014, when manufacturers engineered a leap reminiscent of the arrival of those ‘80s bikes.
First came the Kawasaki Ninja H2, launched at Germany’s Intermot show in September 2014. The Japanese manufacturer might have simply launched a rocket-propelled grenade, so thoroughly did the street-legal H2 and 300-horsepower, track-only H2R ignite the internet.
About that 300hp number, which can throttle the imagination like the Hellcat’s 707 figure. It comes courtesy of supercharging, a technology all but unheard of in two-wheeler circles.
It is as if Kawasaki engineers awoke one day to realise their parent, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, owned all sorts of subsidiaries, such as the Gas Turbine & Machinery Company and the Aerospace Company, which could be tapped to contribute know-how to a ludicrous sportbike with wind tunnel-developed aerodynamics that would impart the necessary high-speed stability.
The H2R is not a racing machine, just a bike built to be sold to everyday citizens who enjoy exercising their motorcycles at the racetrack. The street-going H2’s power has yet to be disclosed officially, but it too packs the supercharged 998cc engine and racing-specification transmission, so it will be plenty fast. How fast? This looks pretty fast .
Incidentally, the H2 is not Kawasaki’s first foray into forced induction, which feeds large quantities of air into the engine to optimise fuel combustion and boost power. That was the GPz750 Turbo of 1984-85, which caused a similar frothing 30 years ago. And while Kawasaki might have struck first in the hot-bike stakes in 2014, the brand is not alone at the outer limits.
2015 Yamaha YZF-R1M. (Yamaha)
At November’s Esposizione Mondiale del Motociclismo (EICMA) in Milan, Europe’s largest motorcycle trade fair, competitors rolled out their own shockingly fast equipment. Consider Yamaha’s new YZF-R1M. Its naturally aspirated 998cc in-line four-cylinder engine is rated at 200hp, and riders benefit from the assistance of MotoGP-calibre electronics to harness those horses. The R1 gets an electronic slide control system that metes engine power out according to lean angle and yaw relative to the direction of travel. It also has a system to limit the height of wheelies, so riders avoid tumbling backwards with their front wheels aloft.
2015 Honda RC213V-S prototype. (Honda)
Down the hall at EICMA, Honda dropped all pretense to maintaining the street-track divide, instead virtually bolting license plates and lights to its RC213V MotoGP machine and offering it for sale.
The result is the Honda RC213V-S Prototype. The “S” is added to the name of the company’s MotoGP racer to indicate that it is the street-legal edition. Given Honda’s habitual secrecy, the company released no additional details, but the tagline “MotoGP bike for the street” was enough to draw plenty attention in Milan.
2015 Ducati 1299 Panigale. (Ducati)
Naturally, if performance is the discussion, Italians are involved. Ducati revealed the 1299 Panigale at EICMA, a larger-displacement version of its race replica, while Aprilia launched the RSV4 RR, an uprated edition of its RSV4 super sport bike.
The new Panigale uses an additional 100cc of engine displacement to boost horsepower to 205. An “R” version of the Panigale exists to make various desirable high-performance parts eligible for use in its ostensibly street bike-based World Superbike racers. In this case it means titanium valves, a lightened crankshaft that uses tungsten counterweights, and low-friction pistons that utilise only two rings instead of the customary three for sealing.
2015 Aprilia RSV4 RR. (Aprilia)
Aprilia says the RSV4 RR is the street-going version of its World Superbike contender, and that its 999.6cc V4 engine cranks out 201hp. That muscle is corralled by electronic systems guarding traction, launches and wheelies, each of which can be separately deactivated if the rider prefers to crash – er, control it manually.
Indeed, such electronic aids may keep  punchy politicians at bay, while permitting engineers to tease even  more power and speed from their creations. But first, we require an answer to the question of which is faster to 200mph: the Hellcat or the H2?

The best images from the Rosetta comet missionBy Andrea Peterson November 12 Follow @kansasalps
The European Space Agency's Rosetta mission just made history by landing on the surface of a comet. The lander Philae touched down on the surface of a comet more than 300 million miles away at a little after 11 a.m. Eastern time.
Here are the best pictures so far from the mission, some from Wednesday, and some from earlier during its 10-year journey -- we expect to update as more images are transmitted back to Earth.

Army general: U.S. troops in Liberia expected to top out at 3 000By Missy Ryan and Brady Dennis November 12 Follow @missy_ryan Follow @brady_dennis

The number of U.S. troops deploying to West Africa to help battle the Ebola epidemic could grow to 3,000 by the middle of December, but likely will not expand to the 4,000 soldiers that military officials had expected to send just weeks ago.
“What we found working with (the U.S. Agency for International Development) and the government of Liberia was there’s a lot of capacity here that we didn’t know about before,” Maj. Gen. Gary Volesky, who commands the U.S. military’s Ebola response in Liberia, said in a telephone briefing Wednesday with reporters at the Pentagon. “And so that enabled us to reduce the forces that we thought we originally had to bring.”
The decision not send the full number of U.S. troops initially authorized comes as the rate of Ebola infections has fallen sharply in Liberia in recent weeks, leaving once-overwhelmed treatment centers half empty and some corners of the country with few or no new cases. At the same, despite the recent positive turn in Liberia, infections have spiked in Sierra Leone, as well as in parts of Guinea.
Volesky and other officials involved in the U.S. effort against Ebola said that while the number of new cases in Liberia had slowed, the disease continues to pose a serious threat, and plenty of work remains to break the transmission chain of the disease.
“We are not out of the woods by any stretch of the imagination,” said Deborah Malac, the U.S. ambassador to Liberia. She said more treatment units and medical personnel were still needed to quell the outbreak.
Volesky said he expected that all 17 Ebola treatment units the United States had vowed to build in Liberia would be finished by the end of December. In addition, Malac said officials are working to reverse widespread public skepticism of Liberia’s health system, which had contributed to an increase in deaths from other, unrelated problems as many Liberians stayed away from medical facilities after the Ebola outbreak took root. .
“The system collapsed under the weight of this epidemic, which was much broader and faster than anybody could have anticipated, partly out of fear,” she said.

Uber to invest $400 million in India to grow business  expand and hireUber to invest $400 million in India to grow business, expand and hire

(“It is likely to use the…)
BENGALURU: Taxi hailing app Uber could set aside nearly half the amount from a proposed round of funding to grow business in India, its largest and fastest growing market outside of the US. "Uber could invest over $400 million in India," said two people familiar with developments. "It is likely to use the cash to strengthen presence where it has a footprint, expand to newer cities and to aggressively hire," said one source.
According to a report in the Wall Street Journal, Uber has informed its investors that it plans to raise more than $1 billion in funding which is likely to value the company at more than $30 billion.
Uber did not reply to email queries from ET on the developments. The Indian taxi aggregation space has been the hub of frenetic action in recent months, with companies like Ola, Taxi-ForSure and Uber, competing fiercely for market share . In October, Japan's Softbank led a $210-million funding round in Ola.
Experts are of the view that for Uber, India is an attractive market for the sheer scope that it offers for future growth. "The density footprint in Delhi or Bangalore is not even comparable to its fleet in say New York city. There is plenty of room for Uber to expand," said Arun Sundararajan, a professor at the Stern School of Business in New York whose research is focused on digital economics.
"In India there is a rapidly growing middle class and a lack of good infrastructure, so it makes a lot of sense for a company like Uber to take the market seriously."
The Indian taxi market is estimated to be worth about $9 billion (Rs 54,000 crore), of which only 4-6% is organised. There are around 2.3 million taxis registered in India.
"The aggressive money flow can be attributed to the fact that transport companies only need to leverage technology to reorganise an existing market," said Kartik Hosanagar, professor of ecommerce at The Wharton School, "This is often faster and more cost-efficient than creating new markets,' he said. Companies like Ola and Uber do not operate their own taxis but provide the technology platform that links taxi owners and operators with passengers.
Uber launched its Indian operations in September 2013. Since then it has expanded its network to include more than 15,000 drivers in ten cities including Calcutta, Mumbai, Bangalore and Delhi. The company is looking to hire more than 30 officials in India, according to its website, including government relations senior associate, and a strategic finance manager. Earlier this week, Uber also announced that it has partnered with financial services firms and automobile manufacturers to launch a vehicle financing program for Indian cab drivers.
Uber is backed by Goldman Sachs and Google Ventures, among others, and is reported to have clocked over $1 billion in gross bookings world over last year, with revenue estimated to be doubling every six months. The company is present in over 200 cities in the world.

Prabhu incentive: Finish projects on time  claim 2 pc of cost asrewardPrint
Suresh Prabhu takes charge as the Union Minister for Railways at Rail Bhawan in New Delhi on Monday. (Source: PTI)
Written by Avishek G Dastidar | New Delhi | Posted: November 13, 2014 3:51 am | Updated: November 13, 2014 12:55 pm
To ensure that rail projects do not languish for years and officers find a way to complete them within targets, Railways Minister Suresh Prabhu, who took charge this week, has decided to give two per cent of project cost to the project teams and their chiefs as reward. But if projects miss the deadlines, adverse comments will be entered in the Annual Confidential Report of the officials concerned.
The decision has been communicated to the Railway Board and Board members are currently working out a way to prepare this policy, according to documents accessed by The Indian Express.
Depending on the nature and size of the project, the incentive can be lower but never more than 2 per cent. The money will be worked out as part of the project cost. “The system of reward and penalty should be introduced,” Prabhu told Board members in a meeting.
The decisions, taken at top speed, over the course of just two meetings, have made Prabhu’s intentions and style of functioning clear to top officers in the Railways, sources said.
As availability of funds remains a problem area, Prabhu has also evinced interest in “securitizing” railway land for sourcing funds from external sources. The Railway Board has been asked to provide “details of encumbered land and its value” across the country.
Even before restructuring of the Railway Board takes place formally, Prabhu has directed Board members to carry out complete delegation of powers to field officers with proper checks and balances in a way that “Railway Board should only monitor closely”.
It has been instructed that tenders and such commercial matters will be decided up to the level of zonal General Managers only and do not require the ministry’s interference. The Board is now to prepare a formal revision of delegation of powers policy.
For a complete turnaround of the Railways, Prabhu has directed that each area of rail operations should come up with a global benchmark which should be on a par with global standards. The task given to each department is assess their performance against such spelled out benchmarks every year for a period of five years.
The Board will now prepare a White Paper on its finances to be presented before the Consultative Committee on Railways on December 1. The White Paper will be discussed in Parliament, before presentation of Prabhu’s first rail Budget next year.
As Prabhu heads to the G-20 summit to assist Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Railway Board will be busy preparing a presentation for the minister focusing on a three-year plan based on “benchmark of global standards in respect of Safety, Projects and Customer Satisfaction”, documents reveal.
In the past 30 years, as many as 676 projects were sanctioned worth Rs 1,57,883 crore. Of these, continued…

A Little India in Myanmar  with Hindi classes and an RSSbranchThe Indian-origin population in Zayawaddy is about 70,000.
Written by Esha Roy | Zayawaddy Grant (myanmar) | Posted: November 13, 2014 3:49 am
In between Myanmar’s two erstwhile capitals Yangon and Mandalay lies Zayawaddy Grant, a cluster of villages and a small township. At first glance it is no different from any other small town in this country, that not too long ago was closed to the rest of the world. A wide concrete highway cuts through and all around are strikingly green pastures and small, rain-drenched rolling hills. Cycle-rickshaw drivers wearing conical hats with pom poms line the streets.
Look closer though and the difference is apparent. Tucked between traditional wooden Burmese huts raised on stilts are two-storey concrete homes that could belong to any Indian small town. Wearing traditional Burmese shirts tucked into lungis and savouring samosas and jalebis at tea stalls are many Indian faces, while sari-clad figures rush about holding hands of children returning from school.
Numbering over 70,000 in Zayawaddy town and surrounding villages, they are the descendants of farmers brought by the British from India — mostly from Bihar, but also Uttar Pradesh — to cultivate land in these parts. In the years that the military junta ruled Myanmar with an iron thumb, they largely escaped the authorities’ attention and have now become Myanmarese citizens.
The Little India has a Hindu Kalyan Sahyog Samiti to take care of religious affairs, Hindi is taught to children at a sprawling Gandhi Hall and in nearly a hundred schools, a temple with idols of Shiva, Lakshmi and Radha-Krishna draws many faithfuls, and there is an RSS branch to “liaise” with the authorities.
An idol of the Buddha is also housed in the temple, “to show respect to the local religion”.
Around 1,500 of the Indian descendants are Muslims.
One of the elders and leaders of the community, 73-year-old Shiv Das Verma, says farmers from UP and Bihar were the first settlers on this land. “The first batch of 3,500 farmers was brought in 1889, and then another 4,000 farmers joined them in 1902. The land was a dense forest then and they were told to cut down the trees and start cultivation. We have heard accounts of tigers, elephants, pythons, Cheetahs and bears roaming these lands, and sometimes attacking the first settlers,” he says. A sugar factory considered Myanmar’s first was later started here by the British as sugarcane is one of the staple crops here.
The farmers were brought by Raja Keshav Prasad Sinha of Dumraon (from Ara, Bihar), who had been gifted 20,000 acres of land in and around Zayawaddy for services rendered to the British, on a 30-year lease. He handed over the land to his dewan, Harihar Prasad Sinha, who took charge of cultivating it under the supervision of the British. “Farmers from Bihar were invited here. There were some families who came from UP as well, mostly Azamgarh,” says Shiv Das.
According to him, only those who could count till below 100 were selected. “Even those who made continued…

Hospital trust had no clue aboutcampPrint
Villagers protesting outside the state health minister's residence against underwent sterilization surgeries, in Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh on Tuesday. (Source: PTI)
Written by Ashutosh Bhardwaj , Abantika Ghosh | Bilaspur/new Delhi | Posted: November 13, 2014 3:42 am | Updated: November 13, 2014 7:36 am
Four days after the Chhattisgarh government’s Health Department held a sterilisation camp in Bilaspur that led to the death of 13 women, two more chilling clues have emerged that could further unravel the story behind the tragedy.
The laparoscopic tubectomies, conducted inside the crumbling premises of a private charitable hospital that was shut down in April, took place without the knowledge of the trust that ran the facility.
Preliminary reports obtained by the Union Health Ministry suggest that the deaths were caused by the use of non-sterilised surgical equipment. Several doctors of the State Health Department, including some of those who were suspended for their role in the camp, told The Indian Express that the government used to conduct camps at Nemichand Jain Charitable Hospital, when it was operational, with the permission of the management. They admitted that these camps continued to be held there even after the facility was shut down six months ago.
“We have no information that they conducted surgeries in the hospital. We locked the hospital down in April,” the trust told The Indian Express in a statement. “We do not know how they (health officials) entered inside and did it.”
The trust added that the hospital was “never fully functional” and was closed because of a lack of enough patients and qualified medical personnel. Sources said that the chief trustee Nemichand Jain was unwell and is recovering in a Delhi hospital.
Bilaspur Collector Siddharth Komal Pardesi did not respond to phone calls and messages from this newspaper seeking comment on the issue.
Records confirm that this was not the first time that such camps were held here since the hospital shut down. In fact, Dr R K Gupta, who headed the camp four days ago, had conducted similar sterilisation camps in the premises at least twice in the recent months – in July and September.
The abandoned hospital is now surrounded by thick bushes, and the facility itself presents a grim picture with cracking floors and rusted furniture strewn around inside the rooms.
Not surprisingly, preliminary reports available with the Union Health Ministry show that the women who died had gone into “hypovolemic shock” (haemorrhagic shock) caused by excessive blood loss, which suggests they might have suffered from an infection. A credible picture will emerge only after the blood culture reports are obtained.
On Saturday, Dr Gupta conducted laparoscopic tubectomies on 83 woman, 50 of whom are still in various hospitals in the city. According to the central government’s guidelines, a medical team cannot conduct more than 30 such tubectomies in a day, with three separate laparoscopes ? that means not more than 10 tubectomies with a single instrument, as each instrument needs to be properly sterilised after every operation.
A team of doctors from Delhi’s AIIMS is now in Bilaspur to conduct a probe into the reasons behind the deaths, and the state government has continued…

NASAs new capsule at launch pad for testflightFuture Orions are meant to carry astronauts on missions of deep-space exploration, including trips to Mars.
By: Associated Press | Cape Canaveral | Posted: November 13, 2014 3:42 am
NASA’s new Orion spacecraft is now at the launch pad for next month’s test flight.
The spacecraft was moved 22 miles (35 kilometers) overnight at Cape Canaveral, Florida, and reached the launch pad early Wednesday. It was then hoisted into place on top of a Delta IV rocket for the Dec. 4 launch.
The test flight will last just over four hours and propel the unmanned capsule 3,600 miles (5,800 kilometers) away from Earth, before returning it for a splashdown in the Pacific.
Future Orions are meant to carry astronauts on missions of deep-space exploration, including trips to Mars. Astronauts are expected to start flying on Orion in 2021. The capsules are built for four passengers, one more than the old Apollo spacecraft.

Even after deaths  26 more tubectomies were done in one hour at anothercampThe grieving mother and sister of Chaiti Bai, a member of the protected Baiga tribe.
Written by Ashutosh Bhardwaj | Bilaspur | Posted: November 13, 2014 3:31 am | Updated: November 13, 2014 9:12 am
Even as the women who underwent laparoscopic tubectomies in Takhatpur reported complications and were admitted to hospital on Sunday, the government went ahead with another sterilisation camp in Gaurela hospital of Bilaspur on Monday. If 83 women were operated upon in five hours in Takhatpur, 26 tubectomies were done in an hour in Gaurela — about one every two minutes.
One woman who was at the Gaurela camp died on Wednesday, while at least 20 have reported post-surgery complications. Fifteen were brought to the Bilaspur district headquarters today.
The woman who died has been identified as Chaiti Bai, a Baiga — a protected tribe. With their population showing a dip over the years, the state government has banned the sterilisation of members of this tribe, who are primarily forest dwellers. Several schemes worth crores are being run for their welfare.
Yet, Chaiti was among the women taken to the sterilisation camp. At least one more Baiga woman, Mangli Bai, who also underwent the operation in Gaurela, is reported to be critical.
“I don’t know anything about the operation. Mujhe kya pata usne kyon karvaya (I don’t know why she did it),” said Chaiti’s sister, Lalli Bai. Their mother, Nan Bail, stood outside the mortuary of the Bilaspur district hospital with her granddaughter crying in her arms. They were waiting for the body, so that they could make the long journey home — their village of Dhanauli is about 150 kilometres away. Chaiti’s husband, Budh Singh, was waiting at the village with their other daughter.
As was the case with the Takhatpur surgeries, the two women did not know about the operation. They said someone had persuaded Chaiti to go to the camp.
Meanwhile, the Takhatpur death toll increased to 13 on Wednesday, as one more woman, Shiv Kumari, died at a Bilaspur hospital. Nearly 50 women are still admitted in Bilaspur hospitals, and over 20 are reported to be critical.
Taking suo moto cognizance of the incident, the Chhattisgarh High Court on Wednesday asked the state government to file a detailed report within 10 days. The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) also issued a notice to the state government directing it to file a report within two weeks. The Supreme Court, however, refused to take suo motu cognizance, saying “the Chief Minister has taken up the issue with the Prime Minister”.
With their condition showing little change even after over 48 hours of intensive care, the Chhattisgarh Institute of Medical Sciences, where many of these women have been admitted, has now decided to examine the matter afresh.
“The matter is now turning very complicated. Earlier, we thought it was a case of faulty procedure that caused septicemia and subsequent deaths. But now it seems that septicemia alone cannot cause so many deaths and severe illness to almost all of them,” continued…

Global demand for diamonds to grow at 4-5%: ...Africa
(Because of the US economic…)
Diamond is probably the only luxury item whose price has been increasing, unlike bullion and other commodities, which have fallen recently to multiyear lows. And it's likely to lustre on, Paul Rowley, EVP DeBeers Global Sightholder Sales, tells ET's Ram Sahgal, because of the US economic recovery and continued growth in China and India. DeBeers produces around 33% of the world's rough diamonds by value. Edited excerpts:
We hear that rough diamond prices have risen significantly over the past two years. How much have they risen by and is DeBeers planning to raise roughs production?
Between the middle of 2013 and of 2014, rough prices saw a mid-single digit increase. De Beers' production is expected to be around 32 million carats in 2014 (31.1 million carats in 2013).
What has been the impact of rising rough prices on polished diamonds in India and globally?
The diamond industry has a seasonal demand pattern and prices of rough and polished diamonds can see increases and decreases during the year depending on several factors.
Prices of polished diamonds increased earlier in 2014 as retailers restocked their inventories after the positive sales environment during the end-of-year selling season. Although polished prices are currently slightly lower than earlier in 2014, the expectations are for good consumer demand for diamond jewellery in the major retail markets over the end-of-year selling season and we believe this will see an increase in demand for polished diamonds in the near future as retailers see a growth in their diamond jewellery sales and then look to restock once more after the key end of year season.
The global economy hasn't recovered fully from the recessionary fallout. Diamond is probably the only luxury item whose price is rising amid a fall in bullion and other commodities to multi-year lows. Where is the demand for polished diamonds coming from and what is your outlook for the industry?
Global consumer demand is forecast to grow at an average of 4-5% in US dollar nominal terms between 2013 and 2018, driven by the effect of the US economic recovery and the continued growth of emerging markets, especially China and India. A positive supply demand outlook is shared by a number of external experts. RBC said that in their Diamond Digest in March this year that demand is set to strengthen rapidly, determined by the recovery of consumer confidence in the US, and China as penetration of diamond jewellery pieces increases among the growing middle class there.
Is De Beers planning to buy more mines or bolster production from existing ones?
We continue to invest billions of dollars for production growth with projects in South Africa, Botswana and Canada. In South Africa, we have begun a project to take Venetia mine (South Africa's largest diamond mine) underground; this will extend the mine life beyond 2040. In Botswana, we are investing in the Cut-8 extension at Debswana's Jwaneng Mine that will extend the life of one of the world's richest diamond mines to at least 2028. In Canada, we have a joint venture with Mountain Province Diamonds to build a new mine — Gahcho Kue in the Northwest Territories — that will commence production in late 2016 with a life of mine of some 11 years.
  How is the industry coping with the threat from cultured or lab made diamonds?
Man-made diamonds are not, in themselves, a threat to the diamond industry as they are completely different propositions.
Extensive research we've carried out over the years has told us that consumers see natural diamonds as emotionally significant in a way that synthetics are not and they want the real thing to mark important occasions in their lives. The view from consumers is that you cannot create forever in a lab.
Are there going to be major changes in the Sightholder policy or have these already been instituted?
Earlier this year, we communicated an updated approach for the new three-year supply contract with Global Sightholder Sales. The new contractual period involves more flexibility in purchasing opportunities and requires customers to meet new, more rigorous financial compliance requirements. We believe the new contractual period will strengthen the confidence of all stakeholders in the diamond industry.

Modi government to expand UPA’s corporate job scheme in Jammu & Kashmir
Aman Sharma, ET Bureau Nov 13, 2014, 04.00AM IST
(Home minister Rajnath Singh…)
NEW DELHI: The Centre is planning to expand the 'Udaan' scheme initiated by the previous UPA government to rope in prominent companies to recruit youths from Jammu & Kashmir, as part of a new J&K policy to be unveiled early next year after the assembly elections in the state.
Home minister Rajnath Singh has suggested an improvement to the scheme, which involves taking companies beyond Srinagar to other towns and even remote locations in the state for organising employment camps and hiring locals, officials said. The government will pay local people salaries to bring unemployed graduates to the placement camps to make a success of this initiative, they added.
After the disruption due to severe floods, a group of companies is set to visit the state on November 17 to resume recruitments, a home ministry official said. The scheme has already helped provide jobs to 1,785 youths from J&K with companies including Accenture, Tata Consultancy Services and Wipro, the official added.
"Nearly 5,300 J&K youth are presently under training with various corporates. We now want to expand reach of the scheme to smaller towns and remote areas of J&K for which a plan is being made and will be unveiled after the state elections," the official told ET on condition of anonymity.
An assessment of the scheme by the Narendra Modi-led NDA government, which took over in May, has shown that youths from cities like Jammu and Srinagar are averse to taking up corporate jobs in metros as the initial remuneration is just Rs 15,000-20,000 per month.
"These youths seem to be finding the salary package not enough. We are trying to work with the corporates to increase the salary. But the thought is also that a graduate in a remote town or village of J&K would perhaps see such a salary level of Rs 20,000 a month as attractive and hence can be tapped," the official said.
More than 54 companies have already committed to train nearly 68,738 graduates and post-graduates in J&K over the next four-five years and later offer them jobs as well if they fit the bill. The cost of the training, boarding and lodging, is borne by the central government. If a candidate is selected for a job after completing training, the government reimburses the training cost to the company.
The official added a number of other companies have recently tied up with the Centre to train youths in J&K over the next few years. These include Bharti Infratel Limited; TENVIC, a division of Anil Kumble Sports Promotion; Fidelis Corporate Solutions; MTC Mount Talent Consulting; and Manpower Group, the world leader in innovative work solutions.
YES Bank, Religare and public sector units including NTPC, BSNL, ONGC, HAL and BHEL are also among the companies that have committed to train J&K youths for corporate jobs in metros.

Digital India drive
(The government is also planning…)
NEW DELHI | BENGALURU: Indian government software applications are set to make the shift to open source, potentially boosting the pace at which such programmes are developed, and leading to millions of dollars in savings by moving away from proprietary systems.
The government is readying a policy that calls for open source software to be used as part of the Digital India initiative. The government is also planning to create a Github-like repository of software that can be collaboratively developed.
"We don't want to make it a question of ideology but wherever possible, we want to make use of open source," RS Sharma, secretary, department of electronics and information technology, told ET. "We are also preparing something like a SourceForge, where we will open up the source code of all the existing software and crowd source development like on Github," he said.
Github and SourceForge are popular internet repositories for software code that can be shared and revised by many people.
Experts feel that this will radically improve egovernance and add up significant savings as code and applications can be reused. Governments in India are expected to spend $6.4 billion on IT products and services in 2014, according to Gartner. "The advantage is that every consulting firm will not have to re-invent the software," said Sharma. The policy intends to speed up development and deployment of e-governance projects across various sectors in the government.
"Open source has offered us the best way to out of vendor lock-in and unpredictable financial commitments," said Jay Pullur, founder and CEO, Pramati Technologies, who is also part of software product think tank Ispirt.
According to an early version of the 'Policy On Collaborative Application Development by Opening the Source Code of Government Applications', accessed by ET, the source code of hundreds of custom applications run by various government bodies is to be shared among government agencies and maintained in a common repository.
"The open code policy will ensure faster deployment of IT projects, speeding up the pace of innovation and reducing failure rates of projects," said Venkatesh Hariharan, director of Alchemy Business Solutions LLP, a company focused on technology for development in Indian language computing and open source education technology.
The repository will avoid duplication of applications and solutions to a large extent. For instance, a state wanting to adopt a particular application just has to go to the repository and customise it. "It is perverse that each state develops its own treasury application from scratch when it could be the same code," said Hariharan.
While open source experts agree that the policy is a step in the right direction, they caution that like most government initiatives, it would make a real impact only if implemented well. "Because open source is open code, you can rework on it, re-conceptualise it. And India would need a lot," said Parminder Jeet Singh, executive director at IT for Change .
Pullur said, "Given the diversity and plurality of the nation, open source adoption is the best approach and rightly chosen by the government." Singh added that India has had a policy for open standards, which was drafted in 2010, but its implementation was "very shabby". He hoped that the new policy had the "highest political backing". Another advantage would be scaling up skill development in open source.

Sensex conquers 28K; don t see a big rally next yearBSE sensex
(Most analysts expect the…)
NEW DELHI: After rallying over 200 points in intraday trade, the Sensex lost momentum in late trade, but enthused investors as it closed above the crucial 28,000-mark.
The Sensex closed the day at 28,008.9, up 98.84 points. The Nifty ended the day at 8,383.30, up 20.6 points.
What lies ahead? Analysts say we should not expect a big-bang rally in 2015.
Benchmark indices, namely the Sensex & the Nifty, have rallied over 32 per cent so far in the year 2014, but a similar performance next year might be a little difficult as a lot of positives are already being factored in the price, say analysts.
India has been the top beneficiary of strong foreign flows when compared with other emerging market peers, largely on account of strong macros, stable currency and the Modi factor.
Most analysts expect the market to rally probably by 10 per cent to 15 per cent, while some even expect a negative or flat return for the year 2015.
"Eyeing a 20 per cent return in the next 12 months is far too optimistic and you are absolutely right in saying that India has been one of the top performing markets this year. Year-to-date the Sensex is well above 30 per cent," says Robert Parker, Senior Advisor, Credit Suisse.
"The upside in the Indian market, taking a 12-months view, is probably limited to a further 5 per cent to 10 per cent. Having said that, I reiterate my positive outlook for the Indian economy," he adds.
On Tuesday, global investment bank UBS recommended a target of 9,600 on the Nifty by end-2015, which presents an upside of nearly 15 per cent from current levels. That is half of what the markets delivered in the year 2014.
They remain bullish on Indian equities for the year 2015 considering the fact that the economic growth recovery is underway, which will sustain current valuations.
Unlike the last three years, UBS expects FY16 and FY17 earnings growth estimates of over 15 per cent to be met. The Nifty target of 9,600 is based on top-down expectation of 15 per cent earnings growth in FY16E and 18 per cent growth in FY17E (on a base of 13% in FY15E), explains UBS.
The S&P BSE Sensex rallied to 28,000 for the first time last week and is well on its way to touch 30k by the end of this year, and probably 35000 by December 2015, which only provides an upside of 25 per cent from current levels
According to an ET Now survey of 15 brokerage firms, conducted last month, reveals that most analysts are eyeing a level of 30000-35000 in the next 12 months.
As per the poll, 33 per cent of respondents are of the view that the Sensex could see the levels above 35000 in the next 12 months, while 50 per cent or majority of the respondents see the index trading in the range of 30000-35000. And, only 17 per cent of the respondents see the index hovering in the range of 26000-30000.
The government is making the right noises, moving the right levers, albeit a little slowly, but very-very steadily. But achieving a growth rate of over 6 per cent may take a while.
"Unlike what most market participants would like to believe, running a country is a little different from running the markets. So it is going to take a while to change," says Dipen Sheth, Head-Institutional Research, HDFC Securities.
"It is a huge country. We keep on talking of 125 crore people or what have you, and to get things to steer this big ship around is a little different from taking a quick U-turn on a scooter. We want to see everyday excitement on our screens and that is not going to happen," he adds.
There are some experts who think that the present momentum may not continue for long or in the next year, as the Reserve Bank of India may take a while before it starts cutting rates and the US may well hike interest rates, which would put some bit of pressure on the emerging markets, including India.
"Momentum may not continue as interest rates are going to be raised in the US next year. The RBI is not going to cut rates before FY16. So we can expect significant volatility," says Yogesh Nagaonkar, VP-Institutional Equities, Bonanza Portfolio Ltd.
"The Nifty can give no or negative returns in the next 1 year," he says, adding that the Budget will be the next big trigger for the Indian markets, and if the next Budget fails to live up to the expectations of the market (implementing key reforms such as GST ), then the market will react negatively.
Markets running ahead of fundamentals?
Most economists across brokerages feel that the economy has bottomed out, but will take time to pick up. With factors turning favourable, the growth is expected to gain momentum in FY16.
While the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) has lowered India's growth forecast to 5.4 per cent from 5.7 per cent estimated earlier for the current year, it expects the Indian economy to expand 6.4 per cent next year compared with 5.9 per cent estimated less than two months back in its September'14 interim outlook.
"In terms of underlying economic activity - whether it is credit off-take, auto sales or earnings numbers- it is clear that the economy has not really turned meaningfully," says Saurabh Mukherjea, CEO-Institutional Equities, Ambit Capital.
"My reading is that the second quarter growth will come in well below the Q1 number of 5.7 per cent. We are looking at a number closer to 5%. So there is a concern that the economy has not actually turned in a significant way," he adds.
Mukherjea is of the view that this is a slow recovery and it will take time to overcome the fundamental issues of the economy. The best way to make profit it is buy good-quality names, which will stand the test of time, because you will need to be patient to make money in India, he adds.

Smartlink Network SystemsBSE ID : 532419     NSE ID : SMARTLINK
RECOMMENDED PRICE 57.60
PEAK FROM RECO 93.60 62.50%
CURRENT PRICE 73.10 26.91%
Smartlink Network Systems Ltd. is one of India's leading networking company. We recommend to buy at CMP with a target price of Rs 100-125.
Smartlink Network Systems
The smart bet for long term play.
NDA led government is looking for smart city and here is a proxy bet after we identified D-link which is already up 3x times.
About the company
Smartlink Network Systems Ltd. is one of India's leading networking company. It was established in the year 1993 to prop the Indian market in the field of Network Infrastructure. Pioneer in the field of Active networking, it offers an integrated value proposition from design and development
Why Smartlink a Smart Bet?
Debt Free Company having market cap of 170 crore and Liquid Investments of 280 odd crore as per latest balance sheetand 50 crore of cash. Meaning you are getting the Brand Digisol free of cost and additional 110 crores-140 crores of liquid equivalent
The company sold its Digi Link Business 3 years back but now the new forte will soon reap tremendous return. On net net basis investors with long term view has nothing to lose from here on as the threat or fear of seeing the fate end of new forte has eventually evened out.
We have valued the Digi-Sol business of smartlink for about 130 crore. Thus on total value front it is a company with intrinsic value of 400 crore+ available at 170 crore meaning target of 2.5x of current price. However the first target should be at around 100-125 before we initiate fresh view on Digi- business
Globally such net switch gear companies are trading at 20-22 PE on Cash Adjustment basis the value of the company works out to be at 150 a share including cash
Company paying dividend of 2 rupees thus making it a very attractive dividend yield.
Smartlink: The big trigger
Smartlink apart from cash is having no leverage, thus cash is available in surplus. Japan companies will be eyeing Indian Partners for smart city. Scope of business is so huge that it cannot be actually evaluated and we are talking about 100's of cities and thus opportunities will be multifold. Technology Hardpacks is what we have identified the two companies as D-Link and Smart Link. Though there is no more common-link between the two we believe just like D-link Performance from 28 to 100. Smartlink will soon be having the similar run-rate.
Schneider globally has been taking over such niche businesses. And there has been a past deal done by the company. So one cannot rule out the development.
The closest proxy is D-link doing 4 Rs. EPS and available at 25 PE and at dividend yield of 1 percent. Smartlink is available at 4 percent dividend yield.

Modi adds talent and gravitas to Cabinet, moves out those not making the cut
New Delhi, November 10:  
Political symbolism of accommodating caste and regional aspirations aside, the expansion of the Union Cabinet on Sunday was an exercise in furthering Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s stated aim to increase efficiency and improve delivery systems in the government.
Striking a balance
The thrust clearly was on adding talent and gravitas by picking seasoned administrators like Manohar Parrikar and Suresh Prabhu as well as technocrats and professionals like Mahesh Sharma, a well-known physician who has a chain of clinics and diagnostic centres in Delhi’s neighbouring Noida, and former Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha’s Harvard-educated son Jayant.
Sunday’s additions simultaneously triggered a minor reshuffle in which those who did not meet the PM’s exacting standards were moved out while simultaneously easing the burden on some who had too much on their plate.
Efficiency was clearly valued over party loyalties, especially in sectors close to Modi’s heart.
For instance, the PM handpicked Suresh Prabhu to ease out DV Sadanand Gowda from the Railways, a key infrastructure portfolio where Modi wants to usher in new reforms.
Besides Prabhu’s vastly superior administrative skills and techo-economic expertise, Gowda’s position in the key ministry had been weakened by controversies surrounding his son, Karthik.
So, even though Gowda had taken some crucial decisions to better the finances of the Railways, he was gently edged to the Law and Justice Ministry to make way for the savvier Prabhu.
Gowda took over the Law Ministry from Ravi Shankar Prasad, who can now focus on the crucial Telecom Ministry.
By relieving Arun Jaitley of Defence, which he himself described as a “temporary charge” when he took over, the Prime Minister requisitioned the services of Manohar Parrikar, counted among the most credible leaders in the BJP.
Knights in command
While Parrikar and Prabhu bring a certain expertise to the upper echelons of the Council of Ministers, Jaitley retains his clout by being the new interface between the government and the media as the new Information and Broadcasting Minister.
Besides being possibly the most media-savvy Minister in the Cabinet, there are other important factors in this shift. The sector has been opened up for private participation leading to many critical issues including corporate cross holdings.
Kinship matters
Another important strand in the Prime Minister stepping up the efficiency quotient is the inclusion of another IITian, besides Parrikar that is, Jayant Sinha as Minister of State for Finance.
Although Sinha’s inclusion is largely being attributed to his Harvard Business School and Wall Street credentials, the fact that he is the son of former Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha too apparently played a role in his appointment.
True to expectations, Sinha’s first interaction with the media as MoS, Finance, reflected his ease with his new assignment. Sinha was well versed with issues ranging from the state of the economy to concerns over inflation.
Lighter portfolio
A noticeable change was that of Harsh Vardhan from Health, talks for which had started in August when the AIIMS CVO transfer issue came to the forefront. The issue of irregularities in the CVO’s appointment had been raised by JP Nadda, who has taken over from Harsh Vardhan.
Given a relatively lighter portfolio of Science and Technology, Harsh Vardhan will only warm the seat till he is recalled to head the election campaign in Delhi.

The President Might Have Just Saved the InternetDuring his first run for the White House, Barack Obama promised that he would take "a back seat to no one" on Net Neutrality.
Today, the president finally got in the driver's seat.
Early this morning, President Obama issued a clear and powerful statement of support for real Net Neutrality -- one that left no wiggle room or confusion about where he stands.
The short summary for anyone who has been following the debate over Net Neutrality: THIS IS HUGE.
The president's statement is worth quoting at length:
An open Internet is essential to the American economy, and increasingly to our very way of life. By lowering the cost of launching a new idea, igniting new political movements, and bringing communities closer together, it has been one of the most significant democratizing influences the world has ever known.
'Net Neutrality' has been built into the fabric of the Internet since its creation -- but it is also a principle that we cannot take for granted. We cannot allow Internet service providers (ISPs) to restrict the best access or to pick winners and losers in the online marketplace for services and ideas. That is why today I am asking the Federal Communications Commission to answer the call of almost 4 million public comments, and implement the strongest possible rules to protect Net Neutrality.
The president goes on to say:
To be current, these rules must also build on the lessons of the past. For almost a century, our law has recognized that companies who connect you to the world have special obligations not to exploit the monopoly they enjoy over access in and out of your home or business. That is why a phone call from a customer of one phone company can reliably reach a customer of a different one, and why you will not be penalized solely for calling someone who is using another provider. It is common sense that the same philosophy should guide any service that is based on the transmission of information -- whether a phone call, or a packet of data.
So the time has come for the FCC to recognize that broadband service is of the same importance and must carry the same obligations as so many of the other vital services do. To do that, I believe the FCC should reclassify consumer broadband service under Title II of the Telecommunications Act -- while at the same time forbearing from rate regulation and other provisions less relevant to broadband services. This is a basic acknowledgment of the services ISPs provide to American homes and businesses, and the straightforward obligations necessary to ensure the network works for everyone -- not just one or two companies.
Obama's words arrive at a crucial moment in the fight for real Net Neutrality. For months and months, his appointee to head the Federal Communications Commission has put forward convoluted, loophole-ridden proposals to avoid reclassifying broadband under Title II. Both FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler's original slow-lane-creating "706" proposal and the baffling " hybrid " currently under consideration would endanger the open Internet as we know it.
The FCC is an independent agency, but the president appointed its commissioners who pay attention to what he says. Today's statement sends a clear message to FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler: Stop messing around and get on the surest path to protecting the open Internet.
Why is the administration suddenly so vocal? There's only one answer: unprecedented public pressure . Nearly 4 million people have weighed in at the FCC for real Net Neutrality -- by far the most comments received in the agency's history. And over the past 10 months, activists have staged an escalating series of actions , rallies and people's hearings on the issue. The phones have been ringing off the hook at the White House for weeks.
A broad coalition of public interest advocates, netroots organizers, grassroots leaders and innovative businesses have joined together to push for strong Net Neutrality rules. We've resisted half-baked compromises and business as usual in Washington to keep advocating for the policies that will actually preserve the open Internet. And today President Obama became our standard-bearer.
I haven't been shy about criticizing this administration in the past -- and I won't hesitate to do so in the future. But today, Internet users everywhere should thank President Obama and his staff. Today, they just might have saved the Internet.
We still need to keep the pressure on the FCC unless and until Wheeler follows the president's lead and crafts strong rules under Title II. (A statement put out by Wheeler today in response to the president indicates the FCC may take more time to write new rules, which could push a vote from December into early 2015.) Until the full Commission passes real Net Neutrality protections, we can't let up.
And we need to get ready for a backlash. Because powerful companies like AT&T, Comcast and Verizon will attack the president's move. They will unleash their legions of high-priced lobbyists and misinformation-spreading flacks. These companies aren't used to losing in Washington.
The president's partisan opponents might try to paint his call for Title II as too much regulation, and they might even try to overturn good rules. But no industry or partisan spin can change the fact that Title II is a deregulatory, flexible approach that has allowed the Internet to flourish. And only rules based on Title II will survive in court. It's the only way to provide what the public wants: an open Internet where you can speak freely and innovate without permission -- an Internet where users, and not big companies, are in control.
In the weeks ahead, we need to put as much energy into advancing good policies as we did into opposing bad ones. Now that the president has stood up for us, we need to stand up for him.

WATCH: Anchor Not Amused By Co-Host s Taylor Swift Dancereddit
Sarah Pisciuneri would probably prefer her co-host Dan Thorn not take advice from Taylor Swift during commercial breaks. At least, that's what people say, mmm-mmm.
By the looks of it, the dance-happy WVNS 59 News anchor just can't stop, won't stop moving. It's like he's got this music in his mind, telling him it's gonna be alright.
The West Virginia anchor rose to prominence last week when he let loose to T.I.'s "Where They At Doe" during a break on the show and uploaded the video to YouTube.
Thorn told Billboard he decided to follow up his T.I. performance with a Taylor Swift dance, in the hopes of getting co-anchor Pisciuneri to join in. By the looks of this video, it didn't quite work out like he'd planned, though he did get some head nods:
That's alright, Thorn. Shake it off. Haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate.

Gold  silver rates extend losses on weak global cues  lowdemandGold futures price falls on global cues
Gold rates plunged by Rs 345 to Rs 26,050 per ten gram in Delhi today, tracking a weak global trend amid absence of demand from jewellers and retailers at domestic markets.
Silver remained under pressure and fell by Rs 350 to Rs 35,150 per kg on poor offtake by industrial units.
Sentiments remained subdued largely in tandem with a weak trend in global markets where gold traded at a four-year low as surging dollar waned demand for the precious metals, traders said.
Besides, slackened demand from jewellers as well as retailers at prevailing levels at domestic spot markets too weighed on prices, they added.
Globally, gold in Singapore, which normally sets price trend on the domestic front, fell by 0.16 per cent to USD 1,149 an ounce, a lowest level since 2010. Silver also slid 0.7 per cent to USD 15.50 an ounce.
In Delhi, gold of 99.9 and 99.5 per cent purity tumbled by Rs 345 each to Rs 26,050 and Rs 25,850 per ten gram respectively. It had lost Rs 55 in yesterday’s trade.
Sovereign also declined by Rs 100 to Rs 23,700 per piece of eight gram.
In a similar fashion, silver ready dropped further by Rs 350 to Rs 35,150 per kg and weekly-based delivery by Rs 535 to Rs 34,490 per kg.
Silver coins also fell sharply by Rs 2,000 to Rs 58,000 for buying and Rs 59,000 for selling of 100 pieces.

IFC sells Masala Re Bonds; raises Rs 1 000 cr for AxisBankKotak Mahindra Bank: Deal and after
The World Bank Group’s development finance body IFC today raised Rs 1,000 crore through a 10-year bond, which will be invested in private sector lender Axis Bank’s forthcoming infra bond issue.
Christened as ‘Masala Bonds’, the latest issuance is a part of the Corporation’s USD 2-billion offshore rupee bond programme and will be the first such offering to be listed on the London Stock Exchange, the Washington-based developmental body said in a statement issued here.
Proceeds from the latest issue will support a forthcoming infrastructure bond issuance by Axis Bank, the statement said.
It can be noted that the country’s third largest private sector lender Axis Bank is targeting to raise up to Rs 6,000 crore by March through the long term infra bond instrument issued by RBI in July.
“The IFC Masala Bonds set a triple-A benchmark for offshore rupee issuances and pave the way for more foreign investment to help meet the country’s private sector development needs,” said Tarun Bajaj, Joint Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance.
Among all the rupee denominated issues till now by IFC, the latest offering has the longest maturity at 10 years, keeping in mind the needs of the longer gestation infrastructure projects, it said, adding, the others have been in the 3, 5 and 7 year buckets.
“This bond issue demonstrates the powerful role that capital markets can play in linking international savings to infrastructure investment. The strong demand from investors signals continued momentum for the Indian economy,” IFC chief executive Jin-Yong Cai said.
The yield for the bonds has been set at 6.3 per cent, it said, adding that J P Morgan was the sole arranger for the issuance.
The rupee denominated bonds help deepen the process of internationalisation of the rupee and involve raising money in an international currency, which is brought onshore and converted into rupee in the domestic spot market.
The repayment will be as per the existing exchange rate of the rupee against the international currency.

Can honey sriracha and pretzel pizza help Pizza Hut make a comebackPizzas from Pizza Hut’s new menu. (PRNewsFoto/Yum Brands)
Pizza Hut is looking to get out of its pizza rut.
The chain has recently faced quarter after quarter of sagging sales , even as its chief rival, Domino’s Pizza, saw healthy sales growth.  In October, executives with Pizza Hut’s parent company, Yum Brands, pledged that the brand would soon unveil a major effort to boost sales.
The comeback plan was unveiled  this week .
Pizza Hut announced  that it would overhaul everything from its logo to its employee uniforms. The centerpiece of the strategy is a revamped menu, one that includes 10 new crust flavors, five new toppings and six new sauces.  Instead of doubling down on classic Italian flavors, Pizza Hut is trying to bring global flair to its pies.  New crust options include Honey Sriracha, Salted Pretzel, Ginger Boom Boom and Get Curried Away.
“We know that American tastes and preferences are evolving, and this new menu is designed to completely wow them,” said Wiley Bates III, Pizza Hut’s global executive chef, in a statement.
Still, some of the new items don’t reflect a particularly new flavor profile for the Pizza Hut diner. New pizza sauces such as Buffalo and barbecue offer a different spin on flavors that have long been available on the chain’s wings menu.
Pizza Hut’s strategy is similar in some ways to the one that McDonald’s recently announced for turning around its own flagging business. McDonald’s pledged to make its menu more customizable, while Pizza Hut’s slate of new crust flavors, sauces and ingredients also seem aimed at giving customers more choice.
While Pizza Hut remains the world’s largest pizza company, with 15,000 restaurants across the globe, analysts say it has lost ground to its competitors and been outmaneuvered on digital ordering technology. Online orders now account for 45 percent of sales at rival Domino’s, which experts largely attribute to the ease of its online ordering system.  Pizza Hut is making a bid to win more digital customers with a revamped online ordering tools, which it promises are “more interactive and visual.”  Pizza Hut’s online ordering capabilities will now be available in both English and Spanish.
At a time when many restaurant-goers are seeking healthier options, Pizza Hut is also adding Skinny Slice Pizza to its menu.  With a thinner crust and a mix of relatively healthy toppings, these items each have less than 250 calories per slice.
Pizza Hut’s move comes at a time when the broader fast-food industry in facing intense pressure from fast-casual outposts such as Chipotle and Noodles & Co. So far, the pizza chains have been somewhat insulated from the rise of fast-casual dining because none of the giants of that category specialize in making pizza.  But that could change soon:  Chipotle recently opened a second location for Pizzeria Locale , a fast-casual pizza restaurant.  Blaze Pizza, Live Basil and The Pizza Studio are also relative newcomers that aim to bring a Chipotle-style dining experience and menu to the pizza category.

Smartphone sales up 65% to 23.5 mn in Q3: CounterpointInternational rights not in jeopardy, clarifies SpiceJet
Growing consumer preference for Internet-enabled phones and falling prices has helped smartphone sales in India to grow 65 per cent to 23.5 million units in the third quarter of 2014, a report by Counterpoint Research said today.
This is against sales of over 14 million smartphones sales in July-September 2013 period, Counterpoint said in its Market Monitor Q3 2014 Report.
On a quarter on quarter basis, sales were up over 23 per cent from about 19 million units in April-June 2014 quarter.
“The growing need for consumers flocking to the internet using mobile phones coupled with rapidly declining average selling price (ASP) of smartphones has been the key drivers of uptake of smartphones in India,” Counterpoint Research Senior Consultant Tina Lu said.
The declining smartphone ASPs is result of proliferation of not only local brands entering a price-war but also the highly price-competitive Chinese brands like Xiaomi entering the Indian market, Lu added.
Korean electronics giant Samsung led the market with 25.1 per cent share of the smartphone segment in the quarter under review, falling slightly from 25.3 per cent in Q2 2014.
Homegrown firm Micromax, on the other hand, saw its share growing from 19.1 per cent in April-June 2014 to 20.4 per cent in Q3 2014.
Karbonn had 9.6 per cent share, while Motorola and Sony followed in the list with 4.7 per cent and 4.5 per cent share, respectively.
The quarter was marked with many brands now shipping more than a million smartphones per quarter joining the likes of Samsung, Micromax and Karbonn.
Helped by a leaner go-to-market strategy coupled with exciting portfolio of Moto X, G and E phones at competitive price points, Motorola shipped more than one million smartphones for the first time in a quarter in Q3 2014.
Similarly, Sony and Lava also crossed one million unit mark. Apple also crossed one million units of cumulative iPhone shipments for the first time in its fiscal year ever for India market.

Yahoo buys digital ad service BrightRoll for $640 mnInternational rights not in jeopardy, clarifies SpiceJet
Yahoo is buying digital video advertising service BrightRoll for USD 640 million in an effort to boost its revenue after years of little or no growth.
The acquisition announced yesterday marks Yahoo’s first major purchase since reaping a USD 9.4 billion windfall in September by selling part of its stake in a rapidly rising Internet star, Chinese e-commerce service Alibaba Group Ltd.
Yahoo Inc has promised to distribute at least one half of the USD 6.3 billion in after-tax proceeds to its shareholders, giving CEO Marissa Mayer the option of spending rest on acquisitions that could enable the Sunnyvale, California, company to recover some of the ground that it has lost to rivals Google Inc and Facebook Inc in the booming online ad market.

Analyst Corner: Outperform on Adani Ports on SEZ land monetisationKotak Mahindra Bank: Deal and after
We maintain ‘outperformer’ on Adani Ports & SEZ (APSEZ) with a March 2016-based revised price target of R342 from R313 earlier, the price revision reflecting increased visibility on SEZ land monetisation. We like APSEZ for its strong asset base, visibility on cargo and sustained cash flows.
With the Mundra SEZ now receiving its final environment clearance, we expect a pick-up in its development. With a land bank of 16,000 acres, this SEZ is likely to be a key value driver going forward. We expect 28% earnings CAGR over FY14-17e.
APSEZ adjusted consolidated PAT grew 6.3% y-o-y to R590 crore, led by land related income of R200 crore. Reported PAT after considering derivative loss of R16 crore grew 68% y-o-y to R570 crore.
Consolidated cargo volumes grew 25% y-o-y to 35.2 million tonnes led by strong growth in coal and container cargo even as crude volumes remained weak due to maintenance shutdown at HMEL’s Bhatinda refinery. Cargo at Mundra grew 8% y-o-y to 26.6 million tonnes, at Dahej by 31% y-o-y to 3.3 million tonnes and Hazira by 48% y-o-y to 1.45 million tonnes. Dhamra was consolidated for the first full quarter with cargo of 3.6 million tonnes.
Consolidated revenues grew 44% y-o-y to R1650 crore and ebitda grew 39% y-o-y to R1050 crore. Ebitda margin declined 230 bps y-o-y to 63.5%. Consolidated net debt increased to R16,500 crore from R12,500 crore as on March 2014 due to acquisition of Dhamra and restatement of forex loans.

Analyst Corner: Motherson Sumi a good buy on growth driversKotak Mahindra Bank: Deal and after
We reiterate ‘buy’ on Motherson Sumi (MSS) with a revised fair value of R498 per share (earlier R231) as we roll forward our valuation and change our valuation methodology to one year forward.
MSS reported consolidated ebitda growth in Q2FY15 of 1% y-o-y (2% lower than our estimates) as revenue growth (11% y-o-y, 3% above our estimates) was offset by a lower ebitda margin of 9.1% (down 90 bps y-o-y and below our forecast of 9.6%). The standalone entity registered robust revenue growth of 14% y-o-y to R1270 crore despite sluggish passenger vehicles volumes in Q2FY15.
This was primarily driven by MSS wining orders from the recently launched successful new models (from Honda and Maruti). An increase in content per car, market share gains; and product mix change towards higher-value assemblies.
Adjusted ebitda margin stood at 18% (up 110 bps q-o-q and down 270 bps y-o-y; higher base), a tad below our expectation of 19%. However a lower effective tax rate (26%) resulted in adjusted PAT coming broadly in line with our estimates. We expect the standalone entity to deliver EPS CAGR 20% of over FY14-17e, led by strong revenue momentum and margin expansion driven by positive operating leverage and a favourable product mix change.

Higher valuation than Sensex makes mid caps a tricky choiceKotak Mahindra Bank: Deal and after
Selecting stocks from the mid-cap space has turned tricky for investors despite their potential to offer higher earnings growth over the next two years, thanks to the outstanding gains made by most of these scrips in the year so far.
On the back of a 50% rally so far in 2014, the BSE mid-cap index currently trades at a near-peak relative valuation to its large-cap counterpart, the 30-share Sensex. Currently, the mid-cap index is trading at a one-year forward price-to-earnings ratio of 15.77; the Sensex is trading at a P/E multiple of 15.57.
While more than a half of the BSE mid-cap universe has outdone year-to-date Sensex returns (31%), as many as 30 stocks from the 267 constituents have more than doubled this year.
Market experts say after three years of under-performance, mid caps had a high potential to catch up, but, now, as a general re-rating of the space may be over, investors ought to turn stock-specific, given that many of these are trading way ahead of their fundamentals.
According to Nilesh Surana, head of equity at Mirae Assets Global investments India, now that the overall valuation gap to the market has been breached, companies with scalable businesses and good earnings visibility should be preferred. “The focus should shift towards cash-flow generation from an optimism of re-rating potential,” added Surana.
In a recent strategy note, Axis Capital argued that while the mid-cap space usually does well when the economic growth surprises, individual mid caps have their own long-term sustainability shortcomings.
The brokerage used several financial and operational parameters, including EPS growth, RoE expansion, pricing power, scalability, ability to generate free cash and de-risked business model, to shortlist its mid-cap picks.
As per data compiled by Bloomberg, the consensus one-year forward earnings growth for the BSE mid-cap index with 267 stocks stands at 57% compared to a 24% growth projected for the top-30 companies that constitute the Sensex.
However, data also suggest that some of the frontrunners in the latest rally continued to demonstrate inferior financial performance in the last three quarters. For example, companies like BASF, Century Textile, Wockhardt, Muthoot Finance, State Bank of Bikaner, EIH and Hexaware Tech, which have either reported losses in the three months to September or seen profit growth decline in three of the last four quarters, have rallied anywhere between 60% and 85% in the year so far.
According to UBS, as small- and mid-cap stocks (SMID) have continued to rally after the election on hopes of an acceleration in growth recovery, many stocks are running ahead of fundamentals.
The brokerage noted that foreign inflows over the past 3-4 years have increasingly come from exchange-traded funds, Global Emerging Markets (GEM) and international funds, which are not big buyers of SMID stocks; inflows from dedicated India funds, on the other hand, have shrunk.
“While local institutions have finally started to see inflows, retail participation has increased. This provides technical support for SMIDs in the near term, as has arguably happened over the past 3-4 months,” noted analyst Gautam Chhaochharia in the report.

Rising stars make Adidas more American  less soccer-madInternational rights not in jeopardy, clarifies SpiceJet
A new generation of more international Adidas executives is trying to loosen a hierarchical structure that has held back creativity at the venerable German sports brand as it tries to retaliate against Nike.
But that is a tall order for a company of 52,500 employees still based in the small Bavarian town where it was founded in 1949, now struggling to keep pace with the fast-changing whims of the urban teens who are its target clientele.
“The whole organisation is run so Germanically and is not fast and agile where everybody is empowered,” said Erich Joachimsthaler, head of strategy consultants Vivendi Partners.
As disappointing performance, particularly in the U.S. market, has hammered the share price of late, long-serving Chief Executive Herbert Hainer, 60, has promoted a raft of younger managers ahead of his own expected retirement in 2017.
Leading the new guard are 47-year-old American Eric Liedtke, global brand chief since March, and Roland Auschel, the 51-year-old German named as sales chief a year ago.
Forced to ditch ambitious targets set for 2015, Liedtke and Auschel are working with Hainer on a new five-year strategy to be presented in March, but they are taking action already.
Adidas and smaller sportswear rival Puma are still based in sleepy Herzogenaurach, Germany, where they were founded by two brothers who fell out with each other after World War Two.
Liedtke has moved several executives to the firm’s U.S. base in trendy Portland, home to Nike, as he seeks to reverse the brand’s decline in the world’s top sportswear market, important not only for sales but also for defining global cool.
TAPPING INTO U.S. BUZZ
Despite buying U.S. brand Reebok in 2006, the German firm that is strongest in soccer has struggled to break into sports like basketball and American football, recently slipping into third place in the United States behind Nike and fast-growing Under Armour, founded only in 1996.
Its distance from the U.S. market and top-down structure have contributed to missing trends pioneered by Nike like its “FuelBand” fitness device and “Free” barefoot-feel running shoes, as well as being slow to catch on to the “Athleisure” trend that has seen sports leggings becoming the new denim.
Liedtke, a former American football player who joined Adidas in 1994, has therefore revived the role of global creative director, and appointed Paul Gaudio to the post in Portland. Gaudio also plans a creative studio in Brooklyn to be led by three former Nike designers.
America has long been an obsession for the Herzogenaurach sportswear firms. “The American market is about cool things that work. It’s a blend of sports and lifestyle, sports products that also have a street appeal and that is what we also see developing into Europe,” said Bjorn Gulden, a former Adidas executive now trying to revive Puma as CEO.
Liedtke and Auschel have named 12 new direct reports in recent months, including Mark King as new North America head – the first American in the job for a decade. American, British and French executives now far outnumber Germans in their teams.
More products for the U.S. market will be developed in Portland in the future, while Adidas has signed top basketball players and celebrities like Kanye West and Pharrell Williams.
Even when Adidas is ahead with an innovation like the “Boost” cushioned shoes that Liedtke helped develop in his previous role, it has not done enough to follow through with Nike-beating marketing, a failing it is now addressing.
Liedkte and Auschel have also shifted reporting lines to foster cooperation between the different parts of the business, for example encouraging the Originals fashion line to seek inspiration from the basketball division.
To speed up decision making, heads of categories like running, soccer and basketball have also been put in charge of their own marketing and future product innovation.
Hainer said the new structure would be “more consumer-focused, brand-driven and agile” with clearer accountability.
HAINER HEGEMONY
Though there are now more non-Germans, women and non-soccer players in the top ranks than before, Adidas watchers are sceptical of fundamental culture change as long as Hainer – CEO since 2001 – is still at the helm.
Germany’s Manager Magazin reported in September that hedge funds were considering buying stakes in Adidas to push for sweeping changes, including a Reebok sale and Hainer’s removal, but few current shareholders have spoken out against the CEO.
Adidas declines to comment on reports that an investor group plans a $2.2 billion bid to buy Reebok.
Joachimsthaler, who has consulted for Adidas for years but is currently working with Nike, knows Liedtke well but doubts he will depart radically from the course set by Hainer.
“Even under Eric Liedke, I have not seen that openness to experimentation, to tap into the Zeitgeist,” he said, adding that Adidas’s traditional structure had slowed it down when he was trying to help it catch up with the Nike Plus running app.
While Nike works with many outside agencies, Adidas prefers to develop ideas in-house, Joachimsthaler said, adding that Nike executives have more autonomy than at hierarchical Adidas.
“You need somebody external for a radical strategy shift,” said one fund manager who holds Adidas shares and declined to be identified.

Multibillionaire oilman to pay ex-wife $1 billion in divorce settlementInternational rights not in jeopardy, clarifies SpiceJet
Multibillionaire American oilman Harold Hamm has been ordered to pay almost USD 1 billion to his ex-wife to settle one of the most expensive divorce cases in US history.
According to a ruling filed in Oklahoma on Monday, the CEO of Continental Resources owes his former wife Sue Ann Hamm USD 995,481,842 for “property division alimony.”
Hamm, 68, is one of America’s richest people. His 68-percent stake in Continental Resources is worth nearly USD 14 billion, according to Forbes.
Time magazine included him in its 2012 list of the 100 most influential people, noting how he had grown his business through the use of hydraulic fracturing.
The couple were married in 1988.
Hamm must pay Sue Ann, 58, nearly USD 323 million by the end of the year, then the rest must be paid off in monthly installments of at least USD 7 million, plus interest. He had already paid her more than USD 22 million.
The ruling is subject to appeal.

Evergreen Federer still defying Old Father TimeEvergreen Federer still defying Old Father Time

Roger Federer of Switzerland returns the ball to Kei Nishikori of Japan during their …
By Martyn Herman
LONDON (Reuters) - Blessed with tennis genius, a multi-lingual father of two sets of twins, Roger Federer has plenty going for him, but on top of that he appears to be defying the ageing process.
At 33, the age when most sportsmen and women, particularly those practising individual sports requiring speed, strength, stamina and agility, are winding down, the effervescent Swiss is hitting as hard and moving as nimbly as ever.
On Sunday he saw off Milos Raonic, 10 years his junior, in straight sets, and he gave away nearly a decade to Japan's Kei Nishikori on Tuesday when he dashed to 6-3 6-2 win that put him on the cusp of the semi-finals at the ATP's World Tour Finals.
His classy win over Nishikori at the O2 was his 70th of the season, far more than any other player, and left him only seven wins away from clocking up 1,000 for his career.
Should he beat Andy Murray in his final Group B match on Thursday it would equal his most successful season in terms of match wins since he was all but untouchable in 2006.
He is already assured of becoming the oldest player to finish in the ATP's top two and if he won a sixth season-ending title this week and captured a first Davis Cup title for Switzerland next week he could even return to world number one.
No wonder Nishikori looked slightly in awe as Federer lorded it on one his favourite stages.
"Actually I never feel that he's 33 right now," Nishikori told reporters. "He looks still young and is playing amazing tennis. I think the age doesn't matter.
"I think he's getting better every time."
Had Federer edged out Novak Djokovic in an epic Wimbledon final rather than fall just short of an 18th career major, few would argue that he has been the year's best player.
While he said it would be "cool" to notch up 1,000 career wins, his only focus after beating Nishikori was on his match with Murray on Thursday -- when he could already be assured of a semi-final berth.
He said there would be no let-up, whatever the scenario.
"The advantage of being qualified, if that were to happen, is just that you can go into the match a bit more laid back," he told reporters. "But there's so much still at stake, wanting to beat a rival, wanting to win the points that are at stake, go in with a clean sheet into the semis is the way to go."

PM says India and ASEAN can be great partnersPM says India and ASEAN can be ‘great partners’

Nay Pyi Taw, Nov 12:  
Asserting that there are “no irritants” in the India-ASEAN relationship, Prime Minister Narendra Modi today told ASEAN leaders that a new era of economic development, industrialisation and trade has begun in India and they can be “great partners” for each other.
As India seeks to deepen its engagement with the 10-nation bloc of small and medium economies, Modi said both India and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are keen to enhance their cooperation in advancing balance, peace and stability in the region.
“The ASEAN community is India’s neighbour. We have ancient relations of trade, religion, culture, art and traditions. We have enriched each other through our interaction. This constitutes a strong foundation of a modern relationship,” Modi said in his opening statement in Hindi at the 12th India-ASEAN summit in the Myanmarese capital.
“That is why our world view is similar in many respects; our mutual confidence and trust is strong. We have no irritants in our relationship. We see encouraging opportunities and challenges in the world in similar ways,” he said.
Strategic partnership
Observing that India and ASEAN have been successful to a considerable extent in pursuing their dreams, Modi said they have laid a foundation for a strong and comprehensive strategic partnership.
“My government has been in office for six months and the intensity and momentum with which we have enhanced our engagement in the East, is a reflection of the priority that we give to this region,” the Prime Minister said at the summit held at the sprawling Myanmar International Convention Centre on the second day of his 10-day three-nation tour of Myanmar, Australia and Fiji.
New era of industrialisation
“A new era of economic development, industrialisation and trade has begun in India. Externally, India’s ‘Look East Policy’ has become ‘Act East Policy’,” he said.
“Rapidly developing India and ASEAN can be great partners for each other. We are both keen to enhance our cooperation in advancing balance, peace and stability in the region,” the Prime Minister said.
“But, our potential is much higher than where we are at the moment,” Modi said.
ASEAN, with a population of 600 million, accounts for 8.8 per cent of the world’s population.
India-ASEAN trade
At present, India-ASEAN trade is around $76 billion, catering to a combined market of 1.8 billion people.
However, India’s trade with ASEAN is just three per cent of total ASEAN trade with officials saying there is immense untapped potential.
The two sides have set a target of $100 billion for bilateral trade by 2015.
Noting that India has close bilateral relations with each one of the 10 member nations, Modi said it treats the ties with ASEAN with the same importance.
“Today ASEAN has established its own identity and voice in global political and economic affairs. Today, the entire Asia-Pacific region desires integration and cooperation,” Modi said.
Observing that the entire Asia-Pacific region desired integration and cooperation, the Prime Minister said, “To achieve this extremely important goal we look at ASEAN, not only for inspiration but also for its leadership; and you have achieved a great deal of success in leading us in that direction.”

Scientists set for historic comet landing attempt by ESA s RosettaIndia's communication satellite GSAT-16 launched successfully
How do you land a spacecraft on a comet that is streaking by at 41,000 mph (66,000 kph)?
That’s a problem scientists have been grappling with for more than a decade as they prepare for one of the most audacious space adventures ever – the European Space Agency’s attempt to land a scientific probe on the giant ball of ice and dust known as 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.
They’ll find out Wednesday whether their plan will work when the agency’s mission control center in Darmstadt, Germany, gives its unmanned Rosetta space probe the final go-ahead to drop a lander on the comet.
The event marks the climax of Rosetta’s decade-long journey to study the icy celestial bodies that have long fascinated humanity. Scientists hope that the data collected by Rosetta and its sidekick lander, Philae, will provide insights into the origins of comets and other objects in the universe.
On Tuesday, the agency announced that systems aboard the Philae lander had failed to switch on properly at first. Fearing a cosmic calamity, scientists tried a reboot.
”The lander successfully powered up, and preparations are now continuing as planned,” the agency said on its website.
The hitch demonstrates how much can still go wrong with the 1.3 billion euro ($1.62 billion) mission first conceived more than two decades ago.
Launched in 2004 after a year’s delay, the Rosetta spacecraft had to swing around Earth three times – and once around Mars – to gain enough speed to chase down the comet. After traveling 6.4 billion kilometers (4 billion miles), it pulled up alongside 67P in August.
Now Rosetta and the comet are flying in tandem at 41,000 mph between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, 500 million kilometers (311 million miles) from Earth. The vast distance means the European Space Agency has to rely on NASA’s Deep Space Network of giant radio antennas to communicate with Rosetta.
Early Wednesday, Rosetta will execute a series of complicated maneuvers to reach the optimum drop-off point. About 0835 GMT (3:35 a.m. EST), the lander will separate from the mother ship.
If anything goes wrong then, scientists will be powerless to do anything but watch. Since it takes more than 28 minutes for a command to reach Rosetta, the lander has been programmed to perform the touchdown autonomously.
The landing site – dubbed Agilkia after an island on the river Nile – was chosen because it is fairly free of boulders. But even the smallest error could put Philae hundreds of meters (yards) off course during its seven-hour descent to the comet.
Once the 100-kilogram (220-pound) lander touches down, it will fire two harpoons into the 4-kilometer (2.5-mile) wide comet’s icy surface to avoid bouncing off due to the low gravity.
Experts have likened the process to flying over a city and trying to hit a specific spot with a balloon.
Confirmation of the landing is expected to reach Earth at about 1603 GMT (11:03 a.m. EST).
Even if the landing fails, mission manager Fred Jansen said Rosetta alone will be able to gather much of the data that scientists hope will help them learn more about the origins of comets, stars, planets and even life on Earth.
Already scientists have made a number of exciting discoveries about the comet. Close-up pictures sent back to Earth in July show it’s shaped a bit like a giant duck, suggesting that it may be the result of two comets that collided.
Last month, one of Rosetta’s 11 on-board instruments found that the comet’s coma, the fuzzy head surrounding the nucleus, is made up of chemicals that on Earth would smell like rotten eggs and vinegar, among other things.
And on Tuesday the European Space Agency said it had determined the `sound’ of the comet, likely caused by the release of particles into space becoming electrically charged. As the comet makes its closest approach to the sun – the point called perihelion – the amount of matter it releases will greatly increase.
”We’ll watch this comet evolve,” said project scientist Matt Taylor. ”It’s never been done before.”

New Delhi, Nov 12:  
In a bid to connect with voters ahead of the Delhi Assembly elections, the Aam Aadmi Party today launched ‘Delhi Dialogue’, an initiative under which the party would seek the people’s opinion on how their ideal city should be.
The move is aimed at connecting with different stratas of society, ranging from professionals to homemakers and from youth to women.
“We wish to know what are the expectations of people and how they want their Delhi to be. We will interact with professionals, housewives, students, youth, women, people from villages, industrialists, people from JJ clusters and unauthorised colonies. We will then prepare a 50-point programme, prepare a blue-print and address these issues,” the party’s national convenor Arvind Kejriwal told a news conference here.
The issues will also find their way into the party’s manifesto. As a part of the initiative, on November 15, the party will hold a rally of the youth in the national Capital and address their issues. A similar rally will be held on November 26, the party’s foundation day, where issues related to women’s safety will be addressed.
A team comprising senior party functionaries including scribe-turned-politician Ashish Khetan, Adarsh Shastri, who quit his high-profile job to contest the Lok Sabha elections, banker-turned-politician Meera Sanyal and Preeti Sharma Menon have been formed for this purpose.
“Health, education, power and water will be the prime focus areas and the party will try to solve the issues in a time-bound manner,” said Ashish Khetan, who is leading the initiative.
The programme is also being seen as the party’s initiative to intensify its mass contact programme.
The party scripted a spectacular debut in the Assembly elections last year in which it won 28 seats and also went on to form a government. Arvind Kejriwal then resigned as the Chief Minister on February 14.
After its rout in the Lok Sabha elections, where it drew a blank in the National Capital, the party has been holding numerous mass contact programmes. It has also launched several wings, including the students, youth, women, minority and traders’ wing.

Fadnavis-led BJP govt wins trust vote in MaharashtraEYE BROWSE
BJP govt wins trust vote in Maharashtra Assembly
The development was preceded by the unanimous election of BJP leader Haribhau Bagde as the new Speaker of the Maharashtra assembly.
Yahoo India –  Wed 12 Nov, 2014

MUMBAI: Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis' minority government Wednesday won the vote of confidence of the state assembly by a voice vote, while the Shiv Sena opted for the role of opposition here.
The development was preceded by the unanimous election of BJP leader Haribhau Bagde as the new Speaker of the Maharashtra assembly.
The Congress and Shiv Sena cried foul over the newly-elected speaker's decision to reject the demand for balloting in the trust vote and instead to settle for a voice vote.
State Congress president Manikrao Thakre alleged that the government has failed to prove its majority as per Governor C.V. Rao's directives.
"This is a murder of democracy and the entire state has witnessed it. This government continues to be in minority and must resign immediately," Thakrey demanded.
Shiv Sena's Ramdas Kadam and other leaders also demanded a count of the voice votes to ascertain how many were in favour of the BJP government.
Thakre said a delegation of all parties would meet the governor to apprise him of the developments.
"We will urge the governor to either order a fresh of vote of confidence since today's vote was not done properly. The A.B. Vajpayee government in the past at the Centre had fallen because of just one vote. Here, this government fell short of at least 25 votes and has no right to continue. We will not allow the government to work," he declared.
Congress Legislature Party leader Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil said the ruling party violated rules and must seek a fresh vote of confidence of the house.

Shah Rukh Khan s  Happy New Year  box office collections beat Salman Khan s  Ek Tha TigerIndia's communication satellite GSAT-16 launched successfully
Shah Rukh Khan and Deepika Padukone starrer ‘Happy New Year’ box office collections have made a joyous entry into the Rs 200 crore blockbuster club. Though the film, into the third week since release, saw a fall in ticket collections to an all-time low of about Rs 75 lakh on Tuesday, the overall domestic business has been reported at over Rs 200 crore.
This makes ‘Happy New Year’ the 6th biggest all-time grosser in Bollywood, more than Salman Khan’s ‘Ek Tha Tiger’ at Rs 198.78 crore. The only Hindi movie with an A-list star cast that released this Diwali, ‘HNY’ will probably overtake lifetime collections of Aamir Khan-starrer ‘3 Idiots’, which made Rs 202.47 crore, but it is unlikely that SRK’s latest will manage to beat his earlier release ‘Chennai Express’ (Rs 227.13 crore).
‘Happy New Year’ box office collections now only behind Salman Khan’s ‘Kick’ (Rs 231.85 crore) among the 2014 releases.
The film, which raked in the moolah on craze and the hype that was generated in terms of promotions, publicity, smart planning, as well as timing, made Rs 100-plus crore within just three days of its release.
In terms of overseas business, the heist-dance extravaganza has been making good money because of the huge fan base of Shah Rukh Khan.
According to Koimoi, the just the film’s business in international market is over Rs 80 crore.

Indias retail inflation drops to 5.52 per cent in OctoberNarendra Modi’s bottom-up idea to replace Plan panel secures support of CMs
India’s economic outlook brightened on Wednesday with a surprise pickup in industrial output and further cooling in consumer prices, data showed, boosting Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s bid to end the longest slowdown in growth in decades.
Retail inflation, which the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) tracks in setting lending rates, slowed to 5.52 percent in October from a multi-year low of 6.46 percent a month earlier, helped by slower annual rises in food and fuel prices.
Industrial output unexpectedly grew 2.5 percent year on year in September, its fastest pace in three months, helped by a rebound in the capital goods sector, separate government data showed.
Read Full Report: CPI Inflation
Wednesday’s data is expected to bolster the outlook for Asia’s third-largest economy which is recovering weakly from a two-year spell of sub-5 percent growth.
Economic growth hit a 2-1/2 year-high of 5.7 percent in the quarter to June, prompting some economists to predict 6 percent growth for the fiscal year to March 2015, higher than 5.5 percent projected by the central bank.
But lacklustre industrial production since then has led some to trim their more optimistic projections.
Read Full Report: IIP Growth
Cooling prices will intensify pressure on the RBI to cut interest rates to stimulate consumer demand which powers 60 percent of the economy.
“A rate cut at this juncture will no doubt add to the existing positive growth impulses,” said Prithviraj Srinivas, an economist with HSBC.
“But such a move would also increase the risk that the RBI misses its inflation target … to return inflation back to the level last seen in the period between 1999 and 2005, when CPI inflation averaged just 4 percent.”
Worries that price pressures would revive once food prices pick up due to a weak monsoon and the fading of base effects led the RBI to leave one of Asia’s highest lending rates on hold for a fourth straight meeting in September.
It is widely expected to maintain the status quo when it reviews monetary policy on Dec. 2.
Slowing inflation, however, has bolstered hopes for a rate cut next year, triggering a rally in the bonds market.
COMMENTARY
SOUMYA KANTI GHOSH, CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISER AT STATE BANK OF INDIA, MUMBAI:
“The CPI trajectory is benign and the decline is well entrenched. I expect the next number to be below 4.5 percent.
“But we do not expect an RBI rate cut before mid-2015 as inflation will remain higher than RBI’s 6 percent target by January 2016. The IIP (industrial output) is better than expectation, but this could be a transient number and improve only in the last quarter of the current fiscal year.”
SHIVOM CHAKRABARTI, SENIOR ECONOMIST AT HDFC BANK, MUMBAI
“We see some further downside in inflation driven by base effect. There is strong indication that food price inflation and momentum of core inflation is coming off.
“But that said, trajectory of CPI inflation will only be clear after base effect wears off post-December.
“We expect a status quo on rates in the RBI policy though the statement could be more dovish than in the September policy.
“The industrial production number is high, but the worrying aspect is consumer goods, which is fairly weak. The real improvement in industrial production will be seen next year when inflation comes down, which will spur consumer spending and exports will be higher.”
RUPA REGE NITSURE, CHIEF ECONOMIST, BANK OF BARODA, MUMBAI
“It is a very sweet pair of numbers, but the point is that with IIP (industrial production) one cannot look at it with a high level of credibility because it is a very, very volatile series.
“It has to do with the lumpiness in the capital goods production series. But what really matters is that all other indicators of economic activity actually have slowed in the month of October, whether it is PMI, or credit demand or auto sales. So I don’t think that today’s reading of industrial production is sustainable.
“Inflation, of course, has started moderating but recent data shows that towards the end of October we have seen spikes in vegetable prices as well as in cereal prices because of delayed monsoon. So there’s a big question of sustainability of these readings.
“I stick with my stance that at least in the current financial year there will not be any rate reduction.
R. SIVAKUMAR, HEAD OF FIXED INCOME, AXIS ASSET MANAGEMENT, MUMBAI
“CPI is more or less in line. Post-September we saw a cut in petrol, diesel prices. Along with the ongoing play on the base effect, both have worked on the year-on-year number.
“IIP (industrial production) is a bit above survey, but that doesn’t say much.
“It’s still a very weak reading at 2.5 percent. We had a series of decent reading leading up to the June quarter, but the subsequent quarters have clearly indicated a weak reading, which may point to a slightly low GDP number at the end of the month.”
A PRASANNA, ECONOMIST, ICICI SECURITIES PRIMARY DEALERSHIP, MUMBAI
“The CPI data is positive.
“Next number is also expected to be benign and could be below 5 percent. But base effect will kick in after that, which will push up inflation in the January-March quarter, and average inflation could be at 7 percent by financial year-end.
“As far as RBI is concerned though, inflation is likely to undershoot RBI’s 8 percent target for January 2015. There are still upside risks to the 6 percent target by January 2016 and therefore we expect rates to remain unchanged this financial year.”
SOUMYAJIT NIYOGI, ANALYST, SBI DFHI LTD, MUMBAI
“The unexpected fall in October consumer inflation will mean that the inflation number for the December quarter will likely be less than 7 percent.
“This is heartening and gives RBI scope to consider rate cuts next year. On the IIP (industrial production) front, although the rebound is reassuring, we do expect some moderation in the coming days.
“The 10-year bond has already factored in this substantial fall in inflation, so the incremental gains from hereon in government bonds will be limited. Lastly we expect RBI to cut interest rates only by February next year.”

CPI at 5.52%  IIP at 2.5% beats street estimates. Room for rajan to actNew Member

Inflation will come down further since there is reduction in oil prices unlike in west our inflation is mostly on account of cost push rather than normal theory of too much money chasing too few goods. In such cost push inflation situation higher interest rates will never help the economy by keeping higher interest rates and multiple taxes   It is important to reduce interest rates and multiple tax rates to stimulate the economy

The data on inflation based on Wholesale Price Index for October will be released on Friday. WPI inflation had dropped to a near five-year low in September to 2.38 per cent, helped by moderation in food and fuel prices.
The Reserve Bank has of late started targeting retail inflation, while deciding on its bi-monthly monetary policy. RBI has been targeting a retail inflation of 8 per cent by March 2015 and 6 per cent by March 2016.
RBI’s next monetary policy is due on December 2, 2014.

Furious Congressmen  injure  Maharashtra governor Vidyasagar RaoHat-trick and 400th Barcelona FC goal for Lionel Messi
Protesting legislators of Congress caused “injury” to Maharashtra Governor Ch Vidyasagar Rao on the first day of the session today when they tried to block his entry into the legislature complex here, revenue minister Eknath Khadse said.
Speaking in the Assembly, Khadse said Congress legislators Rahul Bondre, Amar Kale, Ranjit Kamble, Vijay Wadettiwar and Abdul Sattar “caused injuries” to two legislature officials as well as the Governor.
Khadse said he wanted to move a resolution suspending these members for unruly behaviour.
“Governor’s left hand was injured. The issue does not end with an apology. This should not be tolerated,” Khadse said.
Congress leader in the House Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil said there was no intention to cause hurt to anyone, but he would apologise.
NCP MLAs Ajit Pawar, R R Patil and Chhagan Bhujbal, however, said the issue should be put to the rest with the apology if the report of Governor getting hurt was true.
Today is the first day of the new legislative Assembly and it should not start on a bitter note, the NCP leaders said.
BJP MLA Girish Mahajan said he was an eyewitness to the incident and it was a condemnable development.
Speaker Haribhau Bagde then adjourned the House for 30 minutes to discuss the issue with group leaders.

Aam Aadmi Party expects to win 40-45 seats in Delhi assembly pollsHat-trick and 400th Barcelona FC goal for Lionel Messi
The Aam Aadmi Party could win 40-45 seats in the upcoming Delhi assembly election, party chief Arvind Kejriwal today said.
The former Delhi Chief Minister, who resigned after running a 49-day government, had been saying in his rallies that more the BJP extends the term of President’s rule in the National Capital, more the seats the party will bag.
“We will win 40-45 seats,” Kejriwal said in a response to a question by reporters on whether the party had done an internal survey and how many seats it was expected to win.
“The BJP has done exactly the opposite to what it promised. It hiked the electricity tariff, there has been an increase in inflation,” he said.
Incidentally, an opinion poll conducted recently by a news channel said that the saffron party will sweep Delhi assembly polls and AAP will come a distant second. However, the former Delhi Chief Minister had a slight edge over Union Minister and Chandni Chowk MP Harsh Vardhan.
In the assembly polls held in December last year, AAP had won 28 seats in its debut performance, but the BJP was the largest party with 32 seats including a lone Shiromani Akali Dal nominee.

Cash shocker for scribes in MP s presserHat-trick and 400th Barcelona FC goal for Lionel Messi
Mediapersons today walked out of BJD MP Pinaki Mishra’s press meet after finding cash in their kit.
Mishra, who was about to address the media at a hotel in Puri as Chairman of the Parliamentary standing committee on Urban Development, however, later expressed ignorance about cash tucked inside media kit.
Before lodging FIRs at the Sea Beach Police Station in Puri, the enraged media contingent placed the currency notes on dais and left the venue shouting.
“We have received two FIRs, one from a group of 15 journalists and another from Sachetan Nagarik Manch, Puri in connection with recovery of Rs 200 each from the kit of reporters and camera persons,” Sea Beach Police Station IIC, Pravas Chandra Sahu said.
He said the police were investigating the matter.
Mishra, when contacted, said “I will talk to the authorities of a Bank which organised the press meet. I have demanded the strongest possible action against whosoever has done it. Heads must roll for this attempt to lower the dignity of the fourth estate.”
Besides Mishra, local MLA and former minister Maheswar Mohanty and some members of the standing Committee, Urban Development, were also present in the press meet.
“It is a shame for all of us that that there was an attempt to bribe the journalists at the press meet of Parliamentary Standing Committee Chairman,” said Jagannath Bastia, President Puri Journalist Association, who first raised the voice in the press meet, said.
Leaders of different parties including Mishra’s BJD strongly condemned the incident.
“The incident is entirely in tune with the political culture of the ruling BJD, which has sought to use money power in everything it does,” Congress stalwart and Leader of Opposition Narasingha Mishra said.
Senior BJP leader Suresh Pujari said it was a shameful act against the press. “I demand action against the culprits,” Pujari said.
BJD spokesperson Samir Dash, also demanded a thorough investigation into the incident.

Muthoot forays into gold recycling business
LN Revathy
May lead to use of gold idling in homes
Coimbatore, November 12:  
Muthoot Exim Private Limited, the precious metal division of Muthoot Pappachan Group (MPG), has launched its first old gold aggregation outlet – Muthoot Gold Point – in Coimbatore.
The opening of this outlet marks the company’s foray into retail gold aggregation and recycling business, says Keyur Shah, Chief Executive Officer, Precious Metals Division, PMG.
The company plans to open a similar outlet in Chennai, followed by another in Madurai before the close of the current fiscal.
Lucrative market
“We identified Tamil Nadu as a potential State for retail gold aggregation as South India accounts for 40 per cent of the country’s gold consumption and 70 per cent of this consumption is in this State,” he said in reply to a query. Elaborating on the new business, Shah said that the company’s objective is to cater to the burgeoning individual household need to recycle unwanted, old and used gold jewellery by buying the scrap or used jewellery items directly from the customers.
The new facility established by the company here would ensure transparency in purity, weight and valuation.
Market rates
“We will offer the live market rate and not go by the fixed rate for the day. We have a national pricing policy,” Shah said. He said that India is one of the largest importers of gold in the world and already had an estimated stock of more than 25,000 tonnes in the custody of private households and temple trusts.
“All this is lying idle and our average import of bullion over the last eight years has stood at around 800 tonnes per annum.”
Idle holdings
“If such idle holding is brought into the market, our dependence on import would decline drastically. Only 200 to 300 tonnes of used gold is recycled annually at present,” Shah said.
Muthoot Exim has tied up with Mumbai-based Infinium Precious Resources for refining scrap gold.
“They will help reprocess and refine the scrap, which can be supplied as refined bars for domestic consumption. By doing so, we will be able to supply ‘made in India’ gold bars,” he said, stressing the need for more refineries in India.

Posco to invest $20 mn in Gujarat: South Korean AmbassadorNarendra Modi’s bottom-up idea to replace Plan panel secures support of CMs
One of the world’s biggest steel manufacturer — Posco — is expected to be the first major South Korean investor in Gujarat. According to the Ambassador of the Republic of South Korea, Joongyu Lee, the company has firmed up plans to invest $20 million or (Rs 123 crore) in the state.
“Posco has decided to invest 20 million USD in building a steel coil mill in Gujarat,” said Lee while talking to mediapersons during his visit to the city here on Wednesday. Lee is leading a 60-member delegation from South Korea which includes representatives from the Posco Group.
The South Korean steel giant already holds about 26 percent equity in Posco Poggenamp Electrical Steel Pvt Ltd that has operations in Gujarat.
“South Korean investment in Gujarat is minimal and so we are here to explore opportunities,” said Lee while stating how his country’s presence is limited to a couple of companies in the power sector.
Earlier today, the Ambassador met Gujarat chief minister Anandiben Patel at Gandhinagar. Later, a round-table meeting between Korean corporate executives and state government officials were also held. “The Gujarat government has proposed to build a exclusive zone for Korean companies in Gujarat. However, this is just at an ideation stage,” said Lee while simultaneously stating how South Koreans were concentrating more on the upcoming Korean industrial park at Neemrana in Rajasthan.
“The meeting with Gujarat government officials were more an exchange of ideas. However, companies like Samsung and LG are keen to explore opportunities in the state,” Lee added.
In the evening the South Korean Ambassador addressed the Korea-Gujarat friendship forum held at Ahmedabad where he traced back Korean and Indian bilateral ties to a 2000 year-old-incident where according to Lee an Indian princess from Ayodhya, travelled all the way to Korea and married a Korean King. Lee said that one-fourth of the population of Korea including him, were descendants of this Korean-Indian couple.
Recollecting his meeting with Narendra Modi who was at the helm of affairs in Gujarat last year, Lee said that he was right in choosing a state which has been a proved to be a “nursery” for the political career of Modi who has gone on to become the Prime Minister of the country.
According to him the size of bilateral trade between India and Korea stood at 17 billion USD and more than 450 Korean companies had invested 3.5 billion USD in India.
SEZ of Gujarat and the DMIC corridor in Gujarat presents a lot of potential for future Korean investments in the state, Lee said while addressing businessmen from the state at the forum. This could be in the areas of automobiles, infrastructure, petrochemicals, renewable energy, shipbuilding, textiles and tourism, he added.
B2B networking session hosted by Korea International Trade Association and a meeting of Small and medium companies hosted by Korea Trade-Investment Promotion agency was hosted at two different hotels in the city. Top leaders of the companies like Hyundai Motors, Samsung Electronics, LG Electronics, Posco India, Doosan Power System India, Hyosung, Hyundai Construction, Nuga Medical India, Seela Infra and others were part of the 60-member Korean delegation.
Later in the evening the a “Korea Day” reception was also hosted in of the hotels where Korean traditional dance and music was performed by an elite Gyeonggi Provincial Dance team.

US-China climate deal  bad for the world: Sunita NarainSunita Narain
New Delhi, November 12:  
The deal struck by the US and China on Wednesday at the end of the APEC Trade Summit held in Beijing has faced criticism from Sunita Narain, Director General of the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE). Narain said the deal, heralded as “ambitious”, was actually “not ambitious enough or effective enough and may be bad for the entire world”.
She was speaking on the sidelines of the India-US cooperation on climate change and energy, organised by the Ananta Centre, along with the Aspen Institute and Shakti Sustainable Energy Foundation.
However, according to sources, the Indian Government was positive about this deal, which comes ahead of the climate talks to be held in Peru in December.
Narain said the deal effectively means that China and the US will converge at a very high per capita emissions level (of about 12 tonnes per capita a year) by 2030. “This will get the world towards a 4 degree centigrade rise (in average temperature). This deal may be good for the US, it may be good for China, but it is not a deal that is good for the planet,” Narain said.
Biggest emitters
The US and China — two of the biggest emitters — have agreed to cut emissions over the next two decades. The US, which was the largest emitter till recently, has agreed to reduce its emissions by 26-28 per cent from 2005-levels by 2025. China, the largest carbon emitter today, will reach its peak by 2030 and then start reducing emissions. According to analysis by CSE, this would bring the US and China at par in terms of emissions with both standing at around 11-12 tonnes per capita a year.
In comparison, if India were to continue its growth rate, without taking significant steps to cut emissions, it would reach about 4 tonnes per capita by 2025.
Narain said if all developing countries were to follow suit and seek convergence at 10-12 tonnes per capita, the world would over-reach its climate capacity and head for a 4 degree centigrade rise in temperature.
Globally, it is recognised that temperature rise has to be capped at 2 degree centigrade, since the 1990s levels, to avoid instability.
In case of a 4 degree centigrade rise, several species of animals could become extinct, several islands could disappear due to rising ocean levels, droughts and floods would affect food generation .

Trade policy to make schemes for services exports more effectiveTrade policy to make schemes for services exports more effective
Our Bureau
Niche sectors and start-ups likely to get higher sops
New Delhi, November 12:  
The Foreign Trade Policy (FTP) plans to make the existing export promotion schemes for services more effective and also introduce new ideas for giving greater thrust to the sector, said Commerce Secretary Rajeev Kher.
“We already have an export promotion scheme for services which we are trying to make more effective. We will also try to come up with some new ideas for the sector,” he said talking to reporters on the sidelines of the two-day services conclave, organised by the Commerce Ministry and CII.
The FTP will also try to give a fillip to start-ups. “The Commerce Ministry is aware that there are areas such as gaming and R&D which need some encouragement. Our effort in the FTP would be to provide incentives to niche sectors and start-ups,” said JS Deepak, Additional Secretary in the Commerce Ministry .
The Commerce Secretary, however, did not specify when the FTP could be expected. “I hope it is soon,” he said.
While the BJP Government announced the Union Budget in July, it is yet to come up with a new policy for exporters and importers.
Scrips scheme
The biggest concession that the services sector can hope for in the new FTP is transferability of import duty exemption scrips earned under the ‘Served from India’ scheme. At present, sectors such as hospitality, that earn substantial foreign exchange, are not able to use the scrips (valued at 10 per cent of foreign exchange earned) as these mostly don’t import capital goods for which the incentives can be used.
“If the services sector is allowed to sell the scrips to those who can use it, they can utilise the benefits of the scheme,” an official in the Commerce Ministry said.
The share of services in the country’s GDP was 57 per cent in 2013-14. Export of services during the year is estimated at $151.47 billion compared to goods exports worth $312.5 billion.
India is considered a mine for services delivery, yet its share in the global services exports is still below 3.5 per cent as against European Union’s 42 per cent and China’s over 4 per cent, Kher pointed out.

The Sino-Russia Partnership Is Stronger Than the West Thinksreddit
WASHINGTON -- Some American pundits are calling for new overtures by the West that would distance China from Russia. In Japan, voices are urging the government to step up diplomacy with Russia to draw it away from China. In these appeals we can discern an assumption that divergent national interests leave either Moscow or Beijing susceptible to enticement by the U.S. and its ally in Tokyo.
These attempts to split Russia and China from each other as they grow closer together are bound to fail because they misunderstand the nature of the challenge the West faces. The true nature of the challenge is best understood through the lens of national identity. How the regimes in Moscow and Beijing see themselves -- "regime self-image" -- is critical to grasping their anti-Western stance today.
THE ANTI-IMPERIALIST LEGACY
The communist legacy in national identity, as opposed to Marxist-Leninist-Maoist ideology, has survived and gained new momentum under Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin. Anti-imperialism has survived as a pillar of ideology, as has Sinocentrism and Russocentrism, which focus overwhelmingly on resistance to the United States and its allies.
Old positions from the Cold War  -- minus the Sino-Soviet dispute -- are being reaffirmed. With Xi's "China Dream" and Putin's Eurasianist pride, civilizational superiority is being touted. Tighter controls to prevent dissent, let alone a "color revolution," are evident reminders of the past.
THE PARTNER OF CHOICE
Failing to rediscover each other in the 1980s through rapidly normalizing relations and then confirming an overlapping search for "reform socialism," political elites in Moscow and Beijing awakened to their mistake late before finally turning to each other as the partner of choice.
There was no sudden epiphany in 2014 that solidified the Sino-Russia challenge, but identity convergence was accelerating already in 2012-13, boosted by a change of tone from Russia following its aggression toward Ukraine and the impact of global sanctions.
MISSED SIGNALS
International relations has been so obsessed with "realist" and "liberal" theory that the upsurge of writings on national identities since the end of the Cold War was largely missed and marginalized as a matter of concern by Western analysts.
Realists fixed their gaze on territorial disputes along the Russia/Chinese border and, recently, on fear of Chinese expansionism into the Russian Far East. Liberal theorists put priority on integration into the world economy sought by both countries.
Both points of view missed the importance Moscow and Beijing place on resisting any emerging ideas or alternative narratives that would threaten regime legitimacy -- whether the right of civil society to take shape and influence national policies or the application of values such as human rights in responding to global hot spots. China and Russia have seen eye to eye on opposing what they see as the subversive effects of such ideas, which they believe the West is promoting in order to weaken them.
U.S. concessions to China or Russia might presumably ameliorate tensions, but we have seen in Obama's early acquiescence to China's idea of "core interests," and later in his willingness to pursue a "new type of great power relations,"  -- and in his "reset" to Russia -- that they do not reverse the tide of deepening national identity gaps.
While striving to cast doubt on the distortions at the root of the narratives in China and Russia, the United States must work with its allies and other nations to agree on a different narrative with lasting appeal for a broadly shared international identity.
There are three legs to the competition, with China and Russia on one side and a U.S.-led community on the other:
Security. This requires shoring up alliances and partnerships while seeking, when possible, confidence-building measures with China and Russia;
Economic regionalism premised on globalization. Starting with Trans-Pacific pact but opening the door to a free trade area of the Asia-Pacific with China and even Russia if it accepts the 21st century norms being proposed;
A humanistic civilization, presenting a compelling story about the inclusive diversity of America's national identity as part of the global community while narrowing existing gaps in identity with like-minded countries most relevant in this growing competition.
There should be no illusions that China will abandon Russia, even if it were to act more aggressively in Ukraine, or that Russia will soon turn against China in fear of being treated as only a junior partner.
This is not to say that bilateral relations are likely to proceed smoothly. There is no cultural closeness between these countries, and China is known to drive a hard bargain. Russia will be reluctant to yield on some sensitive matters, including the transfer of its most advanced weapons.
Yet, there is little that Washington or, for that matter, Tokyo would be willing to offer that could alter the course of reconciliation based on national identities that are rooted in the past and are increasingly embraced in each country.
We don't want to revert to the Cold War notion of "ideological struggle," but we should awaken to the fact that China and Russia, in parallel and with increasing awareness of the advantages of their cooperation, are intent on demonizing the national identities of the United States and its allies.
This is a challenge that requires a response deeply informed about their identity strategy, but also nimble in showing eagerness to narrow identity gaps with them --  if possible.

You Think Facebook Privacy Is Bad Take A Look At Smartphone Gamesreddit
People who worry about social networks like Facebook prying into their personal information should probably also spare a thought for games like "Jetpack Joyride."
The popular mobile game is just one of many that's earned poor marks for privacy in a new study by PrivacyGrade , an organization made up of researchers from Carnegie Mellon University.
To conduct their study, which was released in late October, the researchers examined people's assumptions about how certain apps use their data and graded the apps based on how closely those beliefs matched reality. An "A" grade essentially means that the app uses information as a user would expect, while a "D" suggests the app takes advantage of a user's data in an unexpected way -- for example, using a person's GPS location for marketing purposes.
Some games, like " Fruit Ninja " and " Jetpack Joyride ," received D grades for using "sensitive" information like an individual's location or phone carrier to deliver targeted ads, among other things. Halfbrick Studios, the developer behind "Fruit Ninja" and "Jetpack Joyride," did not respond to a request for comment.
Many other kid-friendly apps, like " Despicable Me ," " Angry Birds " and " My Talking Tom ," also received unimpressive marks. On the other hand, " Candy Crush Saga " earned a comforting A from PrivacyGrade.
Many popular social networking apps that often come under scrutiny for their privacy policies received high grades in the study. Facebook , Instagram , Google+ , YouTube and Twitter all received A grades. To be clear, that's not because these services don't access your private data, but rather because they use private data in a way that lines up with user expectations.
Twitter, for example, uses your location data, but it does so to let users mark their tweets with that data, according to PrivacyGrade .
Still, this doesn't mean that social networking clients that access your accounts are totally safe. Popular Twitter app TweetCaster , for example, received a C grade in the study, in part because it accesses user data to deliver targeted ads.
In fairness to app developers, when you install an app from Google Play -- the platform that PrivacyGrade studied -- you receive a message that describes what information that app will access. In other words, when you download Fruit Ninja to your device, you're told that it will access your location, though it doesn't specify what for:
CNN notes that even the app developers themselves may not realize their software is intrusive. Developers who want to monetize their apps take code from advertiser networks, but they don't necessarily know what information is being accessed by that code.
"Advertisers have a big incentive to collect lots of data about individuals so that they can send better targeted ads," Jason Hong, leader of PrivacyGrade and an associate professor at Carnegie Mellon University, told The Huffington Post via email. "Most developers are also not aware that their apps have these kinds of behaviors either, they just reuse code from these advertisers."
According to Hong, his team only looked at Android apps because developers are forced to declare what info they collect from users when they download apps from Google Play. Hong also noted that there are more research tools on the Android platform because it's more "open" than Apple's iOS.
The PrivacyGrade research team reportedly received financial backing from Google, the National Science Foundation and NQ Mobile, a security firm. All told, they analyzed more than 1 million apps .
Hong told HuffPost that he's interested in investigating iOS apps in the future.

Surveillance video shows Florida man concealing chainsaw by putting it down his shortsComments
By Sarah Dunton November 12
Police in Port St. Lucie, Fla., have arrested a man who allegedly stole a chainsaw from a lawn equipment store. Surveillance footage shows the man concealing the chainsaw in his pants and underneath his shirt. (AP)
An accused chainsaw thief in Florida employed a simple plan that involved nothing more than his shorts, shirt and a calm demeanor.
Surveillance video captured on Oct. 28 inside Treasure Coast Lawn Equipment in Port St. Lucie, Fla., shows a man concealing a Stihl chainsaw, valued at $619 – which does not appear to be spinning — in his shorts and tucking his shirt over the top as a store clerk sits nearby.
via AP
TCPalm.com reports that store employees, who can be seen in the video, chased the man, identified as 28-year-old Anthony Ballard, and called police. As police searched the area for Ballard and the chainsaw, which he had ditched after her fled on a reportedly stolen bicycle, one of the employees spotted him in a wooded lot nearby. The employee confronted Ballard and held him until police arrived.
Although police said he told officers that he had a “change of heart” and dumped the chainsaw, Ballard was arrested on a grand theft charge. Ballard was taken to county jail. He is also being held on a theft warrant issued by another county, according to Port St. Lucie police.

Discovering Your Soul Signaturereddit
We do not choose the work we were brought into this lifetime to do. That work is your soul signature -- your unique expression. Your spiritual DNA.
Your soul signature is who you are at your core -- your singular contribution to the world. It doesn't necessarily have to do with your career or profession -- though it might. It's more likely about the accumulated essence of everything you have ever been, thought, felt, done, or experienced in your entire life.
There's no hierarchy when it comes to soul signatures. My soul signature has been a spiritual path. Yours might be coaching young people to fulfill their destiny, or creating something magical from your imagination--a novel, or a work of art--or maybe it is about turning a dream that you've nurtured into reality. It is about bringing your unique set of gifts to bear on the world around you. Only you can share your particular soul signature on this earth. It is as individual as a fingerprint and it permeates every aspect of your life.
Being aligned with your soul signature ought to be the most natural thing in the world. And yet so many of us struggle. So many of us are unaware of its very existence. We get caught up in the complex swirl of emotions that govern our lives and in the process disconnect from our truest source. We reject who we are, we reject our true calling. We start to believe, instead, in our limitations. We see ourselves as lacking, less than, imperfect.
It is my soul signature to help you receive the truth that you are love. You are not what you've been told. I wrote this book, Discovering Your Soul Signature, to lead you from fear to love, from denial to self-acceptance. Through a series of exercises and meditations you will come into a detailed and intimate knowledge of yourself. You will dismantle, one by one, the emotional blocks that keep you from connecting with your core and come to embrace who you are, as you are.
My wish for you is that you come to be the love you are. And that you live that love in each moment of your life, from this day forward.
Fear
I begin the book with fear for a very specific reason: we allow it to run our lives without even knowing it.  Our fear takes many forms -our finances, our jobs, our kids, or our health.   How do we stop the panic and worry? By facing our fear head on.
Imagine yourself in a house surrounded by a beautiful garden. However the garden is overgrown with fear.
Visualize yourself on your knees pulling the fear out by the roots. It may seem scary but know that your fear cannot hurt you.
You are removing the tangled mass of energy that's keeping your abundant garden from blossoming. The weeds aren't wrong or bad. They're just taking up space needed for your own growth and fulfillment.
Anger
Do you remember the last time you were really angry- blood boiling, red in the face, angry? Did you try to contain it, hide it, or ignore it altogether? Were you afraid of your anger's effect? Stuffing the emotion of anger only causes a dam inside you, building up and disempowering you and impeding your flow.
Instead of stuffing your anger down let it run through your body like a current of energy.
Think of what happens when you shift your car into neutral.  You can rev the engine repeatedly and you don't' run anyone over or crash into anything.  Allowing the anger to move through you, you're giving the energy a chance to run its course.
When anger arises, catch yourself in the experience and realize what's happening. Don't pretend your anger's not there. Recognize it and let it flow through you. The feel you'll be left with is one of strength and empowerment.
Mindful Mornings and Soulful Sleep
Give yourself the gift of a mindful morning.
Imagine beginning your day surrounded by a golden ocean of energy - the purest form of love you've ever felt.  Touch it. Feel it. It's all around you.
Become excited by the possibility of being in connection with this beautiful golden light.   Before anything else, take a moment to do this as you begin your morning.
Throughout your day, this light is with you and you are not alone. You are connected, spacious, centered, expanded, and complete.
The Dalai Lama has called sleep "the best meditation"- the place where we can open ourselves up to our most meaningful work.  How do we make the most of our sleep? By beginning with an essential: a necessary feeling of trust.
To feel trust, we must feel supported. Nurture yourself with all you need- your favorite blanket, temperature, pillows, and give yourself over to the unknown.
Release and surrender knowing that by giving yourself over, you are allowing yourself to receive everything you need.
Sleep soulfully, sleep soundly, and let go.

We cannot skimp on public healthNovember 9, 2014 2:15 pm
We play with fire if we skimp on public health
Lawrence Summers
Ebola was a ‘stress test’ on health systems, and Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea could not cope
©AP
Epidemics and pandemics are like earthquakes. Tragic, inevitable and unpredictable. It starts as a random event. A virus jumps species from a bird, bat, or other animal to “Patient Zero” – who passes it on to other human beings. More likely than not, over the course of this century we will face an influenza pandemic similar to the one in 1918 that killed 50m people.
The FT’s A-List
The A-List provides timely, insightful comment on the topics that matter, from globally renowned leaders, policy makers and commentators
President Barack Obama’s first chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, said in the wake of the global economic meltdown that “you never let a serious crisis go to waste”. Crises are opportunities to learn. They point to measures that will prevent the collapse of institutions when they are under extreme pressure.
While the focus is understandably on responding to the Ebola crisis, it is equally important that it serves as a wake-up call with respect to inadequacies that threaten not just tragedy on an unprecedented scale but the basic security of the US and other wealthy nations. As with climate change, no part of the world can insulate itself from the consequences of epidemic and pandemic.
The report of the Global Health 2035 commission, which I co-chaired, points up three crucial lessons. First, collective action must be taken to build strong health systems in every corner of the globe. In west Africa, Ebola was a “stress test” on national health systems, and in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea the systems could not cope. There were too few trained health professionals; there was also too little equipment and too few supplies, and too little capacity for public health surveillance and control.
More
Reform as the answer
Nigeria’s containment of the virus after the first case was diagnosed in July is instructive. Its success, hailed by the World Health Organisation as a piece of “world class epidemiological detective work”, is explained by its aggressive, co-ordinated surveillance and control response. It already had a polio surveillance system, with skilled outbreak specialists who were quickly put to work tackling Ebola. While much of Nigeria’s health system, such as primary care services, remains very weak, on Ebola the surveillance and control system worked. Every country needs this kind of system. Prevention is cheaper than cure and leads to better outcomes.
Building these systems takes time and money. Our research, conducted with an international team of economists and health experts, and published last year in the medical journal The Lancet, suggests that the price of this “systems strengthening” would be about $30bn a year for the next two decades. The good news is that we have the financing to pay for this through a combination of aid and domestic spending. The cost represents well under 1 per cent of the additional gross domestic product that will be available to low- and lower-middle-income countries due to increased GDP growth over the next 20 years.
The second lesson is that the lack of investment in public health is a global emergency. The WHO’s slow response to Ebola was not surprising, given its recent staff cuts. For that, we all share the blame. Since 1994, the WHO’s regular budget has declined steadily in real terms. Even before the Ebola crisis, it struggled to fund basic functions. The entire budget for influenza was just $7·7m in 2013 – less than a third of what New York City alone devotes to preparing for public health emergencies.
It takes just one infected airline passenger to introduce an infection into a country. We need the WHO more than ever. It alone has the mandate and legitimacy to serve as a health protection agency for all countries, rich and poor. Starving it of funds is reckless.
The third lesson concerns scientific innovation. When it comes to discovering and developing medicines, vaccines and diagnostic tests, we have been largely ignoring the infectious diseases that disproportionately kill the world’s poor. Consequently, we still have no medicines or vaccine for Ebola. All we can do is provide basic life support, such as fluids and blood pressure treatment. For prevention, we have to rely on old-fashioned measures such as quarantine.
Margaret Chan, the WHO’s director-general, has explained the reason for this neglect. Doctors were “empty-handed”, she said, because “a profit-driven industry does not invest in products for markets that cannot pay”. Ebola affects poor African nations, so drug companies see no profit in working on it. Nor is there an adequate incentive to invest in prevention. No society will allow companies to reap huge profits when disease is spreading rapidly.
Rich governments and donors need to step up. Investing several billion dollars a year, less than 0.01 per cent of global GDP, could be decisive in preventing tragedy on the scale of world war.
Some issues are even more important than recessions and elections. Ebola is a tragedy. Let us hope that it will also be a spur to taking the necessary steps to prevent the far greater one that is nearly inevitable on the current policy trajectory. The next Ebola is just around the corner.

What Can CMOs Learn From Major League Baseballreddit
When Jerry Dior, a graphic designer for the advertising firm Sandgren & Murtha, designed the logo for Major League Baseball (MLB) in 1968, it took him only one afternoon to complete the task. In the 46 years since, the logo has been changed a total of zero times--a timespan that's practically unheard of in marketing. Over the years, the MLB has plastered the iconic red, white, and blue silhouette of a batter swinging at a ball on everything from jackets and T-shirts to bumper stickers and coffee mugs. The image is timeless--it's not modeled after one single player or specific ethnicity, and the batter could be either left or right handed. Plus, the logo is easily recognizable regardless of whether or not you're a baseball fan.
So what can CMOs learn from the MLB's logo success? It may seem obvious, but it's simple: If it ain't broke, don't fix it. In an era when companies are forever trying to stay relevant, especially with the ever-changing technological landscape where social media reigns, it's easy for marketers to think that the easiest way to increase revenue is through rebranding. But that's not always the case.
In 2009, Tropicana (yes, the orange juice company) underwent a complete overhaul. The public outcry was so loud--not to mention its sales plummeted 20 percent--the company quickly reverted back to its iconic straw-in-an-orange logo. And the list of poorly executed logo redesigns doesn't end there. Gap, AOL, and Pepsi have all found themselves under attack by loyal customers and business experts alike. Why? Humans are creatures of habit, and an unexpected (not to mention poorly executed) rebranding can disrupt the status quo. The fallout can be even more severe nowadays when practically everyone has access to social media. With a few simple keystrokes, anyone can air their concerns directly back to a company.
But not all logo changes need to end in failure. Going back to the MLB, nearly all of its teams have seen multiple logo changes throughout their history. Although some have been a bit questionable and look like scribbles (I'm looking at you Detroit Tigers ) or would make for a better tattoo than a team logo ( Pittsburgh Pirates ), some were so poorly designed in the first place that a complete overhaul was expected--and encouraged.
But unless you have a crystal baseball, it's nearly impossible to predict the outcome of a rebranding. Here are some tips you should consider before making the change:
Ask yourself the following questions: Why should I do a rebrand? Are sales dipping? Are customers showing less interest in my company? Will rebranding solve these problems or is there another option?
If you decide to move forward, research other brands. Ask yourself what makes their logos pop. What are these brands doing that make them successful and noticeable to consumers?
Have a recognizable transition that makes customers aware of the impending changes. This is where social media can come in. Ask for honest feedback from your followers before you formally launch the rebrand. You want to make sure your brand is still recognizable to customers; don't take them by surprise.
Changing for changes sake is bad, so don't just rebrand for the sake of rebranding. Make sure you have a clear reason to change things up.
You've heard me talk about a brand being a promise delivered. So everything you do, show, design, or display needs to show the value of what you're going to deliver. Now, talk to me: As a CMO, what are some of the pros and cons you've experienced working on a rebranding?

California s Budget Surplus Leads to Credit Upgradereddit
A day after voters passed Proposition 2, which creates a "rainy day fund" to cushion the state budget from future economic downturns, major credit-rating house Standard & Poor's on Wednesday upgraded California's general obligation bond rating. S&P raised the state's credit rating from A to A-plus, citing the stability offered by Proposition 2.
But it's more than that.  California's unemployment rate dropped to 6.8 percent in September, according to the State Unemployment Office and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The San Francisco Bay area led the way with San Francisco and the surrounding counties' jobless rates in the low 4 percent, which in essence means full employment.
Proposition 2, boosted by Gov. Jerry Brown and passed by the Legislature on a bipartisan vote, requires the state to set aside funds, especially when revenue from taxes on capital gains is high, to both pay down debt and create a reserve that can be tapped only when the state is in fiscal distress.
What happened to the California economy that several years ago was pronounced dead or dying by its critics, conservatives determined to downsize government with budget and tax cuts to punish everyone, except the wealthiest?  Governor Jerry Brown did just the opposite--raised more revenues to stimulate job growth, at a time of record low interest rates, as the S&P ugrade noted.
Californians won the battle of economic policies that has blocked so much growth in the rest of the country; such as with Kansas , the poster child for cutting government programs that has set its economy in reverse.
"The upgrades follow voter approval on Nov. 4, 2014, of a strengthened budget stabilization account under Proposition 2," S&P analyst David Hitchcock said in a statement. "In our view, the new state constitutional provision will partially mitigate California's volatile revenue structure by setting aside windfall revenue for use during periods when state tax revenue could fall materially short of forecast."
And California now has a very large budget surplus, because of it.  State Controller John Chiang in a press release just released his monthly cash report for the month of June, and announced that the state's General Fund -- the primary account from which California funds its day-to-day operations and programs -- ended the fiscal year with a positive cash balance for the first time since June 30, 2007.
A positive cash balance means that the state had funds available to meet all of its payment obligations without needing to borrow from Wall Street or the $23.8 billion available in its more than 700 internal special funds and accounts.
And what about California's drought that could badly hurt future growth?  Voters also overwhelming approved Proposition 1 to address water conservation and climate change problems that could create even more severe water shortages.
"At its core, Proposition 1 advances an all-of-the-above strategy that includes everything from local resources to water storage to safe drinking water," said Timothy Quinn, executive director of the statewide Association of California Water Agencies. "Other states facing similar challenges may learn from that approach."
And that is the point.  California, once thought the economic basket case, has instead become the model that both red and blue states should follow.

Can Innovation Cause Inefficienciesreddit
Have you ever wondered what innovation, communication, collaboration, connecting and company efficiencies have in common? My creative brain was thinking about a few of these and then came up with this wacky thought. You know... I think I am on to something.
As a marketer, I see correlations in producing creative work, being innovative and how workflow efficiencies can be impacted. Here are five things I see could emerge as a potential positive outcome and a not-so positive outcome in your business.
Communicate:
In the social and digital world, communicating is done every second of every day and on multiple channels. Communication also happens during the business day in places that it may be disruptive. Think about what works best for you and your company. Your communication will also be more effective if you take a little time to find out the strengths of today's social and digital channels. Better do this quick because next week there could be a new way to communicate popping-up.
Collaborate:
I think we all know that without collaboration, ideas just don't flow as easily. Think about re-designing your workspace and office ergonomics. When you do this, collaboration is magnified. The inception of creative ideas all the way through the department may soon emerge. It also creates an energy not usually seen in closed office environments. This change created a healthy, creative energy that you didn't have before. However, are there people in the office that need peace and quiet to stay focused? Hmm. You may have just created a disruptive monster and didn't realize it.
Connect:
Think about ways to connect every employee in your company to one another. This may sound silly. However, when the entire brand and company are unified, they will make better decisions and have a direction to follow. Sometimes this is through an organizational mantra or even a physical object or product. Either way gets them to buy into the goal and your brand will be much stronger. This connection can also be tied to collaboration. Think and plan carefully before you launch into a company-wide initiative.
Casual:
If you take a look around the new office spaces of today, gone are the large secluded offices with heavy furniture. Open workspaces are more commonly used and integrated, all for increased communication, collaboration and connection. But... just because it's designed and valued in some ways doesn't necessarily mean it's good for everyone right? How would you like it if you had to work in a wide-open workspace with lots of other people who are constantly talking, meeting and collaborating?
Counter-intuitive:
It may sound like I am all about office ergonomics. You're right, I am. However, I also like seclusion and quiet when I need to focus. Both have positive attributes. There is also a negative. When increased communication, collaboration and connection are happening, that also means increased distraction is happening. Think about both the positive and negative effects of these 5 areas before you dive into a complete redesign of your office for innovation sake.
An open office is said to promote collaboration, but that doesn't mean your neighbor will appreciate when you've gathered your entire department next to his desk.
- BloombergBusinessweek
Of course, all of this is just my opinion. I have worked in both open and closed office environments and see the reasons why each can be highly effective. I truly think a mix of both would be best.
Here's the real question. Is it possible that trying to be innovative has really turned your company or department in the other direction and caused Inefficiencies? If your employees are losing focus and not staying on track because of the cool, creative, innovative open spaces, you may want to go in search of a quiet office that hasn't been occupied yet. You know, one that is not innovative. Hmm.

A Working Father s ResponseEditor's note: The following blog post is a response to the Huffington Post blogger Regan Long's " A Working Mother's Plea to the President ."
Dear Regan:
I was truly moved by your anguish about leaving your new baby home so you could return to your teaching job, and while your letter was directed to President Obama and not me, I wanted to respond.
I have three kids myself.  Mine are a little older -- the oldest just went away to college -- so they need me a little less than yours need you. I know the guilt you feel, though.  And I can tell you that your children won't blame you for going out to earn a living and keep a roof over their heads.
I agree with you -- we don't do nearly enough in this country to help working families balance all the competing demands on their time.  It's as shocking to me as it is to you that we're the only industrialized country without paid family leave.  I was just in Germany where I met a young American working for an IT company there -- he doesn't want to return to the U.S. because he and his wife have started a family and they need the paid leave.
I've talked to a lot of families like yours facing difficult choices. Just a few weeks ago, I sat down for lunch with two families who wrote to me about the emotional and physical stress of having to go back to work before they are ready. How can we tell someone to take a huge financial hit unless they go back to work only a few weeks after an emergency C-section? The financial strain doesn't get easier as a child gets a little older -- as the president recently pointed out, day care can cost more than tuition at a public university.
So much has changed in recent decades -- the influx of women into the workforce, modernizing gender roles, new family structures -- it makes no sense that our laws haven't kept up with social and economic change. In the second decade of the 21st century, why are we still living by Leave it to Beaver rules?
You shouldn't have to win the boss lottery in order to have a little bit of flexibility at work.  Raising and supporting a family isn't just a financial obligation.  What's important isn't just being able to put food on the dinner table -- we want you to be at the dinner table, too. The most important family value of all is time with your family.
From a policymaking perspective, we're slowly making progress on this issue. So far, Rhode Island, New Jersey, California and several cities have passed paid leave laws. And earlier this month, Massachusetts passed a state paid leave referendum.  So did the cities of Trenton and Montclair, New Jersey.  With compelling voices like yours speaking up, Regan, we can push to make paid family leave the law of the land.
Thank you for sharing your story.  And all the best to you and your family.
Sincerely,

Alaska Senate Race Finally EndsAlaska Senate Midterm Election Results Show Sullivan Wins Over Begich
The Huffington Post/AP
reddit
Republican Dan Sullivan was victorious over incumbent Democrat Mark Begich in the Alaska Senate race. The Associated Press announced the decision early Wednesday, more than a week after the midterms were held.
Sullivan served as the Attorney General of Alaska under former Gov. Sarah Palin (R). Begich previously served as the mayor of Anchorage before being elected to the Senate in 2008.
More from The Associated Press:
JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) — Republican Dan Sullivan won Alaska's U.S. Senate race, defeating first-term incumbent Democrat Mark Begich.
Sullivan led Begich by about 8,100 votes on Election Night last week and held a comparable edge after election workers had counted about 20,000 absentee, early-voted and questioned ballots late Tuesday. Thousands more ballots remained to be counted, but the results indicated that Begich could not overcome Sullivan's lead.
The Alaska seat was initially considered key to the Republicans' hopes of taking control of the U.S. Senate, but that goal was accomplished before the Alaska race was decided.
Sullivan's campaign planned to release a statement. A Begich spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment made around 11 p.m.
On Tuesday, news reporters and observers affiliated with candidates or political parties watched as election workers opened ballots, reviewed those in which voters' qualifications were questioned and tallied votes in election centers in Juneau and other parts of the state.
Begich was in Washington, D.C., as Congress geared up to finish out this session. Earlier in the day, his spokesman, Max Croes, said Alaskans deserved to have their voices heard and votes counted.
Sullivan, a first-time candidate, ran a confident campaign, ignoring the debate schedule Begich released during the primary and setting his own agenda. He also attracted some star power to the state, with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, a tea party favorite, and 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney rallying support for Sullivan in the waning days of the hotly contested race.
Sullivan pledged to fight federal overreach, talked about the need for an energy renaissance in the U.S. and at seemingly every opportunity, sought to tie Begich to President Barack Obama and Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid, who are unpopular in Alaska.
Begich complained that Sullivan offered little in the way of proposals for what he would do as senator. Begich touted his clout, including a position on the power Senate Appropriations Committee, and tried to paint sharp contrasts between himself and Sullivan in areas such as women's health, education and Alaska issues.
Begich, for example, was born and raised in Alaska. He cast Sullivan, who grew up in Ohio, as an outsider, and many of the early attacks by pro-Begich groups keyed in to that theme. That perception of Sullivan made for an at-times uncomfortable debate on fisheries issues, in which questioners grilled Sullivan about his knowledge of one of Alaska's most important industries.
On several occasions, Sullivan's wife, Julie Fate Sullivan, an Alaska Native and frequent companion on the campaign trail, appeared in ads defending her husband's ties to the state and his positions on women's issues.
Sullivan has roots in Alaska dating to the 1990s but was gone for nearly seven years for military service and work in Washington, D.C., that included working as an assistant secretary of state. He returned to Alaska in 2009, when he was appointed attorney general by then-Gov. Sarah Palin.
He most recently served as Alaska's natural resources commissioner, a post he left in September 2013, to make his first run for public office.
Sullivan hit the ground running, exhibiting a fundraising prowess that rivaled and during some quarters exceeded that of Begich. Many of his supporters cited his service in the Marine Corps reserves or repeated the oft-repeated GOP refrain that became of hallmark of the campaign — that Begich voted with Obama "97 percent of the time," a figure that takes into account votes during 2013, many of them on confirmations, on which Obama stated a preference.
Sullivan said he was humbled by the support he received and publicly sought to tamp down expectations of a win, even as campaign members expressed great confidence in a victory in the lead-up to the Nov. 4 election and said the Democrats' much-talked-about ground game wasn't all it was made out to be.
It was estimated that tens of millions of dollars were pumped into the state, with Republicans seeing Begich as vulnerable and Democrats trying to hold the seat Begich won in 2008. Voters were barraged by calls and ads, which many said they were turned off by.
Sullivan emerged from a hard-fought, three-way GOP primary to take on Begich, who had token opposition. Begich focused during that race on bolstering his homespun image, casting himself as an independent thinker unafraid to stand up to Obama, with a record of working across party lines, including with Alaska's senior senator, Republican Lisa Murkowski. Murkowski, who backed Sullivan after the primary and is expected to become chairwoman of the Senate energy committee now that Republicans have taken over the Senate, told Begich to knock it off.
A turning point, in the view of many observers, was an ad from Begich's campaign shortly after the primary that painted Sullivan as soft on crime. It featured a man identified as a former Anchorage police officer standing outside the home where an elderly couple was beaten to death and a family member sexually abused in 2013. It ended with the man saying Sullivan should not be a senator.
The ad, which Sullivan responded to with one of his own, was pulled following a demand from an attorney for the victims' family.
Begich, in discussing the ad, said Sullivan had a "pattern when he was attorney general of doing these plea deals that let violent offenders, sexual offenders out earlier than they should be." He said Sullivan's record as attorney general needed to be scrutinized. But that didn't become a major focus of TV ads by his campaign and surrogates.
Instead, some of the strongest criticism of Sullivan was with regards to his residency, his support of a permitting bill that critics said would have limited public participation in the state's permitting process and his stance on abortion.

Euro zone growth could be worse than expected: IMFECB
(IMF warned of downside…)
WASHINGTON: The International Monetary Fund on Wednesday warned of downside risks to its growth projections for the euro zone, and urged the European Central Bank to act if prices in the currency bloc continue to drift lower.
The IMF's warning echoes an increasing fear among global policymakers that Europe is not on track to spur economic growth, something that should be a key topic for discussion when leaders of the Group of 20 economies meet in Australia later this week.
The IMF, the Washington-based lending institution charged with policing global economic and financial stability, in October predicted the euro zone would expand 0.8 percent this year and 1.3 percent next year.
But a raft of disappointing data in the last month has put even those modest economic projections in doubt, including "surprisingly" weak data for domestic demand in Germany, the euro zone's biggest economy, the IMF said in a report prepared for the G20 meeting.
The 18-nation euro zone is skirting close to recession, and a report on Friday is expected to show economic growth in the third quarter is in line with the 0.1 percent pick-up posted in the prior three months. Prices have risen just 0.4 percent over the past year.
The ECB has a mandate to keep inflation below but close to 2 percent.
The IMF said it welcomed recent moves by the ECB to keep interest rates low and pump more money into the region's banking system.
"But if the inflation outlook does not improve and inflation expectations continue to drift down, the ECB should be willing to do more, including purchases of sovereign assets," the IMF said in its report.
It also warned of the risks tied to geopolitical tensions in Ukraine and the Middle East, and of financial market corrections due to divergent policies from the world's major central banks.
The U.S. Federal Reserve last month decided to end its bond-buying stimulus program, while the Bank of Japan has dramatically increased its pace of money creation and the ECB agonizes over whether to follow suit.
A deep stock market sell-off in mid-October also spooked policymakers concerned that a market rout could hurt confidence.
"The recent increase in volatility is a reminder about the challenges ahead," the IMF said.

Spacecraft lands on comet: ESA | 5 questions about the historic comet landingEuropean Space Agency's probe first to land on comet, but fails to anchor down
By AP | 13 Nov, 2014, 11.23AM IST
The European Space Agency says it has succeeded in landing a spacecraft on a comet for the first time in history.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
DARMSTADT/GERMANY: Landing with a bounce after traveling 4 billion miles, a European spacecraft made history Wednesday by successfully reaching the icy, dusty surface of a speeding comet - a cosmic first designed to answer big questions about the universe.
The landing by the washing machine-sized craft after a decade-long journey required immense precision, as even the slightest error could have resulted in stellar calamity.
Indications were that the spacecraft touched down almost perfectly, save for an unplanned bounce, said Stephan Ulamec, head of the lander operation.
"Today we didn't just land once. We maybe even landed twice," he said with a chuckle.
Ulamec said thrusters that were meant to push the lander, called Philae, onto the surface, and harpoons that would have anchored it to the comet failed to deploy properly. Initial data from the spacecraft indicated that it lifted off again, turned and then came to rest.
Scientists were still trying to fully understand what happened and whether those failures would affect the lander's ability to remain on the comet, called 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko . But so far, most of the instruments were working fine and sending back data as hoped, Ulamec said.
We're signing off shortly, but we leave you with replay hlighlights of this afternoon's events https://t.co/K4IRFgsn2y
— ESA (@esa) November 12, 2014
"Tomorrow morning we should know a lot more," he said.
The landing team at mission control in Darmstadt had to sweat through a tense seven-hour wait that began when Philae dropped from the agency's Rosetta space probe as both it and the comet hurtled through space at 41,000 mph (66,000 kph).
During the lander's descent, scientists were powerless to do anything but watch, because its vast distance from Earth - more than 300 million miles - made it impossible to send instructions in real time.
Finally, at 16:03 GMT (11:03 a.m. EST), the agency received a signal that the lander had touched down.
While it may take a while to determine the exact state of the 220-pound (100-kilogram) lander, the fact that it was resting on the surface of the comet was already a huge success - the highlight of Rosetta's decade-long mission to study comets and learn more about the origins of these celestial bodies.
The head of the European Space Agency underlined Europe's pride in having achieved a unique first ahead of its U.S. counterpart, NASA.
"We are the first to have done that, and that will stay forever," said the European agency's director-general, Jean-Jacques Dordain.
NASA contributed three instruments to the mission and its Deep Space Network of giant radio antennas has been key to communicating with Rosetta.
Eight-time spacewalking astronaut John Grunsfeld, now associate administrator for science at NASA, called the landing "a breakthrough moment in the exploration of our solar system and a milestone for international cooperation."
"The data collected by Rosetta will provide the scientific community, and the world, with a treasure-trove of data," he said in a statement.
Scientists have likened the trillion or so comets in our solar system to time capsules that are virtually unchanged since the earliest moments of the universe.
"By studying one in enormous detail, we can hope to unlock the puzzle of all of the others," said Mark McCaughrean, a senior scientific adviser to the mission.
The insight gleaned will give researchers the opportunity to test the theory that comets brought organic matter and water to Earth billions of years ago, giving them a key role in the evolution of life on our planet, said Klim Churyumov, one of the two astronomers who discovered the comet in 1969.
Rosetta and Philae will accompany the 2 {-mile wide comet as it races past the sun and becomes increasingly active in the rising temperatures. Between them, they will use 21 different instruments to take 3D images, analyze the comet's chemical composition and electrical properties, and even probe its internal structure with low-frequency radio signals.
Mission manager Paolo Ferri said there was no time to celebrate, because the lander had only enough battery power to operate for up to 64 hours. After that it will have to recharge, using solar panels to eke out an extra hour of operations each day.
Ferri said communications with the lander also needed to be stabilized, as there were intermittent connection problems after the touchdown. In the meantime, all the data that Philae collects is safely being stored for later transmission, he said.
Rosetta, which was launched in 2004, had to slingshot three times around Earth and once around Mars before it could work up enough speed to chase down the comet, which it reached in August. Rosetta and the comet have been traveling in tandem ever since.

Hundreds of millions of miles from Earth, a European spacecraft made history by successfully landing on the icy, dusty surface of a speeding comet - an audacious cosmic first designed to answer big questions about the origin of the universe.
The European Space Agency celebrated the cosmic achievement after sweating through a tense seven-hour countdown that began when the Philae lander dropped from the agency's Rosetta space probe toward the comet as both hurtled through space at 66,000 kph.

The agency then received a signal at 1603 GMT from the 100-kilogram Philae lander after it touched down on the icy surface of the comet named 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Philae had drifted down to the comet and latched on using harpoons and ice screws.
"We definitely confirm that the lander is on the surface," said flight director Andrea Accomazzo.

While further checks are needed to ascertain the state of the lander, the fact that it is resting on the surface of the speeding comet is already a huge success.

What s Apple worth Sky s the limit as stock hitsEMAIL
(AFP/Getty)
Apple (AAPL) shares are hitting another record high. And it seems like there’s nothing that can stop it — not even price targets.
Shares of the smartphone-maker keep blasting blast analysts’ price targets almost as fast as the analysts can raise them. Apple’s breathtaking rally this year — powered by strong uptake of the iPhone 6 smartphone — continues to mock analysts’ price targets rooted in fundamentals and valuations as emotion and speculation takes over.
Shares of Apple Wednesday closed up $1.55, or 1.4%, Wednesday to $111.25. That already tops the $108.10 18-month price target that analysts had just two months ago. Analysts have been scrambling to keep ahead of the soaring shares of Apple — but the stock seems to have no bounds. Perhaps the analysts saying Apple is the first “risk free” stock are on to something after all?
Apple at $110 a share is just below analysts’ current $116.69 18-month price target on the stock. And that average price target has been collectively raised 4.4% just over the past month.
Certainly, there are degrees of optimism, even among analysts. The highest 18-month price target on Apple is currently $143 a share. That might seem outlandishly high, especially since the stock is already trading at 17 times its earnings the past 12 months. But analysts have learned the hard way that you’re either bullish on Apple, or you’re wrong.
Earlier this week, UBS tech analyst Steven Milunovich took his price target up nearly 9% to $125 a share. He pointed to “strong buying intentions for the iPhone 6 … appreciation of the brand and ecosystem and interest in Apple Pay,” as drivers for the ever-rising stock price in a note to clients.
Computerized tools continue to be more guarded about the trajectory of Apple’s stock. Trefis , a tool that measures how much a company is worth by looking at the present value of expected cash flow, pegs the stock’s value at $110. But even that’s been raised more than 10% over the past few months.
How high can the stock go? Seems like it has a mind of its own — one that even the analysts can’t read.

Modi has plan for Nehrus 125th birth anniversary: Connect him withmassesPrint
Narendra Modi.
Written by Amitabh Sinha | New Delhi | Posted: November 13, 2014 3:55 am | Updated: November 14, 2014 1:01 pm
Indira Gandhi might have received low-key attention from the Narendra Modi government on her 30th death anniversary recently, but her father Jawaharlal Nehru is likely to be treated very differently. Prime Minister Modi wants the government to initiate activities that will ‘connect’ Nehru with the people during his 125th birth anniversary that is being commemorated this year. That is what Modi told members of the committee that has to decide on the programmes to honour the memory of India’s first Prime Minister.
“Hum jo bhi karen, kuch aisa karen ki Nehru ko janmaanas ke saath joda ja sake (Whatever we do, it should be something that helps in connecting Nehru with the masses),” Modi is learnt to have said in his brief opening remarks at the first meeting of the reconstituted committee on November 1.
According to sources who attended the meeting, Modi then went on to offer his own suggestion on how to go about doing this. “Ek tareeka ye hai ki abhi sarkaar ki jo bhi prathmiktayen hain unke saath Nehru ko joda jaye (One way of doing this is to link this government’s priorities with Nehru’s views),” he said.
While remembering Nehru’s love for children, Modi said the government’s Swachh Bharat campaign could be taken to schools as a message on cleanliness from Nehru to the students. Children can then be made a special focus group for the cleanliness drive, he said.
The other thing Modi recalled was Nehru’s stress on developing science and technology and his efforts in building scientific institutions. He said as a tribute to Nehru some programmes could be launched to help in spreading scientific temper amongst people, especially children who always were Nehru’s special constituency.
After offering his suggestions, Modi is learnt to have said that he had come to hear the ideas of others. Some members who were part of the original committee formed last year during the UPA rule informed the Prime Minister about the proposals that had been approved in earlier meetings. A website for Nehru, hosted and managed by the Nehru Memorial Museum and Library (NMML), a Rs 10 crore grant for the uplift and upgradation of the NMML, and creation of a grant for scholars engaging in research on Nehru were some of the decisions that had been taken earlier.
Modi said the government will honour all the earlier decisions but repeated that whatever activities were undertaken, these should aim at ‘connecting’ Nehru to the people, ‘bringing him closer’ to the masses, according to sources who attended the meeting. “Nehru ko janmaanas ke saath jodna zaroori hai (It is important to connect Nehru with the masses),” he is learnt to have repeated.
Modi’s comments came just a day after the government marked Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel’s birth anniversary with much fanfare and greater zeal than it had been done in recent times. In contrast, it largely ignored the death anniversary of Indira Gandhi which continued…

Keep off, these are the world's deadliest islands
Islands conjure up visions of paradise - of isolation, romance and adventure, of sunny, sandy beaches lined with coconut palms. Of a sense of discovery.
Sorry to burst your bubble, but these islands are not your typical honeymoon destination. Some of them are sealed off from any tourism at all. Others are considered dangerous. Some are swarming with venomous serpents, while others are patrolled by leagues of ravenous sharks and crocodiles. Still others are polluted with insanely high levels of nuclear radiation and chemical weapons.

Nurses voice Ebola concerns at WashingtonprotestBy: Press Trust of India | Washington | Posted: November 13, 2014 4:47 am
Several dozen nurses at a Washington hospital have demonstrated outside the White House, saying they are woefully ill-prepared to handle an Ebola case.
They were among thousands of health care workers taking part in protests yesterday in the United States and overseas amid fears the Ebola epidemic might spread beyond West Africa.
“Ebola is just one plane ride away,” said emergency room nurse Kelly Fields of Providence Hospital in Washington, where unionised nurse staff are negotiating their first collective agreement with management.
In blue scrubs and red union T-shirts, the nurses demanded an ample supply of full-dress protective suits as well as the training to use them.
“It’s a major concern for us… It only takes one person to come to our emergency room and from there we’re really not sure what to do,” said intensive care nurse Aster Goitom.
Two nurses are among the nine confirmed Ebola cases that have been treated in the United States. Both women had helped to care for a Liberian man who died of the virus in a Texas hospital.
In a statement, Providence Hospital, which is affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church, said it was prepared to identify and treat patients with highly communicable diseases, including Ebola.
National Nurses United, the biggest nurses’ union in the United States, said it expected 100,000 nurses in 15 states to join what it called Global Ebola Awareness Day protests.
Similar demonstrations were scheduled to take place yesterday in Australia, Canada, Ireland, the Philippines and Spain, it said in a statement.
The United States has more than 2.7 million registered nurses, according to the Kaiser Foundation, a national health policy think tank.

Dangling workers rescued from World TradeCenterTwo window washers trapped on a dangling scaffold nearly 70 stories up the new 1 World Trade Center tower were rescued.
By: Associated Press | New York | Posted: November 13, 2014 4:28 am
Two window washers trapped on a dangling scaffold nearly 70 stories up the new 1 World Trade Center tower were rescued Wednesday by firefighters who sawed through a window to reach them.
The washers were stuck for nearly two hours before their dramatic rescue, as New Yorkers looked on from the ground and people around the country watched on live TV. The scaffold accident, which officials said was caused by a malfunctioning cable, happened little more than a week after workers began moving into the nation’s tallest building.
It was unclear whether the scaffold had been used on the 1,776-foot (541-meter), 104-story skyscraper before or whether anything about the building’s design complicates working a scaffold there. Officials stressed that firefighters had trained for various emergencies at the tower, the centerpiece of the rebuilt World Trade Center.
The window washers’ ordeal began on the lower Manhattan building’s south side at around 12:40 p.m. (1740 GMT) when one of the platform’s four cables abruptly developed slack, Fire Commissioner Daniel Nigro said. The open-topped platform tilted sharply and swayed slightly in the wind between the 68th and 69th floors, he said.
“It suddenly went from horizontal to nearly vertical,” he said.
Officials haven’t determined what caused the cable problem. The cables are controlled from the scaffold vehicle, the fire commissioner said.
About 100 firefighters rushed to the skyscraper, some of them lowering ropes from the roof so the workers could secure themselves and a two-way radio for them to communicate, Nigro said. The workers also were harnessed to the platform.
Firefighters first used diamond cutters to saw through part of a two-layered glass window on the 68th floor. They shattered the thick glass in place, then carefully pulled the broken pieces into the building.
Firefighters also began inching another scaffold down the building as a backup rescue plan, but they were able to bring the workers to safety through the roughly 4-by-8-foot (1.20 to 2.40 meters) window hole by 2:30 p.m.
Firefighters generally seek to cut out windows to make such rescues, but Nigro noted the trade center’s thick glass: a double-paned inner layer and an outer pane.
The workers had mild hypothermia but seemed otherwise OK, Nigro said. They were taken to a hospital to be checked out.
The silvery skyscraper, which rose from the ashes of the September 11, 2001, terror attack, reopened last week to 175 employees of magazine publisher Conde Nast. About 3,000 more Conde Nast employees are expected to move in by early next year, eventually occupying 25 floors of the $3.9 billion tower.
Steps away from the new tower are two memorial fountains built on the footprints of the decimated twin towers, a reminder of the more than 2,700 people who died in the September 11 attack. continued…

View Photo Gallery —A big issue before President Obama is a proposal to approve a pipeline carrying fuel from Canada’s oil sands through America’s heartland to Texas. What’s at stake? Here’s a quick overview from “Down the Line: A Journey Along the Controversial Pipeline and Into America’s Energy Frontier.’’
Whether Congress can authorize constructing the pipeline has been the source of debate between Republicans pining for its construction and environmental groups who say the powers rest solely with Obama.
But supporters say that Congress can use its power to regulate commerce with foreign countries to authorize the project. The legislation, as written, would authorize constructing the pipeline and use a January 2014 environmental-impact report by the State Department to satisfy federal requirements that the project be studied for adverse effects.
After their midterm losses, there is little political fallout for Senate Democrats to worry about. Landrieu, Manchin and at least nine other Democrats support building the pipeline, and Republicans are expected to make up the bulk of the votes approving the plan in the Senate next week. Even if it doesn’t pass this year, the GOP has long vowed to approve the pipeline once they win total control of Congress.
But in recent days, several Democrats and Republicans have cited authorization of the oil pipeline as a modest proposal that could be used to restore bipartisan cooperation in the fractured Congress. Party leaders agreed suggesting that it could be voted on next year in the new Congress.
Landrieu had other ideas.
“I don’t think we necessarily need to wait until January,” she said Wednesday in a floor speech that lasted almost three hours. Landrieu made no attempt to hide her motive. “I’m going to do everything in my power here and at home on the campaign trail, where I’m still in a runoff, as you know, to get this project moving forward,” she said.
And later, she secured an agreement from Democratic and Republican leaders to hold a vote authorizing the pipeline as early as next Tuesday. House Republican leaders also announced plans to hold a vote as early as Thursday to authorize the pipeline, the ninth time the GOP-controlled House has voted to approve the pipeline in the past six years.
Before her remarks, Landrieu was spotted riding the escalator alone up from the Senate trains that carry lawmakers between their offices and the Capitol, toward a row of elevators. She was stone-faced and declined to answer questions from reporters. Once she reached the top level and stepped off, Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), one of his party’s top campaign strategists, walked over.
Smiling, he asked Landrieu to step aside for a private conversation. She shook her head and moved briskly toward the elevator. As she did, she pointed to her phone, saying she had a call. Schumer paused for a moment as she moved away. His smile dropped, and he turned to follow her. “Mary, Mary,” he said, a few steps behind, asking her to speak with him. When she kept moving and ducked into an elevator, he hustled and jumped in to join her as the doors closed.
A few minutes later, Landrieu took to the Senate floor to vent her frustrations and to try to shift the political winds in her direction.

In poll hurry  Rajnath puts depts onnoticeRajnath Singh met senior officials of Delhi administration and Delhi Police on Wednesday.
By: Express News Service | New Delhi | Posted: November 13, 2014 5:25 am
Union home minister Rajnath Singh has sought a progress report from each Delhi administration department, including the chief secretary. The minister has asked the officials to work on departments with public dealing and produce better results.
Singh met senior officials of Delhi administration and Delhi Police on Wednesday. Elections on the horizon, Singh gave a December-end deadline to officials and asked them to show a proactive approach towards governance and services to the public.
He pulled up the Delhi Police commissioner B S Bassi over law and order problems in the state and asked why only a few women personnel had been deployed in the police control room (PCR) vans despite the proposal pending for long now.
He also took up the issue of Swachh Bharat and reportedly said the cleanliness drive should be better visible. He asked officials to focus on short-term goals so that visible changes in governance are made till December.
Singh asked about the status of Delhi government hospitals and wanted to know about the projects still pending.
Departments who were present at the meeting were PWD, health, urban development, Delhi Jal Board, the three civic corporations, transport, food and civil supplies and Delhi police.
According to the sources, the urban development department was asked to find out the way to work around the regulations that need to be amended. PWD also gave a presentation on upcoming projects.
Delhi Jal board has been asked about the Munak canal to ensure that South Delhi is not parched next summer.
About the civic bodies, the minister reportedly expressed displeasure at their working. Sources said corporations were asked to focus on collecting waste.

US: Supreme Court lifts hold on gay marriage inKansasThe US Supreme Court said Wednesday that same-sex marriages can go ahead in Kansas.
By: Associated Press | Topeka | Posted: November 13, 2014 5:21 am
The US Supreme Court said Wednesday that same-sex marriages can go ahead in Kansas.
The nation’s highest court denied the state’s request to prevent gay and lesbian couples from marrying while Kansas fights the issue in court. The state constitution includes a provision banning gay marriage, approved overwhelmingly by voters in 2005.
“Now, this is a day to celebrate,” said Tom Witt, executive director of the gay rights group Equality Kansas.
The US Supreme Court’s decision in the Kansas case came the same day a federal judge struck down South Carolina’s same-sex marriage ban as unconstitutional, opening the door to such marriages but also giving the state a week to appeal. The attorney general said he would do so immediately.
Gay marriage advocates have won a rapid series of legal victories in the US Same-sex marriage is legal in 32 states, the District of Columbia capital district and parts of Missouri.
A federal district judge last week blocked Kansas from enforcing its ban, saying it was in keeping with an earlier ruling by a federal appeals court that struck down bans in Oklahoma and Utah.
The judge’s ruling was supposed to go into effect Tuesday, but Justice Sonia Sotomayor temporarily put it on hold while the high court reviewed the case.
Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas would have sided with the state.
The ruling came in a lawsuit filed last month by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of two lesbian couples denied marriage licenses.
The legal situation was complicated in Kansas because state Attorney General Derek Schmidt filed his own case with the Kansas Supreme Court, seeking to block marriage licenses for gay couples. The Kansas court blocked further licenses while it reviewed the case and its order is still in effect, making it unclear how the US Supreme Court’s decision Wednesday will be applied in individual counties.
US District Judge Richard Gergel, ruling in the case of a same-sex couple from Charleston who sued to be married, found South Carolina’s state constitutional ban “invalid as a matter of law.”

Shah steps in to tell Delhi BJP how towinPrint

Written by Pragya Kaushika | New Delhi | Posted: November 13, 2014 5:18 am | Updated: November 13, 2014 1:48 pm
Leaders of Delhi Bhartiya Janata Party met their national chief Amit Shah on Wednesday to take tips on running a successful election campaign. Shah is understood to have told the newly-appointed team to ensure victory by projecting Modi as the face of party and win as many as 60 seats in the 70-member Assembly.
At the meeting, party sources said, it came to everyone’s notice that Shah knew more of Delhi politics than the leaders had expected. A word of caution has been sounded to “consider themselves not as leaders but as workers, who are equal to any other worker of the BJP”.
Shah reportedly asked the leaders to work at the ground and reach every household. With Shah guiding the Delhi team, the pressure is now on the state unit not to lose these elections.
The leaders have been asked to win back “traditional” BJP seats like Shalimar Bagh and Model Town that the party lost in December polls.
The party’s Delhi in-charge Prabhat Jha told Newsline that they are now working on Mission 60-plus.
“We had a 272-plus target in national campaign and we got more than that. We would target 60 or more Assembly wins in Delhi,”
said Jha.
“In the Lok Sabha elections, we won in 60 Assembly constituencies with a comfortable margin, so we need to improve by winning more than 60.”
At Wednesday’s meeting, party leaders were told to prepare a manifesto that should reflect the Centre’s policies and not make promises that contradict them. Work on finalising the manifesto will start this week. Water and electricity issues may emerge as big promises.
Sources said, with little time left before polls, the party wants to ensure the Centre announces perks for Delhi. The sops could then be used to counter any criticism by AAP and Congress of the performance of the Modi government.

In the run up to the Delhi Assembly polls, the Aam Aadmi Party on Wednesday launched a drive called Delhi Dialogues — the groundwork to draw up a 50-point blueprint for a five-year government in the capital.
Party chief Arvind Kejriwal said at the launch that the party “will interact with people from different fields” and work towards making Delhi a “world-class city in five years”.
Elaborating on their initiative, Kejriwal said, “Our team will talk to experts as well as common residents to identify issues which will be incorporated in the blueprint. At an event organised every week, we will announce these issues.”

The first such event has been set for November 15 at Jantar Mantar, followed by discussions on November 26 on measures to be taken for women’s safety. “The party will talk about issues related to the youth and students of Delhi, about their aspirations and their problems,” Kejriwal said.
Senior AAP leader Yogendra Yadav connected the campaign to the party’s idea of swaraj. “The Aam Aadmi Party, from the beginning, has tried to give a new idea to the country in the form of swaraj. Delhi Dialogue takes this idea forward,” Yadav said.
Touted as a collaborative action to create a partnership between the government and the governed, Delhi Dialogues, aims to draw up an actionable plan for various sections through a series of discussions.
Yadav said, “Just before each election, all political parties release their manifesto. Hardly any discussion takes place on their content… We will present small sections of our manifesto so that there is discussion, debate and investigation of these issues. Delhi Dialogues represents a step forward for the party’s ideas.”
The campaign will be led by senior AAP leaders — banker Meera Sanyal, former journalist Ashish Khetan and former Apple sales head Adarsh Shastri.

Boost pressure on Russia over Ukraine  US tells UNcouncilUS told UNSC there needs to be greater international pressure on Russia to abide by a ceasefire in Ukraine.
By: Reuters | United Nations | Posted: November 13, 2014 5:04 am
The United States told the United Nations Security Council on Wednesday there needs to be greater international pressure on Russia to abide by a ceasefire in Ukraine, as Russia denied it was a threat to its neighbour.
The 15-member council held its 26th meeting on Ukraine. A ceasefire agreed by pro-Russian rebels and Ukraine on September 5 in the Belarussian capital of Minsk is now all but dead and Western fears of a return to all-out conflict are growing.
Ukraine said on Wednesday it was redeploying troops in the east because of fears separatists will launch a new military offensive, despite Russia’s denials it sent troops to reinforce the rebels.
“What we need to do is keep ratcheting up the pressure on Russia until it abides by Minsk and chooses the path of de-escalation,” US Ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, told the Security Council.
The United States and the European Union started imposing economic sanctions on Moscow in response to Russia’s seizure of the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine in March, a month after the overthrow of a Moscow-backed president in Kiev after protests.
European Union foreign ministers are due to meet in Brussels on Monday but are unlikely to step up sanctions against Russia, EU diplomats said on Wednesday.
NATO’s top military commander Philip Breedlove said in Bulgaria the alliance had spotted military equipment arriving from Russia in regions of east Ukraine held by pro-Russian separatist rebels.
Russia’s Deputy UN Ambassador Alexander Pankin told the Security Council that NATO’s assessment did not reflect the situation on the ground and was an “empty statement and the usual propagandistic falsifications.”
In comments directed at Ukraine UN Ambassador Yuriy Sergeyev, he said: “The equipment and forces that the Russian armed forces have are on the territory of my country and they’re not threatening yours, they are not moving from my country.”
Russia on Tuesday abstained from a Security Council vote to renew authorization for an EU military operation in Bosnia because it said the mission could be viewed as a bid to accelerate the country’s integration into the EU and NATO. Moscow previously voted in favor of the EU operation.
A senior council diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said this was the first example of a spillover of the disagreements over Ukraine into other council issues.

Android One faces stiff competition from Xiaomi & Motorola; poses tough challenge for GoogleAndroid One faces stiff competition from Xiaomi & Motorola; poses tough challenge for Google
By Danish Khan , ET Bureau | 13 Nov, 2014, 06.15AM IST
The strategy was flawed, especially for a device targeted at a large segment of the population unlikely to have access to the internet.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
NEW DELHI: Early trends suggest that Indian consumers have given a lukewarm reception to Google's much-touted Android One devices amid intense competition from the likes of Xiaomi and Motorola, posing a tough challenge for the US company, which has made the standard the centrepiece of its emerging-market strategy for smartphones.
Import data for October showed Google's Android One partners — Micromax, Karbonn and Spice — together imported just over 2 lakh devices in the first full month of sales. This was less than the nearly 2.3 lakh handsets imported for the 15 days of September, data from market research firm Cybex Exim Solutions, available exclusively with ET, showed. The devices were launched in mid-September.
IDC analyst Karan Thakkar and Counterpoint Research Analyst Tarun Pathak said initial sales have been hurt by intense competition as well as the fact that Android One devices were initially only available online, which still has limited penetration in India. The strategy was flawed, especially for a device targeted at a large segment of the population unlikely to have access to the internet.
"For the month of October, roughly 8 million smartphones were shipped into the country, of which Android One would be just about 2.5%," said an industry tracker, who did not want to be quoted.
A Google spokesperson, however, said the devices were seeing "very strong sales and consumer interest", particularly in tier II and tier III cities. IDC's Thakkar, too, expects Android One sales to pick up in November and December. A person familiar with the matter said though Micromax's sales of its Android One device exceeded that of rivals, it managed to sell only about 1.2 lakh units till October end, as against a total of 2.50 lakh units imported. "They had anticipated huge demand for the device, and therefore had ordered a large stock." Micromax didn't respond to requests for comment.
Pardeep Jain, managing director of Karbonn Mobiles , said its Android One Sparkle V smartphone had performed below the company's expectations, adding that sales were also marred as supplies were available for only 15 days in October. "Traction has started coming now and demand is improving," he said. Prashant Bindal, chief executive officer of Spice Mobility, said sales were hit by supply issues. "We had faced an outof-stock situation during the month since there was no inventory coming from China."
A person familiar with the matter said that Karbonn and Spice, unsure about the product's prospects, had shipped low quantities, which were eventually sold out once they started offline sales in addition to online. "The factories in China couldn't suddenly cater to their requirements for additional stocks, thus creating a supply gap."
The two companies started selling their devices offline to push sales earlier in October, after their initial strategy of an exclusive online launch failed to gather momentum. The drawback with selling through retail stores is that it increases the cost of handsets.
Micromax imported 1.32 lakh units of its Canvas A1 device in October compared with 1.19 lakh in September. Karbonn brought in just 34,390 units of its Sparkle V handset in October, almost half the 67,440 units imported in September. Spice brought 34,390 units in October, compared with 43,100 units in September, according to Cybex Exim.
Android One devices are facing stiff competition from the likes of China's Xiaomi and Motorola - both of which are also selling only online -- as some of these models offer the same or better specifications at lower or similar price points. "Vendors such as Motorola, Gionee and Lava are providing stiff competition," said Pathak of Counterpoint Research. Experts added that these phones need to offer more features at lower price points, and that their unique qualities need to be more effectively communicated.
"The USP of Android One such as software updates and other Google services of the device were not publicised. That was another reason for the lukewarm response toward Android One devices," Pathak said, referring to the close integration of Maps, Google Now and other features.
Moreover, the inability of these devices to take pictures without adding an external card may have also hurt sales.
Success in India - among the world's fastest-growing and most price-sensitive markets -- is critical for Google, which plans to take the low-cost Android One devices to markets such as Indonesia , the Philippines, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka shortly. The US giant has tied up with new partners including Acer, Asus, HTC, Lenovo and Panasonic apart from India's Lava and Intex and chipmaker Qualcomm for the next set of handsets.

In reply to : Skylight message

I usually end up with 3x-5x returns over 3-5 years..........if you follow following rules of selling you will be benefitted in long run
Personal Reasons
• Risk Tolerance Reached
You bought a company that looked like a steady growing concern, but instead it has turned out to be a roller coaster ride. For whatever reason, this stock is just too volatile for your nerves. Dump this firecracker and replace it with a stock that will let you sleep at night.
• You Need some Cash
An unexpected major bill can sabotage anyone’s budget. Using a stock, especially one that is underperforming, to solve a financial emergency is another reason to sell. However, take a close look at your personal finances. An emergency cash fund that is not tied up in investments is recommended to avoid, except in extreme cases, liquidating stocks to pay bills.
• Moral, Ethical Conflicts
More and more investors are becoming concerned about the social, environmental, ethical and moral standards of the companies they own. You may decide that a company you own has practices or products that conflict with your social, religious or moral beliefs. There is no better reason to sell if that is important to you.
• The Grass is Greener
This overlaps with market reasons to sell, but there is nothing wrong with dumping an underwhelming stock for a company that offers better returns. The danger here is that active trading can generate significant transaction costs and taxes, both of which eat into any potential gain. Look (and think) before you leap.
• You’ve Reached your Goal
It worked. Your plan to reach that financial goal, whether it was retirement or getting a child to college, is finally here. Now is the time to start systematically liquidating those stocks you’ve tagged for this goal. If you have been trading, make sure you have owned the stock at least one year before selling so it falls under long-term capital gains tax rules.
Market-Driven Reasons
• The Stock Drops by x%
If you buy a stock as a trader, rather than an investor (see Are You an Investor or Trader? ), you may set an arbitrary floor for the stock. When the stock falls to this floor, you sell. Many traders set that floor in the 6% – 8% range, depending on the volatility of the stock. They may not be happy about a small loss, but they make sure it doesn’t become a big loss.
• The Company Flounders
This is the investor’s signal to sell. The investor bought the company because of its fundamentals and its business plan. When something changes and the company loses its way, the investor has to re-examine whether it is the same company or not. Maybe a new CEO takes the company off in a direction that the investor (and market) believes is wrong.
• When a Stock is Over Valued
Can there be too much of a good thing? There certainly can in the market. When stocks are pushed way past their true value, they are often set up for a fall. The strategy is to sell when they are over valued and buy them back after a market correction has knocked the price back down. This, of course presumes an accurate knowledge of the top and bottom of prices – something very few of us are particularly good at with any consistency. Selling an over-valued stock is certainly preferable to buying an over-valued stock. Just be prepared to watch it keep going up after you sell, as happens sometimes. Don’t second-guess yourself; it could have more easily gone the other way.
• Rebalancing Your Portfolio
You have decided that the best allocation for your circumstances is 60% stocks, 30% bonds and 10% cash in your portfolio. Good fortune has smiled on you and your stocks, which are now valued at 70% of your portfolio. As tempting as it might be, your best move is to rebalance your portfolio by selling off some of your stocks and bringing the percentages back into alignment. Obviously, the stock(s) you sell should meet the long-term capital gains test of one-year ownership. Beyond that, look at how your stocks break out and decide which stocks can be sold to keep the diversification intact.

After hitting a new record high of 28,027.96 points in early trade, the benchmark Sensex on Monday ended just 6 points higher compared to the previous close as investors booked profit across counters.
The 30-share Sensex surged to hit new lifetime high of 28,027.96, breaching its previous high of 28,010.39 recorded on November 5.
The index soon started losing momentum quickly and briefly slipped into the negative territory in volatile trade to touch a low of 27,764.75.
It finally ended 6.10 points higher at 27,874.73.
ITC Ltd, Sun Pharma, Dr Reddy’s, Hind Unilever, Coal India, Bajaj Auto, BHEL, HDFC, Hero MotoCorp, Tata Power and Wipro led the 15 Sensex gainers, while Tata Motors, Tata Steel, TCS, SBI, Sesa Sterlite, RIL, M&M, L&T, ICICI Bank and ONGC were among the 15 losers.
The 50-share NSE Nifty after hitting a new peak of 8,383.05 in early trade, also succumbed to profit-booking. It gave up most of initial gains to touch a low of 8,304.45 before ending at 8,344.25, showing a moderate rise of 7.25 points. The gauge had previous intra-day record high of 8,365.55, touched on November 5.
Sectorally, the BSE FMCG index gained the most by rising 2.81 per cent, followed by consumer durables index 1.00 per cent, power index 0.84 per cent and healthcare index 0.47 per cent.
However, oil & gas index ended in the negative zone with a fall of 1.29 per cent, capital goods index (down 1.01 per cent), banking index (down 0.53 per cent), PSU index (down 0.48 per cent) and auto index (down 0.34 per cent).
A mixed closing at the other Asian markets and a slightly higher opening on the European markets influenced the sentiment, market players said.

Apple iOS bug makes devices prone to attackApple iOS bug makes devices vulnerable to attack, say experts

Researchers have warned that a bug in Apple's iOS operating system makes most iPhones and iPads vulnerable to cyber attacks by hackers seeking access to sensitive data and control of their devices.
Cybersecurity firm FireEye published details about the vulnerability on its blog on Monday, saying the bug enables hackers to access devices by persuading users to install malicious applications with tainted text messages, emails and Web links.
The malicious application can then be used to replace genuine, trusted apps that were installed through Apple's App Store, including email and banking programs, with malicious software through a technique that FireEye has dubbed "Masque Attack."
These attacks can be used to steal banking and email login credentials or other sensitive data, according to FireEye, which is well-regarded in cybersecurity circles for its research.
"It is a very powerful vulnerability and it is easy to exploit," FireEye Senior Staff Research Scientist Tao Wei said in an interview.
Apple's iOS has robust security features that make it extremely difficult for attackers to install malware on devices using traditional techniques for infecting Windows machines and Android mobile devices with malicious emails and Web links. The "Masque Attack" makes that possible by exploiting a system that Apple developed to allow large organizations to deploy custom-built software without going through Apple's App Store, according to David Richardson, iOS product manager at mobile security firm Lookout.
Those applications are not vetted by Apple for malicious software , unlike apps in its App Store, though users do receive pop-up notifications asking if they want to prevent the apps from installing on devices, he said.
"You can just say 'Don't install.' As long as you do that, you will be protected from this vulnerability," Richardson said.
FireEye disclosed the vulnerability to Apple in July and representatives of the company said they were working to fix the bug, according to Wei.
Apple could not immediately be reached for comment.
News of the vulnerability began to leak out in October on specialized Web forums where security experts and hackers alike discuss information on Apple bugs , Wei said.
He said FireEye decided to go public with its findings after Palo Alto Networks Inc last week uncovered WireLurker, the first campaign to exploit the vulnerability.
"Currently WireLurker is the only one, but we will see more," Wei said.

RBI tightens rules for  shadow banks   NBFCs gainRBI tightens rules for 'shadow banks', NBFCs gain
Reuters  Mumbai, November 11, 2014
First Published: 12:18 IST(11/11/2014) | Last Updated: 12:21 IST(11/11/2014)
Comments
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has tightened rules for so-called "shadow banks", raising minimum capital requirements and restricting deposits with a set of changes that it hopes will protect consumers and the market without stifling growth.
Non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) such as LIC Housing Finance Ltd, provide a variety of banking services for both firms and individuals. They have been lending heavily to sectors like infrastructure at a time when traditional banks are held back by, among other things, hefty bad loans.
But NBFCs do not hold full banking licences and are not subject to the tougher rules imposed on commercial banks.
The RBI, which has long warned of the risks posed by unregulated financial firms, said on Monday that their growth meant NBFCs could now pose risks to the broader market. A senior RBI official said in September that the bank recognises roughly 12,000 registered NBFCs.
"NBFCs are now deeply interconnected with the entities in the financial sector," the RBI said in a statement on Monday.
"Being financial entities, they are as exposed to risks arising out of counterparty failures, funding and asset concentration, interest rate movement and risks pertaining to liquidity and solvency, as any other financial sector player."
The new rules are meant to replace a set of loose guidelines that had previously governed the NBFC sector, which has grown rapidly in recent years. Analysts estimate NBFCs account for about 12% of the total assets in India's financial sector.
RBI tightened Tier 1 capital requirements and said NBFCs would need to hold capital levels of at least of Rs. 10 million ($162,668) by the end of March 2016 and 20 million rupees by end-March 2017 to avoid losing their right to operate.
The central bank also said only certain investment-grade NBFCs would be allowed to take deposits, saying the firms would have until the end of March 2016 to acquire a credit rating. It capped deposit-taking at 1.5 times the size of a firm's minimum capital -- down from four times previously.
The RBI said the new rules would address risks posed by these firms "without impeding the dynamism displayed by NBFCs".
An executive at one of the country's biggest NBFC said the RBI would continue to tighten rules.
"RBI is slowly and steadily removing all kinds of arbitrage possible," he said, declining to be identified because he was not authorised to talk to the media. "To that extent, I am more inclined to believe, this is not the last of it."
Meanwhile, shares in non-banking finance companies gained on Tuesday after the RBI tightened rules for "shadow banks", raising minimum capital requirements and restricting deposits, ending the uncertainty.
The rules contain no unexpected changes, contrary to investors' fears, say traders.
Shriram Transport gains 3.9%, Mahindra and Mahindra Financial Services gains 2.4%. IDFC gains 2.6%, LIC Housing Finance up 1.6%.
Among key changes, NBFCs' bad loan and provisioning norms have been aligned with banks.
The long transition period, until March 2018, for new rules also helps.

Vodafone reports slump in profitsVodafone reports slump in profits

Vodafone's profits plunged in the first half, hit by much lower one-off tax gains and costs linked to a series of acquisitions, but still beat analysts' expectations, the British mobile phone giant said on Tuesday.
Net profit dived 70% to £5.422 billion ($8.589 billion, 6.910 billion euros) in the six months ending September 30, compared with the equivalent period one year earlier, the world's second-largest mobile operator said in a statement.
But its share price jumped in early deals in London as investors cheered the better-than-expected result and news that Vodafone has upgraded its full-year profits forecast, traders said.
The British group, second only to China Mobile in terms of subscriber numbers, is snapping up companies after last year selling its 45% stake in Verizon Wireless to Verizon for $130 billion, clinching one of the biggest transactions in global corporate history.
Vodafone has since bought Spanish cable firm Ono and Kabel Deutschland (KDG), the largest cable operator in Germany.
Vodafone shares were up 4.71% to 217.5 pence in morning deals on London's FTSE 100 index, which was up 0.12% at 6,619.18 points.

You love it  your spouse hates itYou love going abroad for work. Your spouse hates it
Ian Driscoll

Staying open-minded can make or break a move abroad. (Thinkstock)
Before Jody Holland arrived in Shanghai in 2011, she and her family attended a two-day cultural immersion course in the UK, arranged and paid for by her husband’s company
“We were taught business etiquette, how business operates, the importance of titles to people, the meaning of guanxi (the social connections and relationships that underpin much Chinese business activity), and other things we wouldn’t have been able to find out ourselves,” Holland said.

Don't say — or do — this in Asia
As the trailing spouse — the family moved due to her husband's job at a major European automobile manufacturer on a three-year assignment — she found the preparation invaluable. Their three children were taught separately and topics they covered included the Chinese Zodiac, the importance of the number eight in Chinese culture and how to use chopsticks.
Holland’s instructors included two expatriates with extensive experience of China, as well as a native Chinese. In addition to their insights into Chinese culture, it was the instructors’ wisdom about daily life that also helped. One piece of essential advice: that her husband wouldn’t find shoes his size in China. (He wore a UK size 11 but the largest size readily available in China is a UK Size 9.)
“Nothing can fully prepare you for China, but it certainly took the shock out of arriving,” Holland said of the guidance.
Upon arriving in Shanghai, however, that perception of preparedness dissolved quickly. With no follow-up instruction in the new country, she suddenly felt very alone and overwhelmed by the enormity of her new situation. “I remember standing in a house with no furniture, not knowing anyone, and wishing they had buddied me up with someone from my husband’s company,” she said.
Holland was by many accounts one of the lucky ones with some transitional help at the onset. But not all trailing spouses are as fortunate. Some are unable to adjust and settle in the new environment and the expat assignment, often by the spouse’s choice, is cut short.
“Around 30% of assignees who return early from an international assignment attribute the inability of their family to settle to the decision to come home,” said Matthew MacLachlan, head of intercultural and communication skills training at London-based consulting firm Communicaid.
The downside of these early returns, of course, is not only the repatriation expense the company must absorb, but also the additional costs associated with finding a replacement, training the successor and managing any shortfall in productivity in the interim. There may also be career repercussions, especially if head office cannot readily accommodate the returnee.
When training works
To combat the problem some companies will send trailing spouses (and sometimes their children) on immersion courses like those offered by relocation company Cartus or the intercultural training specialist Communicaid. Courses may begin by addressing primary topics such as food, language and appearance. Advice on gift-giving, etiquette and local customs around births and deaths sometimes follows. Two-day courses will delve into deeper issues, such as the social conventions of high and low context cultures. Generous companies may conclude the process with language lessons once the spouse has arrived in their new home.
The aim of these courses is to ameliorate what Anthony Di Bratto, a Toronto-based human resources consultant calls “the combination of relationship/family stress, feelings of isolation and cultural conflict or culture shock that make overseas life untenable for a trailing spouse.”
The best courses train you before departure and offer assistance after you arrive, according to Val Gascoyne, formerly the London-based expat manager for UK food retailer Tesco Plc. “And culture training needs to be done with a specialist,” who will customise the information to an expat’s personal situation, she said, adding that some companies will spend as much as £1500 [$2380] on a trailing spouse.
Living the day to day
To adapt quickly, experts recommend expats immerse themselves into the day-to-day life of the new culture by doing everything from buying groceries, picking up prescriptions at the local pharmacy, sending letters at the post office and ordering off the menu at a restaurant — just as they would back home. This gives newcomers a chance to observe and mirror how the locals beside them are behaving and doing the same tasks.
“Learning specific cultural norms, especially those associated with the most frequent daily interactions with host country nationals is helpful,” Anthony Di Bratto said.
Joellen Nicholson, who recently followed her partner to Germany, was initially exasperated by the early closing hours of Munich’s grocery stores compared with those in the US. But for every negative, she has also found a positive, like the German institution: the beer garden. “The insider tip,” she said in an email, “is that at many biergartens you can actually bring your own food and just buy the beer there.”
Dealing with culture clash
Differences of culture are par for the course.
For instance, in China, a nation of 1.35 billion people, personal space is measured in inches rather than feet, and locals readily push past one another with few consequences. However, this incessant broaching of what psychologists call your “intimate” space unhinges many westerners. On the flipside, many Asians consider the western habit of blowing a nose into a handkerchief staggeringly unhygienic.
“First time expatriates may only see the superficial cultural differences, but the training helps them to anticipate and successfully negotiate the implicit, invisible cultural values underneath,” said MacLachlan, who uses the analogy of a floating hippo to illustrate the necessity of understanding those unseen cultural elements: what you see above the water’s surface is only a sliver of what lurks beneath.
Developing empathy for local context and staying open-minded can make or break whether expats adjust. Ultimately, a person’s attitude is what determines who completes an assignment.
Zack Goss, a Shanghai-based social worker who has counseled many expats, said that responses to difficulties vary considerably. “People who invest in the culture, who embrace the differences and who embrace new opportunities and new exposures, often have an easier time,” said Goss. “There’s a little more flexibility and less of a fight…whatever you can do to embrace flexibility before you arrive can help ease discomfort.”
Integrating into the local community and immersing yourself in the language also helps. “Language is an entry point; it allows you to gain more insight and understanding and get closer to the culture. It has the potential to make you more comfortable,” said Goss.
New Zealander Marita Light, who studied Mandarin and spent five years in China, said adjusting her expectations of life around her also helped.
“Your frustrations build up and create inner resistance to everything you experience, but the frustration is there because your expectations for normality are completely unrealistic,” she said. “Letting go of my judgments, and consciously being more open, enabled more creativity in how I dealt with awkward situations. It was much more rewarding way to live in China.”
When to call it quits
Despite enjoying aspects of Shanghai, one Australian trailing spouse has pulled the plug and is going home, despite the company offering his wife an extension of her contract. “My experience has been tempered by the way my wife’s company has treated us. They forgot the human factor,” said the man, who didn’t wish to be named. “No one from my wife’s company ever called and asked how I was doing.”
Aside from a lack of cultural training, a series of bad experiences from the onset triggered a landslide of others. The final straw, he said, was when his father died and his wife’s company “didn’t consider him a close enough relative to trigger the compassionate leave provision” and pay for his flight home.
But more quotidian issues have also plagued the spouse.
His status as male trailing spouse hasn’t always been welcomed. “It took the mums a longer time to be comfortable with me,” he said.
What amuses him is that his wife’s company gave him half a day of cultural training when they previously moved to London. This included instructions on how to behave if he met a member of the Royal family.
“When was I ever going to meet a member of the Royal family?” he asked.

Smoothing spousal transition
Moving to a new country comes with challenges, especially when you are moving for your partner’s job. These tips can help:
Learn the language.
Connect with your local expat community.
Ask your partner’s company to provide pre-and post-relocation counseling. Learn to manage your expectations in advance of arrival. Most foreign countries aren’t what you expect.
To help you meet locals, attend your partner’s company events.
If you have children, get more involved with parent groups at their school.

FCC chairman  Obama not in sync on net rulesBy Brian Fung and Nancy Scola November 11 Follow @b_fung Follow @nancyscola

Hours after President Obama called for the Federal Communications Commission to pass tougher regulations on high-speed Internet providers, the agency’s Democratic chairman told a group of business executives that he was moving in a different direction.
Huddled in an FCC conference room Monday with officials from major Web companies, including Google, Yahoo and Etsy, agency Chairman Tom Wheeler said he has preferred a more nuanced solution. That approach would deliver some of what Obama wants but also would address the concerns of the companies that provide Internet access to millions of Americans, such as Comcast, Time Warner Cable and AT&T.
“What you want is what everyone wants: an open Internet that doesn’t affect your business,” a visibly frustrated Wheeler said at the meeting, according to four people who attended. “What I’ve got to figure out is how to split the baby.”

The dissonance between Obama and Wheeler has the makings of a major policy fight affecting multibillion-dollar industries. The president wants clear rules to prevent Internet service providers from auctioning the fastest speeds to the highest bidders, a scenario that could favor rich Web firms over start-ups.
Wheeler, a former lobbyist for the cable and telecommunications industry, has floated proposals that aim to limit the ability of service providers to charge Web companies, such as Netflix or Google, to reach their customers. But critics have argued that his approach would give the providers too much leeway to favor some services over others.
Given the high stakes, White House aides had wrestled over whether Obama should publicly prod the FCC to adopt the strongest rules possible on the “net neutrality” issue. Ultimately, aides felt that a public stance would galvanize allies in Congress as well as young, tech-savvy progressives, a key part of the Democratic base, according to several people familiar with the matter. The decision to speak out also comes as Democrats are aggressively courting Silicon Valley in preparation for the 2016 campaigns.
But the move by the White House has put Wheeler in an uncomfortable spotlight. The two men have long been allies. Wheeler raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for Obama’s campaign and advised the president on his transition into the White House. Obama last year appointed Wheeler to lead the FCC as it was poised to tackle its biggest issue in years — the rules that govern content on the Web.
A growing source of frustration for White House and congressional Democrats is that they have three of their own on the five-member commission at the FCC, a majority that should give them the power to push through a policy of their liking. But if Wheeler charts a different course, he could bring the other members along with him.
And, as Wheeler reminded participants at his meeting with Web companies Monday, the FCC does not answer to the Obama administration.
“I am an independent agency,” Wheeler told them repeatedly, according to several officials.
Both Wheeler and the FCC declined to comment for this story. The White House had no additional comment beyond the president’s statement Monday, in which he said the FCC is an independent agency and “ultimately this decision is theirs alone.”
Obama’s statement caught industry observers by surprise, but it was the product of mounting concern at the White House that Wheeler and the FCC were clouding the issue.
Administration aides worried that Wheeler’s efforts to strike a compromise between open-Internet advocates and telecom firms would result in rules that were murky and ineffective, according to officials familiar with the thinking, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the discussions were private. The FCC has tried to solve the Internet access issue with a compromise approach, only to have it struck down in court this year under a challenge from Verizon.
Obama promised during his 2008 campaign that he would seek rules supporting net neutrality, or the principle that all Internet traffic should be treated the same. Ultimately, the White House decided that telecom companies probably would challenge any strong FCC rules in court anyway, so why not fully support calls by the tech lobby for far-reaching rules protecting an open Internet?
The aides saw a political upside to a strong statement. A key contingent of the president’s base — young, tech-savvy progressives — would be energized by the action, and a strong statement on net neutrality could also help his relationship with congressional Democrats, according to government and industry officials.
Obama also saw a more immediate opportunity to retake the political high ground from Republicans, according to a Democratic congressional aide. Should GOP lawmakers vote to overturn any protections enacted by the FCC, a presidential veto would put Obama on the side of millions of consumers who have called on the FCC to adopt strong regulations.
“I see him almost salivating over a congressional fight, or a fight with the carriers, over this issue,” said the aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to talk on the record. “This is a populist issue he thinks he can win on.”
The president’s statement galvanized supporters of net neutrality. Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Tom Udall (D-N.M.) and John D. Rockefeller IV (D-W.Va.) quickly issued statements calling on the FCC to move quickly to implement the president’s plan.
“The president set a solid target out there,” said Evan Engstrom, policy director for Engine Advocacy, which represents tech start-ups.
But the move puts Wheeler in an uncomfortable position.
Wheeler worries that the president’s more drastic approach is too simplistic, according to people familiar with his thinking. With his long experience in the telecommunications industry, Wheeler is well aware of concerns that ill-considered regulations could stifle innovation and slow the growth of the country’s broadband infrastructure, those people said. And he worries that the White House is being naive about the ripple effects of changing how a major piece of national infrastructure is governed.
One telecom industry lobbyist was sympathetic to Wheeler’s position: “I don’t think anybody goes into the FCC saying, ‘I want to be at the center of drama.’ But they seem to find themselves there frequently.”
Behind closed doors, Wheeler has fretted about how Republicans on Capitol Hill would react to far-reaching net neutrality rules, according to people familiar with his deliberations. Already on Monday, the Senate Republican leadership dismissed Obama’s plan as “last century’s rules.”
Obama would probably veto an attempt by Republicans to roll back any FCC rules. But Congress could hamstring the FCC by withholding funding on other, lower-profile issues, and it could put Wheeler in the hot seat during congressional hearings or as the target of lengthy investigations.
Correction: This story has been updated to reflect that Sen. Tom Udall (D-N.M.) -- not  Sen. Mark Udall (D-Colo.) -- issued a statement in support of President Obama 's net neutrality plan.

The economy is getting better. So why are shoppers still hunting for rock-bottom pricesBy Sarah Halzack November 11 Follow @sarahhalzack

The jobless rate is at a six-year low, gas prices have dipped below $3 a gallon , and consumers are more upbeat about the economy.
These are the kind of economic conditions that should encourage consumers to loosen their purse strings this holiday season, and indeed, surveys show that shoppers plan to spend more this year on gifts and decor.
But consumers are also stubbornly clinging to one recession-era shopping behavior that has retailers scrambling: discount prices.
“The retail industry has created this monster that they wish they hadn’t,” said Jennifer Black, president of retail research firm Jennifer Black & Associates.
Retailers say they are girding for a fierce competition over who can offer the best prices this holiday season, and many have already kicked off their deals.  Wal-Mart lowered prices on 20,000 items Nov. 1 and expects the majority of those cuts to remain in place through the holiday season.  Amazon.com, Staples and several other retailers have already made their Thanksgiving weekend deals available to shoppers.
Hunting for rock-bottom prices has long been a Black Friday tradition, but experts say the emphasis on promotional pricing rose to new heights during the recession.  Retailers aggressively slashed prices throughout the holiday season when they found merchandise wasn’t moving. That practice continued even after the holidays as the recession dragged on, and customers became trained to look for deep discounts such as “40 percent off your entire purchase.”
Experts say the lingering promotion-mania may be related to one of the key weaknesses of this economic recovery:  Wages have largely remained stagnant, meaning plenty of households likely aren’t feeling more flush than they were several years ago.
Non-economic factors, too, are fueling the promotion addiction. The Web has created unprecedented transparency around price, and smartphones have made it easier for shoppers to make sure they’re not missing out on a better deal. In a  survey released by Deloitte in October , 68 percent of shoppers said they were likely or very likely to research a purchase online before ultimately making it at a store.  Twenty-three percent of shoppers said they would use their phones to do in-store price comparisons.
Retailers say they are struggling to cater to customers’ desire for deep discounts without destroying their  already-thin profit margins.
“It becomes a limbo contest: How low can you go?  At some point you’ve got to fold the hand,” said Charlie O’Shea, a retail analyst at Moody’s Investor Service.
Gap Chief Executive Glenn Murphy told investors in August that there’s “a bit of a promotional merry-go-round in the marketplace,” an environment the company said was a key reason its merchandise margins slipped in the second quarter.  While Gap’s Old Navy brand has been a relative bright spot for the company, its flagship Gap stores have been struggling to recover from several months of weak sales.
Experts say retailers are gradually adjusting to this new normal. Williams-Sonoma, for example, told investors in August that in recent quarters it has reduced its spending on advertising to free up money for more discounts. Best Buy, meanwhile, says it has implemented new pricing and tracking capabilities that have enabled it to see which of its promotional offers are getting the most traction with customers.
In this competitive climate, analysts note that there is an important distinction between planned and unplanned promotions.
When retailers plan to offer a discount, they likely bake that into their original pricing. In other words, if they plan to offer a “40 percent off your purchase” deal for much of the holiday season, they’ll likely set the price of a sweater at $100 knowing they’d typically be selling for $60.
The trouble comes when retailers are forced to unexpectedly offer a promotion because sales are slow, which can put a strain on their profit margins.
As the recession gets further in the rear-view mirror, Jesse Tron, spokesman for the International Council of Shopping Centers, said his organization has noticed a new twist on deal-hunting. In some cases, shoppers are once again shelling out for pricier items, such as upscale denim or luxury handbags, suggesting that they have a comfortable shopping budget. But even as they do so, they’re still only opening their wallets when the items are priced promotionally.
“No one wants to feel like a chump,” said Alison Paul, leader of Deloitte’s U.S. retail practice.

ED says RBI could have acted against Ponzi firmsEnforcement Directorate says RBI could have acted against Ponzi companies
Mail Today Bureau     New Delhi   Last Updated: November 12, 2014  | 08:56 IST
Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan
The Enforcement Directorate (ED) is looking into 'role' of senior Reserve Bank of India (RBI) officials for not taking any action in major Ponzi scams like Saradha and Rose Valley as the investigative agency is not convinced by the Central bank's argument that it did not have powers to act in these cases. A senior ED official told Mail Today that Section 58 B of the RBI Act clearly empowers officials of the Central to take action in scams related to companies that collect money from the public.
Section 58 B states, "Whoever in any application, declaration, return, statement, information or particulars made, required or furnished by or under or for the purposes of any provisions of this Act, or any order, regulation or direction made or given there under or in any prospectus or advertisement issued for or in connection with the invitation by any person, of deposits of money from the public willfully makes a statement which is false in any material particular knowing it to be false or willfully omits to make a material statement shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years and shall also be liable to fine."
According to sources, ED had questioned both RBI and Security and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) officials for their response to these scams . Although Sebi had initiated prosecution proceedings against these complaints, RBI had not taken action on the grounds that its role is merely regulatory in nature.
ED has also sent a detailed questionnaire to RBI on the issue but has not received a satisfactory reply. RBI replies are reported to be vague and evasive and ED has asked them to provide specific answers to the queries.
So far, ED has attached Saradha Group properties worth Rs 600 crore in West Bengal, Jharkhand, Assam and Odisha. However, some action taken by the Shyamal Sen Commission, formed by West Bengal to refund money to the depositors, is causing problems in going ahead with the legal process. ED does not have adequate manpower and logistics support. The Central Bureau of Investigation also plans to examine some RBI officials in connection with the Saradha scam as it has found certain instances for which clarification is required from the bank.

The Union government has also decided to resume providing subsidy on cooking gas through direct cash transfers straight into consumers’ bank accounts.
The Modi government has frozen the budget subsidy for cooking gas at Rs. 20 a kg. This will not mean any increase in price for the consumer right away.
However, if international prices were to rise, as they normally do in winter, then the government will be faced with the choice of either passing on the increase to consumers or asking the oil companies to bear the burden.
“The Cabinet has decided to shift to a fixed budget subsidy for cooking gas which has been frozen at Rs. 20 per kg,” Union Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan told The Hindu. “With the per-kg budget subsidy fixed, I will now push the oil companies to ensure it reaches poor people who need the subsidy more but are unable to afford the bigger cylinders.” “Just like FMCG companies make products like shampoos affordable by pushing sachet-sized sales, we plan to make the cooking gas subsidised cylinders affordable through 5-kg bottles,” the Minister said. Users of smaller cylinders such as migrants, students and labourers will benefit. At present, 5-kg cylinders are not subsidised. The standard subsidised cylinders are 14.2 kg in size.

Gas subsidy through direct cash transfers
The Union government has decided to resume providing subsidy on cooking gas through direct cash transfers straight into consumers’ bank accounts so that pilferage can be minimised, Union Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said here on Tuesday.
“This will ensure that the subsidy bill will come down further by about 15 per cent over time … a consumer may or may not use Aadhaar to access the DBT-linked cooking gas subsidy,” he said.
The decision to shift to a per-kg subsidy norm has the added advantage of introducing transparency and predictability to the calculation of the fuel subsidy element of the fiscal deficit.
So far, the burden of the difference between the market price and the subsidised price of cooking gas was borne by the budget and the State-owned oil companies. How much of the cooking gas subsidy was billed to the budget and how much the oil companies had to bear was negotiated between the Finance Ministry and the Oil Ministry.
The budget subsidy of Rs. 20 a kg will remain till March-end, after which it will be reviewed on the basis of the market price of cooking gas. According to a note approved by the Cabinet, against the market price in Delhi for a 14.2-kg cylinder of Rs. 810, the subsidised price is Rs. 417.
At Rs. 20 per kg, the budget subsidy works out to Rs. 284 while the under-recovery for the oil companies will be Rs. 109.

The final countdown is approaching for one of the most audacious space adventures ever the European Space Agency’s attempt to land a robot on a comet.
The manoeuvre marks the climax of the unmanned Rosetta space probe’s decade-long journey to study comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.
Early on Wednesday, scientists at the mission control center in Darmstadt, Germany, will decide whether to give Rosetta the go-ahead to release its sidekick, Philae.
The 100-kilogram landing craft will drop in an uncontrolled manner down to the 4-km (2.5—mile) wide comet and shoot harpoons into its icy surface to prevent it from bouncing off.
Scientists hope that the data collected by Rosetta and its lander will provide insights into the origins of comets and other objects in the universe.

merger, acquisition and takeover
Yahoo Inc will pay about $640 million for automated advertising service BrightRoll, beefing up its ability to sell video ads in real-time to marketers.
The acquisition sustains Chief Executive Officer Marissa Mayer's acquisition spree and sharpens the company's focus on video ads, which it hopes can offset declining Internet ad prices and decelerating growth.
Buying BrightRoll, which is profitable and expected to have revenues of more than $100 million this year, will make Yahoo's video advertising platform the largest in the United States, the company said in a statement on Tuesday.

Who cares about the soaring dollar You doWho cares about the dollar? You do

Your eyes probably glaze over when you read the headline: Dollar index up more than 10% since June. Who cares, you think.
Then you look at how your international fund has been doing. Hey boy howdy, that smarts.
The average large-company international fund has dropped 2.9% this year, vs. an 11% gain for the Standard and Poor’s 500 stock index with dividends reinvested. The past 12 months,the average large-company international fund has lagged its U.S. counterpart buy 14.09 percentage points, the widest gap since 2012.
Part of the reason, of course, is that many foreign markets have been wretched this year. Measured in euros, the German stock market is down 4.7%, according to MSCI, which tracks overseas markets. Portugal has tumbled 15.4%, and Russia is down 5.19%.
Toss in the soaring dollar, however, and bad markets have become worse. In dollar terms this year:
* Germany, down 14%
* Portugal, down 30.8%
* Russia, down 27.1%.
Unfortunately, it’s the dollar-denominated return that you get if you live in the U.S. A rising dollar erodes the value of overseas assets. Think of it this way: Suppose you gave your friend Conrad in Berlin 100 euros and asked him to mail them to you in one year. You paid $1.30 for the euros, or $130.
Twelve months later, the dollar is stronger, and it only takes $1.18 to buy a euro. Conrad dutifully mails you your 100 euros, and you get $118 — a 12-euro loss. The same process works with stocks held overseas: When the dollar rises, the value of your investments — in dollars — falls.
The argument for international funds is that they provide diversification, which they do. Unfortunately, international stocks tend to fall when U.S. stocks do. Most of the diversification is during bull markets — meaning that international stocks are more often a drag on performance than not. To be a big help to your portfolio, you need a falling dollar and rising overseas markets, a situation that can be difficult to accomplish.
Money flows to where it can get the best return. Right now, the yield on a 10-year Treasury note is a miserly 2.36%. But in Germany, a 10-year government note yields 0.83%. And in Japan, the 10-year government note yields nearly half as much — 0.48%.
The strong dollar has also smacked gold prices. Gold and the sawbuck usually move in opposite directions, and that’s just what they are doing now. Want to look on the bright side? A rising dollar makes it much cheaper to travel. Thinking of going to Europe? Now’s the time.

RSS starts work on a new chapter for education to inculcate ‘proper Indian nationalistic values’ in students
Ritika Chopra, ET Bureau Nov 12, 2014, 04.00AM IST

Atul Kothari
(The Narendra Modi government…)
NEW DELHI: As the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government gears up to prepare a new education policy for the country, its ideological fountainhead is also in the process of firming up inputs for the proposed revamp as part of a long-cherished project to inculcate what it considers to be the proper Indian nationalistic values among students.
In December, a national-level conference of close to 200 academics and experts invited by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh-backed Shiksha Bachao Andolan (SBA) will review the recommendations of all the previous panels on education — such as the Radhakrishnan, Mudaliar, and Kothari commissions — to identify the deficiencies of the current system in practice.
Based on the two-day deliberations in Ujjain, Madhya Pradesh, SBA will then submit a report to the Union human resource development ministry on what is desired in the new education policy. SBA convener Dinanath Batra has already called for changes in the school curriculum to better reflect what he refers to as Indian values. Batra is renowned for having forced Penguin India to withdraw academic Wendy Doniger's book for allegedly causing religious offence.
According to SBA co-convenor Atul Kothari , the curriculum currently taught in schools lacks focus on values and spiritualism as recommended by the Radhakrishan and Kothari commissions. "CBSE (Central Board of Secondary Education), for instance, has some component on value education but it's all in theory. How do we ensure this translates into practice? There has to be a greater focus on values. During the conference, we'll look at other suggestions of previous commissions of education that have not been implemented because of lack of political will," he told ET.
Nationalism, Kothari added, is another element that is missing from the curriculum. "There has to be a greater sense of pride in our history and our national heroes," he said.
The Narendra Modi government has welcomed inputs from the RSS and its affiliates on different issues including education. Recently, HRD minister Smriti Irani met senior RSS leaders along with representatives of six of its affiliated organizations working in the field of education. SBA was among them. Sections of academia have criticised the government-RSS interface as they suspect it will lead to the saffronisation of education.
"As far as nationalism, spiritualism and values are concerned, curriculum makers have engaged with these ideas and school textbooks have brought it out effectively. I think all this is a matter of interpretation," said Anita Rampal, professor of education at Delhi University. "The Mudaliar commission of 1952 talks of patriotism as a value that helps us understand our country and its diversity. The commission spoke against jingoism. When people say the current education system lacks these elements maybe they see nationalism, spiritualism and values differently."
The two-day conference on December 13 and 14 will be held just before the government's own deliberations on the new national education policy. Irani had recently announced that consultations on the new policy will be held at state and national level starting January 2015. According to ministry sources, the government will have consultations even at the gram panchayat level and seek feedback from all sections of society, as advocated by the RSS. However, there is no clarity on how such exhaustive consultations will be facilitated as the Modi government is yet to set up an education commission for this purpose.

Union human resource development ministry starts hunt for CBSE headCentral Board of Secondary Education
(Irani was not available…)
NEW DELHI: The Union human resource development ministry has begun its hunt for the next head of the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), the country's largest school education board.
HRD minister Smriti Irani recently constituted a five-member search committee for this purpose. Interestingly, Professor Jawaharlal Kaul, vice chancellor of Vikram University in Ujjain, Madhya Pradesh, is on the search panel. Kaul had been manhandled and his office vandalized by members of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad and the Bajrang Dal when he appealed for donations to help flood victims in Kashmir. Both the VHP and Bajrang Dal are affiliated to the Sangh Parivar, as is the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party.
Nisar Ahmad Ganai, former head of the Jammu and Kashmir school education board, Union Grants Commission chairman Ved Prakash and HRD joint secretary Satbir Bedi are other members of the search panel. "Both Kaul and Ganai have good academic credentials. In fact, Ganai got the education system in J&K back on track during the insurgency period," said an HRD official , who did not wish to be identified.
Irani was not available to comment on Kaul's selection for the search panel. The post of the CBSE chairman is currently occupied by Vineet Joshi. His term, which expires this month, could be extended by a few months until the government finds a successor, sources said. Joshi's term under the new Modi government has been controversial. The weeklong celebration of Sanksrit in CBSE schools was criticized heavily by political leaders of the southern states.
Former Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalitha had also written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi resisting the "imposition" of the Sanskrit Week in schools in her state.
Appointments to the posts of chairman at CBSE and the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) are being watched closely by the academic world as the government is rumoured to be under a lot of pressure from the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh to 'Indianise' the education curriculum.

GST dream one step closer to reality; empowered panel of state FMs & Centre agree on 'place of supply' rules

(Prime Minister Narendra…)
NEW DELHI: The government's bid to implement the goods & services tax (GST) as early as possible got a significant boost with the empowered committee of state finance ministers endorsing the so-called 'place of supply' rules that form the backbone of the new regime that will replace a plethora of levies, create a common market and likely give GDP growth a lift of up to two percentage points. The states are also confident GST will be in place by April 1, 2016, six years after it was originally scheduled to take effect.
The place of supply rules decide where goods or services will be taxed, fixing a crucial element of the levy that has gained in importance because of the surge in ecommerce and electronic delivery of services. Meanwhile, the Centre is preparing the ground for a national common market commission that will mesh with GST to create a unified area without interstate barriers to trade. However, both the Centre and the states continue to differ on the threshold for the levy with the first wanting it to be raised to Rs 25 lakh while the latter prefers it at Rs 10 lakh.
The Centre has assured the states that they won't suffer any revenue loss on account of subsuming petroleum product and entry taxes within the ambit of GST, promising to meet an important concern of states that are opposed to these duties being included in the levy that was to have been rolled out in April 2010.
"The empowered committee has given in-principle clearance to place of supply rules... This is a key takeaway from today's meeting," a senior government official, aware of the panel's deliberations on Tuesday, told ET.
Tax experts see finalisation of these rules as key to GST. "Place of supply rules are fundamental in determining the state where a service is provided and state GST or integrated GST is required to be paid," said Bipin Sapra, partner, EY. "These are extremely crucial to the basic structure of GST." Place of supply and consumption will determine the tax-recipient state and consuming state and have implications for their revenue.
"Place of supply rules are very critical for GST to run effectively. This is more so in the context of services as determining the state of consumption would be challenging, particularly where the services are not provided from an identified fixed place, such as telecom and transportation," said Pratik Jain, partner, KPMG in India. Jain pointed out that most of the disputes on value added tax in the European Union centre around place of supply rules.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has identified GST as one of the most important items on the government's crowded reforms agenda and progress on the talks is being closely monitored.
The government is expected to finalise the draft of the constitutional amendment Bill that will allow the Centre to tax goods at retail level and states to tax services in a few days. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has already indicated the Centre is in the last stage of finalising the Bill draft, approval of which is an essential step in the process. "If all goes well and the constitutional amendment Bill is carried in Parliament by both Houses, I think the 2016 target date is achievable," said GST Empowered Committee Chairman Abdul Rahim Rather.
The empowered panel did not agree to the Centre's demand for a higher threshold for taxing goods and services.
"In September, the Centre wrote to us suggesting that this decision of the empowered committee should be reviewed. The Centre suggested that the limit should beRs25 lakh. Even if it is not Rs25 lakh, the Rs10 lakh limit should be increased," Rather said, adding that the committee wants to stick to the agreed Rs 10 lakh threshold. However, he said the final call on threshold could be taken by the GST Council proposed to be created in the constitution amendment Bill.
GST will subsume central indirect taxes such as excise duty and service tax at the central level and value added tax at the state level besides other local levies such as octroi and entry tax. Though states are reluctant to include entry tax within GST, the Centre is now attempting to persuade them by offering a revenue compensation mechanism. The GST Constitutional Amendment Bill, introduced in the Lok Sabha in 2011, has lapsed and the government has to come up with fresh legislation.

Government plans to create unified national market
Deepshikha Sikarwar, ET Bureau Nov 12, 2014, 04.00AM IST
(An authority will be set…)
NEW DELHI: The Narendra Modi government is preparing a plan to create a unified market in India by setting up a permanent authority that will take the concept through to implementation, in tandem with the long-awaited goods and services tax (GST), which is a top priority for the administration.
A Cabinet note on the creation of a national common market commission under Article 307 of the constitution is expected to be drafted soon, a senior government official aware of deliberations told ET.
This body will deal with intra- and inter-state issues related to freedom of trade and commerce, the person said. Along with GST, the authority will help break down state and district boundaries for the seamless delivery of goods and services across the country, though the primary focus is on movement of food and vegetables.
The government is keen to spell out a timetable for GST implementation soon with the budget giving concrete signals such as the elimination of central sales tax levied on inter-state sales. Efforts are on to persuade states to agree to the earliest possible implementation date for GST, apart from readying legislation that's needed as part of this initiative."Free movement of goods and services within the country is important," said the official cited above.
"Discussions have begun and a cabinet note would be floated once the contours are frozen." The department of consumer affairs had pitched for the creation of a common market commission at a meeting of the inter-ministerial group on consumer advocacy.Industry said the move would amount to a significant reform.
"The creation of a unified market, which would facilitate seamless movement of goods across states by removing inter se trade barriers between them, would go a long way to reduce the transaction cost of business and help India to compete in overseas markets on equal terms," said Chandrajit Banerjee, director general of the Confederation of Indian Industry. "So far, Indian industry has had to deal with the disability of a fragmented market and high transaction costs."
Article 307 allows Parliament to appoint an authority for carrying out the purposes of Articles 301, 302, 303 and 304, related to trade, and confer on this powers and duties as deemed fit.Various panels on inter-state relations including the Sarkaria and Punchi commissions suggested an inter-state trade and commerce commission.
The government is keen on the creation of an integrated food market as sharp seasonal fluctuations in the prices of fruits, vegetables and pulses are a concern for policy makers. The Centre has already asked the states to revamp wholesale marketing systems under the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee Act as these are seen to be hindering the free movement of goods within the country."There is a need to establish an institutional mechanism for coordinated policy making for development of a single agriculture market that covers internal trade and facilitates harmonization of food and agri marketing policies across states," said the official cited above.
An integrated food market will be a necessary condition to increasing the efficiency of distribution from the farm to the consumer and reducing intermediation costs.
The official said this will require the repeal of some obsolete legislation and redesigning policy interventions to address "market failures".
A 2011 report by the working group on consumer affairs set up by the department pointed to significant inter-state barriers to trade. Such tax-related and physical barriers should be reduced or eliminated, it had said.
Under the constitution, Article 301 mandates that trade and commerce throughout the territory of India shall be free. Article 302 mandates that Parliament can impose restrictions on this in the public interest. Article 304 allows state legislatures to impose taxes on goods from other states provided those locally sourced face the same levies. This article also empowers state legislatures to impose curbs on the freedom of trade as needed in the public interest.
The government is relying on Supreme Court judgements such as the one in Atiabari Tea Co. Ltd versus the state of Assam and others to bolster its bid to free up interstate trade. "Free movement and exchange of goods throughout the territory of India is essential for the economy of the nation and for sustaining and improving living standards of the country," the top court has said.

Petrol  diesel rates likely to be cut by Re 1 this weekendPetrol, diesel rates likely to be cut by Re 1 this weekend
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: November 12, 2014  | 15:24 IST

Petrol and diesel prices are likely to be cut by close to Re 1 per litre this weekend on sliding global oil rates.
This would be the seventh reduction in petrol prices since August and the third in rates of diesel since its decontrol in October.
State-owned fuel retailers Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corp (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp (HPCL) following the fortnightly review practice, are due to revise rates of petrol and diesel on Saturday.
In all probability, rates will be reduced if the current trend of declining international oil prices continue, industry sources said.
Petrol price was last cut by Rs 2.41 a litre on November 1. On the same day, diesel rates were reduced by Rs 2.25 per litre.
A litre of petrol in Delhi today costs Rs 64.25 a litre. Since August, petrol price has been cumulatively cut by Rs 9.36 per litre.
Diesel price was for the first time in more than five years cut on October 19 by Rs 3.37 a litre when the government decided to deregulated the fuel. This was followed by another cut on November 1 and diesel currently costs Rs 53.35 a litre in Delhi.
Prior to the October 19 reduction, diesel rates were previously cut in January 2009.
Sources said oil firms revise rates of petrol, which was deregulated in June 2010, and diesel on 1st and 16th of every month based on average international oil price and rupee-US dollar exchange rate.
Brent crude fell for a third day amid signs that OPEC members are reluctant to reduce supply even as prices slumped deeper into a bear market. It declined by 82 cents to $80.85 per barrel. Brent has lost almost 30 per cent since its June peak amid speculation that global supply is outpacing demand.

Obama  Xi play down points of tension; highlight areas of agreement on climate changeU.S. President Barack Obama, left, and Chinese President Xi Jinping, right, speak during a joint news conference at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, Wednesday, Nov. 12, 2014. (Source: AP)
By: Associated Press | Beijing | Posted: November 12, 2014 1:02 pm
US President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping sought to play down points of tension between their two nations Wednesday, unveiling a flurry of agreements on climate change, military cooperation and trade, while casting their own burgeoning relationship as candid and productive.
Yet areas of discord between the world’s largest economies still bubbled to the surface. Obama pressed Xi on human rights and the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, while Xi repeatedly reminded his American guest that his nation wants to be seen as an equal to the United States.
“I believe that President Xi and I have a common understanding on how the relationship between our two countries should move forward,” Obama said as he closed a three-day trip to China. “Where we have disagreements, we will be candid about our intentions, and we will work to narrow those differences where possible.”
The two leaders addressed reporters in a rare joint news conference for the Chinese leader, whose government keeps tight control on media in the country. Xi first appeared to ignore a question posed to him from an American reporter who asked about restrictions placed on U.S. news organizations operating in the country, then later suggested it was unfavorable coverage that had led to the crackdowns.
Obama has made significant personal investments in his relationship with Xi, including a two-day summit at a California estate last year. U.S. officials have seen Xi as a potentially new kind of Chinese leader, with closer ties to the U.S. than other Chinese officials — he spent time in Iowa as an exchange student — and an ease with public appearances that eluded his predecessor, Hu Jintao.
Yet Xi has consolidated power since taking office, deepened China’s provocative maritime disputes with its neighbors and stands accused of continuing cyberattacks against the United States. U.S. officials have new concerns over the potential for a crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong and are warily watching Beijing strengthen ties with Moscow as the West distances itself from Russia.
For its part, Beijing remains skeptical of Obama’s intentions in Asia, seeing his efforts to bolster U.S. economic ties in the region as a way of countering China’s rise. Obama’s domestic political weakness, particularly following the Democrats’ defeats in last week’s midterm elections, has also sparked questions in China about whether the U.S. president can deliver on potential international agreements.

Shah Rukh Khan says he will certainly attend Salman s sister Arpita Khan s weddingPrint
Shah Rukh Khan on attending Arpita Khan's wedding: "Inshallah… She's like my sister. I have seen her from childhood… So, most certainly. There's no question about that."
Written by Sunitra Pacheco , Edited by Sarika Sharma | Mumbai | Posted: November 12, 2014 12:36 pm | Updated: November 12, 2014 4:50 pm
Salman Khan, who is going all out when it comes to celebrating his youngest sister Arpita Khan’s wedding to Delhi-based fiancé Aayush Sharma, recently extended an invitation to frenemy Shah Rukh Khan.
But, whether SRK would attend the wedding or not was the big question. At a recent Children’s day celebration in Mumbai on Tuesday (November 11), Shah Rukh Khan was asked on his plans to attend the wedding. “Inshallah… She’s like my sister. I have seen her from childhood… So, most certainly. There’s no question about that,” said the actor.
On being asked about the wedding, Shah Rukh Khan further added, “I do not know whether I have got the invite or not. Haven’t gone home but Rishta aisa hai ki mujhe invite ki zaroorat nahin hai.” (Our relationship is so deep that I don’t need an invite).
The Khan family is barring no expense when it comes to seeing their youngest daughter tie the knot. The pre-wedding rituals will begin on November 16 and the main wedding ceremony will be held at Falaknuma Palace on November 18 in Hyderabad. The cost of the venue is said to be a crore per day and Salman’s family is shelling out two crores on it alone.
A splendid wedding reception has been planned for November 21, which is said to host the country’s crème de la crème, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Bollywood personalities like Aamir Khan, Ajay Devgn, Akshay Kumar, Karan Johar, Kareena Kapoor Khan, Subhash Ghai and many others.
From down South, Kamal Haasan, Vijay, Chiranjeevi, Venkatesh, Suresh Babu are expected to attend the ceremony. Interestingly, the groom’s side has invited Sonia Gandhi to the wedding along with Rahul Gandhi and Himachal Pradesh governor with the entire state cabinet as Aayush happens to be the grandson of former telecommunications minister Sukh Ram and younger son of Himachal Pradesh cabinet minister Anil Sharma.

World Pneumonia Day: India still struggles with pneumonia and diarrhea deaths  says reportPrint
Written by Anuradha Mascarenhas | Pune | Posted: November 12, 2014 1:14 pm
The 2014 Pneumonia and Diarrhea Progress Report, released today by the International Vaccine Access Center (IVAC) at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, highlights India’s persisting burden of pneumonia and diarrhea, but notes marginal progress toward improving coverage of life-saving interventions to prevent child deaths and those suffering from these diseases. As per the latest estimates from UNICEF, pneumonia and diarrhea collectively claimed more than 300,000 children in 2013.
According to the annual report, India ranks third lowest compared to the 15 other high burden countries for its Global Action Plan for Pneumonia and Diarrhea (GAPPD) score – a calculated average of coverage levels for the vital pneumonia and diarrhea interventions outlined in the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF’s integrated GAPPD for which data are available, including vaccination, exclusive breastfeeding, access to care, and use of antibiotics, oral rehydration solution (ORS), and zinc. However, the report also notes that India is in a position to improve its ranking following the recent commitments it has made toward access to child health interventions.
“In India, pneumonia and diarrhea have been a health challenge for very long time,” said Dr. V K Paul, Head of Pediatrics at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). “It is heartening to see that the government has started intensifying strategies to combat these diseases through various interventions. This includes the government’s decision to introduce the pentavalent vaccine against Hib pneumonia and meningitis in an additional 11 states, introduce rotavirus vaccines for diarrhea in its routine immunization program, and step up the measles vaccination program. However, as the report suggests, we need to move faster to save many more lives of our Indian children. In particular, there is a need to raise the coverage of pneumonia treatment in the community”.
For the first time, the report also includes a subnational analysis for India. A total of 27 states in India for which data were available were ranked based on their GAPPD score. Of these, Goa performed the best and Meghalaya the worst. The analysis also revealed high levels of inequities in access to interventions between urban and rural regions within states.
This year’s Pneumonia and Diarrhea Progress Report takes a special look within two large and high-burden countries, India and Nigeria, to identify inequities in coverage levels that exist between states. The Ministry of Health & Family Welfare has demonstrated its commitment to the integrated approach outlined in GAPPD through several recent efforts, including a workshop on “Integrated Approaches for Prevention and Management of Pneumonia and Diarrhea for achievement of MDG 4,” held in October with WHO in Delhi, and the Intensified Diarrhoea Control Fortnight launched in August. New scorecards are also being developed to better evaluate India’s progress on these indicators at the state- and district-level, though more and better data is needed.
“The recent decision by the Union Government to introduce three new childhood vaccines in the Universal Immunization Programme (UIP), including vaccines against rotavirus, rubella, polio (injectable), is a clear indication of the government’s commitment,” said continued…

Expect Nifty to breach 8 500 in the near termYou are here: Home > Collections > Opec
Here’s why crude prices may be nearing the bottom

(Low prices may induce countries…)
The demand-supply equation, which was pushing global crude oil prices higher in the first half of 2014, has gone awry, with Saudi Arabia aggressively expanding output in a bid to maintain market share rather than cutting it to support prices as it had done for many years. Saudi Arabia's aggressive stance stems from its bad experience in late 80s, when its production cuts to support oil prices helped other countries — including its Opec colleagues — make a killing, while it suffered 16 years of budget deficits.
Thus, it's safe to assume that Saudi Arabia, as well as Opec, are unlikely to cut output in the near future. On the other hand, low prices may induce countries which are largely dependent on oil revenues, to increase production to the extent possible to balance their internal budgets. The most severe impact of low oil prices will be on unconventional oil producers, such as shale oil in the US and tar sands in Canada due to their high cost of production.
According to International Energy Agency , more than 20% of global crude output in 2013 was unconventional, which is expected to reach 33% by 2035. According to various estimates, about a third of the US daily shale oil production of 6.5 million barrel turns uneconomical if the oil price is below $80 a barrel. The price level is regarded as the bottom for Brent, the international oil maker. A recent Goldman Sachs report forecasts Brent hitting a floor of $80 a barrel in the second quarter of 2015, then rising to $90 in 2016 as US shale oil production slows down.

List of good intentions
air transport
As many of his predecessors have done, Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju has unveiled another draft aviation policy , which he hopes to implement by next year. It is more of a broad statement of intent, without going into the specifics. Mr. Raju has touched upon all the major issues and problems faced by the sector, but has not exactly come up with solutions. It may not be fair to expect the Minister to just wave a magic wand and resolve all the issues that have plagued the aviation sector over the decades. But this is perhaps the best time for the NDA government and Mr. Raju to take some bold initiatives and address all the pending problems. New airlines are coming into being and people are realising the benefits of air travel, but there are several major obstacles for the airlines to grow and be profitable. What takes the cake is the announcement of yet another committee or panel to look afresh at the future of Air India, which has remained the country’s big white elephant for too long. Something drastic needs to be done, and done quickly, before crores of rupees of public money go down the drain. Given its condition, there can be no suitors for a strategic partnership, and listing it on the stock exchange may end up as a disaster. The government has to make up its mind about privatisation, sooner than later.
The need of the hour remains the growth and development of airports. While Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Bengaluru have shown the way on PPP models, the Airports Authority of India’s (AAI) projects in Kolkata and Chennai have been disasters. The Aviation Ministry has to set this right and get a private partner to redeem these airports, besides strengthening and developing smaller airports for the existing and new airlines to operate. The ravaged Visakhapatnam airport and a ‘real’ airport for Vijayawada must be at the top of his priorities. The AAI may be a profitable enterprise, but it needs to be corporatised and restructured in order to make it efficient. As far as the airlines are concerned, the cost of Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF) is the major concern, as it contributes to over 40 per cent of the cost of operations. The recent drop in global crude prices and consequently of ATF provides some relief. But Mr. Raju has to work with the Finance Ministry and the State governments to rationalise taxes, basically VAT, to reduce the burden. The advent of GST may solve this problem, as and when it comes into being. Since the Minister has promised to firm up the policy by January and get it through the Cabinet, the civil aviation sector as a whole hopes that he will work on the specifics and come up with a time-bound, implementable framework that will not only help all segments of the aviation business but also protect the interests of passengers.

Technocrat Ministers in Modi Cabinet Add Fresh Legs to Market Rally
NDTV | Written By: Varun Sinha | Updated On: November 12, 2014 15:07 (IST)
TCS, Infosys, 4 Others Lose Rs 54,053 Crore in Market Value
The Cabinet expansion on Sunday seems to have added fresh legs to the market rally, with both the Sensex and Nifty hitting fresh highs this week. The Nifty scaled the key 8,400 mark today, while the Sensex is firmly above 28,000.
The gains over the last two days have come despite a slowdown in foreign flows. FIIs bought cash shares worth nearly Rs 800 crore on Monday and Tuesday as compared to net purchases of over Rs 3,500 on Thursday and Friday. Domestic investors have been net sellers in equities (Rs 800 crore) over last two days.
Here are the reasons why markets are excited about the Cabinet expansion:
1) Induction of technocrats: Sonal Varma and Aman Mohunta of Nomura say, "The inclusion of technocrats is another dose of energy and fresh perspective in the Modi government and should help further push its development agenda." The technocrat-turned politicians who were recently induced into the Cabinet are,
a) Suresh Prabhu, a chartered accountant by profession, has been entrusted with the railway ministry. Investors believe his induction will boost investment in railway infrastructure, a sector where the Modi government recently permitted 100 per cent FDI. Railway stocks have rallied sharply after the appointment of the new minister.
b) Manohar Parrikar, an IITian, has got the charge of the defence ministry. Known for his clean image and honest administration, Mr Parrikar is expected fast-track defence deals and weed out corruption in contracts. His appointment has led to gains in defence-related stocks such as BEL (up over 10 per cent since Thursday).
c) Jayant Sinha, an IITian and MBA from Harvard Business School, has been appointed as the minister of state of finance. Analysts say his appointment completes Finance Minister Arun Jaitley's crack team that will draft the upcoming Budget. "Given his experience in the global financial industry, his appointment should bring in fresh and a pro-market perspective in the ministry of finance," Nomura says. Investors are hoping for bold decisions on the economy in the Budget.
2) Better focus in key ministries: Mr Jaitley had run both defence and finance since PM Modi took office six months ago, leading to criticism that neither of the key departments could be properly given due attention. With a heavy portfolio like defence off his back, Mr Jaitley will have more time to helm the crucial finance ministry. Rana Kapoor, president of industry body Assocham, says the fact that some of the key portfolios will now have full-time Cabinet minister will provide speed to the decision making in important sectors of the economy.
3) More reforms: The appointment of a full-time minister (Rajiv Pratap Rudy) to the skill development and entrepreneurship ministry is consistent with Mr. Modi's focus on the manufacturing sector. Ajay Shriram, president of CII, says the Cabinet expansion sends out a strong signal that the government is serious about accelerating the reforms process.
The Sensex and Nifty have rallied over 30 per cent year-to-date as the government has taken a series of steps to make life easier for businesses and has reduced subsidies on fuel, but investment in the economy has not picked up, and industrial output is flat. ( Read the full story here )
PM Modi's Cabinet expansion may have proved to be a short-term trigger for the markets, but the rally will sustain only if the government continues working towards attracting investments and pushing bold reforms, analysts say.

Bharti Infratel Seeks to Buy Vodafone, Idea Towers in 7 Circles
Press Trust of India | Updated On: November 12, 2014 14:57 (IST)
Buying Iron Ore for First Time in History, Says Tata Steel
Mumbai: Mobile company Bharti Infratel has approached Vodafone and Idea Cellular to buy their mobile towers in seven out of 22 telecom circles in India, a top official of the company said on Wednesday.
"I have made it very clear to Vodafone and Idea Cellular that we are interested in buying their towers in seven circles where Bharti Infratel is sole operator and Indus doesn't operate," Bharti Infratel executive chairman Akhil Gupta said on sidelines of an event here.
Infratel has over 36,381 standalone mobile towers spread across 18 states under 11 telecom circles.
The company also has a 42 per cent stake in Indus Towers – a joint venture between Bharti Infratel, Vodafone and Aditya Birla Telecom.
The states where Bharti Infratel has no overlapping business with Indus include Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Chattisgarh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, Assam and North Eastern states. These states jointly come under 7 telecom circles.
"We are waiting for them to come back. If at all they are ready we will be certainly pursuing the matter," Mr Gupta added.
As of 2:36 p.m., shares in Bharti Infratel were trading at Rs 289.85 apiece on the BSE, down 0.12 per cent from the previous close.

Ghost city  Nay Pyi Taw is Myanmar s showpiece at ASEANPrint

Written by Anil Sasi | Nay Pyi Taw | Posted: November 12, 2014 3:18 pm | Updated: November 12, 2014 3:26 pm
The 25th ASEAN Summit that got underway in Myanmar’s capital on Wednesday is being termed a historic moment for the bloc of 10 nations, with its secretary-general Le Luong Minh terming it “the most important turning year deciding the achievement of the Asean Community”. One of the key reasons why the ASEAN and East Asia Summits and the related meetings are relevant is because there is barely a year to go before the member states launch an ASEAN Community, including the Asean Economic Community that aims for greater economic integration and freer movement of resources.
Myanmar has deployed an estimated 20,000 police personnel to secure the Summit, according to official estimates released in the run-up to the event. The ASEAN Summit is happening at the Myanmar International Convention Centre in Nay Pyi Taw, where a number of foreign leaders are coming in for the summit and the East Asia summit the following day, to be attended by 16 regional countries as well as Russia and the United States. Apart from the regular restrictions at entry points, passengers on highway buses are being thoroughly checked.
Myanmar is the rotating chair of ASEAN this year for the first time after joining the group in July 1997. The security cordon around the capital is so tight that about 20 per cent of Myanmar Police Force is now deployed in ensuring security in Nay Pyi Taw. The authorities have already designated Myanmar International Convention Centre-MICC1 and the State’s guest houses, the venues of the summit, as limited zones in Nay Pyi Taw.
In terms of sheer planning and execution of a Greenfield project, Myanmar’s capital Nay Pyi Taw would put any Indian city to shame. Ridiculed sometimes as the ‘ghost capital’, the capital city has a short history, having been founded on a malaria-infested shrubland, 3 kilometres west of the country’s logging town and sugarcane refinery center of Pyinmana, and approximately 320 kilometres north of the previous capital of Yangon.
Construction started in 2002 and the administrative capital was officially moved to the militarised
greenfield site on November 6, 2005. Nay Pyi Taw is generally translated as “royal capital”or the “seat of the king”, the name literally means “royal city of the sun” in Burmese.
The city is organised into a number of zones. The residential areas are segregated and organized, with apartments allotted according to rank and marital status. The roofs of apartment buildings are color-coded by the jobs of their residents. But many of the city’s residents, however, live in slums on the outskirts.
Then there’s a military zone, where military officers live in a restricted zone away from regular government employees in a complex continued…

Tough to make money in this market: Analystbull market
In a chat with ET Now, Mehraboon Irani, Principal & Head-Private Client Group Business, Nirmal Bang Securities, shares his views on the markets. Edited Excerpts:
ET Now: What are you doing now at 8380-8400? We hit 8400 today. What do you do now? Are you in the buy mode as yet? Are you advising clients to still buy?
Mehraboon Irani: We are contine to be investor in equities. It is becoming a very difficult market to sell because you sell and the stock goes up. I know for sure that lot of people are on the sidelines. We continue to get inflows of money from our HNI clients who want to invest more and more. There is an appetite for stocks. Every day you have some or the other announcements coming from the government. The mood is and should remain upbeat. The global consensus have abated right now. If the market goes up further, I will not be surprised. If you take a last high the markets made in September and October we went up and then we fell sharply. People started talking of much lower levels. The market surprised us by going up again. If you compare this present high with the previous high of September, 47 per cent of the stocks listed on the markets are quoting 0 per cent to 20 per cent lower than where they were. Money making is not going to be very easy. The first leg of the bull market one fends stocks going up and others catch up.
Quite a few stocks have gone up on valuations at the moment which are absolutely rich but not justified. The point is you chase momentum, you make money in the short term. But, if you are buying the wrong stock and feel great for making money in the short term, years later the stocks could be much lower than where they are today. It is a stock pickers market from now on. It is not going to be easy though we continue to be in a bull market.In the short term I do not see any turmoil happening.

Gold prices soared by Rs 400 to Rs 26,450 per 10 grams in the national capital on Wednesday on emergence of buying by jewellers and retailers on the back of ongoing wedding season demand and firming global cues.
In the national capital, gold of 99.9 and 99.5 per cent purity shot up by Rs 400 each to Rs 26,450 and Rs 26,250 per 10 grams, respectively. The yellow metal had lost Rs 400 in the past two days.
Bullion traders said besides ongoing wedding season demand, a firm global trend as the weakening in dollar revived the appeal of the metal as an alternative investment, mainly boosted trading sentiment.
Gold in New York, which normally sets price trend in the domestic commodity market , gained 0.3 per cent to US $1,163 an ounce in Tuesday's trade.
Sovereign, however, held steady at Rs 23,700 per piece of eight grams.
On similar lines, silver also recovered by Rs 350 to Rs 35,500 per kg on increased offtake by industrial units and coin makers.
Silver ready recovered by Rs 350 to Rs 35,500 per kg and weekly-based delivery by Rs 110 to Rs 34,600 per kg.
On the other hand, silver coins ruled flat at Rs 58,000 for buying and Rs 59,000 for selling of 100 pieces.

Happy New Year  box office collections beat Salman s  Ek Tha TigerIndia's communication satellite GSAT-16 launched successfully
Shah Rukh Khan and Deepika Padukone starrer ‘Happy New Year’ box office collections have made a joyous entry into the Rs 200 crore blockbuster club. Though the film, into the third week since release, saw a fall in ticket collections to an all-time low of about Rs 75 lakh on Tuesday, the overall domestic business has been reported at over Rs 200 crore.
This makes ‘Happy New Year’ the 6th biggest all-time grosser in Bollywood, more than Salman Khan’s ‘Ek Tha Tiger’ at Rs 198.78 crore. The only Hindi movie with an A-list star cast that released this Diwali, ‘HNY’ will probably overtake lifetime collections of Aamir Khan-starrer ‘3 Idiots’, which made Rs 202.47 crore, but it is unlikely that SRK’s latest will manage to beat his earlier release ‘Chennai Express’ (Rs 227.13 crore).
‘Happy New Year’ box office collections now only behind Salman Khan’s ‘Kick’ (Rs 231.85 crore) among the 2014 releases.
The film, which raked in the moolah on craze and the hype that was generated in terms of promotions, publicity, smart planning, as well as timing, made Rs 100-plus crore within just three days of its release.
In terms of overseas business, the heist-dance extravaganza has been making good money because of the huge fan base of Shah Rukh Khan.
According to Koimoi, the just the film’s business in international market is over Rs 80 crore.

The BSE Sensex today closed above the 28,000-mark for the first time and the Nifty touched 8,400-level with sustained buying by foreign funds in auto, banking, FMCG and consumer durable stocks amid hopes of easing inflation and encouraging IIP numbers.
Continuing its surge for the third day, the BSE Sensex hit fresh life-time high of 28,126.48. After paring some gains, the 30-share index settled at an all-time closing high of 28,008.90, up by 98.84 points, or 0.35 per cent, over the previous close. It surpassed the earlier record closing of 27,915.88 touched on November 5.
The gauge had gained 41.43 points in the previous two sessions.
It took 45 trading sessions from September 2 to November 12 to reach the psychological 28,000-level from 27,000.
The NSE Nifty crossed the key 8,400-mark for the first time to hit an all-time high of 8,415.05, breaching its earlier record of 8,383.05 on November 10.
However, some profit-booking at record levels trimmed part of gains but the Nifty ended at a new record high of 8,383.30, up 20.65 points. It surpassed its previous closing peak of 8,362.65 in yesterday’s trade.
A host of positive developments on domestic as well as global fronts buoyed the market and lifted key indices to new highs.
Brokers said sentiment remained positive and foreign funds continued their buying spree on the domestic bourses and retail investors enlarged positions amid strong quarterly earnings posted by blue-chip companies and hopes of further push to economic reforms by the Centre after the recent Cabinet reshuffle.
Further, expectations of encouraging economic data such as inflation for October and IIP numbers for September, to be released after market hours today, buoyed trading sentiments, they said.
Meanwhile, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) remained the main driving force behind the current bull-run. FPIs bought shares worth a net Rs 458.04 crore yesterday, according to provisional data from the stock exchanges.
Sensex components which supported the key indices to hit fresh life-time high were Axis Bank (3.02 pc), Bajaj Auto (2.10 pc), HDFC Ltd (1.12 pc), SBI (0.17 pc), ICICI Bank (1.33 pc), HDFC Bank (0.44 pc), ITC Ltd (1.55 pc), Bharti Airtel (0.64 pc), BHEL (0.88 pc), Coal India (0.10 pc), Dr Reddy (0.58 pc), Hero MotoCorp (1.50 pc), Tata Motors (1.71 pc) and TCS (0.55 pc).
Sectorwise, BSE Auto index gained the most by rising 1.18 per cent, followed by Bank index 1.12 per cent, FMCG 0.96 per cent and Consumer Durables index 0.55 per cent.
Buying activity in small and midcap also gathered momentum, with the BSE midcap index rising by 0.47 per cent and smallcap index by 0.20 per cent.

Bombs hit Libyan city housing elected parliamentFile Photo (Source: AP)
By: Associated Press | Cairo | Posted: November 12, 2014 5:07 pm
A Libyan army spokesman says two car bombs have gone off in the eastern city of Tobruk, where the nation’s elected parliament is temporarily located, causing casualties.
Mohammed Hegazi says the bombs exploded in front of an oil institute early Wednesday but that it was not immediately clear how many people were killed.
He says the attack meant to “terrorise” state institutions and the parliament, as well as deliver a “we are here” message from militants.
Hegazi says the blasts have the hallmarks of extremists from the eastern city of Darna who have pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group.
Libya’s elected parliament was forced to relocate to the far-eastern city of Tobruk after Islamist-allied militias took over the country’s capital, Tripoli, and the second-largest city of Benghazi.

Absence of treaties with tax havens blocking black moneyAbsence of treaties with tax haven nations blocking black money, say agencies
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: November 12, 2014  | 19:46 IST
(Photo: Reuters)
Absence of criminal legal treaties between the country and tax haven nations have been cited by probe agencies working in the SIT on black money as one of the major impediments in initiating steps to bring back unaccounted wealth stashed abroad by Indians.
The agencies, including the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED), have made these challenges known to the SIT in a report after which the high-powered panel has begun preparing an action plan to be communicated to the government for action in this regard, official sources said.
The report, accessed by PTI, says at present the government has 37 Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties or Multilateral Assistance Treaties with about 37 countries which does not include "many of the tax havens like Cayman Islands, Guernsey, Lichtenstein, Monaco, Bermuda, Malta, British Virgin Islands and others" where a number of suspect black money probes are being conducted by domestic investigative agencies.
"The Special Investigation Team on black money is expected to soon send a report to the government in this regard with a request to ink MLATs with tax haven nations and all other jurisdictions important from the point of financial and tax evasion investigations," sources privy to the development said.
To impress upon the difficulty faced by agencies the report cited two incidents of 2013, where tax sleuths were not able to "attach and recover the money in foreign bank accounts in the UK and Singapore through the Ministry of Home Affairs and CBI" as the existing treaties like Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA), Tax Information Exchange Treaty (TIEA) and those framed by global economic body OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) were not helpful.
These treaties, sources said, provide for only collection of documents and does help in attachment or restraint of funds or assets of a suspect black money holder to the country.
"Thus, in a number of black money cases the Indian agencies are not being able to recover or repatriate these funds lying in foreign countries or bank accounts abroad for recovery of tax demands under domestic laws," they said.
When such cases are under investigation there is no tax demand raised on them or penalty notices issued by a court and hence Indian agencies are not able to lay their hands on such suspected offenders.
"The MLAT does not need this. If there is convincing proof, Indian agencies can block these funds or accounts easily," the sources said.
The report also said, "Most of the tax haven countries - where most of the foreign funds of Indians are reported or alleged to be stashed - have not ratified or brought into force the Multilateral Convention of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)."
Hence, this instrument is also not helpful for the government in such cases even as the clamour to get back black money is being made for long now, they said.
"The SIT has been apprised about these developments and diplomatic channels will be activated to get the ratification of OECD framed treaties done by these countries on-board the model global convention," the sources said.
The SIT has been constituted by the Supreme Court and notified by the government with a specific purpose to unearth black money, curb its menace, strengthen mechanisms to check it and investigate all such cases where Indians have stashed illegal funds or assets overseas.
The panel, headed by retired Supreme Court judge MB Shah with justice (retd) Arijit Pasayat as its Vice-Chairman, has heads or officers of 11 central investigative and enforcement agencies on its board.

Reliance Infrastructure, a part of the Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group, has reported near flat net profit for the second quarter of this financial year, but indicated this could have been higher but for the loss on account of the Metro rail project in Mumbai.
The company said its net profit for the period under review was up 1 per cent at Rs 431 crore, but that the same was higher by 14 per cent at Rs 488 crore without taking into account the loss of Rs 57 crore on the metro project during the quarter.
Nevertheless, it said the consolidated net worth stood at Rs 28,040 crore ($2.5 billion) translating into a book value of Rs 1,068 per share at the end of the quarter ended September 30.
Among the other highlights, the company launched its cement in six states with a capacity of 5.8 million tonnes per annum, even as 77,500 new customers were added in the metros of Delhi and Mumbai in the second quarter.
In addition, the electricity tariff regulator in Delhi has approved a hike of 8.3 per cent for Reliance Infrastructure and approved the recovery of Rs 2,100 crore in arrears, including the carrying cost of power.
The company maintains its lead as being the largest private sector distributor of power in the country, serving 6.4 million customers.
Reliance Infrastructure reported its results after the close of trading hours. Shares of the company closed Wednesday at Rs 636.95, down 0.99 per cent.

Rupee closes 4 paise higher against dollarForex Update: Rupee closes 4 paise higher against dollar at 61.51 on fresh dollar selling

The rupee ended higher by four paise to 61.51 against the American currency on fresh selling of dollars by banks and exporters in view of persistent foreign capital inflows into equity market.
Banks and exporters preferred to reduce their dollar position on expectation of further foreign capital inflows in view of rising trend in the equity market.
The Indian benchmark Sensex rose further by 98.84 points or 0.35 per cent to close at 28,008.90 after touching an lifetime high of 28,126.48.
The rupee resumed higher at 61.53 per dollar as against the Tuesday's closing level of 61.55 at the Interbank Foreign Exchange (Forex) Market and hovered in a range of 61.46 per dollar and 61.56 per dollar before ending at 61.51 per dollar, showing a gain of 4 paise or 0.07 per cent.
In London, the yen pulled back from a seven-year low against the dollar in the early trade, after comments from a Japanese government official cooled speculation that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will call a December election.
Mr. Pramit Brahmbhatt, Veracity Group CEO said," Rupee continues to trade range bound and ended near Tuesday's close at 61.51. Rupee is expected to appreciate further taking cues from the strong local equities which is trading all time high but importers will enter in the market to grab the advantage of appreciated Rupee which will keep Rupee under pressure".
In the forwards market, premium advanced further on sustained paying pressure from banks and corporates.
The benchmark six-month premium payable in April rose to 218-220 paise from previous close of 216.5-218.5 paise.
Far-forward contracts maturing in October, 2015 also moved up to 434.5-436.5 paise from 431-433 paise.
The Reserve Bank of India fixed the reference rate for dollar at 61.4785 and for the Euro at 76.7866.
The rupee firmed up further against the pound to 97.55 from previous closing level of 97.64 but slipped to 76.74 per euro from 76.45 per euro previously.
It fell to 53.41 per 100 Japanese yen from Tuesday's level of 53.14.

Regulators slap USD 3.4 bn fine on HSBC Bank  4 othersDanica Kirka and Marcy Gordon     London   Last Updated: November 12, 2014  | 19:00 IST

US, British and Swiss regulators have fined five global banks $3.4 billion for attempting to manipulate foreign exchange markets - the latest penalties for an industry previously criticised for rigging interest rates and for their role in triggering the global financial crisis.
The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the UK Financial Conduct Authority and the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority said on Wednesday that Citibank, JPMorgan Chase Bank, Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC Bank and UBS had agreed to settlements totaling almost $3.4 billion. The FCA said it is continuing to investigate Barclays Bank.
"Today's record fines mark the gravity of the failings we found, and firms need to take responsibility for putting it right," said Martin Wheatley, chief executive of the FCA. "They must make sure their traders do not game the system to boost profits."
Some $5.3 trillion changes hands every day on the global foreign exchange market, with 40 per cent of trades occurring in London. Currencies including dollars, pounds, euros and yen trade in the loosely regulated market dominated by a group of elite banks. But those trades have an even wider impact because companies around the world use market prices to value assets and manage currency risks.
The regulators found that between January 1, 2008 and October 15, 2013, the five banks failed to adequately train and supervise foreign currency traders. As a result, traders were able to form groups that shared information about client activity, using nicknames such as "the players, "the 3 musketeers" and "1team, 1 dream."
"Traders shared the information obtained through these groups to help them work out their trading strategies," the FCA said in a statement. "They then attempted to manipulate fix rates and trigger client 'stop loss' orders." Stop loss orders limit client losses in the face of adverse currency movements.
The traders tried to manipulate the market to ensure that their banks made a profit, the Financial Conduct Authority said.
"It is completely unacceptable ... for firms to engage in attempts at manipulation for their own benefit and to the potential detriment of certain clients and other market participants," the UK regulator said.
RBS Chairman Philip Hampton said the bank accepted the criticism and condemned the actions of the employees responsible.
"Today is a stark reminder of the importance of culture and integrity in banking and we will rightly be judged on the strength of our response," Hampton said in a statement.
RBS has started disciplinary action against six employees, three of whom have been suspended.
The Bank of England conducted a separate inquiry into the role of its officials in the foreign exchange market. The investigation by outside attorneys found no evidence that the central bank was involved in unlawful or improper behavior but it said its chief foreign exchange dealer was aware that traders were sharing information.
From at least November 28, 2012, the bank's chief dealer had concerns this could involve "collusive behavior," but failed to notify his superiors.
"This was an error of judgment for which he should be criticized," the investigator, Anthony Grabiner, said in his report. Grabiner stressed the dealer did not act in bad faith and was not involved in unlawful or improper behavior.
The US Department of Justice and other authorities are conducting their own investigations and further penalties are possible. Barclays said in a statement that "after discussions with other regulators and authorities," it decided to seek a more general coordinated settlement."
Regulators in Britain, Switzerland, the US and Asia have been investigating the banks' conduct for months, and negotiating settlements with the banks.
For their part, the banks already had factored in the prospect of heavy fines by putting money aside to cover the cost.
Citigroup took a $600 million charge while JPMorgan Chase & Co about $400 million. Barclays, HSBC and Royal Bank of Scotland similarly set aside hundreds of millions of dollars.
The foreign-exchange scandal again lifts the curtain on misconduct in the banking world and is the latest black eye for big international banks. Five big banks - including Britain's Lloyds, Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland - have been sanctioned for alleged manipulation of a key global interest rate in a continuing investigation. The five banks together have paid nearly $4 billion in settlements, and several individuals have been criminally charged by US authorities.
The London interbank offered rate, known as LIBOR, is used by banks to borrow from each other and affects trillions of dollars in contracts around the world, including mortgages, bonds and consumer loans.
Major Wall Street banks including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup have each paid billions of dollars in settlements with the Justice Department and other US agencies over their role in selling the toxic mortgage securities that fueled the worst financial crisis since the 1930s and threw millions of homes into foreclosure.

New era has dawned in India  says Narendra Modi  makes alliance pitch to ASEANFIPB role shrinks amid easier FDI flows
Asserting that there are “no irritants” in the India-ASEAN relationship, Prime Minister Narendra Modi today told ASEAN leaders that a new era of economic development, industrialisation and trade has begun in India and they can be “great partners” for each other.
As India seeks to deepen its engagement with the 10-nation bloc of small and medium economies, Modi said both India and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are keen to enhance their cooperation in advancing balance, peace and stability in the region.
“The ASEAN community is India’s neighbour. We have ancient relations of trade, religion, culture, art and traditions. We have enriched each other through our interaction. This constitutes a strong foundation of a modern relationship,” Modi said in his opening statement in Hindi at the 12th India-ASEAN summit in the Myanmarese capital.
“That is why our world view is similar in many respects; our mutual confidence and trust is strong. We have no irritants in our relationship. We see encouraging opportunities and challenges in the world in similar ways,” he said.
Observing that India and the ASEAN have been successful to a considerable extent in pursuing their dreams, Modi said they have laid a foundation for a strong and comprehensive strategic partnership.
“My government has been in office for six months and the intensity and momentum with which we have enhanced our engagement in the East, is a reflection of the priority that we give to this region,” the Prime Minister said at the summit held at the sprawling Myanmar International Convention Centre on the second day of his 10-day three-nation tour of Myanmar, Australia and Fiji.
“A new era of economic development, industrialisation and trade has begun in India. Externally, India’s ‘Look East Policy’ has become ‘Act East Policy’,” he said.
“Rapidly developing India and ASEAN can be great partners for each other. We are both keen to enhance our cooperation in advancing balance, peace and stability in the region,” the Prime Minister said.

Cong legislators disrupt Guv s address in Maha AssemblyPrint

By: Press Trust of India | Mumbai | Posted: November 12, 2014 6:48 pm | Updated: November 12, 2014 7:09 pm
Congress legislators in Maharashtra on Wednesday disrupted Governor Vidyasagar Rao’s Address to the joint session of the state legislature, protesting the manner in which the 13-day-old BJP government won the trust vote.
Congress MLAs shouted slogans like “Dadagiri nahin chalegi (no bullying tactics),” and “Governor go back” as Rao began his Address.
Raising slogans like “down with the minority  government,” the Congress legislators walked out before the Governor could complete his Address.
Earlier, Sena legislators tried to stop the Governor from entering the Vidhan Bhawan to deliver his Address, and handed over to him a memorandum complaining the “unconstitutional” manner in which the vote of confidence was passed earlier in the day.

The Congress legislators including former Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan squatted on the stairs of the Vidhan Bhawan building and blocked the Governor’s entry.
MPCC chief Manikrao Thakre said outside Vidhan Bhawan that no poll was taken during the trust vote today and it had become clear that the BJP government had trampled upon the Governor’s directives to have a vote of confidence.
The state Congress, soon after the trust vote, had sent a letter to the Governor requesting him not to deliver his Address to the joint session.
“The minority BJP government which has a strength of 123 MLAs when the majority mark is 145 was asked to prove majority in the House. But the motion was not put to vote. The BJP has not followed your directives and hence it is an unconstitutional government,” the letter said.
The party sought time from the Governor to explain the developments in the Legislative Assembly and said if the demand was not accepted it will resort to severe agitation.

Essar opens office in Geneva to expand Europe footprintLibby George and Nidhi Verma     London/New Delhi   Last Updated: November 12, 2014  | 20:27 IST

Essar Group has set up an office in Geneva to trade crude oil, refined petroleum products, coal, iron ore and steel, the head of the new company told Reuters on Wednesday.
The entity, PeaKom SA, began operations in September and will be a global trading platform for Essar, according to Chief Executive Gilles Sayer.
"At this stage, the company in Geneva will straddle all the commodity flows of Essar," Sayer said, adding it could grow beyond that. In an emailed statement, PeaKom said it will use its banking relationships and deal origination as a "one-stop-shop" for Essar commodities .
Sources said the office includes up to ten people, but Sayer declined to comment on the number of staff.
Raman Jaggi, group treasurer of Essar, will serve as PeaKom's chief financial officer, and Guillaume de la Ville, formerly of BNP Paribas and Gunvor, has started as head of trade finance. Tarun Naruka, Essar's former corporate finance lead and Thibaut BarthelmÃ©, formerly of CrÃ©dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, are also working with PeaKom.
The opening cements the company's involvement in Europe, bolstering a presence that already includes London-based traders and the 245,000 barrel per day (bpd) Stanlow refinery in the United Kingdom.
The expansion of Essar 's European operations indicate that it is looking to maintain a long-term presence in the region, which could be of comfort to staff at the Stanlow refinery in Britain who watched as the Milford Haven plant in Wales was shuttered last week.
Jobs at European refiners are at risk as analysts say more than 1 million bpd of refining capacity in Europe will close due to fierce competition from state-of-the-art refineries opening in the Middle-East and Asia.
The Stanlow refinery mothballed a crude distillation unit that accounted for one third of its production capacity in September in an effort to save the plant. Its capacity dropped to around 195,000 bpd from 296,000 as a result.

Iraq: 17 killed in bombings in and around BaghdadCivilians inspect the aftermath of a car bomb explosion in Sadr city, Baghdad. (Source: AP photo)
By: Associated Press | Baghdad | Posted: November 12, 2014 7:16 pm | Updated: November 12, 2014 7:45 pm
Suspected Sunni militants struck in and around Baghdad on Wednesday, killing 17 people including 11 soldiers and policemen, and injuring about 40 in three separate attacks, including two suicide bombings, according to police and hospital officials.
The largest of Wednesday’s attacks was in the turbulent Youssifiyah district south of Baghdad where a suicide car bomber hit an army checkpoint, killing six soldiers and injuring 16, including 10 civilians and six soldiers.
Earlier in Baghdad’s upscale Mansour district, a car bomb near a cluster of shops killed six civilians and wounded 13.
Minutes later, a suicide bomber blew himself up at the entrance of a nearby police station as officers were rushing out to the site of the first attack, killing five and injuring 10, all policemen.
The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak to the media.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attacks, but they all bore the hallmarks of the Islamic State group, whose fighters control about a third of the country after they blitzed across much of the north and west of Iraq this year.
Elsewhere in Iraq, government forces backed with Shiite militiamen are continuing to meet tough resistance from  Islamic State fighters in the refinery town of Beiji, a day after they pushed militants out of the town centre, a senior military official reached there by telephone said today.
The official said reinforcements have reached Beiji, 250 kilometres (155 miles) north of Baghdad, to protect areas of the town now under government control.
Booby-trapped houses and roadside bombs however were hindering their advance toward the northern and northwestern parts of the town, where Iraq’s largest refinery is located.
The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to brief reporters.
Lifting the siege of the refinery, which sits inside a sprawling complex whose capacity of some 320,000 barrels a day accounts for a quarter of Iraq’s refining capacity, was likely the next objective in the campaign to rid Beiji of the militants.
When fully retaken, the strategic town will likely be a base for a future push to take back Saddam Hussein’s hometown of Tikrit just to the south, one of the main prizes overrun by the extremists last summer.

The new threat to mom-and-popThe new threat to small businesses

A few years ago, a large event in Saskatoon usually meant more business for the Chaplin Country Bed and Breakfast in Saskatchewan, Canada. “I’m about 10 minutes out of the city, so when the city hotels and bed and breakfasts fill up, I would often get their overflow,” said owner Kathy Chaplin.

Borrow, don't buy
Sharing websites allow people to borrow everyday items, rather than purchase them. Here's how it works.
But those days are over. As the popularity of home-sharing website Airbnb has grown — a recent search found 48 listings in Saskatoon, ranging from $184 for an entire three-bedroom home to $41 to rent a couch in the owner’s living room (bring a sleeping bag and pillow) — Chaplin’s business has slowed down. She has seen her business drop by 30% in the last two years.
The peer-to-peer economy — think Lyft, Airbnb, Uber and Taskrabbit — has been hailed as a great way for people to buy and sell goods and services directly to each other and bypass large corporations. The person renting out a guest room or a seat in her car makes a little extra cash, and the buyer saves a bundle over what she’d pay for, say, a hotel or a car service. A win-win for little guys everywhere.

Or so it would initially appear. But it’s not just hotel and transportation moguls who are being disrupted — small innkeepers, cab drivers and other professionals are feeling the pinch as their friends and neighbours make extra spending money, charging far lower rates than the pros must bill to survive.
The veterans say that they are paying for taxes and licenses and abiding by regulations that their newbie competitors are able to avoid.
“There are a lot people out there for whom it's a full-time occupation and if they don't have enough clients they will be out on the street,” said University of London economist Guy Standing.

Contemplating career changes
In San Francisco, ride-sharing services like Uber, Lyft and Sidecar have decimated the taxi business. A report by the city’s Municipal Transportation Authority found a 65% drop in taxi rides from January 2012 to July 2014, largely attributed to the rise in ride-sharing.
For Barry Korengold, who has driven a cab for 33 years, the income drop has left him contemplating a career change.
“I don’t particularly appreciate having to think of another career when I’m in my 50s,” said Korengold, who has seen his income drop by 25% to 50% since January 2013.
The president of the San Francisco Cab Drivers Association, Korengold said many of his colleagues have been hit even harder.
“A lot of these people aren’t able to feed their families or pay their rent,” he said.
He scoffs at the idea that they could all go to work for Uber or Lyft. “It’s kind of like the Wal-Mart thing: They come in and put the small businesses out of business and then everyone has to go work for Wal-Mart,” he said.
Level playing field
The professionals affected by the app-enabled businesses say they aren’t opposed to competition. The problem, they say, is that the playing field isn’t level, as they are obeying regulations and paying expenses that the sideliners aren’t.
Korengold said that in his city, taxi medallions cost $250,000 and insurance runs between $8,000 to $10,000 a year. All of the city’s taxis must be hybrids or alternative-fuel vehicles, a roughly $10,000 added cost ride-share drivers aren’t required to incur.

Hoda Mohtar, who owns Les Diplomates Executive Suites, a bed and breakfast in Waterloo, Ontario, said in addition to paying 13% in taxes, she pays to have her four-room inn accredited and inspected regularly. She also pays CAD$4,000 ($3,590) per year in agency fees — membership fees, listings, inspections, conferences — and about CAD$1,400  ($1,250) in insurance.
“We do everything by the book and others are just opening shop,” said Mohtar. “I don’t want to stop anyone from making money in the shared economy. But for them to not pay taxes, not to be legislated, not to be inspected -- that’s dangerous.”
Several Saskatoon Airbnb hosts were contacted for this story, but declined to be interviewed or did not return queries before publication. For many who list their spare rooms or homes on sites like Airbnb, the money they make has supplemented their incomes or provided extra spending money, as a BBC Capital story found earlier this year.
Debbie Judt, owner of Glacier Park B&B in Saskatoon, shares her colleagues’ concern that some Airbnb owners might not be paying taxes, though she stresses that she doesn’t know what her neighbours are doing and doesn’t have a problem with the site — in fact, about 5% of her business comes through her listing on Airbnb.
“I wanted to be exposed to one of the biggest listing sites in the world because it’s huge,” she said.
Municipalities start to adapt
Eric Brousseau, a professor of economics and management at the University Paris-Dauphine, said the sharing economy is still in its infancy, but believes regulation will eventually catch up. He notes that when French farmers first began opening bed and breakfasts, they could do as they pleased. But now these inns are subject to regulations and standards like any hotel.
“I think by the end you will have control of entry of the market just because it’s needed,” Brousseau said. That could mean everything from inspections to permit requirements to more rigorous tax-collection and professional standards.
That is starting to happen, as regulators are cracking down on both ride- and home-sharing. In the US, New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman issued a report stating that 72% of Airbnb rentals in New York City are illegal, violating zoning or other laws (short-term hotel stays must abide by more stringent regulations than those offering long-term rentals).
In San Francisco and Portland, Oregon, Airbnb now collects occupancy taxes for its hosts after housing advocates and neighbourhood groups pressed for stricter legislation. In Spain, Uber drivers caught taking passengers without professional licenses face fines of up to 18,000 euros ($22,500). And, after a German court banned UberPop in Berlin and Hamburg, the ride share company dropped its fare to 0.35 euros (44 cents). A subsequent ruling permitted UberPop drivers to continue because officials believed those fares could only cover the driver’s cost of operating the car and not yield a profit. In other words, they truly have to be sharing.
Fundamental shift
But Standing believes there is a larger problem: we are now seeing a fundamental shift in the way employment is handled around the globe. He notes that in the past, professionals of all stripes — be they cab drivers or attorneys — regulated their own industries by setting standards, pay rates, training systems, and the like.
“Those old models of the guilds that lived for hundreds of years have gradually been turned over to being run by commercial interests,” said Standing, who notes that outsourcing firms have been auctioning employment, from telemarketing to accounting, to the lowest bidder on the global marketplace for years.
The problem isn’t new to creative professionals — writers, photographers, disc jockeys — who have seen technology-enabled amateurs drive down prices during the past decade.
During the early 2000s, British sports photographer Gareth Jones made a nice living taking pictures at rugby matches and other sporting events in Reading, Berkshire, garnering enough work to contract out to four other photographers.
Things began to change around 2007, when photo-sharing sites coupled with lower cost of cameras and higher quality equipment flooded the market with the work of hobbyists willing to sell their photos for very little — or nothing at all — or post them on public websites for anyone to use.
“Say it was a rugby match. They would take a hundred photographs and two are okay. People are happy with that. It’s not perfect, but it’s good enough,” he said.
After Jones saw his business drop significantly, he realised he had to make some changes. He now shoots events that require a higher degree of skill, like gymnastics competitions and bicycle races.
Jones can offer shots that less-skilled competitors cannot due to their lack of technical skill and training.
“That’s hopefully what separates the professional from the well-meaning amateur,” he said.
At any rate, Jones bears no grudge. “You can’t stop things like that,” he said. “Sometimes it’s better to embrace it.”

Pickup in Industrial Output, Cooling Inflation Brighten India Outlook
Reuters | Updated On: November 12, 2014 20:18 (IST)
More Steps to Rationalise Subsidies on Anvil: Arun Jaitley
New Delhi: India's economic outlook brightened on Wednesday with a surprise pickup in industrial output and further cooling in consumer prices, data showed, boosting Prime Minister Narendra Modi's bid to end the longest slowdown in growth in decades.
Retail inflation, which the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) tracks in setting lending rates, slowed to 5.52 per cent in October from a multi-year low of 6.46 per cent a month earlier, helped by slower annual rises in food and fuel prices.
Industrial output unexpectedly grew 2.5 per cent year on year in September, its fastest pace in three months, helped by a rebound in the capital goods sector, separate government data showed.
Wednesday's data is expected to bolster the outlook for Asia's third-largest economy which is recovering weakly from a two-year spell of sub-5 per cent growth.
Economic growth hit a 2-1/2 year-high of 5.7 per cent in the quarter to June, prompting some economists to predict 6 per cent growth for the fiscal year to March 2015, higher than 5.5 per cent projected by the apex bank.
But lacklustre industrial production since then has led some to trim their more optimistic projections.
Cooling prices will intensify pressure on the RBI to cut interest rates to stimulate consumer demand which powers 60 per cent of the economy.
"A rate cut at this juncture will no doubt add to the existing positive growth impulses," said Prithviraj Srinivas, an economist with HSBC.
"But such a move would also increase the risk that the RBI misses its inflation target ... to return inflation back to the level last seen in the period between 1999 and 2005, when CPI inflation averaged just 4 per cent."
Worries that price pressures would revive once food prices pick up due to a weak monsoon and the fading of base effects led the RBI to leave one of Asia's highest lending rates on hold for a fourth straight meeting in September.
It is widely expected to maintain the status quo when it reviews monetary policy on December 2.
Slowing inflation, however, has bolstered hopes for a rate cut next year, triggering a rally in the bonds market.

Called  drunkards  in Half Girlfriend  Bihar royals set to sue Chetan BhagatCalled 'drunkards' in Half Girlfriend, Bihar royals set to sue Chetan Bhagat

Angry with Chetan Bhagat's allegedly uncharitable and 'factually incorrect' references to its members in his new book Half Girlfriend, the erstwhile royal family of Dumraon, in Buxar district of south-central Bihar, is set to sue the bestselling author.

"In the novel, members of my family have been described as drunkards. It has also been stated, erroneously so, that the erstwhile Dumraon estate has gone into bankruptcy," Yuvraj Chandra Vijay Singh of Dumraon told HT on Wednesday.
Singh's remarks came as protests against the book and its author continued for the third successive day in Dumraon, about 100 km west of state capital Patna.
The protests began on Monday when locals burnt an effigy of Bhagat and staged a demonstration against him and the the book for portraying Biharis in a poor light.
"In the novel, Biharis have been shown in the way that suggests they do not know English well, which, of course, is not true," said Ranjan Kumar, who was at the forefront of the protest.
According to Singh, among the other inaccuracies in the novel are claims that the last 'maharaja' of Dumraon died 10 years ago and a lady was its incumbent 'queen' who doubled as a school teacher.
"My father, Kamal Singh, remains the maharaja of the Dumraon estate and he is still alive. There is no lady in his family who runs the estate. Besides, we are not drunkards," he said.
"Our family has not lost the respect of the people as claimed in the book. We continue to enjoy popular respect, as in the past," he added.
Singh, 67, said a legal notice was being prepared and will be served to Bhagat "within a day or two".
"Subsequent to that, we will prefer to file a defamation suit against the Half Girlfriend author for his derogatory remarks against my family and the erstwhile Dumraon estate," he declared.
Founded by a branch of the Parmar rulers of Jagdishpur (Bhojpur), Raja Narayan Mal, was the first king of Dumraon (1604-1622), according to a zamindari document.
The document says Bahadur Kamal Singh (now 88), a former Bharatiya Janata Party MP, is the15th maharaja of Dumraon (since November 1, 1949). The accession of the 'riyasat' to the Indian union took place in May 1951.
According to a Facebook post on Indian royalty, the Dumraon-Burma case, regarding the maharaja of Dumraon's Burma estates, was one of the most famous court cases in India at the turn of the century.
Babu Chittaranjan Das was the Dumraon maharaja's lawyer while the opposing lawyer was none other than Motilal Nehru, father of Jawaharlal Nehru's India's first prime minister.

Make sure you dont choose the wrong health planBy Jonnelle Marte November 12 Follow @jonnelle
HealthCare.gov has been revamped as its second enrollment season approaches. (AP Photo/file)
Most people try to get through open enrollment  without changing a thing . But that inertia might cost them hundreds of dollars later.
Even people who haven’t seen a change in their jobs, health or coverage may have to pay more next year than they did this year. That’s because they could be passing up on a new plan that might be a better fit. And with more insurance companies taking part in the public insurance exchanges this year, some people might find they’ll get a smaller subsidy — even if their plan stayed the same.
“Last year we focused so much on just understanding the Affordable Care Act,” says Carrie McLean, director of customer care at eHealthInsurance, an online insurance broker. “This year is really about picking the right plan.”
It’s complicated stuff. Oddly enough, people who make a decision based just on price may end up paying more than they need to. Whether you’re comparing the options offered through your job or shopping on the exchanges , here are some steps to keep you from ending up in the wrong plan this open enrollment season.
1. Reapply if you’re buying on the exchanges. Many people who bought insurance on ACA exchanges last year will be automatically enrolled into those plans for next year. But that doesn’t mean their costs won’t change. People who changed jobs, got a raise or aren’t making as much as they did last year should update their information on the exchanges to make sure their subsidy isn’t too big or too small. Workers who can get affordable coverage through their jobs won’t qualify for subsidies, even if they meet the income requirements. (Generally, subsidies are available to people earning between the poverty level and four times the poverty level.)
Some people might be missing out on more than just the subsidy — they might be limiting their plan options altogether. People who make below 250 percent of the poverty level can access plans with lower deductibles and copayments, says Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow for the Kaiser Family Foundation. If their income isn’t updated in the system, those plans may not come up when they search on the exchanges, she says.
2. Watch out for price changes. Premiums aren’t expected to increase by much, overall, this year. But some local markets may see big jumps, or drops, in price as more insurance companies enter the exchanges, McLean says. Those who don’t shop around could be passing up a better deal, she says. People receiving federal subsidies might also have to pay more for their plans — even if those plans cost the same and if they’re making the same as they did last year.
As my colleague Jason Millman reported, that’s because some areas will see a change in what’s known as the “benchmark” plan , or the second lowest cost silver plan on which subsidies are based. If the benchmark status goes to a cheaper plan, some people in that market may find their subsidies won’t go as far as they did last year, even if their plans stayed the same.
3. Double check that your doctor and drugs are covered. Some people chose plans last year based on price only to find out later that the doctors or the medications they need are not included, McLean says. Any savings they made by choosing plans with lower premiums were likely erased when they got bills for doctors’ visits or prescriptions that weren’t covered, she says. Some 23 percent of eHealth customers surveyed this summer said they plan to avoid making that same mistake this year.
eHealth has a tool that lets people search a doctor’s name to see which plans include that doctor in the network (though not all exchange plans will be included). Insurance companies also offer information on their Web sites about which doctors, hospitals and drugs are covered by specific plans. When it comes to drugs, people should check what tier a medication is in for the plan they’re considering, says John Barkett, director of health policy affairs for Towers Watson, a human resources consulting firm. Generally, a tier 1 drug (usually a generic) will be cheapest while a tier 3 drug (typically brand name) will be most expensive.
4. Start early. Most people procrastinate when it comes to anything related to money. But you don’t have as much time to choose a plan this year as you did last year. The open enrollment period for the exchanges, which starts Nov. 15 and ends Feb. 15, is half as long as it was last year. Those who want to be covered by Jan. 1 need to decide by Dec. 15.
People should start shopping sooner rather than later so that they can give themselves time to deal with any technical glitches and to properly compare plans, says Dan Mendelson, chief executive of Avalere Health. The same goes for people who are comparing plans offered through their jobs, where they might only have a few weeks to make a change. “You don’t want to get jammed on this,” he says.
5. Re-evaluate family coverage. As much as you would like to avoid it, now is the time to make sure your family is signed up in the most affordable plan. Some employers are making it more expensive to include a spouse or child, so you may find it’s cheaper to move the children over to your partner’s plan. Some families may even find that it’s less expensive to move part of the family on to plan purchased through the exchanges, says Carolyn McClanahan, founder of Life Planning Partners. (They probably won’t qualify for a subsidy, however, if they can be added to an employer-provided plan.)

US urges IMF to cancel some debt of Ebola-hit countriesTreasury Secretary Jack Lew will propose the debt relief program for Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea
By: Agence-France Presse | Washington | Posted: November 12, 2014 9:31 pm
The United States has asked the International Monetary Fund to cancel USD 100 million of the debts of the three West African countries devastated by the Ebola outbreak.
Treasury Secretary Jack Lew will propose the debt relief program for Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea at this week’s G20 meeting in Brisbane, according to a statement on Wednesday.
“The International Monetary Fund has already played a critical role as a first responder, providing economic support to countries hardest hit by Ebola,” Lew said.
“Today we are asking the IMF to expand that support by providing debt relief for Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. IMF debt relief will promote economic sustainability in the worst hit countries by freeing up resources for both immediate needs and longer-term recovery efforts,” he added.
Commercial, industrial and agricultural activities have stalled in the three poor countries in the face of the epidemic, which has killed around 5,000, according to the World Health Organisation.
“These economic impacts will likely increase and continue until confidence rebounds, underpinning the need to free up resources to contain Ebola, to support vulnerable communities and critical government services, and to restore economic growth,” the US Treasury said.
Lew’s proposal is to tap into the IMF’s Post-Catastrophe Debt Relief Trust (PCDR) used to fully cancel Haiti’s USD 268 million debt to the IMF in the wake of the 2010 earthquake catastrophe on the Caribbean island.
The Treasury pointed out that the PCDR still has USD 150 million, two-thirds of which it proposed could be put toward debt relief for the three West African countries.

Role of El Nino in heat build-up in Indian Oceanclimate change
The Indian Ocean has been warming at a rate faster than thought before (1.2 deg C during the past century). It is also the largest consistent contributor to the global ocean warming trends. Recent studies show that a warm Indian Ocean can in turn modulate the Pacific conditions including the El Nino events. So basically, such large warming over the Indian Ocean has implications on the global climate.
The western Indian Ocean, traditionally thought to have cooler sea surface temperatures (SSTs) than the central and eastern Indian Ocean, is surprisingly showing an even stronger summer warming trend over the whole of the 20th century than the central and eastern Indian Ocean. The warming is significantly so large that it may alter the monsoon circulation, monsoon rainfall over the ocean and land, marine food webs and fisheries (western Indian Ocean is one of the most productive oceans) and global climate including the El Nino.
A recent study focused on the causes for this warming and found that it was mainly due to El Nino events, which are getting stronger and more frequent during recent decades, possibly due to a changing climate. These El Nino events weaken the summer westerly (blowing from west to east) winds over the Indian Ocean. Winds have the effect of cooling the sea surface. Strong winds cause evaporation and loss of latent heat from the ocean leading to cooling. When the winds are weakened the opposite happens — the ocean warms.
The study published recently in the Journal of Climate was undertaken by Dr. Roxy Mathew Koll of the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune and co-authored by Ritika Kapoor, Pascal Terray and Sebastien Masson. This work is part of an Indo-French collaboration, carried out under the National Monsoon Mission set up by the Ministry of Earth Sciences.
The study found that the ocean atmospheric phenomenon — the El Nino, and its influence on the Walker Circulation were responsible for periodic weakening of monsoon westerlies and led to abnormally high summer sea surface temperatures in the western Indian Ocean. Walker Circulation represents the zonal (east-west) circulation over the tropics. In the Pacific, the trade winds blow from east to west. This is because of the low pressure in the west and high pressure in the east, which drives these winds. This is linked to the warm waters over the west Pacific and cool waters over the east Pacific. In the upper atmosphere, this trade wind circulation is completed by winds blowing from west to east.
During summer, this Pacific cell is linked to the monsoon westerlies in the Indian Ocean. During an El Nino, due to warm waters in the east and cool waters in the west, the pressure systems also change, reversing (shifting) the Walker circulation. The wind direction reverses and the whole circulatory system shifts eastward leaving only weak surface westerlies in the western Indian Ocean. This results in ocean warming in the Western Indian Ocean.
A simultaneous correlation analysis between the eastern Pacific and
global summer mean SST anomalies, after removing the global warming trends, depicts significant positive correlation over the western Indian Ocean. This indicates that ENSO dominates the western tropical Indian Ocean variability during summer.
“The frequency and magnitude of El Ninos have also increased in the recent decades, possibly due to global warming. This means a piling up of heat on the Indian Ocean,” notes Dr. Roxy Koll in an email.
Unlike the Pacific or the Atlantic Oceans, the Indian Ocean is land-locked on the north. This means that the ocean circulation which carries the tropical heat towards the poles is restricted in the Indian Ocean, withholding the piled up heat.
When queried how Indian Ocean warming affects the El Nino, Dr. Koll noted: “Earlier studies have shown that enhanced tropical Indian Ocean warming in recent decades favours stronger trade winds in the western Pacific via the Walker circulation and hence is likely to suppress the El Nino events.”
“The western Indian Ocean, due to its cool, nutrient rich waters, is
abundant with marine phytoplankton and the fisheries thrive on it. Excessive warm waters can be detrimental to phytoplankton production which in turn affects the fisheries,” he notes.

Encapsulating bio inputs for crops has several advantages

TOPICS
agriculture
The Indian Institute of Spices Research (IISR), Kozhikode, has made a significant breakthrough in bio-fertilizer production by successfully encapsulating plant growth nutrients.
“The encapsulation process is simple, does not require sophisticated equipment and comes at a low investment” says Dr. M. Anandaraj, Director, who also happens to be the inventor of this benign and simple technology.
In present-day agriculture, bio-fertilizers are of great economic importance because they partially replace chemical inputs and play a vital role in enhancing soil and environmental quality.
Plenty in market
Different formulations of bio-fertilizers like liquid, peat, granules, and freeze-dried powders are available in plenty in the market and their success depends on the crop, environment, ease-of- use, cost and availability.
But a perfect bio-fertilizer formulation does not exist till date and each type has its own limitations.
Nevertheless, a promising advancement has been the development of this capsule technique that allows encapsulating the required nutrition in a capsule and delivering them to the crops, according to Dr. Anandaraj.
While such methods have been fairly successful inside laboratories, practical attempts to implement the same in the fields have been largely unsuccessful. Presently no such commercial products are available in the market. “Termed as bio-capsule, the other advantages of this technology include reduced cost and easy handling and transport, no harmful by-products, less requirement of inorganic and inert material, storage at normal temperature and more importantly, enhanced shelf life (18-24 months)”says Dr. Anandaraj.
Less requirement
Besides, the number of capsules required will be markedly less compared to other bio formulations.
For instance, the normal requirement of any other bio-fertilizer for ginger crop is 20 kg for a hectare.
It can be replaced with just 200 capsules weighing 200gm (each capsule weight being 1.0gm), a marked decrease of 100 times by volume.
The main components in the capsule are the essential nutrients packed in a hard gelatin capsule (like the ones we get in medical stores). The whole process of encapsulation can be done at room temperature.
No special equipment
Apparently, this means one does not need any sophisticated equipment or special conditions. This is significant because the investment cost to manufacture these capsules is low.
“The encapsulation technique appears to be significant because it can be used to deliver all kinds agriculturally important microorganisms like nitrogen fixers, nutrient solubilizers/ rhizobacteria, trichoderma, etc to any crop, whatsoever.
Field testing
“The technology has been successfully tested in farmers’ fields and patent for this delivery process has been filed for,” he explains.
On how it should be used he says:
At the time of application, the required capsules should be mixed in water and the seed/ planting materials are soaked in the solution for 30 minutes before sowing. The remaining liquid can then be drenched in the field or pots.
“We field tested it for two years in ginger and its performance was way ahead of talc-based formulation and at par or sometimes even better than chemicals like Metalaxyl-mancozeb which is commonly used in reducing soft rot disease and enhancing growth” he adds.
Yet to be licensed
Since it has not yet been licensed to prospective entrepreneurs, the bio-capsule is being given to farmers for testing through the Agricultural Technology Information Center (ATIC) of the institute.

RSS ideologue Dinanath Batra to guide Haryana on educationDinanath Batra to guide Haryana on education
Navneet Sharma , Hindustan Times  Chandigarh, November 12, 2014
First Published: 22:19 IST(12/11/2014) | Last Updated: 10:00 IST(13/11/2014)
RSS ideologue Dinanath Batra will advise Haryana’s new Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government on education as part of a new committee of educationists, the state’s education minister said on Wednesday.
 
The move to rope in Batra,  a controversial author and activist devoted to recasting India’s history from the perspective of the Hindu right, is the first sign of the role the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) may play in policy formulation in Haryana.
 
Education minister Ram Bilas Sharma said the committee comprising well-known educationists and experts, including retired teachers and professors from the state education department, and Jat and Hindu educational institutions, will advise to the state government on steps to improve the education system.
 
“I will constitute an advisory committee of educationists under the tutelage of Dinanathji Batra to give advice on education-related issues,” Sharma told HT in an exclusive interview.
 
Sharma said the government decided to choose Batra, national convenor of the RSS-backed Shiksha Bachao Andolan Samiti, because he was a well-known educationist.
 
“He is a well-known educationist from Haryana. When he was principal of Gita School in Kurukshetra, I had worked with him as teacher,” said Sharma.
 
Batra, who was responsible for the pulping of American scholar Wendy Doniger's book on Hinduism for allegedly causing religious offence, has been at the centre of controversy for his efforts to Indianise education.
 
A one-time RSS pracharak and president of the Shiskha Sanskriti Utthan Nyas, he was in the news recently for demanding the revamp of education, curriculum and textbooks to introduce concepts that promote “modernity with Indian values”.
 
Historians have dismissed his books , which have been recommended as secondary reading in Gujarat schools, as nothing but works of “fantasy”.
 
According to media reports, the books contain several moral and political prescriptions such as a proposal to redraw the map of India in line with the right-wing idea of an Akhand Bharat. They also suggest that birthdays should not be celebrated by blowing candles on the grounds that it is Western culture. Instead, they should be marked by wearing swadeshi clothes, having havans, reciting mantras such as the Gayatri mantra and feeding cows.
 
His Shiksha Bachao Andolan Samiti has also reportedly convened a national conference of academics and experts to examine the national education policy. The new Haryana government has already halted the ongoing revision of textbooks for government schools in the state.
 
On the role of the RSS in policy formulation in the state, Sharma said the organisation was working nation-wide and had played a big role in “character building and value education”.
 
“The RSS will definitely have a role. The chief minister (Manohar Lal Khattar) is an old pracharak. I have been a pracharak too,” he added.

Bharat Petroleum Posts 50 Per Cent Fall in Q2 Profit
Press Trust of India | Updated On: November 12, 2014 21:50 (IST)
Buying Iron Ore for First Time in History, Says Tata Steel
New Delhi: Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) on Wednesday reported a 50 per cent drop in net profit for the quarter ended September 2014 as refining margin dipped on slumping international oil prices.
Net profit in July-September at Rs 464.20 crore, or Rs 6.42 per share, was 50 per cent lower than Rs 931.13 crore, or Rs 12.88 a share, in the same period a year ago, the company said in a filing to the stock exchanges.
The company earned $2.36 on turning every barrel of crude oil into product as opposed to a gross refining margin of $4.38 per barrel last year.
Turnover was marginally higher at Rs 62,025.16 crore in the second quarter as compared to Rs 61,784.51 crore in the same period a year ago.
BPCL said almost all its losses incurred on selling diesel, domestic LPG and kerosene at rates below cost were made up by cash subsidy from government (Rs 1,505.80 crore) and support from upstream firms like ONGC (Rs 3530.79 crore).
However, because of unmet losses of first quarter, the company had to in first half of current fiscal absorb Rs 503.42 crore.
Sales rose to 17.13 million tonnes when compared to 16.38 million tonnes, it said adding that the increase was mainly in petrol (10.34 per cent), LPG (12.03 per cent) and diesel (Rs 1.92 per cent).

In new video  U.S. sailors attacked in Istanbul by Turkish mobBy Dan Lamothe November 12 Follow @danlamothe
Anti-American protesters shouting "Yankee, go home!" attacked three U.S. Navy sailors on Wednesday in Istanbul near where their warship was docked on an inlet of the Bosphorus Strait in the Black Sea. (AP)
A group of about 20 nationalists attacked three U.S. sailors in Istanbul on Wednesday, hurling objects at them, chasing them and briefly putting a bag over one of the sailors’ heads.
The U.S. Navy acknowledged the incident, which was publicized in a video online. The attack underscores the volatility in Turkey, a longtime U.S. ally that increasingly is at odds with Washington on foreign policy, especially over how to handle the Islamic State militant group in neighboring Syria.
In the video, one of the Turks is seen saying the Americans looked like members of the U.S. Army. The Turks claimed to be members of the Turkey Youth Union, which is opposed to working with the United States and becoming members of the European Union.
“We define you as murderers, as killers… and we want you to get out of our land,” one man says, seconds before the attack ensues.
The Navy said the sailors were assigned to the USS Ross, a destroyer, and in Turkey for a scheduled port visit. They appeared to be in their late teens or early 20s. They were able to get away without suffering injuries and are back on the Ross, Navy officials said.
“The U.S. Navy is currently working with the Turkish National Police and U.S. Embassy staff to investigate this incident,” said a statement from U.S. Naval Forces Europe/Africa . “The U.S. Navy will continue to coordinate with Turkish authorities to review security procedures for future ship visits.”
In a series of tweets, the U.S. Embassy in Turkey blasted the attack, calling it appalling. The vast majority of Turks are against “an action that so disrespects Turkey’s reputation for hospitality.”

A Navy spokesman, Lt. Timothy Hawkins, said that the Ross already was scheduled to depart Istanbul on Thursday and that the attack had no effect on operations.
Navy Secretary Ray Mabus said in a Facebook post that he is certain the vast majority of Turkish people and the Ankara government do not condone the attack.
“We understand that local law enforcement have suspects in custody,” Mabus said. “We commend this swift action and are certain that those who did this will be held accountable.”

Chess World Championship game 4: Carlsen draws with AnandIn the fourth game of the World Chess Championship, a confident Viswanathan Anand - playing black in a Sicilian Defence - stretched Carlsen for more than four hours before agreeing to a draw.
 
Even though Vishy opted for Sicilian Defence, which is supposed to encourage active play, game 4 ended in a draw. 
Game Board
Sending a message with Sicilian
Anand, playing with black pieces in game 4, was expected by many chess experts to play for a draw rather than risking his game going for a win.
 
But Anand surprised them. He played the famous 'Sicilian Defence', which is known to create unbalanced positions, thus having high probability of ending in a result.
Vishy started with Sicilian defence
The Sicilian is popular because it leads to sharp positions where the better player usually prevails, whereas most other moves by black leads to drawish positions.
 
This bold move was appreciated by many chess experts. It was interpreted as a 'message' Anand is sending to his opposite camp - 'I'm ready for the fight, bring it on'.
 
Susan Polgar, famous chess commentator, wrote in her blog, "Big psychological game displayed by Anand. After winning yesterday (Tuesday), he gave a big message with Sicilian that he's not afraid. If Anand continues to send the message that he's not afraid to battle, we will witness a very good match."
 
Carlsen replied to Anand's Sicilian with 'King's Indian Attack'. A move, which according to Polgar, was 'off the popular theory'. Polgar felt that Calrsen moved away from the usual 'theoritical moves' because Anand is so good with his current preparation and his knowledge of this setup is good.
 
Slight positional disadvantage for Anand
 
But Sicilian, like we saw before, led to a strange position for black. Even though the game was even, Carlsen maintained a small positional advantage over Anand by move 15.
A slight positional disadvantage for Anand
World number two Fabiano Caruana tweeted, "Vishy's position looks slightly uncomfortable. I remember suffering quite a bit in this line years ago vs @nigelshortchess."
 
And Carlsen gained a good postion with his 15th move Qf1. Nigel Short, chess player and commentator, tweeted, "Qf1! was a real Magnus Carlsen move. It is not even doing that much, but it just makes things a bit harder for Vishy."
 
But the match remained pretty dull when it entered mid-game level. Neither were there any brilliant moves nor blunders.
 
Isolated pawns
 
The only problem that Vishy had at this point was that his pawn structure was a little worrying. His pawns were not connected on the queen side and isolated pawns always become a major headache at the business end of the game.
 
The game gained a lot of intensity after move 21. Both players started exchanging pieces and entered active game play.
After move 21, game play got a little active
But after exchanging one rook and two bishops, it went back to a dry position again. It went on like this for more than four hours with neither of the players making inroads.
 
This was followed by more pieces getting exchanged in a boring monotonous game play which continued even beyond the first time control.
 
Magnus had a one-pawn advantage at the fag end of the game. But as there were only few pieces left, this didn't create an impact.
 
At the end of 47 moves, the players repeated the same set of moves three times, forcing a repetitive draw.
 
In the press conference, Magnus said, "I'm not playing very well. Actually, I'm playing somewhat terribly. My last two games were pretty bad."
 
Magnus added, "Overall, it was not a high quality game. There were no errors in general. But not very good game play either."

 RBI Seen Holding Onto High Rates Till Monsoon: HBSCMore Steps to Rationalise Subsidies on Anvil: Arun Jaitley
Mumbai: Even though consumer inflation ebbed to 5.52 per cent in October, foreign brokerage HSBC on Wednesday said the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will adopt a cautious stance on rates and a reduction is possible only after the monsoon next year.
It said a rate cut may result in the quality of growth suffering and also heighten the chance of the RBI missing its inflation targets.
"The RBI will, therefore, remain cautious about changing its policy stance pre-maturely. At the least, expect a pause till the rains set in next year," it said in a report released before the October inflation data was announced.
In September, retail inflation stood at 6.47 per cent. The consumer price inflation, which has been the key factor governing the RBI's rate stance, came in at 5.52 per cent in October, increasing hopes among many quarters of a rate cut to boost economic growth.
After two fiscal years of sub-5 per cent growth, the country notched up a 5.7 per cent GDP expansion in the June quarter, which is expected to fall to 5 per cent level due to a slowdown in industrial production.
The RBI wants to get the inflation to 8 per cent by January 2015 and down to 6 per cent by January 2016. It can be noted that at the last policy announcement, RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan said the inflation will trend lower till the end of the year on a base effect.
He has been consistently saying the RBI wants to fight the battle against inflation decisively and ensure the high price rise problem does not arise repeatedly.
Hinting at the upcoming changes in the monetary policy setting system, HSBC said the present rate cut cycle, whenever it starts, will be unique because from now on the RBI may have an explicit inflation target and added that this will put pressure on the RBI.
"Ideally, the nominal policy rate should decline gradually (up to 200bps even) if Prime Minister Modi's reforms boost productivity in the economy. If this does not happen, the rate cut cycle will be relatively shallow given low tolerance for inflation now," it added.

Diesel Rates Likely to be Cut AgainYou are here: Home Economy
Petrol, Diesel Prices Likely to be Cut This Weekend
Press Trust of India | Updated On: November 12, 2014 15:26 (IST)
More Steps to Rationalise Subsidies on Anvil: Arun Jaitley
New Delhi: Petrol and diesel prices are likely to be cut by close to Rs 1 per litre this weekend on the back of sliding global oil rates.
This would be the seventh reduction in petrol prices since August and the third in rates of diesel since its decontrol last month.
(Read: How diesel price deregulation impacts you )
Following their fortnightly review practice, state-owned fuel retailers Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corp (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp (HPCL) are due to revise rates of petrol and diesel on Saturday.
In all probability, rates will be reduced if the current trend of declining international oil prices continues, industry sources said.
Petrol price was last cut by Rs 2.41 a litre on November 1. On the same day, the price of diesel was also reduced by Rs 2.25 per litre. ( Read more )
Since August, petrol price has been cumulatively cut by Rs 9.36 per litre.
At present, a litre of petrol in the national capital costs Rs 64.25 a litre, while diesel costs Rs 53.35 a litre.
Diesel price was for the first time in more than five years cut on October 19, by Rs 3.37 a litre, when the government decided to deregulated the fuel. This was followed by another cut on November 1.
Prior to the October 19 reduction, diesel rates were last cut in January 2009.
Sources said oil firms revise rates of petrol, which was deregulated in June 2010, and diesel on 1st and 16th of every month based on average international oil price and rupee-US dollar exchange rate.
Brent crude fell for a third day amid signs that Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) members are reluctant to reduce supply even as prices slumped deeper into a bear market. It declined by 82 cents to $80.85 per barrel. ( Read more )
Brent has lost almost 30 per cent since its June peak amid speculation that global supply is outpacing demand.

Nothing micro about this max sales storyInternational rights not in jeopardy, clarifies SpiceJet
India’s second largest and home-grown smartphone maker Micromax posted a staggering 130% year-on-year jump in turnover for FY14 to Rs 7,141.23 crore, according to the company’s 2013-14 balance sheet filed with the Registrar of Companies. Its net profit for the same period rose almost 50% to touch R284.10 crore.
Through a sustained marketing campaign (Hollywood actor Hugh Jackman is its brand ambassador) and by launching smartphones with the latest features at competitive price points, Micromax has managed to grow its business in a market that is crowded with global brands like Samsung, Apple, Lenovo and Sony; home-grown competitors like Karbonn and Lava; and Chinese entrants like Xiaomi and Huawei.
According to market intelligence firm IDC, Micromax shipped 2.58 crore handsets, including both smartphones and feature phones, during calendar year 2013, up from 2.19 crore handsets during 2012. The company’s market share increased to 10% from 6% during the same period.
The Gurgaon-based company grew its market share between January and June 2014 to 13%, by shipping 1.6 crore handsets.
Only Samsung sells more smartphones than Micromax in India and, according to IDC, the gap between the two is narrowing.
“Micromax’s handset volumes have grown significantly during calendar year 2013 from the previous calendar year, and we expect the July-September 2014 quarter performance of the company to be phenomenal,” said Karan Thakkar, a senior market analyst at IDC.
While Android-based smartphone makers like Micromax and Samsung are seeing a surge in demand, the same can’t be said of all handset manufactures, especially those operating on platforms other than Android.
India is one of the fastest growing markets for smartphones in the world with a slew of new offerings each year finding favour with the Indian consumers.
Apple, which sells premium products like the iPhone and iPad, saw its turnover touch Rs4,500 crore for fiscal 2014, a tenfold growth from 2010. Its net profit in the same period has grown three times to Rs 119.5 crore.
But not all companies have had a good run in the country. BlackBerry India, the Indian arm of the Canadian handset maker BlackBerry, saw its net profit decline sharply in fiscal 2014, by around 50% year-on-year to Rs 11.46 crore. The company’s revenues nearly halved to Rs 142.05 crore during the same period.
“Micromax’s handset volumes have grown significantly during 2013 from the previous year, and we expect the July-September 2014 quarter performance of the company to be phenomenal,” Karan Thakkar, a senior market analyst at IDC said.
The significant improvement in Micromax’s performance over the past two years can be attributed to the company’s ‘value for money’ proposition. Placing its products with specifications similar to that of foreign brands but at a significantly lower cost has also helped the company gain market share in the last couple of quarters.
“According to our research, most Indians replace their phones every one to two years and aren’t willing to spend Rs 40,000-50,000 on new smartphones,” Thakkar said. This gives a huge opportunity to Indian vendors like Micromax, Karbonn, Lava and Chinese vendors like Huawei and Xiaomi, which price their phones competitively while providing same specifications as other foreign brands.”
Thakkar also said that a lot of young Indians that were looking to buy smartphones with the latest specifications’ were more value conscious than brand conscious.
Commenting on the company’s performance, a Micromax spokesperson told FE, “We have always believed in bringing affordable innovation to Indian consumers, which is in sync with their interests and needs, and would continue to do so. We would continue to challenge the notion that great technology comes at a higher price by introducing innovative products that simplify needs of our consumers and wish to grow ahead of the market. Going forward, a large chunk of our efforts will be concentrated on coming up with products and services which act as solutions to the needs of the fast-evolving consumers.”

HC restores Uttar Pradesh sugar sops  raps state badlyFIPB role shrinks amid easier FDI flows
Reckless, politically motivated policy reversals by governments at the expense of industry have got the rap from the judiciary, again.
The Allahabad High Court has ruled that an abrupt suspension of a policy initiated by the Uttar Pradesh government in 2004 to attract investments in the sugar sector was “arbitrary” and done “without the application of mind” and directed the state to extend the promised incentives.
Under the policy, eligible mills were entitled to incentives including exemption from entry tax on sugar, trade tax on molasses, stamp duty and registration charges on purchase of land, purchase tax on cane and reimbursement on transport of sugar, and a capital subsidy of 10% on the investment made.
Though the court’s order came in a case filed by Bajaj Hindusthan — which made up for more than a third of investments worth roughly R9,000 crore in the scheme period — it could influence verdicts in cases filed by a dozen-odd mills against the state for the said policy withdrawal.
The court’s ruling came as a relief to the states’ sugar industry bogged down by the state’s irrational cane pricing policy. The sudden withdrawal of the incentives under the “sugar industry promotion policy” was the first decisive blow in at least two decades to the embattled sugar mills in the state.
In the order, the court said: “On the principle of promissory estoppel and legitimate expectation, the action of the respondents (the UP government) in denying the benefits under the sugar policy and the notifications issued under various Acts is deplorable, unreasonable and arbitrary which cannot be sustained. The petitioners (Bajaj Hindusthan) are liable to be given the benefits under various notifications issued in pursuance of the sugar policy on the units established by it.”
To lure investors, the Mulayam Singh-led state government had firmed up the policy in 2004 to offer tax breaks and other incentives for five years to companies that invest at least Rs 350 crore each and for 10 years to those spending Rs 500 crore or more on setting up of new units, including ancillary industries like power generation and distillery units, and expansion of existing units.
However, just within a week of Mayawati coming to power in 2007, the policy was “scrapped” through an executive order, leaving the mills that had taken huge loans to fund the expansion strapped for funds. While some mills that had made early investments under the policy, including Bajaj Hindusthan, had been granted the incentives for a while, many others couldn’t reap the benefits.
Millers said all major companies, including Bajaj Hindusthan, Balrampur Chini Mills, DCM Shriram, Simbhaoli Sugar Mills, Dalmia Sugar, Dhampur Sugar Mills, Dwarikesh Sugar Industries and Mawana Sugars, which had invested heavily, approached the high court separately against the state government’s decision. While some cases are being heard by the Allahabad High Court, some others are being heard by its Lucknow bench.
Bajaj Hindusthan had invested around Rs 3,000 crore and set up units at Bilai, Gangnauli, Thanabhawan, Budhana, Kinauni, Khambarkhera and Barkhera in the marketing year through September 2005. While it had received eligibility certificates to avail of benefits for all these units, getting the approval for its Maqsudapur plant in Shahjahanpur was under way. Sources said while Bajaj had got eligibility certificates and even reimbursements to the tune of Rs 60 crore in lieu of various incentives before the policy was sought to be scrapped, most other mills were not issued the eligibility certificates by then.
Among others, DCM Shriram had spent Rs 650 crore in setting up two sugar and one co-generation units apart from adding capacities to two existing plants. Dalmia Sugar had also invested over Rs 700 crore in establishing new factories and expanding capacity from 5,000 tonnes crushed per day (tcd) to 22,500 tcd.
Compounding the mills’ problems, successive years of elevated cane prices, fixed by the state government, and subdued sugar prices led to huge losses. Sugar mills in UP incurred losses to the tune of Rs 7,250 crore in the three years through 2013-14, with some like Mawana Sugars going to the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction.
Interestingly, on a petition against such a policy in 2006, the state government had defended it, saying it had “extensively analysed the pros and cons of the impugned policy before formulating it”.
The latest verdict was in favour of Bajaj Hindusthan primarily on three counts: The doctrine of promissory estoppel that mandates the state to fulfil its promise; the court’s ruling that a legislative enactment made by a notification under a statute can’t be cancelled through an executive order; and non-withdrawal of notifications under which various exemptions and incentives were proposed to be extended.

IIP up  CPI down  but RBI unlikely to cut ratesFIPB role shrinks amid easier FDI flows
Industrial production inched up to a three-month high of 2.5% in September, compared with 0.5% a month earlier, aided by an uptick in the usually volatile capital goods segment, showed official data released on Wednesday.
Coming on the back of retail inflation hitting a fresh low of 5.52% last month, against 6.46% in September, the latest pick-up in the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) adds to the feel-good factor generated after Narendra Modi came to power, but it’s still early to predict a turnaround in the economy struggling with structural weaknesses, said analysts.
Although the IIP data marked the sixth straight month of expansion, its best performance in around three years, it has been hugely aided by conducive bases. The sharp drop in the consumer price inflation, too, came on a favourable base (retail inflation was 10.2% in October last year) although analysts took heart from the fact that sequential momentum is flat. The effect of a favourable base will wear off by December but hopefully retail inflation could still come in at lower than 7% in March 2015, given the low global commodity prices.
Most analysts agree that the Reserve Bank of India’s target of a CPI inflation figure of 6% for March 2016 could be achieved earlier. But given that it has resorted to a long-drawn and assiduous battle against inflation, the central bank is unlikely to cut rates until it is fully convinced that the inflation genie is back in the bottle. The next monetary policy review is slated for December 1.
Interestingly, the persistent contraction in radio, TV and communication equipment continues to hurt, as without the 43.8% drop in this segment, the IIP would have grown by 4.9% in September. Analysts had earlier attributed it to the disruption of Nokia’s operations in Tamil Nadu.
Although capital goods output hit a three-month peak, the contraction in the segment in 11 of the 18 months since the beginning of the last fiscal suggests that several of the projects cleared are yet to take off on the ground.
“The decline in growth of IIP, barring capital goods, to 1.2% in September 2014 from 2.1% in August 2014, is symptomatic of the broader sluggishness in economic activity. IIP growth outpaced the 1.9% growth displayed by the core sector industries in September 2014, for the first time in four months, led by a pick-up in manufacturing growth,” said Aditi Nayar, senior economist at ICRA.
Moreover, even in the build-up to the festival season, a 4% drop in consumer goods output in September — recording a contraction in 15 out of the 18 months since last April — suggested a near collapse of private demand.

Chhattisgarh sterilisation deaths: Rusty  infected tools killed womenComments
Furious protesters took to the streets in Chhattisgarh on Wednesday as activists complained standard procedures and guidelines were not followed in the state's mass government-run sterilisation programme that left 13 women dead.

A team of doctors rushed to Bilaspur to investigate the deaths following the operations performed by a doctor accused of using rusty equipment in an operation theatre that had not been used for four months.
The cause of the deaths was not immediately clear, but officials said the victims showed signs of toxic shock, possibly because of dirty surgical equipment or contaminated medicines. The victims had suffered vomiting and a dramatic fall in blood pressure after undergoing laparoscopic sterilisation, a simple process in which the fallopian tubes are blocked.
"Preliminary examinations suggest septic shock may have caused the deaths," said local government official Amar Thakur. "It looks like the equipment that was used was probably infected. We are waiting for the report."
A total of 83 women, all villagers under the age of 32, had the operations on Saturday and were sent home that evening, but more than 50 became seriously ill later and had to be hospitalised.
The expert team from Delhi's All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) reviewed the clinical details of the women who fell ill, but did not say what led to the deaths.
"All of us unanimously think that the cause of the illness can only be ascertained after all laboratory results and post-mortem findings are available," said Dr Anjan Tirkha, who headed the seven-member team.
Sources said the death may have been caused by drugs prescribed to the patients or internal malfunctioning resulting in renal failure, respiratory failure and liver infections.
The doctor has been accused of operating on more than 80 women in just a few hours with the help of two assistants in an abandoned private hospital, officials said.
Police have filed a case of causing death by negligence against the doctor, RK Gupta, Bilaspur IGP Pawan Dev told HT.  The state government rewarded Gupta on January 26 for accomplishing his target of laproscopic tubectomies.
N Sarojini, founder and director, Sama Resource Group for Women and Health, said the Bilaspur surgeries violated Supreme Court orders saying that a medical team can conduct a maximum of 30 operations in a day with two separate laparoscopes.
"One doctor cannot do more than 10 sterilisations in one day, yet the surgeon in Chattisgarh did an astounding 83 surgeries in a short span of five to six hours… The scale of these deaths and critical morbidity clearly show that these operations were not done under standard protocols," she said.
"The only step that has been taken by the government till now is to announce Rs. 4 lakh compensation for the families of the dead and suspension of some doctors. These steps are not adequate to ensure that such incidents do not happen again. The systemic failures that led to this incident need to be addressed."
Although the surgery is voluntary, rights groups say the target-driven nature of the programme has led to women being coerced into being sterilised. Women are given Rs. 1,000 rupees and men Rs. 2,000 as incentive to undergo the procedure.
Shiv Kumari Yadav, 26, and Parvati Bai, 25, said they would not have opted for the procedure had they known about the surgeries were carried out in an unhygienic operation theatre. "Two women were simultaneously handled on the two parallel beds by the doctors," said one of the patients.
The Chhattisgarh high court has issued notices to the union and state governments as well as the Medical Council of India seeking a detailed report within 10 days.

Verizon just made up a holidayBy Hayley Tsukayama November 12 Follow @htsuka

You know "Black Friday," "Cyber Monday" and -- nowadays -- even "Black Thursday." Now Verizon Wireless is adding another commercial "holiday" to the week: Connection Day.
In a promotion announced Wednesday, Verizon said that it will be handing out free gifts to the data-hungry on the day before Thanksgiving, aka one of the biggest travel days of the year.
Verizon will give stuff like free access to magazines, movies and TV shows as well as free airport and inflight WiFi regardless of a customer's wireless provider. For the effort, Verizon is partnering with a number of companies, including Condé Nast, JetBlue, WiFi provider Boingo Wireless and Apple. For its own "More Everything" customers, Verizon will give them an extra perk: a free gig of data, plus an additional 1GB of data for the next billing cycle.
The only catch, really is that you will have to sign up via Verizon's Connection Day Web site to get the free stuff.
It's an interesting move from Verizon, which has been working more with outside partners of late, most notably by introducing a rewards program  for its subscribers that lets them earn points for retailer discounts, daily coupons and sweepstakes. The nation's largest wireless provider, the company has nevertheless been under some pressure to woo customers -- particularly as T-Mobile looks to make itself a champion of the people in the wireless world.
So, yes, Verizon definitely gets something out of this: visibility, plus your e-mail address. Still, the gifts could be welcome on that hectic travel day, whether you're staving off calls of "Are we there yet" from the backseat, or having to re-book a flight at the last minute.
Here's a full selection of what Verizon is offering, and with whom:
Amazon: Selection of 10 free/discounted apps, plus two free Audible book downloads (new members) or $10 Audible credit (current members)
Apple: A special offer from iTunes to be revealed on Nov. 26
Condé Nast: Free Digital Edition downloads of 17 Conde Nast Publications, including Wired, Vanity Fair andGQ.
Free Wi-Fi: 30-minute complimentary Internet sessions through Boingo Wireless (at airports) and GogoTechnologies (in-flight).
JetBlue: Free in-flight Fly-Fi (Wi-Fi) for flights between November 26th and December 24th.
Pandora Media: Free seven-day trial of Pandora One.
Verizon FiOS: Special mobile access to popular movies and TV shows on  November 26 , compliments of Verizon FiOS, by downloading the free  FiOS Preview

Americans are falling out of love with restaurantsin 3 chartsWhere did everyone go? (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster)
If you find yourself eating out less often these days, you're not alone.
The average American now eats at a restaurant only 74 times each year, the lowest reading in more than 30 years, according to data from market research from NPD group.
"People have been abandoning restaurants for quite some time," said Harry Balzer, chief industry analyst and vice president of NPD group. "Eating out just isn't as popular as it once was."
Indeed, it's not. The number of times the average American eats out has been falling almost every year since 1984, when NPD began tracking the metric.
For a time, the country's growing disinterest in sit-down lunches and dinners was offset by a stunning rise in take-out. In 1987, for the first time, Americans picked up food more often from restaurants than they sat down for meals—94 times per year on average compared to 92. And they continued picking up more and more of it through the early 2000s.
But, as you can see above, the country's appetite for take-out began to level off and has even fallen roughly 8 percent since 2007. As a result, the average American only eats food from or at a restaurant roughly 191 times per year, the smallest number since 1993, and more than 10 percent less than in 2000 when the average American ate or ordered out about 215 times.
What's going on here? A few things, most likely.
For one, there's the rise of prepared meals, which have greatly improved in quality over the past decade, has probably pinched the demand for take-out. Yogurt, sandwiches, granola bars, Mexican food, and pizza are among the fastest growing food segments in the country, according to NPD Group. And all of them are easy to prepare at home.
"With restaurant visits down, the manufacturers of our food are filling more of that need," said Balzer. "You can eat most of the fast-growing food items with little to no preparation."
Money is almost certainly a major driver, too.
Female participation in the workforce has leveled off at the same time that male participation has fallen, meaning less income to spend on dining out.  "Up until this started happening, there was a greater need for convenience, and money to pay for it," Balzer said.
The average American has also eaten fewer meals prepared by restaurants ever since the Great Recession. Consumers spent  roughly 7 percent less on eating out  in 2010, compared to the year before, according to the Bureua of Labor Statistics. Meanwhile, people are buying more groceries , because it's cheaper.
Strangely, however, the fact that Americans are falling out of love with restaurants doesn't mean they're cooking instead. "People are quick to say Americans are cooking more often, but that's not really true," said Balzer. "People are eating in their houses more often, but a lot of that is packaged and prepared foods."

Delhi court upholds sex workers dignity  jails rapistsDelhi court upholds sex workers dignity, jails rapists
Avantika Mehta , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, November 13, 2014

Four men who raped a Rwandan woman refugee in Delhi just weeks before the brutal December 16 gangrape shook the Capital have been found guilty and sentenced to the maximum penalty of 10 years in jail by a Delhi court.
The men, in their defence, had claimed the woman was a prostitute and an illegal immigrant who had falsely implicated them to find an excuse to stay on in the country. The court, however, said their argument “deserves to be rejected outright”.
During her cross-examination, the woman said she previously worked as a prostitute. However, the judge said it was irrelevant to the case. “Simply because the victim worked as a sex worker before the incident in question doesn’t confer any right upon anyone to violate her dignity,” additional sessions judge Kaveri Baweja said.
 
The court further noted that DNA evidence found on the convicts left no doubt there were physical relations between them and the rape survivor, adding “it is not the claim of the accused that the prosecutrix entered into sexual relations with the accused voluntarily”.
“This is a good judgment. The ministry of women and child has already clarified that no action needs to be taken against foreign nationals who may have been brought here and forced into trafficking. It’s good that the court has reinforced this stand,” Ravi Kant, president of NGO Shakti Vahini that works for gender  equality, told HT.
The convicts Deepak, Praveen, Vikas and Ashok Ekka — all Delhi residents — were sentenced to 10 years in jail for gang-rape and abduction.They were also ordered to pay a compensation of Rs. 59,000 to the rape survivor.
According to the rape survivor’s statement, she was walking towards Gandhi Nagar around 7pm on December 1, 2012 when three men in a car grabbed her.
She was then drugged, brutally beaten and raped in the moving car before she lost consciousness. She woke up naked and bleeding on the banks of the Yamuna.
Her clothes, wallet and money were later recovered from the homes of the accused.

Cabinet announces relief, rules out MSP
The State Cabinet on Wednesday ruled out the possibility of a minimum support price (MSP) for onion while announcing a compensation of Rs. 9,000 a hectare for crops damaged due to rains in Chitradurga, Davangere, Gadag, Dharwad and Bellary districts. This has come on the heels of growers protesting crashing prices of their produce.
A macro view of market scenario shows that fluctuations are not a one-off phenomenon but a worrying trend for over a year.
Apprehension
Onion yield arriving at the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) at Amaragol here during August 2013, fetched Rs. 4,350 a quintal at higher end (with the Average Modal Price being Rs. 2,517 a quintal). It was due to apprehension that there might be shortfall of supply in Nasik market (one of the main onion markets in the country) due to poor monsoon.
Just over a year and a quarter later, the price at higher end is now Rs. 1,900 a quintal (with AMP being Rs. 764). This is because of huge but poor quality arrivals in the market. In the intervening period, there have been constant fluctuations. At its lowest, it was Rs. 482 a quintal in May 2014.
One of the reasons attributed to the falling price is excessive rain this monsoon that has affected the quality of the yield and the merchants are not ready to pay more for the “wet” yield. Although the farmers admitted that their crop had been affected, they were of the opinion that “poor quality” was a mere ploy by merchants and brokers to reduce the price.
And despite protests and assurance by the government on intervention in the market, the price has only kept dropping since September this year. This forced farmers to resort to frequent protests last month and this month. On Tuesday, the auction of onion at the Hubballi APMC had to be suspended. While their protest resulted in intervention of the Deputy Commissioner of Dharwad, resulting in setting up of a committee for daily monitoring, the end result was just a slight upward revision in the prices.
Import norms relaxed
Onion trader Saleem Byahatti, however, said many farmers opted for onion cultivation hoping that they would get better price. Meanwhile, amid concerns about high prices, the government relaxed the norms for import of onion. “Now huge arrivals and the relaxed import norms have both contributed to the slump in the price,” he said.

Microsoft just squashed a 19-year-old software bug. How did it go undetected so longBy Andrea Peterson November 12 Follow @kansasalps
This is a 44-million-year-old Ectobius cockroach from northern Europe — so a really old bug. (D.S. Shcherbakov)
On Tuesday, Microsoft patched a critical bug affecting Windows that researchers say could potentially allow hackers to remotely control users' machines. But the bug wasn't some recent mistake. The IBM researchers who found it say it has been around for nearly two decades, highlighting the difficulty of spotting and fixing bugs even in code that has gone through extensive review.
"Significant vulnerabilities can go undetected for some time," wrote IBM X-Force research manager Robert Freeman in a blog post on the problem. "In this case, the buggy code is at least 19 years old and has been remotely exploitable for the past 18 years." The bug was present as far back as the original release code for Windows 95, he says. 
The IBM team says it hasn't found any evidence that the bug has been exploited. Still, there's a whole market for previously unknown computer software bugs where cybercriminals and even governments bid for ways to hack into computer systems. IBM said that this newly discovered bug would have fetched six figures on this market, which occupies a legal gray area.
This isn't the first time major flaws have taken years to uncover. In 2010, a Google engineer uncovered a 17-year-old Windows bug affecting all 32-bit versions of the operating system and that could be used to hijack PCs. In September, another problem called " Shellshock " was discovered in a free software package built into some 70 percent of all devices connected to the Internet. It could have been introduced as long as 22 years ago, says Chet Ramey, the long-time maintainer of the code.
And there are other examples, like the infamous Heartbleed bug  that emerged in April and had gone undiscovered for two years.
So why does it take so long for seemingly important problems in critical systems to be discovered and fixed?
Part of it has to do with the process of software development and review. Writing code is not like a traditional engineering task such as building a bridge, where there are clear definitions for whether a project meets technical specifications. Code is a far messier medium, and it can be hard to know how the individual pieces will work together when combined into a final product.
Developers also do their own assessments of products, and in many cases hire testers to look for obvious flaws. But the true test of the security of a piece of software often comes after it has been released. That's when code is exposed to outside security researchers and hackers who start to pick it apart, looking for weaknesses.
Many companies, including Microsoft, offer financial incentives through  bug bounty programs  to make the process go faster. (There are people who make a living searching for bugs and collecting these bug bounties.)
But despite all these efforts, no one knows just how many bugs are out there, waiting to be discovered. And sometimes, it takes decades to find them.

Starbucks rolls out $200 'Silver' card

Starbucks' Silver Card
1988 CONNECT 77 TWEET 31 LINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORE
Think of it as Tiffany meets Starbucks.
It's not a diamond ring. Nor a gold watch.  But for a cool $200 this holiday season, most Starbucks stores nationwide will be selling the Limited Edition Sterling Silver Starbucks Card.
Until they're gone, that is.
It's a solid silver mini-card, the size of a key-fob card, attached to a sterling key ring and clasp.  It comes loaded with $50 for Starbucks food, drink and merchandise.
The other $150? Well, that's what Starbucks says is the retail value of the sterling silver card and key chain itself.  And if history is any guide, they'll sell out faster than you can say Frappuccino.
For Starbucks, selling a fancy-dancy holiday Starbucks card has become a wildly successful annual public relations ploy.  This is the third year -- and is the first year they've been sold in-store, not just on line.
About 43,000 of these cards will be made available in total -- two to 11 cards per store at the about 7,000 company-owned Starbucks stores in the U.S.
"It's taking the excitement of limited-edition cards and making them available to other people," says Linda Mills, a Starbucks spokeswoman.  On Nov. 1, Starbucks offered 1,000 of these cards on its website and they sold out within four hours, says Mills.
One expert in luxury marketing says the promotion's got legs. "This Starbucks play gets media attention and buzz going," says Pam Danziger, president of Unity Marketing. "Any publicity is good publicity."
But, she adds, it's got considerably less luster than that $450 Starbucks Metal card promotion that sold-out online last holiday and the holiday before that with $400 loaded onto each card.
Why has Starbucks cut the value of its priciest holiday card and, this time, taking it to the stores?  Is this a statement on the tough state of the economy?
"Customers told us that they wanted to have even greater access to our limited-edition, premium cards," says Mills.
Gilt snafu sells Starbucks Metal Cards early
Last year, consumers cried foul after Gilt, the luxury retailer that worked with Starbucks on what was then an online-only promotion, accidentally posted -- then un-posted -- the $450 Starbucks Metal card on its site one day before it was supposed to go on sale. Some folks not only bought the card ahead of time, but turned around and posted the collectible cards on eBay for as much as twice their value.
This time around, Starbucks has eliminated the middle man.  And it's promoting the cards in stores with signs that read, "A gift aglow with holiday sparkle."
The real Sterling Silver card won't be on display, but kept behind the counter "for security reasons," says Mills. You'll have to ask a barista if you want to actually see one, she says.

Can one get an injunction to enforce Godwins LawOne version of Godwin’s Law famously says that whoever analogizes one’s opponent to a Nazi (absent highly unusual circumstances) automatically loses the argument. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Co. v. Black (Cal. Ct. App. Nov. 6, 2014) brings that into actual law:
[Mr.] Dominique Black submitted a claim to his insurer, Fireman’s Fund Insurance Company. The claim was initially denied and, over the next couple of years, Black communicated with company representatives through letters, emails, and telephone conversations. In these communications, Black complained, often in vitriolic terms, that Fireman’s Fund handled his claim improperly, engaged in illegal activities, and had ties to the Nazi regime in Germany….
Black [believed that] Fireman’s Fund’s parent company, Allianz SE (Allianz) … had been aligned with the Nazi regime in Germany. He investigated purported misdeeds by Allianz during the Holocaust, and he implied to Lesser that Allianz never paid off on insurance policies that the company had issued to Jewish policyholders who were killed in concentration camps. Black claimed that, like Allianz, Fireman’s Fund engaged in wide-ranging financial and other improprieties.
Even before his claim was denied, Black sent a letter to the company’s director of automobile claims, copying other personnel, threatening to file a complaint with the California Department of Insurance (CDI), to use “social media to facilitate a viral consumer brand awareness campaign about Allianz’s history of ‘evil and corruption’ in a global boycott of Allianz products and stock until [Fireman's Fund] corrects its conduct,” and to pursue civil litigation “after this campaign.” (Italics added.) In the later onslaught of emails, Black frequently referred to the Allianz-Nazi connection. In a declaration Lesser submitted in connection with the anti-SLAPP motion, Lesser stated that in telephone conversations Black repeated his threats to launch a “social media campaign” against Fireman’s Fund and to associate it with Nazis….
[Black] charged that Allianz and Fireman’s Fund were “under the control of former NAZI collaborators,” and that Fireman’s Fund employees acted like “NAZI’s from the insurance industry” and had used “totalitarian tactics reminiscent of past Allianz executives,” while engaging Black in a “war of extermination.” …
At the end of September 2011, Fireman’s Fund sent Black a check for $8,994.95 for reimbursement of lost or stolen parts from the motor home and some of Black’s towing and storage costs. Black refused to accept it. Around this time, he sent a photocopy of a Web page design he intended to launch titled, “AllianzWatch … a voice for the consumer and investor,” which included the banner with a swastika, and with the following lead in: “De-Nazified 65 years ago…. Has the beast returned in Fireman’s Fund[?]“
Fireman’s Fund eventually sued, accusing Black of extortion, interference with business relations, and other misconduct.
[Fireman's Fund] requested injunction sought to prohibit Black from “[p]ublishing statements or images in any media and on any Web site stating that Fireman’s Fund personnel have committed crimes or fraud, or that associate Fireman’s Fund or its business practices with Nazis, with the conduct, practices or statements of the Nazi regime, or with the Einsatzgruppen”; from “using the word[s] ‘Allianz’ [or] ‘Fireman’s Fund’ in conjunction with the word ‘Nazi,’ the word ‘exterminate,’ and/or an image or images of a swastika …”; and from “[c]ommunicating with or contacting … Fireman’s Fund … employees with any communications that are alarming, annoying, harassing, intimidating, threatening, vile, ugly[,] or hateful.”
The Court of Appeal concluded that Black’s claims — both his Godwin’s-Law-condemned analogy of an insurance company’s payment practices to the conduct of Nazis, and his more historical claim of a connection between Fireman’s Fund’s parent company and actual Nazis — related to a matter of public concern:
Black contends, and we agree, that speech complaining about an insurance company’s allegedly illegal business practices in issuing, canceling, and substituting policies or processing claims must be considered speech on matters of public interest under subdivision (e)(4). Black’s complaints were not limited to his own isolated insurance claim but also included accusations that Fireman’s Fund suffered from internal corruption and was engaged in financial misconduct and “money laundering.” …
Black’s threat to publicize Allianz’s past relationship with the Nazi regime in Germany is also a matter of public interest. Information that an insurance company cooperated with Hitler’s regime — and failed to pay life insurance benefits to the beneficiaries of policyholders who were exterminated in concentration camps — might well affect consumers’ decisions about that company. The fact Fireman’s Fund itself was not a participant in these events, but is merely owned by Allianz, does not change our conclusion.
Nonetheless, the court concluded that Allianz stated a claim that Black’s speech was nonetheless tortious on various grounds, and that Fireman’s Fund could proceed with the case. Moreover, the court concluded that, if some of Black’s communications are “determined to be illegal [at trial], they can be enjoined from being repeated.” My sense is that the hyperbolic characterizations of Fireman’s Fund conduct as tantamount to Nazism would be constitutionally protected opinion, and couldn’t be enjoined; likewise, any factually true statements (or, more precisely, statements that Fireman’s Fund can’t prove to be false) about Allianz’s actions related to the Nazi era couldn’t be enjoined other. But if Fireman’s Fund can prove that specific “accusations of its unlawful misconduct were untrue,” then repetition of those specific likely could be enjoined as constitutionally unprotected defamatory falsehoods (even though the tort claim is brought under the interference with business relations tort, rather than under the tort of defamation). See Balboa Island Village Inn, Inc. v. Lemen, 40 Cal. 4th 1141, 1155-56 (2007), which authorizes such injunctions of speech that has been found to be constitutionally unprotected.
The line between civil extortion (here, essentially blackmail: pay me $X or I’ll reveal this information about you), proper litigation (here’s a Complaint I’ll file about you, with the unspoken message that the Complaint is likely to be picked up by the press or permissibly publicized by me, but I’ll be happy to settle the case before filing, if you’d like), and constitutionally protected speech (I’m publicizing how I think you’ve been refusing to pay me what you owe, but with the unspoken message that if you do pay up, I’ll stop) is famously vague, by the way. For more on this, see, for instance, this post .

Kate Middletons brother tries  fails to talk business on GMABy Emily Yahr November 12 Follow @emilyyahr

Those Middleton siblings — they really know how to leverage fame to do something that sounds way more fun than being a member of the royal family.
James Middleton, 27-year-old brother of Kate and Pippa, mostly shuns the spotlight. That is, until he has a marshmallow business to promote. He runs a company called Boomf, which creates personalized marshmallows with photos. His title is “Wonka-in-chief.” (Yeah, he definitely sounds weird and also like he is probably the coolest Middleton sibling.)

Theoretically, that’s why he showed up on “Good Morning America” Wednesday. Though just as when Pippa appeared on the “Today” show , “GMA” pounced to make most of the interview about the family members everyone really cares about: Princess Kate, along with 16-month-old Prince George. James was introduced as “the royal brother-in-law. . . brother to the future queen and uncle to the future king,” while his marshmallow business partner sat quietly beside him.
News anchor Amy Robach got right down to it, asking James about what it was like being part of Prince William and Kate’s royal wedding. He echoed Pippa’s “Today” response, that “although billions were watching, it felt like a family wedding.” And yes, his wedding gift to the couple was their puppy, Lupo.
After the wedding chatter, it was onto George — an excuse to show cute footage of the toddler . “I want to be the best uncle possible, like any uncle wants to be. ” James confessed. “I want to be the cool uncle, the fun uncle.” (No, he hasn’t gotten him a Christmas present yet, as we know you were wondering, but he’s mulling ideas.)

“How often do you get to spend time with your sister Kate and your nephew George?” Robach inquired.
“We’re a really close family,” James confirmed. “And actually, we see each other and speak on the phone all the time. . . the odd Sunday lunch, or pop in for coffee or something like that.”
Cut to: Robach and James taking a random walk outside as she grilled him about his future niece or nephew, due next spring. James said his sister is “on the mend” after suffering from acute morning sickness.
“We are hearing that she may come to New York,” Robach said, a bit too eagerly.
“I heard that too. Um — I — I, um, I don’t — I’m not — I don’t really know,” James said, looking a little fearful.
“We would be very excited to host her if she does feel up to it to come,” Robach pushed. She has obviously heard rumors that NBC is on the verge of signing Pippa (party-planning book author, Vanity Fair columnist) as a lifestyle correspondent. Better try to lock that up!
Afterward, James and his business partner, Andy Bell, appeared with the rest of the “GMA” gang — George Stephanopoulos, Lara Spencer — as they showed up with personalized Boomf marshmallows for the crew. (The name “Boomf” originated from that idea that if you taught a marshmallow to speak, that’s the first word it would say.)
Naturally, the topic quickly came back around to James’s royal relatives.
“There are great for kid’s birthday parties, things like that,” Stephanopoulos said, then pivoted: “James, I have to ask, are you making progress on being the cool uncle?”
“Well, I think there’s a long way to go to try and be a cool uncle. I’m just trying to be — yeah, as best as I can, really,” James said. “GMA” quickly used the opportunity to cut away to show video footage of George being adorable.

HCLs engineering unit may earn over $1-bn i...GH Rao president
(HCL Tech’s engineering…)
MUMBAI: The engineering and R&D division of HCL Technologies will likely cross the $1-billion mark in the next financial year as the company sees larger deals in a market that's widely expected to be the next big source of growth for the Indian IT sector. HCL Tech's engineering services unit contributed about 17% to the company's revenue in the September quarter, coming in at $245 million. The unit grew about 8.1% sequentially in the quarter.
"Earlier, scaling the accounts took a few years because clients would start out with small projects or give us parts of the product development. But now customers are starting to outsource bigger projects and we are seeing a trend where we can get work on an end-to-end product," GH Rao, president, engineering and R&D services, HCL, told ET.
HCL has outstripped rivals such as Tata Consultancy Services in revenue in this division. However, experts say that given how revenue is classified with the division, such as those accruing to product lifecycle management and technical publications, Wipro is also near the billiondollar mark in this business.
The unit has about 19,000 engineers, giving it scale in a sector that is expected to power future growth. And, unlike the IT industry, which has complained for years about the quality of graduates, ER&D has a strong supply from engineering colleges in India.
"It's a misconception that R&D requires specialised people. Our engineering colleges are training people in electronic and mechanical engineering. These students are wellsuited to the roles," Rao said. He added, however, that there was a little shortage at the more experienced levels but that, too, was beginning to get better.
India's ER&D services market is expected to reach $38 billion by 2020, according to research firm Zinnov , growing at about 12% a year over the period.

Microsoft to invest Rs 1,400 crore in India cloud data centres

(“The biggest cloud data…)
BENGALURU: Seeing a $2 trillion promise in India's cloud market, Microsoft has decided to spend Rs 1,400 crore on setting up three data centres in the country. In a filing with the Registrar of Companies, the US software giant said it has started work on setting up the cloud data centres in Mumbai, Pune and Chennai. The company is setting up local centres in a bid to capture the India market, especially customers in the banking and telecom industries, which have had data sovereignty concerns.
For Microsoft, which earned Rs 2,261 crore from India in 2013-14, the country is among the fastestgrowing cloud markets globally, with 2,000 customer additions each month. The company hopes to scale up its cloud offerings by setting up more global data centres.
"The biggest cloud data centres we have globally are capable of handling 600,000 servers in just one region. That's a massive amount of compute. Increasing this scale helps us in being more competitive," Corporate Vice President for Microsoft Azure Jason Zanders told ET.
Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella said during his visit to the country in September that he sees the India cloud computing market as a $2 trillion market opportunity.
Top cloud players have shown keen interest in setting up data centres in India in the past few months. IBM launched a centre in Mumbai this month and plans to add another one soon. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos had indicated in September that the company could set up its centres in India. The situation was quite the opposite about a year ago when all major companies shied away from India, citing infrastructural issues such as unpredictable power supply, patchy Internet connectivity, limited bandwidth and unreliable optical fibre connectivity.
"There is a huge demand for cloud services in India, especially among the SMBs (small and medium sized businesses) because of which companies like Microsoft are willing to spend so much on setting up data centres in India," said Sanchit Gogia, chief analyst at Greyhound Research. However, seeing high growth in cloud adoption in India, companies are working out ways to overcome such issues. IBM has set up multiple sets of power equipment and signed up multiple bandwidth providers to increase reliability for its Mumbai data centre.
Microsoft is in talks with telecom companies to connect large enterprises directly to their data centres, which will ensure faster and more reliable bandwidth. According to Gartner, the public cloud services market in India is expected to grow from $423 million Rs 2,550 crore) in 2013 to $1.3 billion in 2017. Gartner expects India to be the fastestgrowing market for cloud adoption globally.

Dow  S&P 500 dip  end 5-day streak of closing highsDow
(Dow and S&P 500 ended slightly…)
NEW YORK: The Dow and S&P 500 ended slightly lower on Wednesday, breaking their five-day streak of record closing highs as energy and utility shares lost ground, while the Nasdaq climbed.
Energy shares fell along with oil prices, with Brent crude oil breaking below $80 a barrel for the first time since September 2010. Shares of Exxon Mobil were down 1.1 per cent at $95.38, while the S&P energy index dropped 0.9 per cent.
S&P utilities slid 2 per cent and were the biggest drag on the benchmark index, reversing recent gains. The index is still up 7.6 per cent for the month so far.
The S&P 500 has rallied more than 9 per cent from a six-month low in October, buoyed by supportive economic data and corporate earnings. For the year so far, it is up 10.3 per cent.
"The overall environment has really shifted from negative to positive. We had our bounce back ... so the markets are fairly quiet, and I think investors are actually fairly comfortable right now," said Bryant Evans, portfolio manager at Cozad Asset Management, in Champaign, Illinois.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 2.7 points, or 0.02 per cent, to 17,612.2, the S&P 500 lost 1.43 points, or 0.07 per cent, to 2,038.25 and the Nasdaq Composite added 14.58 points, or 0.31 per cent, to 4,675.14.
Lifting the Nasdaq, Apple shares gained 1.4 per cent to $111.25, a record high. Shares of Twitter jumped 7.5 per cent to $42.54. It said during its first financial analyst day it is considering creating additional mobile applications.
Financial shares slipped after global regulators fined five major banks for failing to stop their traders from trying to manipulate the foreign exchange market. The banks included Citigroup Inc, whose shares dipped 0.7 per cent.
The day's gainers included retailers, with the S&P retail index climbing 0.6 per cent. Macy's Inc rose 5.1 per cent to $61.57 after upbeat earnings. Shares of Fossil jumped 8.4 per cent to $112.48, a day after its results.
  Shares of J.C. Penney fell 1.3 per cent in after-hours trading, while shares of Cisco Systems dipped 0.2 per cent, both after reporting results.
Among the day's biggest NYSE decliners, SeaWorld Entertainment slumped 9.4 per cent to $16.85 after earnings fell short of expectations.
NYSE advancers outnumbered decliners 1,669 to 1,410, a 1.18-to-1 ratio on the upside; on the Nasdaq, 1,645 issues rose and 1,029 fell for a 1.60-to-1 ratio.
About 5.9 billion shares traded on US exchanges, below the 6.6 billion average this month, according to BATS Global Markets.

(Brent crude slid below $80…)
NEW YORK: Benchmark Brent crude slid below $80 a barrel on Wednesday, extending a freefall in oil prices that began earlier this year, after Saudi Arabia's Oil Minister said the kingdom will not engage in a price war.
Fears of a spike in US crude stockpiles also weighed on oil markets. Inventory data due at 2130 GMT from industry group American Petroleum Institute could show a build of 800,000 barrels for the week ended Nov. 7, a Reuters poll showed. The US government's Energy Information Administration will issue on Thursday official inventory data for last week.
The only supportive factor for oil was news that an attempt to restart Libya's largest oilfield, El Sharara, had been abandoned on Wednesday due to a blocked pipeline.
Brent's front-month contract held below $80 a barrel in post-settlement trade, after finishing down $1.29 at $80.38. The session bottom was $79.84, which marked a low since September 2010. Brent has tumbled 30 percent from a June high above $115 on worries of an oil glut.
The front-month in US oil's West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude traded below $77, after settling down 76 cents at $77.18. The session low was $76.63.
Brent and WTI were down from early trade but their losses accelerated late in the afternoon, coinciding with the dollar's rally to a 14-month high against the British pound. The dollar index has jumped 10 percent since June on bets of an earlier than originally expected US interest rate hike.
Saudi Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi said during a visit to Mexico on Wednesday the kingdom wants stable oil markets and that talk of an oil price war was baseless.
More importantly, Naimi did not say if Saudi Arabia will support a cut in oil production at OPEC's meeting on Nov. 27, to shore up prices.
"Parsing his words sounds to me like the Saudis will not cut," said John Kilduff, partner at New York hedge fund Again Capital. "Holding on to their market position means more than anything else to Saudi Arabia now and that means holding on to their production."
Adding to the bearish sentiment, the Saudis, who are the No. 1 exporters of oil, said in OPEC's monthly report on Wednesday their output barely changed in October.

SC frowns on Toyota brass link to non-deploy...Tweet
SC likely to take a final decision on the issue today. The outcome could leave some effect on how overseas investors look at India’s judicial system.
NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday frowned on making all directors of the Indian unit of Toyota Motor parties to a criminal case filed by the owner of a Toyota Fortuner SUV, who accused them with cheating, forgery and criminal conspiracy saying that the airbags of the vehicle didn't deploy in an accident as assured by the company.
The court is likely to make a final decision on the matter Thursday and the outcome could leave some effect on how overseas investors are looking at India's judicial system. Panicky foreign investors had questioned an earlier SC order asking Samsung Electronics Chairman Lee Kun-Hee to come to India and face criminal charges after a supplier to the Korean major's unit accused it of failing to pay.
Gautam Sharma, the SUV owner, claimed that the non-deployment of the airbags had led to the death of his driver and him sustaining injuries in a November 2012 accident in Uttar Pradesh. He filed an FIR under sections 420 (cheating), 468 (forgery for the purpose of cheating) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) against Atul C Kirloskar, Vikram S Kirloskar, Shekar Vishwanathan and Sandeep Singh, all directors of Toyota Kirloskar Motor . The company was not made an accused.
The directors first moved the Allahabad High Court which dismissed their pleas on the ground that charge sheets had been filed against them in the trial court and that the court had already taken cognizance of the matter. The quartet then moved the top court.
An SC bench, comprising Chief Justice HL Dattu and Justices Madan B Lokur and AK Sikri, on Wednesday asked Sharma's lawyer Vivek Tankha to rethink his legal options. "Directors cannot be proceeded against vicariously," Justice Dattu said. "There's no such thing as vicarious criminal liability," he said. "You can't make all the directors party without first making the company a party to the case." Justice Sikri observed that he had to attribute a particular role to a director before making him a party to the case.
The court suggested that the complainant settle for compensation for his agonies and for the driver's family. Toyota, represented by senior lawyer Fali S Nariman , agreed to pay adequate compensation.
Tankha, Sharma's lawyer, resisted saying that those at the helm of affairs of a manufacturing company must be made accountable for any defects. "If your manufacturing centre is producing defective cars, isn't it negligence," he asked. He kept insisting that the courts ensure that some standards are adhered to by manufacturing companies and that they should not mislead consumers. The court observed that though his "fight" was "for a principle", it ought to be against the "correct, proper person" and gave him a day's time to rethink. The court will take up the matter again Thursday.
According to the complaint, the owner's manual had claimed that the car was fully safe and its airbags and seatbelts would save the lives of persons sitting in the car in the event of an accident. The company's claims were corroborated by the dealer, it had said. Since the car toppled over, and did not have a head-on collision, the front air bags which are supposed to inflate on impact did not open.
Sharma charged that the Toyota directors and the dealer were complicit in inducing him to buy the car with an objective to getting monetary benefits and hence should face prosecution for cheating and criminal conspiracy. In their plea seeking top court intervention, the directors argued that there was no "inducement" or "deception from inception" to make out a cheating case against them.

(“It is likely to use the…)
BENGALURU: Taxi hailing app Uber could set aside nearly half the amount from a proposed round of funding to grow business in India, its largest and fastest growing market outside of the US. "Uber could invest over $400 million in India," said two people familiar with developments. "It is likely to use the cash to strengthen presence where it has a footprint, expand to newer cities and to aggressively hire," said one source.
According to a report in the Wall Street Journal, Uber has informed its investors that it plans to raise more than $1 billion in funding which is likely to value the company at more than $30 billion.
Uber did not reply to email queries from ET on the developments. The Indian taxi aggregation space has been the hub of frenetic action in recent months, with companies like Ola, Taxi-ForSure and Uber, competing fiercely for market share . In October, Japan's Softbank led a $210-million funding round in Ola.
Experts are of the view that for Uber, India is an attractive market for the sheer scope that it offers for future growth. "The density footprint in Delhi or Bangalore is not even comparable to its fleet in say New York city. There is plenty of room for Uber to expand," said Arun Sundararajan, a professor at the Stern School of Business in New York whose research is focused on digital economics.
"In India there is a rapidly growing middle class and a lack of good infrastructure, so it makes a lot of sense for a company like Uber to take the market seriously."
The Indian taxi market is estimated to be worth about $9 billion (Rs 54,000 crore), of which only 4-6% is organised. There are around 2.3 million taxis registered in India.
"The aggressive money flow can be attributed to the fact that transport companies only need to leverage technology to reorganise an existing market," said Kartik Hosanagar, professor of ecommerce at The Wharton School, "This is often faster and more cost-efficient than creating new markets,' he said. Companies like Ola and Uber do not operate their own taxis but provide the technology platform that links taxi owners and operators with passengers.
Uber launched its Indian operations in September 2013. Since then it has expanded its network to include more than 15,000 drivers in ten cities including Calcutta, Mumbai, Bangalore and Delhi. The company is looking to hire more than 30 officials in India, according to its website, including government relations senior associate, and a strategic finance manager. Earlier this week, Uber also announced that it has partnered with financial services firms and automobile manufacturers to launch a vehicle financing program for Indian cab drivers.
Uber is backed by Goldman Sachs and Google Ventures, among others, and is reported to have clocked over $1 billion in gross bookings world over last year, with revenue estimated to be doubling every six months. The company is present in over 200 cities in the world.

NEW DELHI: Delhi Metro Rail Corporation will start selling the entry tickets of India International Trade Fair for business days from November 14 and for the general public days from November 19.
The business days for visiting the India International Trade Fair (IITF) are November 14-18 and for the general public, visiting days are November 19-27.
The IITF entry tickets for general public days will be available at all the metro stations except Airport Express Line, where tickets will be available for Trade Fair only at Dhaula Kuan station.
Therefore, general public is advised that in order to avoid last minute rush of purchasing tickets at Pragati Maidan Metro station, they shall purchase the tickets from their originating station, DMRC Executive Director (Corporate Communications) Anuj Dayal said.
Tickets for business days will be available only at 30 Metro stations -- Rithala, Dilshad Garden, Jahangirpuri, HUDA City Centre, Noida City Centre, Anand Vihar, Central Secretariat, Inderlok, Kashmere Gate, Rajiv Chowk, Barakhamba, Saket, MG Road, Noida Sec-15, Vaishali, Laxmi Nagar, Rajori Garden, Janakpuri West, Dwarka Mor, Dwarka Sec-9, Dwarka Sec-21, Mundka, Peeragrahi, Punjabi Bagh, Badarpur, Govindpuri, Lajpat Nagar, Mandi House, Janpath, and Dhaula Kuan.
IITF tickets for both business as well as general days can be purchased from Customer Care Centres of the stations from 8:30 AM to 4 PM on the above mentioned dates.
The tickets for business days is priced at Rs 400 and for general days entry ticket at Metro stations will be priced at Rs 50 (adult) and Rs 30 (child) on weekdays and Rs 80 (adult) and Rs 50 (child) on weekends/holidays.
The Delhi Metro will be operating 20 exclusive token or smart card counters from within the IITF-Pragati Maidan premises near its Gate number 10 from 1 PM to 9 PM on all general days, Dayal said.
The tickets will be sold from stations only for the same day as the tickets are day specific only and no advance tickets will be available for sale, he added.
  The DMRC is expecting massive crowds to use the Pragati Maidan Metro station and therefore additional ticket counters will be opened at Pragati Maidan Metro station. Additional DMRC officers and staff, customer facilitation agents and security staff will also be deployed at all stations, Dayal said.
At Pragati Maidan Metro station, IITF tickets will be available only for Metro users. People coming from outside Metro premises need to buy the tickets from ITPO Gate No 1 and 2.
During the general days, DMRC will be running peak hour frequency of 2 minutes 45 second on Line-3 from Dwarka to Yamuna Bank throughout the day i.e, from 8 AM to 8 PM. Besides this, two trains on each Line will also be kept as standby during Trade Fair to facilitate better passenger handling, whenever required, Dayal added.

Jan Dhan Yojana: Why numbers dont mean muchAgent
(Banks are giving Narendra…)
The aggregate numbers are designed to impress — 6.99 crore accounts have already been opened since PM Narendra Modi launched Jan Dhan Yojana on Independence Day, according to pmjdy.gov.in, a government website. But several concerns lie hidden beneath those numbers.
Under pressure, the department of financial services gave hard targets to banks, which in turn, transmitted the pressure to local staff and banking correspondents (BCs, agents who represent a bank on the field). "The pressure was so high that I told my staff to disregard norms on opening accounts only for the unbanked," admits the head of a Delhi-based banking correspondent company.
On the consumer side, the overdraft offered under JDY, the insurance policies bundled with it, and the fear of missing out on direct benefit transfers incentivised customers to open accounts.
However, the quality of the accounts opened is open to question. "Opening of multiple accounts has happened in an absolutely blatant manner," says the head of the BC company. Agrees Manoj Sharma, the MD of the Asia Pacific operations of Microsave, a financial inclusion think tank: "The question is whether these are first accounts or second accounts." Such duplicate accounts, a finance ministry official says, are now being weeded out.
This is not the first financial inclusion drive that India has seen. In 2009, the Reserve Bank of India directed banks to ensure banking access in all 348,000 villages with a population of above 1,000 by March 2013. This was followed by Swabhimaan — an overlapping financial inclusion drive launched by UPA2 in 2011 as a prelude to a shift to cash transfers.
Two problems that dogged these drives are likely to haunt JDY as well. It's not enough to open an account; people also need easy and reliable access to the bank. Then, once they get access to the bank, they need relevant financial products.
Right now, the banks and the government are working in a mission mode. But the questions will come once the accounts are opened," Says Kabir Kumar, a microfinance specialist at Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP). "How do you design the insurance and pensions such that they are useful for the poor?"
Last Mile Access
Banks are planning to add BCs to deal with the spike in account-holders instead of adding branches. However, India's experience with BCs has not been good. In erstwhile Andhra Pradesh, National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) payments through BCs were so late that the state government had to bring in an ordinance threatening penalties. "Banks, BC companies and village agents withhold the money meant for payments and pensions, earning interest off the float or rotating money in the local market, instead of paying it out quickly," says Sowmya Kidambi, the director of SSAAT, the social audit arm of the state rural development ministry.
Pratap Mandvi, a 40-something farmer in the predominantly Gond village of Madhogarh, about 70 km to the south of Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, is sceptical about BCs. He says villagers will worry the BC agent might vanish with their money. Villagers in Madhogarh say the Central Bank of India branch at Narayanganj has told them to visit only on Mondays. But it cannot process more than 100-150 people in a day.
"And so, the rest are told to come next Monday. But if I need money today, what will I do?" asked one villager.
  A bank official at the local Gramin bank, the sarpanch of a neighbouring village, and other villagers at Madhogarh confirm Mandvi's claim about restricted access, though employees at the local Central Bank of India denied any such restriction.
Open and Sleep
In financial inclusion circles, the poor response to previous FI drives has been misinterpreted as the need to educate villagers about the importance of saving — an explanation which fails to explain why rural India is seeing informal savings schemes like chit funds grow even as zero balance accounts lie dormant.
Take Madhogarh. Most people in this village of about 2,500 people already have bank accounts — almost entirely due to NREGA. However, very few save in the banks at Narayanganj, about 10 km away.
Instead, in recent years, a lot of villagers have invested in get-richquick schemes, ponzis, and companies which promise land in return for fixed payments and lost money. Says Mandvi: "The bank is the uchit sadhan (correct means) for saving money. But accessing that is hard — especially for poorer villagers."
Such ponzi schemes, says S Ananth, a Hyderabad-based rural finance researcher, are common in unbanked — or poorly banked — areas. The rise of such ponzi schemes — in one of the poorer parts of the country — illustrates both the latent demand for financial inclusion and the costs of it not being delivered.
That is the context that JDY has to operate in. But is it set up to deliver better outcomes than previous financial inclusion drives?

(Investors will receive…)
MUMBAI: Indian investors will soon be able to view their entire investments in mutual funds and securities held in dematerialised form with the depositories in a single consolidated account statement.
Capital market regulator on Wednesday kicked off the first phase of the project announced in the Budget this year to create one record for all financial assets of an individual.
The regulator said consolidation of account statement would be done on the basis of the Permanent Account Number (PAN). In case of multiple holdings; it would be PAN of the first holder and pattern of holding. Investors will receive the consolidated account statement on a monthly basis either through electronic mail or in physical form at the address registered in the depository system.
The consolidated account statement will be implemented from the month of March 2015 with respect to the transactions carried out during the month of February 2015. "If consolidated account statement comes with not much time lag, it will be an error-free source of information for both investors and individual financial advisors.
It is useful in effective monitoring of investments and subsequent investment decision-ma king," says Ashish Kehair, head, private wealth, ICICI Securities . Based on the PANs provided by the asset management companies, the depositories will match their PAN database to determine the common PANs and allocate the PANs among themselves for the purpose of sending the statement.
In case of PANs with only MF unit holdings, fund houses will continue to send the consolidated statements to their unit holders as is being done currently.
If investors have multiple accounts across the two depositories, the depository having the demat account which was opened earlier will be the default depository which will consolidate details across depositories and MF investments and dispatch the statement to the investor. But options would be given to the demat account holder by the default depository to choose the depository through which the investor wishes to receive the statement.
Sebi has asked AMCs to provide the data with respect to the common PANs to the depositories within three days from the month end. Depositories would then consolidate and dispatch the statement within 10 days from the month end. In case there is no transaction in any of the MF folios and demat accounts, then statement with holding details would be sent to the investor on a half-yearly basis.
Sebi has also asked depositories and fund houses to ensure data integrity and confidentiality in respect of the shared information is maintained. "The depositories shall utilise the shared data only for the purpose of providing CAS and shall not share the same with their Depository Participants. Where Depositories are required to share such information with unregulated entities like thirdparty printers, the depositories shall enter into necessary data confidentiality agreements with them," Sebi said.

TEV Project, the slot-car highway
Depending on the region in which they are registered, NEVs are limited by law (and usually, by engine output) to speeds below 25mph or 35mph. The best resemble earnest attempts at space capsules, the worst evoke street-legal golf carts (and often because they are, quite simply, street-legal golf carts).
But not the Cruser Sport. This forthcoming model from Ecocruise, a startup based in the Pacific northwest US state of Washington, sooner evokes a dune buggy than a municipal-course beverage cart. When you consider its pedigree, that makes a lot of sense.
Ecocruise is the brainchild of Steve Leighty, a veteran of the off-road motorsports industry, having founded Kasea Motorsports in the 1990s. Beginning by importing Chinese scooters, Leighty realised he could design and build sportier vehicles – ATVs, dirt bikes and motorcycles – himself, and ship the prototypes to China, Korea and Taiwan to be mass produced; the production versions were then sold back to customers in the US. Business prospered, but by 2004 Leighty was ready for a new challenge, and turned his attention to electric mobility.
The two-seater Cruser Sport is the first Ecocruise model to hit the streets, and it is anything but boxy, with a swooping carbon fibre body over exposed tubular steel, plus a covered rear hatch and T-tops. Exposed suspension and 14in aluminium wheels impart a beefy stance, and the bucket seats reinforce the off-road lineage. Safety – hardly an afterthought, even for low-speed neighbourhood electrics –  comes in the form of US Department of Transportation-approved safety glass and seatbelts, antilock brakes and a two year bumper-to-bumper warranty and three-year warranty on the lithium-ion batteries. Leighty claims that the topmost battery package will take the Cruser Sport up to 60 miles on a charge.
The car will retail for $8,500 to $11,900 in the US, depending on motor and battery options, when deliveries commence in January 2015. Shortly thereafter the company plans to release the more conventional one-seater EZIP-4 for around $3,800. A line of service and utility vehicles, including electric scooters, will follow. Distribution in the US is managed through a group of roughly 50 independent retailers, while in Europe, an expected partnership with UK’s Urban Mover will provide a readymade dealer network.
And lest the putter-perfecting neighbourhood-electric user be denied, Cruser Sports will soon  be available in golf-cart form, too.

Design ready for high-tech toiletsThe three designs approved by Delhi Urban Art Commission.
Written by Shalini Narayan | New Delhi | Posted: November 13, 2014 5:35 am
The Delhi Urban Art Commission (DUAC) is ready with the design of three prototypes of its high-tech public toilets. The toilets are part of its mandate from the Ministry of Urban Development to provide eco-friendly public toilets across the city.
Officials claimed the sudden rise in the number of vendors expressing interest to construct the prototypes came up after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Swachh Bharat Abhiyan was launched last month.
The ministry had reportedly mandated the department in 2012 to design environment-friendly and aesthetic toilets for public use. Sources said while the department had readied and put out its first prototype in June this year, the three other prototypes weren’t receiving enough vendors to implement the project in its first phase.
However, a senior DUAC official said that soon after Modi’s campaign for a clean city, 13 vendors approached the department expressing their eagerness to construct the prototypes. “Last week, we issued letters of intent to three vendors. The prototypes should be out in the next three months,” said a senior DUAC official.
The first bio-digesting toilet was installed in June this year by Mohan Rail Components (MNC) Kapurthala outside the Ram Manohar Lohia hospital. The toilet uses aluminum sandwiched honeycomb panels with stainless steel veneering for durability. The prototype has a bio-digestive tank which converts the bacteria into clean water.
The tank is placed in an underground chamber where the process of conversion into water takes place over three days. Officials said the water can either be recycled again or used for the purpose of horticulture.
They said the toilets, meant for twin sharing for both male and female, costs Rs 2.3 lakh to construct as a prototype. Once ordered in bulk, the cost can come down to Rs 1 lakh each. Officials said the first prototype has generated a good response with 7,000 users so far.
“We received feedback that the toilet could do with more natural light and so, the three new prototypes to be installed have more provision for light. The toilets are sensor-based and can be easily cleaned,” said the official.
Meanwhile, sources said various government departments including the DDA and the South Delhi Municipal Corporation have expressed interest in using the technical expertise of the department. Officials said once the vendors are finalised for the projects, the vendors themselves can liaison with the concerned government departments who can mass-produce such toilets across the city.
However, DUAC will add conditions to the agreement including using the DUAC logo at each of the toilets and will have a copyright on its design.

Pollution paper  please: 80 lakh cars  18 days to avoid scramble at pumpsPrint
By: Express News Service | New Delhi | Posted: November 13, 2014 5:31 am
The Delhi government is set to implement its decision to make pollution control certificates (PUC) mandatory for refueling at pumps and it has only 18 days to ensure 80 lakh vehicles comply. Lt-Governor Najeeb Jung had last month approved the proposal but there is now anxiety about a last-minute scramble.
Chief secretary D M Spolia on Wednesday took stock of the government’s preparedness and asked the departments of transport, environment, food and supply and the traffic police to work in tandem to create awareness.
Anticipating a rush of motorists to seek PUCs December 1 onwards, it was decided in Wednesday’s meeting to increase the number of PUC issue centres and keep them open longer. Delhi has about 80 lakh vehicles plying on its roads.
According to government officials, most of the filling stations house PUC centres. If owners or drivers are not allowed to replenish fuel, they will be able to avail PUC certificates at the filling stations on the spot and will then be able to refuel immediately.
The government will also call for applications for the sanction of new PUC centres at filling stations that do not have the facility at present. “A concerted action would be required to mitigate vehicular pollution,” an official said.
The validity of PUC certificates for Euro 4 vehicles is one year while it is three months for all other vehicles.
President of the Delhi Petrol Dealers Association, Atul Peshawaria, however, said, “This decision cannot be easily implemented. We were not consulted while taking this decision. It is not our job to check certificates. We are businessmen, not inspectors.”
He, however, said that the problem will not be the issuance of PUCs as there are about 300 PUC stations and retail stations with the facility. It is checking these certificates that is going to be difficult, he said. “What if there is a law and order problem? Will there be policemen deployed at our stations?” he asked.

Cuba wants to weaken UN resolution on North KoreaIn this file photo, Kim Un Chol, a spokesman for North Korea, attends a panel discussion at United Nations headquarters. Cuba is challenging a resolution in the UN General Assembly on human rights in North Korea.
By: Associated Press | United Nations | Posted: November 13, 2014 5:28 am
Cuba is challenging a resolution in the UN General Assembly on human rights in North Korea, seeking to cut key language about a referral to the International Criminal Court that has Pyongyang nervous.
The draft amendment obtained Wednesday by The Associated Press warns that such language sets “a dangerous precedent that could be applied in the future against any developing country.”
North Korea has been shaken this year by a groundbreaking UN commission of inquiry report that detailed widespread human rights abuses in the impoverished but nuclear-armed country and warned that leader Kim Jong Un could be held accountable.
The General Assembly resolution drafted by the European Union and Japan has more than 50 co-sponsors, but Cuba’s proposal is aimed at gaining the support of developing countries in Africa and elsewhere. Some have bristled at the idea of country-specific resolutions, worrying that they could be targeted, too.
A North Korean official who answered the phone at that country’s mission said he didn’t know how many countries were backing Cuba’s amendment and wasn’t able to comment further. The phone rang unanswered at Cuba’s mission Wednesday afternoon.
Japanese Ambassador Motohide Yoshikawa told the AP that “for sure” the EU-Japan resolution has more support among UN member states.
Yoshikawa also rejected North Korea’s recent efforts to try to get the language on the ICC referral removed in exchange for allowing a visit by the UN special rapporteur on North Korea or even the new UN high commissioner for human rights.
“This should not be linked as a bargain or a negotiation,” the ambassador said.
The EU-Japan resolution, which is expected to face a vote in the General Assembly’s human rights committee on Tuesday, would need the support of a simple majority to move to the full 193-member body. But if the amendment makes it to a vote and gets a simple majority, the resolution would be changed.
Lobbying for both approaches is now under way. Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and six other groups this week wrote to UN member states urging their support for the resolution, saying it “is the best way for the international community to encourage North Korea to make genuine progress in its respect for human rights.”
The resolution, which would be non-binding, echoes the recommendations of the UN commission of inquiry report, saying the UN Security Council should refer North Korea’s human rights situation to the ICC.
China, North Korea’s top ally and a permanent council member, has signaled it would veto such a move, but Pyongyang has been unnerved by the idea that its young leader continued…

In poll hurry  Rajnath puts depts on noticeRajnath Singh met senior officials of Delhi administration and Delhi Police on Wednesday.
By: Express News Service | New Delhi | Posted: November 13, 2014 5:25 am
Union home minister Rajnath Singh has sought a progress report from each Delhi administration department, including the chief secretary. The minister has asked the officials to work on departments with public dealing and produce better results.
Singh met senior officials of Delhi administration and Delhi Police on Wednesday. Elections on the horizon, Singh gave a December-end deadline to officials and asked them to show a proactive approach towards governance and services to the public.
He pulled up the Delhi Police commissioner B S Bassi over law and order problems in the state and asked why only a few women personnel had been deployed in the police control room (PCR) vans despite the proposal pending for long now.
He also took up the issue of Swachh Bharat and reportedly said the cleanliness drive should be better visible. He asked officials to focus on short-term goals so that visible changes in governance are made till December.
Singh asked about the status of Delhi government hospitals and wanted to know about the projects still pending.
Departments who were present at the meeting were PWD, health, urban development, Delhi Jal Board, the three civic corporations, transport, food and civil supplies and Delhi police.
According to the sources, the urban development department was asked to find out the way to work around the regulations that need to be amended. PWD also gave a presentation on upcoming projects.
Delhi Jal board has been asked about the Munak canal to ensure that South Delhi is not parched next summer.
About the civic bodies, the minister reportedly expressed displeasure at their working. Sources said corporations were asked to focus on collecting waste.

US: Supreme Court lifts hold on gay marriage in KansasThe US Supreme Court said Wednesday that same-sex marriages can go ahead in Kansas.
By: Associated Press | Topeka | Posted: November 13, 2014 5:21 am
The US Supreme Court said Wednesday that same-sex marriages can go ahead in Kansas.
The nation’s highest court denied the state’s request to prevent gay and lesbian couples from marrying while Kansas fights the issue in court. The state constitution includes a provision banning gay marriage, approved overwhelmingly by voters in 2005.
“Now, this is a day to celebrate,” said Tom Witt, executive director of the gay rights group Equality Kansas.
The US Supreme Court’s decision in the Kansas case came the same day a federal judge struck down South Carolina’s same-sex marriage ban as unconstitutional, opening the door to such marriages but also giving the state a week to appeal. The attorney general said he would do so immediately.
Gay marriage advocates have won a rapid series of legal victories in the US Same-sex marriage is legal in 32 states, the District of Columbia capital district and parts of Missouri.
A federal district judge last week blocked Kansas from enforcing its ban, saying it was in keeping with an earlier ruling by a federal appeals court that struck down bans in Oklahoma and Utah.
The judge’s ruling was supposed to go into effect Tuesday, but Justice Sonia Sotomayor temporarily put it on hold while the high court reviewed the case.
Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas would have sided with the state.
The ruling came in a lawsuit filed last month by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of two lesbian couples denied marriage licenses.
The legal situation was complicated in Kansas because state Attorney General Derek Schmidt filed his own case with the Kansas Supreme Court, seeking to block marriage licenses for gay couples. The Kansas court blocked further licenses while it reviewed the case and its order is still in effect, making it unclear how the US Supreme Court’s decision Wednesday will be applied in individual counties.
US District Judge Richard Gergel, ruling in the case of a same-sex couple from Charleston who sued to be married, found South Carolina’s state constitutional ban “invalid as a matter of law.”

Shah steps in to tell Delhi BJP how to winPrint
BJP President Amit Shah (Source: PTI)
Written by Pragya Kaushika | New Delhi | Posted: November 13, 2014 5:18 am | Updated: November 13, 2014 1:48 pm
Leaders of Delhi Bhartiya Janata Party met their national chief Amit Shah on Wednesday to take tips on running a successful election campaign. Shah is understood to have told the newly-appointed team to ensure victory by projecting Modi as the face of party and win as many as 60 seats in the 70-member Assembly.
At the meeting, party sources said, it came to everyone’s notice that Shah knew more of Delhi politics than the leaders had expected. A word of caution has been sounded to “consider themselves not as leaders but as workers, who are equal to any other worker of the BJP”.
Shah reportedly asked the leaders to work at the ground and reach every household. With Shah guiding the Delhi team, the pressure is now on the state unit not to lose these elections.
The leaders have been asked to win back “traditional” BJP seats like Shalimar Bagh and Model Town that the party lost in December polls.
The party’s Delhi in-charge Prabhat Jha told Newsline that they are now working on Mission 60-plus.
“We had a 272-plus target in national campaign and we got more than that. We would target 60 or more Assembly wins in Delhi,”
said Jha.
“In the Lok Sabha elections, we won in 60 Assembly constituencies with a comfortable margin, so we need to improve by winning more than 60.”
At Wednesday’s meeting, party leaders were told to prepare a manifesto that should reflect the Centre’s policies and not make promises that contradict them. Work on finalising the manifesto will start this week. Water and electricity issues may emerge as big promises.
Sources said, with little time left before polls, the party wants to ensure the Centre announces perks for Delhi. The sops could then be used to counter any criticism by AAP and Congress of the performance of the Modi government.

In the run up to the Delhi Assembly polls, the Aam Aadmi Party on Wednesday launched a drive called Delhi Dialogues — the groundwork to draw up a 50-point blueprint for a five-year government in the capital.
Party chief Arvind Kejriwal said at the launch that the party “will interact with people from different fields” and work towards making Delhi a “world-class city in five years”.
Elaborating on their initiative, Kejriwal said, “Our team will talk to experts as well as common residents to identify issues which will be incorporated in the blueprint. At an event organised every week, we will announce these issues.”

The first such event has been set for November 15 at Jantar Mantar, followed by discussions on November 26 on measures to be taken for women’s safety. “The party will talk about issues related to the youth and students of Delhi, about their aspirations and their problems,” Kejriwal said.
Senior AAP leader Yogendra Yadav connected the campaign to the party’s idea of swaraj. “The Aam Aadmi Party, from the beginning, has tried to give a new idea to the country in the form of swaraj. Delhi Dialogue takes this idea forward,” Yadav said.
Touted as a collaborative action to create a partnership between the government and the governed, Delhi Dialogues, aims to draw up an actionable plan for various sections through a series of discussions.
Yadav said, “Just before each election, all political parties release their manifesto. Hardly any discussion takes place on their content… We will present small sections of our manifesto so that there is discussion, debate and investigation of these issues. Delhi Dialogues represents a step forward for the party’s ideas.”
The campaign will be led by senior AAP leaders — banker Meera Sanyal, former journalist Ashish Khetan and former Apple sales head Adarsh Shastri.

Jan Dhan Yojana: Why nos don t mean much | CCI still needs to growAgent
(Banks are giving Narendra…)
The aggregate numbers are designed to impress — 6.99 crore accounts have already been opened since PM Narendra Modi launched Jan Dhan Yojana on Independence Day, according to pmjdy.gov.in, a government website. But several concerns lie hidden beneath those numbers.
Under pressure, the department of financial services gave hard targets to banks, which in turn, transmitted the pressure to local staff and banking correspondents (BCs, agents who represent a bank on the field). "The pressure was so high that I told my staff to disregard norms on opening accounts only for the unbanked," admits the head of a Delhi-based banking correspondent company.
On the consumer side, the overdraft offered under JDY, the insurance policies bundled with it, and the fear of missing out on direct benefit transfers incentivised customers to open accounts.
However, the quality of the accounts opened is open to question. "Opening of multiple accounts has happened in an absolutely blatant manner," says the head of the BC company. Agrees Manoj Sharma, the MD of the Asia Pacific operations of Microsave, a financial inclusion think tank: "The question is whether these are first accounts or second accounts." Such duplicate accounts, a finance ministry official says, are now being weeded out.
This is not the first financial inclusion drive that India has seen. In 2009, the Reserve Bank of India directed banks to ensure banking access in all 348,000 villages with a population of above 1,000 by March 2013. This was followed by Swabhimaan — an overlapping financial inclusion drive launched by UPA2 in 2011 as a prelude to a shift to cash transfers.
Two problems that dogged these drives are likely to haunt JDY as well. It's not enough to open an account; people also need easy and reliable access to the bank. Then, once they get access to the bank, they need relevant financial products.
Right now, the banks and the government are working in a mission mode. But the questions will come once the accounts are opened," Says Kabir Kumar, a microfinance specialist at Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP). "How do you design the insurance and pensions such that they are useful for the poor?"
Last Mile Access
Banks are planning to add BCs to deal with the spike in account-holders instead of adding branches. However, India's experience with BCs has not been good. In erstwhile Andhra Pradesh, National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) payments through BCs were so late that the state government had to bring in an ordinance threatening penalties. "Banks, BC companies and village agents withhold the money meant for payments and pensions, earning interest off the float or rotating money in the local market, instead of paying it out quickly," says Sowmya Kidambi, the director of SSAAT, the social audit arm of the state rural development ministry.
Pratap Mandvi, a 40-something farmer in the predominantly Gond village of Madhogarh, about 70 km to the south of Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, is sceptical about BCs. He says villagers will worry the BC agent might vanish with their money. Villagers in Madhogarh say the Central Bank of India branch at Narayanganj has told them to visit only on Mondays. But it cannot process more than 100-150 people in a day.
"And so, the rest are told to come next Monday. But if I need money today, what will I do?" asked one villager.
  A bank official at the local Gramin bank, the sarpanch of a neighbouring village, and other villagers at Madhogarh confirm Mandvi's claim about restricted access, though employees at the local Central Bank of India denied any such restriction.
Open and Sleep
In financial inclusion circles, the poor response to previous FI drives has been misinterpreted as the need to educate villagers about the importance of saving — an explanation which fails to explain why rural India is seeing informal savings schemes like chit funds grow even as zero balance accounts lie dormant.
Take Madhogarh. Most people in this village of about 2,500 people already have bank accounts — almost entirely due to NREGA. However, very few save in the banks at Narayanganj, about 10 km away.
Instead, in recent years, a lot of villagers have invested in get-richquick schemes, ponzis, and companies which promise land in return for fixed payments and lost money. Says Mandvi: "The bank is the uchit sadhan (correct means) for saving money. But accessing that is hard — especially for poorer villagers."
Such ponzi schemes, says S Ananth, a Hyderabad-based rural finance researcher, are common in unbanked — or poorly banked — areas. The rise of such ponzi schemes — in one of the poorer parts of the country — illustrates both the latent demand for financial inclusion and the costs of it not being delivered.

Android One faces stiff competition from Xiaomi & Moto; poses challenge for GoogleAndroid One faces stiff competition from Xiaomi & Motorola; poses tough challenge for Google
By Danish Khan , ET Bureau | 13 Nov, 2014, 06.15AM IST
The strategy was flawed, especially for a device targeted at a large segment of the population unlikely to have access to the internet.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
NEW DELHI: Early trends suggest that Indian consumers have given a lukewarm reception to Google's much-touted Android One devices amid intense competition from the likes of Xiaomi and Motorola, posing a tough challenge for the US company, which has made the standard the centrepiece of its emerging-market strategy for smartphones.
Import data for October showed Google's Android One partners — Micromax, Karbonn and Spice — together imported just over 2 lakh devices in the first full month of sales. This was less than the nearly 2.3 lakh handsets imported for the 15 days of September, data from market research firm Cybex Exim Solutions, available exclusively with ET, showed. The devices were launched in mid-September.
IDC analyst Karan Thakkar and Counterpoint Research Analyst Tarun Pathak said initial sales have been hurt by intense competition as well as the fact that Android One devices were initially only available online, which still has limited penetration in India. The strategy was flawed, especially for a device targeted at a large segment of the population unlikely to have access to the internet.
"For the month of October, roughly 8 million smartphones were shipped into the country, of which Android One would be just about 2.5%," said an industry tracker, who did not want to be quoted.
A Google spokesperson, however, said the devices were seeing "very strong sales and consumer interest", particularly in tier II and tier III cities. IDC's Thakkar, too, expects Android One sales to pick up in November and December. A person familiar with the matter said though Micromax's sales of its Android One device exceeded that of rivals, it managed to sell only about 1.2 lakh units till October end, as against a total of 2.50 lakh units imported. "They had anticipated huge demand for the device, and therefore had ordered a large stock." Micromax didn't respond to requests for comment.
Pardeep Jain, managing director of Karbonn Mobiles , said its Android One Sparkle V smartphone had performed below the company's expectations, adding that sales were also marred as supplies were available for only 15 days in October. "Traction has started coming now and demand is improving," he said. Prashant Bindal, chief executive officer of Spice Mobility, said sales were hit by supply issues. "We had faced an outof-stock situation during the month since there was no inventory coming from China."
A person familiar with the matter said that Karbonn and Spice, unsure about the product's prospects, had shipped low quantities, which were eventually sold out once they started offline sales in addition to online. "The factories in China couldn't suddenly cater to their requirements for additional stocks, thus creating a supply gap."
The two companies started selling their devices offline to push sales earlier in October, after their initial strategy of an exclusive online launch failed to gather momentum. The drawback with selling through retail stores is that it increases the cost of handsets.
Micromax imported 1.32 lakh units of its Canvas A1 device in October compared with 1.19 lakh in September. Karbonn brought in just 34,390 units of its Sparkle V handset in October, almost half the 67,440 units imported in September. Spice brought 34,390 units in October, compared with 43,100 units in September, according to Cybex Exim.
Android One devices are facing stiff competition from the likes of China's Xiaomi and Motorola - both of which are also selling only online -- as some of these models offer the same or better specifications at lower or similar price points. "Vendors such as Motorola, Gionee and Lava are providing stiff competition," said Pathak of Counterpoint Research. Experts added that these phones need to offer more features at lower price points, and that their unique qualities need to be more effectively communicated.
"The USP of Android One such as software updates and other Google services of the device were not publicised. That was another reason for the lukewarm response toward Android One devices," Pathak said, referring to the close integration of Maps, Google Now and other features.
Moreover, the inability of these devices to take pictures without adding an external card may have also hurt sales.
Success in India - among the world's fastest-growing and most price-sensitive markets -- is critical for Google, which plans to take the low-cost Android One devices to markets such as Indonesia , the Philippines, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka shortly. The US giant has tied up with new partners including Acer, Asus, HTC, Lenovo and Panasonic apart from India's Lava and Intex and chipmaker Qualcomm for the next set of handsets.

After 28 years: PM Modi s Australia trip to boost trade & investment | CoverageAustralia
(Modi, who is visiting Australia…)
NEW DELHI: In the first trip to Australia by an Indian Prime Minister in 28 years, Narendra Modi will engage with his counterpart Tony Abbott to boost trade, investment, energy and security partnership, and look for avenues to remove red tape that investors face in the two countries.
Following Modi-Abbott talks on November 17-18 in Canberra and Melbourne, India and Australia will ink five MoUs in the areas of social security, transfer of sentenced prisoners, counter-narcotics, culture and tourism, senior Australian government officials told ET.
"The relationship has come of age in the past three decades as we aim to realise full potential in the bilateral ties in wide-ranging areas from trade to security. We want to make this visit as fruitful as possible," said an Australian government official, requesting anonymity.
Modi, who is visiting Australia within three months of Abbott's visit to India as PM, will arrive in Brisbane on November 15 and cover Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne during his four-day trip, signalling an interest in expanding bilateral ties.
The social security agreement expected to be signed by the two countries will not only address hurdles faced by Indian professionals in Australia and vice versa but also help reduce costs of Australian businesses in India, officials said.
The agreements on transfer of sentenced persons and counter-narcotics will enable combating transnational crimes. India has emerged as a trans-shipment point for narcotics from Af-Pak-Iran regions to Australia, officials said. The MoU on culture entails festival of India in Australia next year as Indian culture and movies have emerged as big hits in the country down under.

Higher duty on crude & petroleum on cards to boost govt financesHigher duty on crude & petroleum products on cards to boost government finances

(The govt levies a Rs 50 per…)
NEW DELHI: The government is mulling higher duties on crude and petroleum products to try and ensure the recent sharp decline in international oil prices, apart from benefiting consumers by cutting fuel bills at the pump, also benefits the exchequer by helping it improve its stressed finances.
The first round of discussions on this issue was held last week in the finance ministry, which is grappling with ways to make up the likely shortfall in indirect tax collections. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley took stock of collections of indirect taxes on Saturday.
"There have been some preliminary discussions," said a senior official privy to the deliberations on the issue, adding that a decision would ultimately be a political one.
Apart from boosting revenue collections in the short term, another consideration in increasing levies — customs and excise — is to create a buffer of sorts that can be tapped into when international oil prices start rising again.
The thinking is that if all the benefits of softer crude prices are passed on to consumers now, revising prices upwards will cause a lot of angst once international oil prices start rising.
International oil prices have fallen nearly 25% in the past five months, in step with a global commodities decline. The country's average crude import cost, as measured by the Indian crude basket (a weighted average of crude from three sources) has fallen to $80.87 per barrel (Rs 4,970) on November 7 from $108.05 per barrel (Rs 6,331) on May 26, the day the Narendra Modi government assumed office.
Much of this decline has been passed on to consumers. Petrol prices are down to Rs 64.24 a litre in Delhi now from a peak of over Rs 76 in September 2013. Diesel is down from Rs 58.97 per litre to Rs 53.35 in Delhi and the fall in prices has even allowed the government to take the politically tough decision to decontrol prices of this most widely used fuel.
Another round of price cuts is expected this week. At present there is no import duty or excise duty on crude. The government levies a Rs 50 per tonne National Calamity Contingency Duty (NCCD) on imported crude. On domestic crude, it levies a cess of Rs 4,500 per tonne.
In the case of petroleum products, the central government charges a specific perlitre duty, which means fall in prices does not impact its revenue collections. At present a total of Rs 9.20 per litre of central excise duty is levied on petrol and Rs 3.46 per litre in the case of diesel.
One thinking among officials is that the government can raise this duty without consumers feeling any pinch as crude prices are forecast to remain subdued for some time. This is a window of opportunity that the government does not want to lose as revenues from excise and customs duty collections remain low because of the wider economic slowdown.
An increase in levies on crude and petroleum products will boost the government's faltering tax collections. In the first half of the fiscal year, it has managed to collect only 32% of the budgeted tax revenues and sections within the finance ministry favour some revenue-raising measures to ensure there is no fiscal slippage. Jaitley has made it clear in the past that the NDA government will not allow any fiscal slippage and rein in fiscal deficit at the budgeted estimate of 4.1% of GDP.

How to age gracefully with the help of dietYour diet doesn’t only make you healthy and fit but also helps in playing a big part in your ageing process. (Source: Thinkstock Images)
By: Indo-Asian News Service | London | Posted: November 12, 2014 9:37 am
Your diet doesn’t only make you healthy and fit but also helps in playing a big part in your ageing process. From increasing your antioxidants to eating more fruits, one can keep a count of a few diet tips to stay younger always.
Erin McCann, nutritional consultant, shares some advice on getting the right nutrients from your diet to help you age gracefully and naturally too, reports femalefirst.co.uk.
Increase your antioxidants: Antioxidants play an important role in reducing inflammation, repairing damaged cells and restoring balance throughout the body. These actions aid in prevention of chronic disease such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer. They also aid in reducing the signs of ageing by repairing damage to the skin from sun and pollutants and improving skin elasticity. Increase antioxidants by:
* Eating more fruits, like berries and citrus fruits and vegetables like leafy greens and squashes.
* Take a quality, natural supplement containing antioxidant rich plant extracts.
Maintain a balance between Omega 3 and Omega 6 Fatty Acids: The balance between Omega 3 and Omega 6 fatty acids is important for reducing inflammation in the body, supporting cognitive function and for maintaining cellular. This balance can be maintained by:
- Reducing processed, refined foods and takeaways in your diet.
- Eating fresh oily fish like wild salmon, mackerel, haddock and sardines 3 or more times a week.
- Cooking with coconut oil as an alternative to butter, margarine and other oils.
Eat balanced meals and snacks regularly: Research has found that excess insulin can speed the ageing process and create inflammation in your body. You can balance insulin and blood sugar levels by:
- Eating meals with a combination of complex carbohydrates, quality vegetarian or lean animal proteins, and antioxidant rich vegetables.
- Having quality snacks between meals, such as hummus with vegetables or oatcakes, to maintain energy and balance insulin levels.
- Reduce stimulants like coffee which can increase insulin production.
Exercise regularly: Exercise not only aids in weight management but it supports your body with improving energy production, immune function and bone density. Increase your exercise throughout the day by:
- Taking a brisk 20 minute walk each day.
- Opt to use the stairs or walking to destinations when you can.
- Incorporate resistance training into your regime such as yoga, pilates or weights
Support immune function: As you age, your immune system may not work as efficiently. A well-functioning immune system will aid your body’s natural defences against infection and chronic illness. The best ways to support immunity are:
Get adequate sleep and rest.

Anand hits back in style to level scores

TOPICS
chess
The Indian’s win is the first over the champion in Classical time format in four years
As the popular phrase goes, “Revenge is a dish best served cold.” But in a match for the World chess title, the sooner you get even, the better it gets.
On Tuesday, how much better Viswanathan Anand was feeling on avenging Sunday’s defeat to World champion Magnus Carlsen could be gauged by the return of his customary, disarming smile. By hitting back with white pieces in Game 3 of the 12-game World championship match in Sochi, Russia, Anand has levelled the score to 1.5-1.5.
Psychologically, Anand has gained a little more.
So how did Anand, looking for his first victory over Classical format since December 2010 turn it around to bring his head-to-head record to 7-7 on Tuesday?
Well, it was Anand’s preparedness in the opening lines that took Carlsen unawares. He involved Carlsen in a sharp theoretical debate and eventually had the final word.
As Anand revealed, “I’d seen the position as far as Qxb6 (Move 24) and even beyond.” This threw some light on the depth of preparations Anand had put in, in this particular variation of Queen’s Gambit Declined that Carlsen opted on this day.
It was clear that the change of response from Grunfeld Defence (seen in the first game) to Queen’s Gambit Declined against Anand’s consistent queen-pawn start, made Carlsen realise he was caught on the wrong foot.
Poor opening
“It was the kind of game where everything went wrong from the start. It sucks,” was how Carlsen chose to put it and said,
“It was obvious that he (Anand) was better prepared than me. I made a poor choice of opening today. I can’t do much worse than that.”
Though Anand mentioned the game played at Bilbao between Levon Aronian and Michael Adams, there was another game that looked similar to the one the Indian won on this day.
Curiously, the sequence of moves, until Anand’s 26th turn, almost resembled the ones played between Evgeny Tomashevsky and Alexander Riazantsev in the 2008 Russian Superfinals.
In fact, in that game, Tomashevsky emerged victorious in 36 moves.
Playing at a pretty brisk pace, Anand temporarily sacrificed a queenside pawn in order to push the queen-bishop pawn to the seventh rank by the 14th move. That also meant Carlsen could not move his queen away from the square that blocked Anand’s advanced pawn from becoming a ‘queen’.
Soon, except the dark-squared bishops, the other minor pieces were off the board.
Anand, almost blitzing his moves compared to Carlsen who consistently fell back on the clock, slowly enlarged what began as a miniscule advantage out of the opening.
He got back the pawn once his queen got into the thick of action.
Castling on the kingside allowed Anand’s other rook to take care of any possible threats from Carlsen’s queen-rook pawn on the sixth rank.
Time advantage
All this while, time slowly turned in Anand’s favour. Deep in thought in search of precise continuation, Carlsen took 32 minutes to play the 17th move and another 45 minutes to advance from Move 22 to 27.
Anand was unrelenting. By the time Carlsen played his 28th move, he was left with under six minutes for 12 more moves to complete the stipulated 40 in two hours.
An exasperated Carlsen traded his rook for a bishop in order to elude Anand’s grasp but in vain. Like Carlsen on Sunday, it was Anand’s turn to get his two rooks and the queen in one file before landing the knockout punch.
When Carlsen gave up on the 34th turn, he had only 13 seconds remaining as compared to Anand’s s had 28:54 minutes.
This was also the third time that Anand had levelled the match-score in a world title clash after trailing. Against Veselin Topalov in 2010 and Boris Gelfand in 2012, Anand bounced back from deficit to keep the crown.
But in Game 4, Anand can only expect Carlsen to come very hard at him.

Draft aviation policy draws flak
Lalatendu Mishra
A draft policy on civil aviation was released by the Ministry of Civil Aviation on Monday.
TOPICS
air transport
The draft civil aviation policy, released by the Ministry of Civil Aviation, on Monday has drawn criticism from experts who said it lacked substance.
“I can’t call this a draft policy. These are broad statements of intent. More depth will be required before policy is formalised,” said Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation (CAPA) Chief Executive Officer (South Asia) Kapil Kaul. “The draft civil aviation policy reads like a feel-good document, bereft of specifics on burning issues like aviation turbine fuel (ATF) taxes, maintenance repair and overhaul (MRO) taxes, airport charges and general aviation. Most of the points are ‘statements of intent’ and are ‘work in progress’ anyways,” said Amber Dubey, Partner and India Head of Aerospace and Defense at global consultancy KPMG.
He said going by the announcements, there would be no ‘open skies’ in India and, hence, bilateral traffic would continue to be constrained by the ability of Indian carriers to deploy equal capacity.
“Air India will not be privatised, and will be guided by yet another ‘expert committee’ for its revival,” Mr. Dubey said.
He said there was no mention of the Essential Air Services Fund (EASF) that was supposed to fund loss making routes, as proposed by the government’s own Naresh Chandra Committee in 2003.
“The long-pending Air Navigation Services (ANS) corporatisation is delayed further. There is no concrete policy measure to bring back the MRO revenue that India loses every day. The policy puts no pressure on the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) to adhere to time limits for various clearances,” Mr. Dubey added.
As regards to listing of the Airports Authority of India (AAI) and Pawan Hans, there was no proposed timelines, the aviation expert said.
“Overall, the draft civil aviation policy is not very helpful. The dozens of policy suggestions that the industry gave to the Ministry have been ignored. Indian aviation will continue to struggle for relevance, policy support and profitability”, Mr. Dubey added.
However, Ankur Bhatia, Executive Director of Bird Group, welcomed the draft policy stating that at least a beginning has been made.

India chief Latif Nathani meets Nirmala Sitharaman
eBay India Managing Director Latif Nathani on Tuesday met Commerce and Industry Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to discuss the prospects of the $3 billion burgeoning e-commerce industry in the country.
Mr. Nathani said eBay had 50,000 sellers on its platform, of which 15,000 sell across the globe.
“That is a huge opportunity with the government charter of ‘Make in India’ because these 15,000 sellers are mostly artisans, craftsman and they are exporting India’s products and India’s culture abroad,” he told reporters after the meeting.
He added: “This is closely aligned with the government’s plan of ‘Make in India’, and I think the Minister was very receptive to what we are doing and appreciative of that.”
It was an “introductory, courtesy meeting” with the Minister, Mr. Nathani said, adding that eBay had been in India for nine years and “we are the largest market place in India, so wanted to talk with her about our history in India and about prospects of e-commerce.’’
Asked if the issue of allowing FDI in online retail came up for discussion, he replied in the negative.
“We do not talk about that because eBay doesn’t get affected with the FDI policy,” he said. Besides the growing base of sellers, the global marketplace major is betting big on mobile technology to propel its growth in the country. “We are looking at significant expansion. We are bullish on mobile commerce. For example, we have come out with new products on mobile web and mobile app. Mobile is a big area for us,” he said.

Coimbatore, November 10:  
The United Forum of Bank Unions (UFBU) has decided to go ahead with the all-India bank strike on November 12, as their bid to arrive at a consensus ended in a stalemate.
Talking to BusinessLine from New Delhi, General Secretary of AIBEA (All-India Bank Employees Association), CH Venkatachalam, said: “We had direct negotiations with the IBA (Indian Banks’ Association) this morning. It lasted for two-and-a-half hours.”
Inflexible
The IBA, he said, has stuck to its earlier stand of 11 per cent, contending that banks had no money to pay more. UFBU, on the other hand, tried to be more flexible by scaling down the demand from 25 per cent to 23 per cent.
“We met the Chief Labour Commissioner later in the day, but there was no progress.
“As our demands remain unresolved, we have decided to go ahead with our strike call on November 12.
“The relay strike proposed in December also stands,” Venkatachalam added.

Amazon plans it big with India Post for deliveriesAmazon plans it big with India Post network to ramp up its delivery mechanism

(The government has sought…)
NEW DELHI: E-commerce giant Amazon wants to do in India what Alibaba did in China. Amazon's India head Amit Agarwal on Tuesday met telecom and IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad and urged him to allow the use of new technologies such as real-time tracking and monitoring devices on the India Post network to develop a delivery mechanism based on smart logistics.
The government has sought a detailed proposal from Amazon, to which it will respond, a person familiar with the details of the meeting told ET. Amazon wants to leverage an improved India Post network to ramp up its delivery mechanism to within 24 hours anywhere within the country.
Agarwal was accompanied for the meeting by Monique Meche, Amazon's vicepresident for international public policy. In an emailed response to ET's query, Amazon said that it is "looking for ways to deepen" its relationship with the Indian postal service which started last year. It currently uses the Indian postal services as a delivery channel, but it is looking to deepen this further, in line with what Alibaba did in China.
Alibaba was the first e-commerce company to tie-up with a government postal agency in China. Right before it hit the capital markets with a multi-billion dollar issue, Alibaba tied up with China Post to share warehouses, processing centres and delivery resources, all part of a smart logistics network providing easier and faster delivery services to online sellers. Prasad also discussed prospects for pushing trade and commerce in rural parts of the country in a big way and how e-commerce websites such as Amazon could play a big part in giving a platform to small-time retailers and entrepreneurs in the hinterland through its market place models.
 
With over 1.6 lakh post offices throughout the country with the lion's share of 1.4 lakh in rural areas, India Post claims to have the largest postal network in the world, according to its website. On an average, a post office serves an area of 21.2 sq km and a population of 7,175 people.
"Speed of the last mile delivery to a customer will be the most decisive factor in an already price competitive e-commerce landscape and Amazon wants to leverage on the well-penetrated postal network," a second executive who did not want to be identified told ET.
Interestingly, Amazon's proposal comes in the wake of the special task force constituted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in October to enhance the role of India Posts in financial inclusion and trade. The committee headed by former cabinet secretary TSR Subramanian will submit its report by the year end. India Post had also tried to get a banking licence but had failed, and is now looking to become a 'payment bank', one which can accept deposits and remittances but cannot lend.
"The government would obviously review any proposals made by Amazon under the light of the recommendations made," the second official said. On a lighter note at the meeting, Prasad referred to Amazon's arch-rival, homegrown e-commerce major Flipkart, and asked Agarwal who would win the e-commerce war between the two majors in India. "The consumer," Agarwal responded.
Surging growth of the e-commerce sector in India has led to a fund-raising spree by companies in the sector. Most recent being Japan's Softbank Corporation's $627-million investment in Snapdeal, which was preceded by $1-billion fund raising by Flipkart. A day after Flipkart concluded its fund raising, Amazon committed investment of $2 billion in India. In the meeting, Agarwal further discussed setting up of a data centre in India for which the company readily agreed to put up a server. Microsoft was the first technology giant this year to announce the setting up of three data centres in the country.
These data centres will enable access to customers in banking and financial services as well as the central and state governments. Many such services are currently legally restrained as they require data to be hosted within the country. Owing to which Amazon put forth the proposal to set up a server within India.

Snapdeal  Amazon no match for Alibaba on sale dayAlibaba Group
(The two companies were still…)
BENGALURU | NEW DELHI: Twenty minutes was all it took for Alibaba to clock its first $1 billion (Rs 6,100 crore) in sales during China's biggest online shopping event, the 'Singles Day Sale,' on Tuesday.
Alibaba Group had crossed $7.7 billion (over Rs 47,000 crore) in sales by 8 pm Beijing time, a full $1.7 billion (over Rs 10,400 crore) more than the estimated size India's online retail industry will reach in 2015, according to research firm Gartner.
Snapdeal and Amazon, in India, also had their own sales on Tuesday, maybe hoping that some of the Singles Day — it is China's version of Valentine's Day — magic will rub off on them. Snapdeal's Savings Day sale featured hourly deals and steep discounts across categories. Amazon India restricted its sale to users of its mobile application in an attempt to increase app downloads. Shoppers on the app had offers like a chance to win 11 months of free shopping of products worth Rs 11,000 per month.
The two companies were still collating data on how much they had sold until the time of going to press and hence declined to share sales figures with ET.
But price comparison and couponing portals registered an uptick in traffic to Snapdeal. Consumer traffic to Snapdeal through cashback and couponing site CashKaro was seven times higher compared to regular days by 3 pm. Conversion of clicks from the site to transactions on Snapdeal was about 25% higher than normal. Price comparison portal MySmartPrice, which typically gets traffic of six lakh a day, saw a 200% increase in click-through traffic to Snapdeal, until 4 pm when the data was collected, as compared to the pre-Diwali sales on October 6 when Snapdeal sold goods worth Rs 600 crore.
The two portals denied that they chose the date keeping in mind China's Singles Day, a day of massive online sales organised by Alibaba for the first time in 2009.
Since then other Chinese sites have also organised sales on the same date every year. "We wanted to create a special day for the app and reward our app users. We chose 11/11 due to the unique nature of the date," said an Amazon India spokesperson. The sales events organised by Snapdeal and Amazon India on Tuesday were much more low-key compared to the Singles Day sales organised by their Chinese counterparts. A chunk of customer buzz that was generated was negative.
Snapdeal's social media feed on Tiwtter and Facebook were filled primarily with rants and complaints from customers. "Whenever I click on any products it says "The product is not available"...and it takes like ever to checkout and pay for a product," said Parthiban Annadurai on Facebook. These issues proved helpful for competitors. "We witnessed an incremental shift of over 25% to other e-commerce portals among shoppers, mainly between 7 am and 9 am, and 11 am and 12 noon on tuesday," said Rohan Bhargava, co-founder of CashKaro. But industry watchers said it is unfair to compare the performance of Indian sites with their older Chinese counterparts.
N Chandramouli, CEO at Trust Research Advisory, said Snapdeal has in fact been smart about the sales.

Prabhu s path breaking ideas to bring IR back on trackboard member
(“The Rail Land Development…)
NEW DELHI: Railway minister Suresh Prabhu has some path breaking ideas to bring the loss-making retrograde organisation back on track. He has promised new ideas, cutting of red tape, decentralisation and empowering of zonal railways.
Senior railway officials with whom he shared the ideas were impressed but also wary of implementation. Among things that Prabhu talked about are decentralisation of authority from the Railway Board to the zones, incentivising GMs for timely completion of projects and leveraging vast tracts of railway land to raise credit for the cash-strapped organisation. Prabhu was not in favour of privatisation of railway land or leasing it to private builders.
He talked of getting foreign investment into the sector, especially from Japan , which is already funding the Dedicated Freight Corridor (DGC) project of the railways. "All very good and radical ideas but will need a complete change in the way the 161-yearold organisation has been functioning. It will turnaround the railways if the minister can implement them," said a senior railway official .
As per sources, Prabhu is in favour of decentralisation of tendering process to the respective zones. As per the current procedures, most high-value tenders — over `150 crore — come to the Railway Board and are cleared by the minister himself. "He made it clear that he doesn't want time to be wasted in the entire long-winding process and wants GMs to be empowered to handle the tenders at the zonal level. This would also reduce corruption," said the railway official.
However, a railway board member , cynical after over three decades spent in the organization, said that this will only prevent political corruption — the minister will not be able to influence the tendering process. "What about the bureaucrats? Senior railway board members including the Chairman Railway Board will be able to influence the GMs in the tendering process. After all, their ACRs, transfers and postings are taken care of by Rail Bhawan," he said. Moreover, he added, the specifications of the tenders were all issued by the Railway Board, and they were often used to favour some party or the other.
Railway officials said the idea of not privatising railway land or giving it on long-term lease was completely different from what railways have been working on for past decade. "The Rail Land Development Authority was set-up to use the ample railway land as an asset to raise money for the railways. The RLDA had finalised several contracts," said another officer .
"The idea may be good but it will require either scrapping of RLDA or new set of rules to be made. As of the now, the Railway Act does allow for mortgaging of the land. It is a government asset and we do not have the authority to mortgage. RLDA allows us leasing and even outright sale but not mortgaging," he explained. Prabhu refused to comment and said he will talk only after a month when he settles down in the ministry.

NEW DELHI: Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu today promised to have an effective complaint redress system and bring about accountability on the part of officers in rail functioning.
"We will launch a portal for getting feedback from general public. There will also be a redress section to communicate with the complainants about the action taken," Prabhu said here.
Focusing on passenger service, he said there should be an effective feedback system to know the prevailing condition.
Railways is being flooded with complaints of bad quality food, unhygienic condition at rail premises and lack of punctuality in train operation among others.
He said there will be a linkage with the Indian Railways website from the portal.
Asked about his plan of action in the coming days, new Railway Minister said there should be improvement in passenger services.
"There are about 2.5 crore passengers travelling on trains daily and my endeavour would be to see that if there could be even five per cent improvement in services," he said.
He also stressed on bringing accountability in railways. "There should be accountability on the part of officers also."
Asked about the many senior posts lying vacants, he said "I am yet to apply my mind to it."
On proposed bullet train projects, he said that the main focus will be on improving train services for mass travelling.
"Bullet train projects between Mumbai and Ahmedabad or any other destination will continue. But the percentage of passengers in such trains will be just about 5 per cent of total passenger segment of railways. So we will be more focused on services for maximum passengers," he said.
Railways have identified eight routes including Mumbai-Ahemedabad for running bullet trains and nine routes including Delhi-Agra for semi-high speed trains.

Govt makes toilet photos must to end bogus claimsBindeshwar Pathak
(Modi-govt to launch a pilot…)
NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Swachh Bharat mission is going tech savvy—not to involve more people in the movement but to ensure that toilets are actually built. It will now be mandatory for those using government money to construct household toilets to upload pictures of the finished lavatories on the database of the Ministry of Drinking Water & Sanitation using an app. Details of location and maintenance will also need to be provided. A pilot project will be launched next month in 2,000 villages across the country.
The move is aimed at ending false claims of building toilets and at preventing duplication. A government study last year showed that over 87 per cent of toilets that were said to been constructed over 10 years as part of a total sanitation campaign in Madhya Pradesh were not built. In Uttar Pradesh, this figure is about 78 per cent. "Millions of bogus toilets exist, especially in remote villages, where officials rarely visit. Several people from the panchayat to block level are involved in the scam. Funds are given when construction of toilets begins and often work is suspended," said Bindeshwar Pathak , founder of Sulabh International, an organisation that constructs toilets for the public.
The government pays each person up to Rs 12,000 now for building a toilet and so it has become important to account for the money, an official working on the project said. The payment process will also change, with only half the amount to be paid in advance. "The government should also ensure the owner of the toilet is in the photograph of the toilet to ensure no duplication takes place," said Pathak.
Most companies that build toilets as part of their corporate social responsibility in collaboration with the government and NGOs are known to submit pictures of finished toilets to the ministry and carry out regular supervision for a year. While people are being trained to use the app, the government also plans to make the process of submitting forms for building toilets online to avoid multiple channels of fund distribution.
"Nearly 50% of the money would be given to beneficiaries after the scrutiny of forms, the rest would be given to them after the toilets are built and photographs sent to the ministry," an official said. Officials believe the measure will help to break the local contractor-bureaucrat-politician nexus in building toilets that exists in many states.
"Also, in many villages, government money was used to build onepit toilets, which were of no use after some years as the pits made were too small. Photographs of toilets will help us know if the toilets are built according to prescribed standards," a government official said.

Make clean energy integral part of Swachh Bharat: Punjab governmentMake clean energy integral part of Swachh Bharat: Punjab government
PTI Nov 11, 2014, 08.05PM IST
CHANDIGARH: Punjab government today sought Prime Minister Narendra Modi's intervention to make clean energy as an integral part of the 'Swachh Bharat' mission.
"The government requests Modi to make clean energy as an integral part of Swachh Bharat Mission to save future generations from long term adverse effects of pollution from traditional sources of energy," Punjab's Non Conventional Energy Minister Bikram Singh Majithia said here.
Inaugurating a conference on 'Roof Top Solar Power generation under Net Metering Policy' here, he said that it was imperative to give a big boost to clean energy including solar, hydel, wind and bio-mass which could be achieved only by mission mode.
"As the Prime Minister has made Swachh Bharat Pan India mission, making clean energy as part this mission will serve twin purposes of making India power surplus without polluting environment," he said.
Seeking liberal tax concessions, subsidised loans including income tax breaks for clean energy projects, Majithia said that the Prime Minister must take initiative to make India number one country by harnessing clean energy by including it in Swachh Bharat Mission.
He advocated the need for ensuring availability of low interest rate loans and income tax incentives for setting up of new renewable energy projects to make these more economically viable.
Citing the example of Dera Beas, near Amritsar, for setting up of one of the largest roof top solar power project of 7.5 MW in just eight months and their further plan to add 27.5 MW, Majithia said that such success stories need to be publicized in a big way.
He said that Union New and Renewable energy Minister Piyush Goyal in his last visit to Punjab has in principle approved a 2000 MW 'Solar Power Park' throughout the state and the Punjab government was roping local governments both corporations/councils and village panchayats for making available required land.
He said that Punjab has already taken a step by enhancing its solar power capacity up to 6 times in last two years besides completing around 40 MW of solar power generation five months in advance out of the ongoing 250 MW such projects under implementation with deadline of March 2015.

Any alliance with BJP only after polls: Sajjad LoneBJP
("Peoples Conference will…)
People's Conference leader Sajjad Lone had on Monday met Prime Minister Narendra Modi, leading to speculation that his party would partner BJP to form the next government in J&K. Lone tells ET in an interview that it was a courtesy meeting, while not ruling out an alliance with BJP after elections. Excerpts:
What did Prime Minister Narendra Modi and you discuss on Monday?
Sajjad Lone: We did not discuss politics. We talked about floods, rehabilitation, having Srinagar in the list of smart cities, development and the northern corridor. Mr Modi gave me his vision for Srinagar.
Why did do you meet other BJP leaders then?
Sajjad Lone: I have social relations with BJP leaders for more than 10 years. If some of them are in Srinagar, we would meet over tea. I met Mr Modi for the first time, but social meetings with other BJP leaders are routine. Congress is a national party but its leaders do not maintain social connections even though it has local presence. BJP lacks local presence, but has kept in touch.
What are the prospects of an alliance with BJP?
Sajjad Lone: Peoples Conference will fight the assembly elections alone. We would not have an alliance. Once results are out, we may think of one. I am not ruling out anything.
Is BJP ideologically different from Congress?
Sajjad Lone: Both of them adhere to a national policy on Kashmir. But when BJP is in power, it has been more liberal than Congress. Mr Vajpayee was more liberal than Dr Manmohan Singh. He was forthcoming in his utterances and spoke from the heart. But on Article 370, autonomy etc, I hardly see any difference between the two. The two parties may be different ideological entities outside J&K.
Is not BJP vocal about repealing Article 370?
Sajjad Lone: BJP may have a different stand but we believe Article 370 has to be there. BJP wants a discussion on Article 370. A discussion can go any way. It may even enhance our position. I have never talked to them on this subject, even remotely because of the floods. In all the talks we had, my focus has always remained on development and rebuilding Kashmir.
How is Modi different from Manmohan Singh?
Sajjad Lone: Both are illustrious leaders. Dr Manmohan Singh is a great economist and I respect him. But Mr Modi has the capacity to bridge the gap with his audience. He is able to reach out and has excellent communication skills. There is a touch of informality while he reaches out. He puts off protocol and communicates person-to-person, which is exceptional.
What are your prospects in the polls?
Sajjad Lone: We will do very well but I cannot give a number on seats we will win. We will have a good, humble beginning. We want to overcome the psychological barrier of entering the assembly.

(The PM who is heading a government…)
NEW DELHI: The Congress leadership has decided not to invite PM Narendra Modi for the November 17-18 international conference in Delhi to mark the 125th birth anniversary of Jawaharlal Nehru to highlight his ideals.
Representatives of around 15 political parties and other dignitaries from many countries will attend the event. Congress has also sent out invitations to most national and regional parties barring BJP, Shiv Sena and Akali Dal. Most of these parties will mark their attendance at the Congress event, adding to the atmosphere of, and efforts for, a broader anti-BJP groupings postsaffron party's resounding poll show and on the eve of winter session of Parliament.
The PM who is heading a government committee to observe Nehru's 125th birth anniversary will be out of India on November 14. Both Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi were not given a place in the government-constituted committee. This means November 14 will see parallel political shows.
Announcing the Congress programme, party senior functionary Anand Sharma said that on November 14, Sonia will lead the Congress brass and workers in taking a nation-wide pledge to uphold Nehruvian teachings and values. Asked why the PM was not invited, Sharma said, "Congress is not obliged to invite PM Modi and his party as they do not subscribe to Nehruvian values. Even when the Congress organised an international conference to mark the centenary year of Gandhiji's satyagrha, we did not invite BJP or RSS as they are opposed to Gandhi's values and had never participated in the Freedom Movement."
Asked about the Congress website for the occasion carrying a quote appreciative of ex-PM A B Vajpayee, Sharma said, "We are acknowledging all those who have said something meaningful. As a party, we have our freedom to decide who subscribes to Nehru's views," he said.

(Parkash Singh Badal’s…)
CHANDIGARH: Punjab's ruling coalition partners, BJP and Shiromani Akali Dal , are vying with each other to woo Bahujan Samaj Party leaders, with an eye on the Dalit votes. Although assembly polls are more than two years away, the two parties seem to be making provisions to withstand a possible break in alliance and loss of vote following the debut of the Aam Admi Party , which won 4 Lok Sabha seats. Punjab has the highest concentration of Dalits with 32% of the state belonging to the community.
BJP is trying to make inroads in BSP bastions of Jalandhar, Kapurthala and Nawasher districts by wooing BSP leaders, promising them plum posts in party organisation. BSP had been an Akali ally in 1997. With Vijay Sampla inducted in the Narendra Modi Cabinet, leaders like Anil Joshi and Tiksan Sood are lobbying with Brahmin and Bani leaders for plum posts within the party. BJP may ask its chief parliamentary secretaries to resign as they have had a lackluster tenure. The party is strengthening its hold in rural and Dalit areas with the help of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh Shakhas too.
Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal's had recently said that the alliance between the Akali Dal and BJP was essential for Hindu-Sikh unity in the state. This drew criticism from radical Sikh group Dal Khalsa. Its spokesman Kanwar Pal Singh said: "The relations between the two communities are not at the mercy of Akali Dal and BJP. The Akali Dal's alliance with the Hindutva party should not be construed as guarantor of Sikh-Hindu amity. The alliance is nothing but a marriage of convenience between the two political entities that are ideologically apart."
SAD vice-president (SC wing) Sohan Singh Thandal, meanwhile, claimed on Tuesday that his party was the 'only custodian' of Dalit rights.

CPI-M working over anti-BJP Left front in West BengalBharat Bolshevik Party
(But now, with the Narendra…)
KOLKATA: Bengal's CPI-M has initiated a process aimed at consolidating Left parties, as their strength shrinks in the state with the BJP making fresh inroads. A meeting of 16 Left parties held at the CPI-M headquarters on Alimuddin Street on Tuesday decided to hold an anti-communal convention in the city on Thursday and organise a rally on the anniversary of Babri Masjid demolition on December 6. The Left Front led by the CPI-M had never felt the need for consolidation of Left forces when it was in power for 34 years, before the Trinamool Congress overthrew it in 2011.
But now, with the Narendra Modi government at the Centre and BJP's growth in the state, the CPI-M is seeking support of smaller parties. CPI-M politburo member and Left Front chairman Biman Bose said on Tuesday that these 16 parties will meet again before December 6. Three Naxalite factions - CPI ML (Liberation), CPI ML (Santosh Rana) and Communist Revolution League of India led by Asim Chatterjee - were among the parties which attended Tuesday's meeting. The CPI ML (Kanu Sanyal) faction refused to join them even though it had earlier promised to be a part of the CPI-M's new initiative.
The other smaller parties which attended the meeting included the Communist Party of Bharat, Bolshevik Party and Party for Democratic Socialism formed by former CPI-M leader Saifuddin Chowdhury. All the nine parties which are the constituents of the Left Front attended. Sources in the Left Front indicated on Tuesday that some of these minor parties might join the Front before the 2016 assembly elections in West Bengal to strengthen the Left unity to combat the BJP. Even though these parties say that their sole intention is to thwart "communal BJP's growth", they on Tuesday have taken a number of political decisions, indicating that they might come up as a new Left force before the elections.
They have supported a strike by tea workers in north Bengal from Tuesday and also backed the November 26 strike in the jute industry, called by all central trade unions except that affiliated to the Trinamool. When asked whether these smaller parties will join the Left Front in the days ahead, Biman Bose said: "It is very difficult to predict what will happen in the future."

NREGA is in need of reform: Jean DrezeAmartya Sen
("While there’s no need…)
For one who had worked so closely to frame the world's largest job guarantee programme, known as the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, it's not easy to see it succumb to pressure. It's no wonder that economist-cum-activist Jean Dreze will raise his voice against this, along with eminent academics such as Pranab Bardhan and Maitreesh Ghatak. Dreze says corruption related to NREGA and leakages — its major blemishes — are on the wane. In an interview, Dreze also lays out his vision of how strong banking and financial infrastructure can make NREGA stronger.
The government seems to be planning to squeeze the scope of NREGA and money allotted to it. What, according to you, is prompting the government to do so?
The new government appears to be caught between conflicting demands from the public and its corporate sponsors. People, especially the poor, want more social support and better public services. The corporate sector, however, tends to oppose social spending, because it means more taxes, or higher interest rates, or less public money for infrastructure and so on. Employers are particularly averse to NREGA, for obvious reasons. A government that prides itself on being pro-business was bound to take a fresh look at this programme. However, my sense is that the government is yet to make up its mind on the issue.
A major chunk of NREGA money is said to be siphoned off by middlemen. What is your experience?
If leakages alone were a good enough reason to wind up government programmes, a lot of things would beg to be shut down: the university system, the defence establishment, the Ganga Action Plan, and so on. Leakages actually raise two questions: is the programme worth it despite the leakages, and can the leakages be reduced? In the case of NREGA, I would answer 'yes' to both. Official employment generation figures are increasingly consistent with independent household survey data, suggesting leakages are going down. This is also plausible in the light of various steps that have been taken to plug leakages, from bank payments of NREGA wages to social audits and proactive display of all essential records on the web. More needs to be done, but there is no reason to capitulate.
NREGA seems to be the driving force behind financial inclusion. Payments through banks and post offices were meant to safeguard against corruption. But what's the scene on the ground? What are your suggestions to reduce the level of corruption related to NREGA?
The most vulnerable link at the moment is the post office. It is not a reliable payment agency as things stand. Village post offices are vulnerable to being captured by corrupt middlemen, especially in the poorer states. The postal system also seems to be unable to pay wages on time. Yet many states continue to rely heavily on post offices for NREGA wage payments, because of the limited capacity of the banking system in rural areas.
 
One option is to modernise the post office, another is to expand the capacity of the banking system. Both raise difficult operational issues and the solution may differ between states. For instance, some states have been able to use business correspondents to expand the reach of rural banks, but in other states, this arrangement has not worked, at least so far. There are real possibilities of major advances in this field in the next few years.
Even if we admit that corruption played a part in NREGA payment, top economists including you have argued that NREGA should stay in its current form. What is the trade-off here?
We did not argue that NREGA should "stay in its current form". We argued that workers' entitlements, including the right to work on demand, should not be curtailed. Speaking for myself, I am very much in favour of reforming NREGA. To start with, I believe the programme should be simplified. For instance, there are needless complications in the planning process and the work measurement system. Aside from stifling the programme, these complications affect the transparency of NREGA. So there is no trade-off between reforming NREGA and fighting corruption. Alas, the new government seems absolutely clueless as far as constructive NREGA reforms are concerned.
What is your view on the Jan Dhan Yojana? Is it possible for banks to open at least one savings account for every household given the existing infrastructure bottlenecks like power and rural road connectivity?
Opening accounts is not difficult — it was done on a large scale under NREGA much before Jan Dhan Yojana was launched. The difficulty is to provide adequate services to the account holders, including, for instance, prompt and convenient payment of wages or pensions. How Jan Dhan Yojana is supposed to help in that respect is not clear as things stand. Some people think cash transfers are seamless, but flow-of-funds problems affect most social programmes including NREGA, social security pensions and even midday meals.

(Low prices may induce countries…)
The demand-supply equation, which was pushing global crude oil prices higher in the first half of 2014, has gone awry, with Saudi Arabia aggressively expanding output in a bid to maintain market share rather than cutting it to support prices as it had done for many years. Saudi Arabia's aggressive stance stems from its bad experience in late 80s, when its production cuts to support oil prices helped other countries — including its Opec colleagues — make a killing, while it suffered 16 years of budget deficits.
Thus, it's safe to assume that Saudi Arabia, as well as Opec, are unlikely to cut output in the near future. On the other hand, low prices may induce countries which are largely dependent on oil revenues, to increase production to the extent possible to balance their internal budgets. The most severe impact of low oil prices will be on unconventional oil producers, such as shale oil in the US and tar sands in Canada due to their high cost of production.
According to International Energy Agency , more than 20% of global crude output in 2013 was unconventional, which is expected to reach 33% by 2035. According to various estimates, about a third of the US daily shale oil production of 6.5 million barrel turns uneconomical if the oil price is below $80 a barrel. The price level is regarded as the bottom for Brent, the international oil maker. A recent Goldman Sachs report forecasts Brent hitting a floor of $80 a barrel in the second quarter of 2015, then rising to $90 in 2016 as US shale oil production slows down.

Crude fall above RBI expectation, to help fight inflation, says Executive Director Deepak Mohanty

Deepak Mohanty
(At the last policy review…)
MUMBAI: The ongoing decline in oil prices is more than what RBI has expected and this will help in fighting inflation, central bank's Executive Director Deepak Mohanty said today.
"Whatever assumptions we made in terms of oil prices and other commodity prices, subsequently what we see now is that the prices have come off even more. So, the disinflationary process would see a bit stronger than what the last policy had done," Mohanty, whose remit includes the crucial monetary policy department, said at a conference.
The price of Indian crude basket has fallen to a low of around $ 81 a barrel as against $ 108.05 in May end.
At the last policy review on September 30, Governor Raghuram Rajan had said the trajectory of inflation was on course as assumed by the RBI in its glide path.
He had said the target of getting consumer price inflation to 8 per cent by January 2015 was more certain, while the risks to the January 2016 target of 6 per cent had subsided.
It can be noted that the RBI has been very vocal with its resolve to contain inflation in a decisive manner and has been holding on to elevated rates to achieve this objective even at the cost of criticism from the pro-growth lobby, which wants a rate cut.
The comments from Mohanty come days after deputy governor H R Khan flagged the concerns on inflation, pointing to systemic issues which are resulting in price rise.
Mohanty said the lower crude prices, coupled with a stable currency has helped reduce the inflation. However, he expressed caution, saying we should not be "overly joyous" stating that the 6.46 per cent number will rise further soon.
"There is a base effect in that and we should not be overly joyous over the fact that we are at 6.5 per cent, but it could slightly go up as we go down the line," he said.
Mohanty said even though the headline inflation number is coming down, the expectations of households continue to be for double digits inflation, which need to be addressed.
"The inflationary expectations of households continue to be high at double digits, it is important we bring down the expectation," Mohanty said, adding that the government resolve to reduce fiscal deficit to 4.1 per cent of GDP has also helped fight inflation.
He said there is also some moderation on the rural wages, which will help the inflation situation. Mohanty said with the reduction in inflation, the policy rates have come in the positive territory after a long time, after remaining negative for a long time. He also defended the RBI's elevated rate stance, saying it is not affecting growth.
On exchange rates, he said the RBI intervenes in the market only in case of excess volatility and the forex reserves we have built up are "healthy".
The current account deficit, which had caused much damage to the currency last year, is "sustainable" at present, he said.
Mohanty also expressed concern about diversion of savings into physical assets like gold, saying there is a need for the financial savings to grow.

NEW DELHI: The NDA government is unlikely to restrict rural job scheme MNREGA in the country's selected poor districts.
Clarifying his positions on MNREGA, Chaudhary Birender Singh who took over as Minister for Rural development, Panchayati Raj and Drinking Water and Sanitation today said that Rs 40,000 crore allocation for the rural job scheme was not for any specific region.
"In this country, there are people who had never seen a Rs 500 note. The poorest of the poor...we have been able to reach them through MNREGA," he told reporters.
He was reacting to a question on his predecessor Nitin Gadkari's plan to restrict the rural job scheme to most backward 200 district of the country.
"Rs 40,000 crore component is for the country and not for any specific region," Singh said.
He, however, acknowledged that there were some problems in implementation of the ambitious scheme, launched by the UPA government and the present dispensation will "correct" them.
"So far, the working of MNREGA is concerned, if there are lacunae, we will correct them," Singh said.
During his stint as Rural Development minister, Gadkari had indicated that it may restrict the rural job scheme MNREGA only to tribal and backward districts of the country.
Gadkari had said that the MNREGA guaranteeing up to 100 days of unskilled work in a year to every rural household was not required in areas having higher growth.
Launched in 2005, MNREGA has been an important source of income for millions of rural households.
Following Gadkari's remarks, there were protests by economists, activists and some political parties, saying it would affect the poor of the country.

(Birender Singh today…)
NEW DELHI: Hours after taking charge as Union minister, former Congress leader Chaudhary Birender Singh today trained his guns on his bete noir Bhupinder Singh Hooda demanding a probe into the cash-for-change of land use (CLU) scam that surfaced during his rule in Haryana.
"I am on record... the total CLU (in Haryana) should be probed. They (the state BJP government headed by Manohar Lal Khattar) have already committed (to a probe)," Singh, now BJP's Jat face in Haryana, said when asked about the future of Congress in the state in wake of land scams allegedly involving its leaders grabbing national attention.
The Haryana Lokayukta has already directed the state police to hold investigation into the alleged scandal and submit its report within three months.
Opposition parties in the state had alleged that Congress legislators were seeking illegal gratification in return of CLU permissions in the state.
Singh, who took over as the Minister for Rural Development, Panchayati Raj and Drinking Water and Sanitation, said that the Congress will be in same position for at least next 10 years both nationally and in Haryana.
"In my state, transfer of vote from Congress to BJP is complete now. In Haryana and nationally, Congress will be in same position. I don't see any ray of hope at least for next 10 years," he said.
Singh, who is a key rival of Hooda, said Congress in Haryana became "Hooda Congress" and that was the simple reason why he quit the party which he associated for 42 years.
"My leaving Congress was very simple. Congress was totally in the pocket of Hooda as far as Haryana is concerned. In that situation, I told Congress president Sonia Gandhi. If this situation continues, I will not be in the party," he said.
Asked why Congress allowed such a unilateral power structure in Haryana, Singh said, "That is surprising for me. Congress in Haryana became Hooda Congress."
On the issue of impending changes in the Land Acquisition Act, Birender Singh said, efforts will be made to bring about a consensus on the issue.
He further added that the Government is not against industrialisation but the interests of the farmers should not be compromised at any cost.
Singh also clarified that he is not in favour of acquisition of multi-crop lands.
When asked whether amendments in the Act will be made in the coming winter session of Parliament, the Minister replied that he will study the issue first and then will formulate his opinion in a couple of days.
Referring to the Swachh Bharat Mission, the Minister said building toilets in the rural areas will be taken on war footing and a massive awareness campaign will be launched for behavioural change as far as sanitation and cleanliness are concerned.
Singh also underlined that the problem of drinking water mainly in the arsenic and fluoride affected regions will be addressed on a priority basis.
He said nearly 78,000 villages or habitations are facing this problem and also hinted that international expertise will be applied to solve the problem.
Earlier, the Minister of State for Rural Development Sudarshan Bhagat and Minister of State for Panchayati Raj Nihal Chand also took charge of their respective Ministries.

(After Philadelphia, this…)
NEW DELHI: Playing Candy Crush on the sly won't be easy at the new GSK office in Gurgaon. There are a few tall plants that a person could possibly hide behind but otherwise it's open plan all the way, with managing director Zubair Ahmed sitting at a desk along with everyone else.
GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare has gotten rid of cabins, cubicles and most fixed workstations at its new India headquarters. After Philadelphia, this is the second city in which the 3.2 billion pound (figure for nine month period ended Sept 2014) British consumer healthcare firm has rolled out the concept.
"The whole space is open -- you can see what the CEO is doing, whether he is working or playing games," Ahmed told ET. "There are practical reasons backed by hardcore research why the office is like a concentric circle -- to encourage collaboration, transparency, trust, integrity." The office is on two floors at Horizon Centre on Gurgaon's Golf Course road. Seated next to the MD are the sales head and the sales team. The absence of barriers makes eminent sense, he said. "Ultimately, they are working on the ground, selling. They are the ones who can tell me what's working," Ahmed said The marketing team will sit next to the sales team so that latter can provide constant feedback to the former on their strategy. For instance, whether a new commercial is translating into sales and how it can be improved. India is one of GSK's top three markets and its products include Horlicks malted milk drink and Sensodyne toothpaste among others.
Only a few of the 330 or so employees have fixed places -- the rest will take what's available. In any case, the number of seats is about 75% of the total number. "This is something we have done deliberately," Ahmed said. "It was a waste of space. So many people are travelling, there is no need for seating for all." The firm has been counselling employees in order to help them cope with the culture shock.
"When people come in, the first thing they would ask is 'Where's my seat?' So we told them there's no seat. For our mindset, unless the person is at his desk, he's probably not working," Ahmed said. "We are changing those mindsets." The concept of the open office has been around for a while. Tech companies looking to change the way in which business is done have extended the philosophy to office design as well by breaking down the walls. Michael Bloomberg, as mayor of New York and boss of the company that bears his name, has also rigorously implemented the open office, along with free food and other staff amenities.
  Traditional businesses are increasingly adopting such practices as they seek to ensure that younger workers remain engaged. "We feel a good environment has a positive view on output and productivity. In one of our old offices, research showed that people take sick leaves, as offices are dull and boring," Ahmed said. "This is such a fun place that you get people to come." To be sure, changing the culture will take more than just adopting an openoffice plan. "For a conservative firm such as GSK Consumer to create an open, cabin-less work place is a move with huge significance," said Sangeeta Pal, senior partner at consulting search firm Transearch. "But it may not be enough to drive cultural changes, though it is a first, forward-looking move."
GSK's Gurgaon office is following a global trend. "Internationally, large corporates have been moving to open-plan offices for almost a decade, where even global CEOs don't have fixed cabins in some cases. Open-plan workplaces facilitate teamwork and help in breaking down hierarchies," said Vibhav Dhawan, managing partner at Positive Moves Consulting. "The downside is animated conversations, heated debates or arguments would also be in the public domain -- even though there are private areas to curb this to a large extent. But open plan offices are definitely the future."
Employees are also completely insulated from visitors at the GSK office. "This is because it gives rise to gossip about who came, who did he meet, how much time did he spend with the CEO and so on," said Ahmed.

HUDA houses 60% cheaper than DDAs: Expertsaffordable housing
(There are more affordable…)
NEW DELHI: Even as more than 10 lakh applicants continue to wait for the lucky draw results for 25,000 housing units Delhi Development Authority (DDA) housing scheme, real estate experts feel there is no need for despair for those who miss the opportunity. For, there are more affordable and attractive options in vicinity to the DDA dwelling units, particularly by the Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA).
"A DDA unit at the rate of Rs 6,000 to 7,000 sq ft in locations like Najafgarh, Narela or Rohini can actually appear a costly affair if we compare it with the Haryana government's scheme in adjoining NCR zones," said Rohit Modi, president, NCR chapter of CREDAI, the apex body for private realtors in the country.
"HUDA's affordable houses in the neighbourhood are cheaper by near 50-60%," Modi added.
HUDA's scheme is offering housing units at the rate of Rs 3,600-4,000 per sq ft in NCR locations like Gurgaon, Sohna Road, Sonipat, Faridabad and Palwal. Yet another factor that goes in favour of HUDA is the resale of a property.
"While in DDA flats, an allottee cannot sell his or her unit before five years after possession, the HUDA flats can be resold one year after the possession," said Navin Raheja, chairman of the National Real Estate Development Council (NAREDCO).
Raheja also mentioned that HUDA scheme has a provision to set prices of the unit on carpet area while Indian developers have a practice of selling units by charging on the surface area. "Charge on the carpet area would help buyers save around 25-35% of the prices over other private or DDA units." According to Santosh Kumar CEO, operations, in real estate consultant firm JLL, the demand for affordable housing from the middle and lower middle class is so high that absorption for both the DDA flats and other affordable housing projects at these locations will be massive.
"For people who work in the primary locations of the National Capital Region (NCR), DDA flats would be a better option but for industrial employees and other buyers residing and working in outskirt areas like Sonipat or Panipat, HUDA's projects will be a better option," said Kumar. Flat maintenance is another key area where HUDA may have scored over its Delhi counterpart.
While maintenance issues routinely plague DDA's erstwhile dwelling units, the Haryana authority has been quick on the draw to rope in private developers to deal with the prickly problem. "In return, the developer would be allowed to develop 4% of the land for commercial purposes," said Modi of CREDAI.

Makaan.com may sell or form JV with MagicBricks or QuikrComparative Advantage
(A potential transaction…)
NEW DELHI: People Group, which owns and operates real estate portal Makaan.com, has entered into talks with potential buyers, to sell the venture, at a time when the country's online property space is being seen as the next battleground for global risk capital and strategic investors. MagicBricks. com and online web and mobile classifieds company Quikr are among those believed to have held early-stage discussions with the promoters of Makaan.com, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the developments.
A potential transaction could see promoters of Mumbai-based venture, either outright sell its entire stake, or enter into a joint venture with a new backer, which could see the promoters divest up to 50% of their ownership, and which will also have a long-term payout component built into the agreement.
Anupam Mittal, the founder and promoter of People Group, declined to speak on the developments, while emails sent to Magic-Bricks.com and Quikr did not receive any responses at the time of writing the story.
Separately, Info Edge, which owns real estate portal 99Acres, and was speculated to be in talks with promoters of Makaan, denied they were looking to pick up a stake in the venture. Info Edge, which owns a clutch of Internet properties, had raised Rs 750 crore through a qualified institutional placement in September.
According to some reports, Info Edge planned to use the proceeds for potential acquisitions for 99Acres. Mittal, who owns about 80% of the property website, runs a slew of internet properties, such as matrimonial website Shaadi.com and mobile media company Mauj.com.
The People Group is backed by risk capital investors, such as Sequoia Capital, Saama Capital, Intel Capital and Citibank.
India's online real estate has been attracting substantial attention from risk capital investors, drawn by the massive demand for housing, combined with increased internet penetration , especially on the mobile platform.
"They're now the primary source of visibility for consumers and have become default search parameters. This is only going to get bigger, especially in a country the size of India," said Anuj Puri, chairman and country head for realty services consultancy JLL India.

(Ambience Group had planned…)
NEW DELHI: Realty firm Ambience today said it will invest about Rs 1,950 crore over the next four years to develop two luxury housing projects in Gurgaon and Noida.
The Delhi-based company will develop over 1,030 apartments in these two projects launched today.
Ambience has presence in Delhi and Gurgaon property markets. It is developing a 150-acre project 'Ambience Island' in Gurgaon that comprises premium homes, 'Leela Ambience' hotel with over 400 keys and a huge shopping mall.
In Delhi, it has a 'Kempinski Ambience' hotel comprising 480 keys and a shopping mall at Vasant Kunj.
"We are coming up two new projects in Noida and Gurgaon. We are entering into the Noida market for the first time," Ambience group Chairman Raj Singh Gehlot told reporters here.
Asked about the investment, he said the project cost for both Noida and Gurgaon residential complexes would be about Rs 1,950 crore and would be financed through internal accruals, and loans from banks and HDFC Ltd.
That apart, Gehlot said: "In 2010-11, we had raised Rs 170 crore in form of equity in Gurgaon project from private equity firm Indiareit." However, he did not disclose the stake divested in the Gurgaon project.
Ambience Group had planned Rs 1,300 crore initial public offer (IPO) in 2010-11 but had to shelve the plan because of bad market conditions.
Asked whether the company would revive IPO , Gehlot said "there is no such plan at this moment".
Elaborating on the project, Ambience Director Aman Gehlot said the company will build 280 flats in the 3.5 acre Noida project 'Ambience Tiverton' at a cost of Rs 465 crore.
In Gurgaon, he said over 750 flats would be constructed on 14.5 acre project 'Ambience Creacions' at Rs 1,480 crore cost.
Ambience has fixed the selling price in both projects at Rs 9,000 per sq ft. The cost of the flats would be in the range of Rs 2 crore to Rs 4.5 crore.
The construction work on both the projects have started and the completion is expected in four years.
At present, Ambience group has about 1,000 acres of land bank, including 350 acre in Panipat where the company plans to develop a township.

BJP's government in Maharashtra
This is the first ever BJP run government in the State. Having staked claim for the post of the Leader of the Opposition on Monday as a default option in case its desired deal with the BJP does not materialise, the Sena has thrown its hat in the ring for the speaker’s election.
With the BJP and the Congress also in the fray, as things stand it is a three-cornered contest. In an effective house of 287 members the BJP has 122 MLAs (22 short of a simple majority, the Sena has 63 and the Congress 42 members.

FAQ on the BJP-Sena split
File Photo: Vivek Bendre
Maharashtra went to the polls on October 15, 2014. For the first time in two decades, it witnessed a five-cornered contest as Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Shiv Sena ended their 25-year alliance (and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress their 15-year coalition) and with Maharashtra Navanirman Sena also being in the fray. On October 19 the results of the Maharashtra bypolls were announced and the BJP won in a simple majority with 123 seats while the Shiv Sena won 63.
What led to the BJP-Sena split?
The main reason for the split was the failure to reach a consensus over seat-sharing for the Assembly elections. While the BJP demanded at least 130 seats, Shiv Sena refused to give its ally more than 119. Earlier, Shiv Sena leader Uddhav Thackeray expressed his desire for the Chief Minister’s post, which the BJP refused to accept.
What’s the status quo?
On October 27th, the Shiv Sena announced that it will support any CM candidate from the BJP. Even as a section of the BJP State unit continues to lobby for a minority government in Maharashtra with the help of Independents, the party announced that it wanted a tie-up with its estranged ally, the Shiv Sena. However, this announcement came with the rider that the Sena should come on board without any conditions.
How did the parties come together in Maharashtra 25 years ago?
The BJP and Shiv Sena came together to forge an alliance in Maharashtra in 1989. Shiv Sena had always had the upper hand among the two parties in the State, with major share of the seats going to the Sena. The Sena came to power in 1995, and stayed in power for a term. Though they were out of the hot seat for the last 15 years, together they were strong as the opposition party. Shiv Sena was part of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). However, the relationship has faced many ups and downs over the years. After Bal Thackeray’s death in 2012, former BJP president Nitin Gadkari was against continuing the alliance with the Sena’s new chief Uddhav Thackeray.

Rohit will bat where he batted in past: KohliBy: Press Trust of India | Kolkata | Posted: November 12, 2014 3:30 pm
A fit-again Rohit Sharma may have been in and out of the team during his seven-year-long career so far but Indian skipper Virat Kohli said that the talented Mumbai batsman can be the X-factor in the 2015 World Cup in Australia.
Rohit was forced to pull out in the middle of the English tour in August after sustaining a finger injury but the Mumbaikar has bounced back with a match-winning 111-ball 142 against the Lankans in the tour match. Kohli said that the opener will get his preferred slot.
“If a player like him gets going he can be the X-factor in a tournament like the World Cup. When he gets going, he can bring those big runs and win the match for you. His value for the team is massive it’s great to have him back.
“Most probably he would bat where he had batted in the past. It’s all about giving him confidence as much as we can before going into the World Cup. These two games and the tri-series in Australia will certainly help him get into his groove at the top of the order. We will be looking at giving him as many overs to bat as possible,” Kohli told reporters on the eve of the fourth ODI against Sri Lanka.
Talking about Rohit’s 141 in the comeback match after a two-month injury layoff, Kohli said: “The good thing about him is he doesn’t really change himself or his game after getting success or failures. That’s one of his biggest strengths.
“That’s why even after such an unfortunate injury in England and going out half way when he was batting well and comes back and gets a hundred in the first game he plays against Sri Lanka. It shows the mental toughness that he possesses.”
“We all are aware of how good he’s with the bat. He brings a lot of positivity to the team. He’s a good thinker of the game. In the past when he was leading the side, he’s always up for discussions. He brings a lot of value into the time especially knowing that the World Cup is round the corner it’s great to have him back,” he added.
Besides Rohit, Robin Uthappa is also back for the final two ODIs and Kohli said the Karnataka batsman would don the gloves.
“The wicketkeeper will be Robin Uthappa. He’s been brought in as wicketkeeper batsman, he’s kept in the IPL also. He’s done really well with the clubs. It’s an opportunity for him to show his skills both with the bat and gloves which can be handy for us in the future,” Kohli said.
Referring to Uthappa’s exploits with IPL champions Kolkata Knight Riders, he said: “The reason he’s been picked regularly is the way he batted in the IPL. It was no slogging but proper cricketing shots full of self belief against the best bowlers of the world. The way he batted was very impressive. It’s important to continued…

After lunch is served, Bigg Boss announces the end of the luxury budget task and captain Diandra is asked to choose the winners from amongst the butlers and the guests. She counts the tips that have been earned by the butlers and also deducts earnings for unruly behaviour, breaking rules and causing unrest during the course of the task.

Govindaji is awesome as a villain in  Kill Dil : Ali ZafarGovinda is playing antagonist in upcoming romantic-action drama 'Kill Dil' and his co-star Ali Zafar feels that the '90s superstar is brilliant as a bad man.

Govinda is playing antagonist in upcoming romantic-action drama ‘Kill Dil’ and his co-star Ali Zafar feels that the ’90s superstar is brilliant as a bad man.
Ali Zafar , 34, said Govinda will be seen in a completely new avatar. “Govindaji is an exceptional actor. The character he is playing in this film is very different to what he had done in the past. People have never seen him like this. He is awesome as a villain in the film,” Zafar said.
The ‘Tere Bin Laden’ actor says he is lucky to share the screen space with his childhood favourite actor.
“Like everyone, I also grew up watching his movies. Govindaji was very kind to me. He always used to praise my work. He even said that I would get a role in Hollywood after this film. It was wonderful to work with him,” he said.
Zafar clarifies that the film is not an out-and-out action film as it has many humorous scenes too. “Kill Dil is a gangster film but at the same time it is very funny and quirky. It is very cutting edge, fast paced commercial cinema. It has a very big humour quotient in it. The film is a new style of storytelling,” he added.
Directed by Shaad Ali and also starring Ranveer Singh and Parineeti Chopra, ‘Kill Dil’ will hit theatres this Friday.

Why people cry when they are happy and smile when they are sadPeople overcome strong positive emotions with tears of joy, says a study, adding that crying actually helps them recover from the situation. (Source: Thinkstock Images)
By: Indo-Asian News Service | Posted: November 12, 2014 5:29 pm
People overcome strong positive emotions with tears of joy, says a study, adding that crying actually helps them recover from the situation.
“Tears flow when people are overwhelmed with strong positive emotions and people who do this seem to recover better from those strong emotions,” said psychologist Oriana Aragon at the Yale University in the US.
“People restore emotional equilibrium with these expressions,” she added.
Aragon and her colleagues at Yale ran participants through some emotional scenarios such as cute babies or a crying spouse who is reunited with her soldier husband returning from war, and measured their responses.
They found that individuals who express negative reactions to positive news were able to moderate intense emotions more quickly.
They also found people, who are most likely to cry at their child’s graduation are most likely to want to pinch a cute baby’s cheeks.
There is also some evidence that strong negative feelings may provoke positive expressions.
For example, nervous laughter appears when people are confronted with a difficult or frightening situations, and we also smile during extreme sadness.
“The new discoveries begin to explain common things that many people do but do not even understand themselves,” Aragon said.
“These insights advance our understanding of how people express and control their emotions, which is importantly related to mental and physical health, the quality of relationships with others, and even how well people work together,” she concluded.
The paper was published in the journal Psychological Science.

Baghban director Ravi Chopra dies at 68Baghban director Ravi Chopra dies at 68
IANS  Mumbai, November 12, 2014

He made mythology popular on television by offering "Mahabharat" to viewers and showed the beauty of family ties on the big screen through "Baghban" and "Baabul". Ravi Chopra made many films and TV shows that showed his impressive range as a filmmaker.
Ravi Chopra
Ravi Chopra, who was hospitalised in Breach Candy hospital in Mumbai, passed away Wednesday. He was reportedly suffering from a severe lung ailment since the last few years. He is survived by his wife and three children. He was 68.
Born in 1946, he hailed from the illustrious Bollywood Chopra family. His father was late filmmaker BR Chopra, and his uncle was late filmmaker Yash Chopra, who helmed romantic films like "Kabhi Kabhie", "Silsila" and "Dil Toh Pagal Hai". The Bollywood connection doesn't end here. He was also cousin of Aditya and Uday Chopra.
He started as an assistant producer of the 1972-release "Dastaan", directed by his father.
Ravi Chopra commenced his directorial journey in 1975 with "Zameer", starring Amitabh Bachchan, Vinod Khanna and Shammi Kapoor.
He went on to work with Big B in movies like "Baghban" and "Baabul". Ravi Chopra also produced Amitabh-starrer "Bhoothnath" in 2008.
He had also teamed up with popular actors like Dilip Kumar, Dharmendra, Raj Babbar and Hema Malini, who considered him like family.
Hema took to Twitter to pay tribute to the late filmmaker.
"Ravi Chopra is gone, leaving behind a void. Renu &amp; he were like family &amp; I will miss him. Rest in peace dear friend (sic)," the actress-politician tweeted Wednesday.
Apart from directing and producing films, he was a writer too. He had penned stories of films like "The Burning Train" (1980) and "Baabul" (2006).
The multi-talented Ravi directed one of the most popular mythological TV shows "Mahabharat". The drama, produced by his father, ran from 1988 to 1990.
He had also directed the television mini-series "Ramayan", which was aired in 2002.
As an executive producer, his project "Cooking with Stella", a light comedy, premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2009.
If one goes by reports, he was expected to make a comeback to the small screen with another mythological series titled "Vasudev Krishna".
If the audience lauded his work onscreen, he impressed celebrities offscreen too.
"Happy New Year" director Farah Khan described Ravi Chopra as "one of the nicest, kindest and big hearted soul".
Actress Divya Dutta, who worked with Ravi Chopra in "Baghban", said he was one man who was "full of life".
Musician Vishal Dadlani called him "one of the most gracious gentlemen".
Actor Rohit Roy had kind words for the filmmaker. He said Ravi Chopra was "definitely the nicest man I've worked with in the film industry".

Caught on camera: Cop forces dancer to perform at gunpoint in UPComments
An Uttar Pradesh police constable Shailendra Shukla on Monday forced a dancer to perform on the dais at gunpoint and showered money on her at an event organised in Shahjahanpur district's Nigohi town.
Shukla arrived at the event in an inebriated condition armed with a pistol. He allegedly tried to enter the makeup room and threatened security guards.
When a dancer started performing on the stage, Shukla climbed up and showered money on her. "He showered around Rs. 40,000," said Ram Govind, a villager present at the event.
When she got tired and stopped dancing, he put his pistol to her head and told her to continue her performance.
The terrified dancer continued to dance for over an hour.
“Since the drunk constable threatened to shoot her, she was left with no option but to continue the dance,” said Govind adding “when Shukla left the spot the organisers decided to call off the show”.
The audience captured the act of the constable on camera.
“The police constable was deputed to manage the crowd and provide security to the artists. His act has brought disrepute to the police force and maligned the image too. The state government has ordered strict action against the erring cops,” a home department officer said.   
Shahjhanpur's superintendent of police Rakesh Chandra Shahu told HT that Shukla has been suspended and a departmental inquiry has been ordered against him.

At G20  India to come out strongly against  mandatory  arbitration for taxFIPB role shrinks amid easier FDI flows
Tax disputes arising out of cross-border transactions should not be “mandatorily” dragged to international arbitration and India will voice its opposition on the same in the upcoming G-20 leaders’ summit, a senior official told The Indian Express ahead of the Summit that starts on Novermber 15.
This is a part of the suggestions of the G20-OECD initiative for dispute resolution mechanism, proposed in, what is being called Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS). BEPS will essentially provide countries with domestic and international instruments that will better align rights to tax with economic activity.
“We will never agree to it, tax is a sovereign issue. Agreeing to this will mean several more Vodafone-like cases for us. This issue will be taken up at the Sherpa-level talks,” the official said. Sherpa is a senior official responsible for preparing the agenda for leaders attending the summit.
India’s stand becomes important in wake of the ongoing international arbitration that British telecom major Vodafone, facing a tax liability of Rs 11,200 crore for acquiring Hutchison Whampoa’s stake in its Indian telecom business in 2007, has initiated with the Indian tax authorities.
Also, last year, Finland-based Nokia, now a division of Microsoft, entangled in a protracted tax case with income tax authorities, had also expressed its intention to seek arbitration under the Bilateral Investment Protection Agreement (BIPA) India has signed with Finland. Further, India will also pitch for taxing digital economy and e-commerce firms which are increasingly mushrooming in the country.
Countries across the globe are facing the problem of taxing such companies which make use of low-tax jurisdictions causing revenue loss to the countries where they are actually based.
“We will raise the issue of defining ‘significant digital presence’ which may include the number of bytes used, number of users or the value addition done in a country. While countries like the US are still not in favour of such a suggestion, we hope to bring every one on board on the issue,” the official said.
Earlier, railway minister Suresh Prabhu, who is Sherpa of Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the Summit, had said that while the principles for BEPS have been laid down and more or less agreed upon by the countries, there was a need to go beyond and look at the possibility of transactions taking place in e-commerce.
“E-commerce happens in one country, the person who manages the logistics could be in another country, the manufacturer of the product could be in yet another country while the consumer could be in a different country. So where do you tax such a transaction? It is issues like this which really need a global consensus,” he said.

Providing some relief to the government on economic front, retail inflation, helped by slower annual rises in food and fuel prices, cooled to 5.52 per cent in October, its lowest level since the government started releasing the data in 2012, while industrial output grew 2.5 percent year-on-year in September, its fastest pace in three months.
The consumer price index-based inflation, which the Reserve Bank of India tracks in setting lending rates, stood at 6.46 per cent in September, while the factory output, measured in terms of index of industrial production (IIP) registered 0.4 per cent growth in both August and July.
Even though the development indicates some uptick in economy, the relief on inflation is largely because of the base effect, experts said.
Several analysts agree that while the CPI inflation target set by the Reserve Bank of India’s could be achieved earlier, the central bank is unlikely to cut rates until it is fully convinced that the inflation genie is back in the bottle. The next monetary policy review is slated for December 2.
Research head of a leading global financial firm explained that in 2013 there was a sharp spike in food prices between July and October, which had led to a high inflation.
However, with prices remaining largely stable in the current fiscal and crude prices softening, the inflationary pressure has come down.
He said that while “it is a welcome correction; it is a little early to call a victory over inflation. If we do not see a similar sharp reduction in inflation in December-January, the inflation may go back to over 7 per cent. Therefore I think the RBI may wait before embarking on a rate cut path”.
Saugata Bhattacharya, chief economist, Axis Bank, also said that though the extent of price pressure has come down, decline in the retail inflation is partly due to base effect and partly due to decline in crude oil prices.
“The moderation in CPI is likely to continue before settling down around 6 per cent by March 2015. While the IIP will continue to grow consistently in the next two quarters… the growth and inflation mix will provide some headroom to the central bank for a rate cut,” Bhattacharya added.

An Egyptian army spokesman says eight sailors are missing after an assault by “terrorist elements” on a navy patrol boat off one of the country’s Mediterranean ports.
Brig. Gen. Mohammed Samir said in a statement on his official Facebook page early on Thursday that four assault boats were destroyed and that 32 attackers were arrested.
Five troops were also wounded in the attack.
Earlier, the official MENA news agency said gunmen from three boats fired at the naval patrol Wednesday north of the port of Damietta, prompting an exchange of fire.
No further details were available.
Human smuggling is common in the Mediterranean. Egyptian troops have increasingly come under attack from militants since the ouster of Islamist President Mohammed Morsi last year, though attacks at sea are extremely rare.

Curating Serendipities: antiSocial  the new creative incubator in thecityPrint
antiSocial promises to provide a more focused space than its buzzier, boozier counterpart
Written by Shantanu David | New Delhi | Posted: November 13, 2014 10:52 am | Updated: November 13, 2014 10:53 am
A quiet stairwell off the corridor to Hauz Khas Village (HKV)’s Smoke House Deli, three stories high, leads into a utilitarian space, white walled, wooden floored and desk-lined with plug-points much in evidence. The entire space overlooks centuries-old monuments and trees. This is antiSocial, which at the Tuesday night launch, played host to a bevy of beards and belles, sipping cocktails out of clear plastic bags and scarfing down munchies.
antiSocial, as the name suggests is a much more restrictive place than its larger and older sibling, Social. The new space is accessible solely to members and is a pure frills-free workspace. They can hold self-curated events in the evening – which include film screenings, talks, and any performances — that members feel will add to the creative constructs incubating in these collaborative workspaces.
The management promises that antiSocial will be open from 9am to “whatever time members need it to be”. The space will also support start-up NGOs by providing a free place to work and food coupons for Rs 5,000 a month, which can be redeemed at Social.
“We’re looking to create a place for serendipities to happen, a space where people from different creative fields can come together and create something awesome and unique because of the collaborations between mediums,” says Riyaaz Amlani of Impresario Hand Made Restaurants, the stable from which this dark horse has emerged. The management is clearly happy with the response, with plans to open a 100 Socials and antiSocials across the country over the next three years.
“In the ’90s Starbucks propagated itself by offering a “third place”, a space to go to apart from work and home. With today’s connectivity and instantaneous communication, apart from home, all you need is a “second place”,where you can both work and play. That’s what we’re offering,” says Amlani, “I guess you could say we’re like Starbucks, except we have beer.”

A huge fan of Indian films, award-winning Iranian filmmaker Niki Karimi Wednesday hoped she bumps into Bollywood screen icon Amitabh Bachchan during her stay in the city. (See Pics: Amitabh Bachchan’s aww moments with Deepika on Piku sets)
Karimi is participating in the 20th Kolkata International Film Festival that kicked off Monday.
Counting Big B’s “Amar, Akbar, Anthony” among her favourites, the actress-turned-director lamented the missed opportunity during the inaugural of the KIFF.
“I heard that Amitabh Bachchan was here at the inaugural, how come I didn’t meet him? Is he still in town? I would like to meet him,” a keyed-up Karimi said.
Big B is in the city shooting for Shoojit Sircar’s “ Piku “. He and his celebrated family inaugurated the KIFF Monday.
The director of award-winning films like “The Final Whistle” and “One Night” said both countries believe in making “good cinema”.
“Many things changed in Iranian films as the society changed. In Iran we make good films like you do in India.
“We do not have as much (big) as audience that you guys have. I always love Indian cinema,” said Karimi, adding she follows the work of women filmmakers like Aparna Sen and Mira Nair.

A World of Her Own: A short film on the daily struggles of a girl with mentaldisorderPrint
Alfiya is open to interpretation
Written by Somya Lakhani | New Delhi | Posted: November 13, 2014 10:39 am | Updated: November 13, 2014 10:49 am
Had the film been even a few minutes longer, it would have answered all our questions, put to rest our dilemmas and given us a good night’s sleep but Alfiya lasts only 18 minutes. The questions remain unanswered and one resorts to imagination and the hope that the filmmaker will make a part two, just for us. A story about a girl with a mental disorder in Delhi and her daily struggles and dilemmas about what’s real and what’s a figment of her imagination, Alfiya has been directed by 25-year-old Satyarth Shaurya Singh. The film will be screened for the first time today at antiSocial in Hauz Khas Village.
“I wrote the script about three years ago, even before I started my own production house, Lights on Films. I was waiting for the right time and team to make it,” says Singh. As Alfiya, the lead character played by theatre actor Amba Suhasini Katoch Jhala, goes about her life, she comes across people and locations whose presence she isn’t sure of. There is a guard, a young girl cycling, a bespectacled receptionist, a doctor and an elevator. The film ends abruptly, leaving one with queries. “We’ve left it open to people’s interpretation. The character undergoes many dilemmas in the film, and if the viewer too feels the same way, we are successful,” says Singh, who made Echoes (2012), a documentary on the independent music culture in Delhi.
The film’s screenplay and dialogues have been written by Singh and Abhilash Sahu, his partner at Lights on Films. They have directed Alfiya together and Sahu also plays the guard in it. Delhi-based band Faridkot and Mumbai’s Caesars of the Green have given the background score and it has been mastered by Mumbai-based independent filmmaker Mohnish Ketswal. “Music is very important for Alfiya because psychologically she feels that it helps her block all the voices she hears. This is why we’ve worked on the music of the film,” says Singh.
The film will be screened at antiSocial, Hauz Khas Village, today, 7.30 pm onwards, in batches of two or three. Entry is free.

When things go wrong  Gandhi appears: EP Unny on the power of politicalcartoonsPrint

A “Nazi tiger”, with swastika symbols all over its body, is chewing a man. However, the presence of the man is only implied, what you actually see is just an umbrella, with a tag of “appeasement”, in its mouth. In the cartoon, David Low of the London Evening Standard apparently had a message for the US president.
Delivering a lecture on ‘The Comic as Continuity’, chief political cartoonist of the Indian Express EP Unny took the audience through this and more slides to sketch a history of cartooning across the world and in India. Organised by the LILA Foundation for Translocal Initiatives, a cultural trust, the event was held at the India International Centre in New Delhi on November 11, as part of a 14-part lecture series on ‘Culture as Continuum’.
Unny raised pertinent questions on what is a cartoon, can cartoons be stand-alones, are they merely meant to entertain, and how does the media use cartoons. “Most of the cartoons can be traced back to actual events in history. There is no stand-alone cartoon. The cartoon can step out of the character, creating a sort of a hologram that can do and say anything which the real character may not do in public,” said Unny.
Cartoons can be used as tools for updating history, just like Ralph Steadman did in 1995. He illustrated the 50thanniversary issue of George Orwell’s Animal Farm, book replete with references to the Soviet Union, which by 1995 wasn’t even into existence.
However, while cartoons are agents of continuity, they can also be tools of inversion as well. The Emergency years were tough for cartoonists. “Our traditional cartoons were upright, direct and outspoken, and were powerful tools for the media,” said Unny, recalling how Indira Gandhi banned cartoons during that phase. Shankar’s Weeklyclosed within a month of the imposition of Emergency. “But when such discontinuity takes place, it comes back with a vengeance, and that is what happened. Once Emergency was lifted, the cartoonist Ravi Shankar and editor Arun Shourie of The Indian Expressrun a cartoon campaign against Rajiv Gandhi for nearly two years, but without tiring out the readers,” he said. Similar work was seen at the time of the Babri Masjid demolition and the attack on the World Trade Centre in the US.
Unny also shared some cartooning cues. “When things go terribly wrong, Gandhi makes an appearance,” he said, showing a cartoon, where Gandhi is seen exiting the Ram Janambhoomi site.

A tribute to Faiyaz Khan: He made the tablasingFaiyaz Khan
Written by Suanshu Khurana | New Delhi | Posted: November 13, 2014 10:28 am
In the early ’60s, the decade which is credited to the success of Ustad Amir Khan, one of the most influential figures in Hindustani classical music, a night before a big concert was a tough one. Not for Amir but for his tabla player, a boy in his 20s, who had been partying all night. Faiyaz Khan had just gone to bed when Amir began his riyaaz in the next room at 5 am. The careful enunciation of the raga, the sparing application of murki and the aura of his voice, had Faiyaz wake up, run to his room and sit at his feet, understanding the complexities he would be dealing with at the concert in the next few hours. Faiyaz’s student Heiko Djiker says, “He was extremely sleepy but went out of respect for the great maestro. Such was the commitment.”
Ustad Faiyaz Khan (pictured), a tabla player, who played with three generations of Indian musicians, and was revered for his energetic yet elegant support with the taankari passed away in Sikar, Rajasthan on Wednesday morning. He had been hospitalised for the last month and a half due to meningitis. He is survived by two sons and five daughters.
What was interesting about Faiyaz’s baaj (playing style) was that besides playing regular and other intricate tabla rhythms with flourish, Faiyaz trained with Ramnad Ishwaran, who taught him the math of Carnatic classical rhythms. One of his most notable collaborations was with thumri queen Siddheshwari Devi with whom he toured Afghanistan in 1955. Later he went on to accompany sarod maestro Ustad Amjad Ali Khan’s father Ustad Hafiz Ali Khan, Sharan Rani, sitar legend Pandit Nikhil Banerjee, Pandit Hariprasad Chaurasia, and Ustad Vilayat Khan among others.
Pandit Ramakant Gundecha, of dhrupad duo Gundecha Brothers, remembers the “old style” and tehzeeb of accompanying an act. “We met him in Holland, where he would teach often. He made his tabla sing with an interesting and delicate tone. Tabla has acquired quite a bit of glamour quotient today with percussionists trying to dominate the main act. He never did. He was interested in weaving his rhythms in the performance,” said Ramakant Gundecha.
The burial will take place on Thursday morning at Sikar and is likely to be attended by a host of musicians.

I have loved working with Shah Rukh Khan: Saif Ali KhanThere were reports that Saif had apparently said that he would prefer to play a lead in his own productions rather than play second fiddle to a big star name.

Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan turned an angry man after reports suggested that he would never work with Shah Rukh Khan in future. The ‘Kal Ho Na Ho’ actor said his statement was misinterpreted.
There were reports that Saif had apparently said that he would prefer to play a lead in his own productions rather than play second fiddle to a big star name.
However, furious with the misinterpretation of his statement, Saif Ali Khan issued a fresh statement debasing the previous reportage.
Commenting on working with Shah Rukh in the future, Saif said: “This is rubbish. I have loved working with SRK whenever I have…Filmfare awards hosting…Kal Ho Na Ho..temptations tours…Seagrams ad!!!!…he is an amazing guy…he was also one of the few people at my wedding from the industry…I look up to him and he had influenced a lot of my thoughts on set.”
As for clarifying his previous statements, the actor added, “What I meant was I don’t see myself doing a film with him unless I have a really interesting role…and most of the films he does revolve around him..and rightly so!!! I’m upset at the reporting of this as I have a lot of respect for SRK..I have worked with him and I know what his contribution is..invaluable!!”
Currently, Saif Ali Khan is busy with the promotions of his forthcoming film Happy Ending.

He made mythology popular on television by offering ‘Mahabharat’ to viewers and showed the beauty of family ties on the big screen through ‘Baghban’ and ‘Baabul’. Ravi Chopra made many films and TV shows that showed his impressive range as a filmmaker.
Ravi Chopra, who was hospitalised in Breach Candy hospital here, passed away Wednesday. He was reportedly suffering from a severe lung ailment since the last few years. He is survived by his wife and three children. He was 68.
Born in 1946, he hailed from the illustrious Bollywood Chopra family. His father was late filmmaker B.R. Chopra, and his uncle was late filmmaker Yash Chopra, who helmed romantic films like “Kabhi Kabhie”, “Silsila” and “Dil Toh Pagal Hai”. The Bollywood connection doesn’t end here. He was also cousin of Aditya and Uday Chopra.
He started as an assistant producer of the 1972-release “Dastaan”, directed by his father.
Ravi Chopra commenced his directorial journey in 1975 with “Zameer”, starring Amitabh Bachchan, Vinod Khanna and Shammi Kapoor.
He went on to work with Big B in movies like “Baghban” and “Baabul”. Ravi Chopra also produced Amitabh-starrer “Bhoothnath” in 2008.
He had also teamed up with popular actors like Dilip Kumar, Dharmendra, Raj Babbar and Hema Malini, who considered him like family.
Hema Malini took to Twitter to pay tribute to the late filmmaker. “Ravi Chopra is gone, leaving behind a void. Renu & he were like family & I will miss him. Rest in peace dear friend (sic),” the actress-politician tweeted Wednesday.
Apart from directing and producing films, he was a writer too. He had penned stories of films like “The Burning Train” (1980) and “Baabul” (2006).
The multi-talented Ravi directed one of the most popular mythological TV shows “Mahabharat”. The drama, produced by his father, ran from 1988 to 1990.
He had also directed the television mini-series “Ramayan”, which was aired in 2002.
As an executive producer, his project “Cooking with Stella”, a light comedy, premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2009.
If one goes by reports, he was expected to make a comeback to the small screen with another mythological series titled “Vasudev Krishna”.
If the audience lauded his work onscreen, he impressed celebrities offscreen too.
“Happy New Year” director Farah Khan described Ravi Chopra as “one of the nicest, kindest and big hearted soul”.
Actress Divya Dutta, who worked continued…

Food Stockpiling
("Both have resolved differences…)
NEW DELHI: India has reached an agreement with the United States on public stockpiling of food on Thursday, paving the way for the implementation of a global trade facilitation deal that has been stalled for months.
"India and the United States have resolved their differences on public stockholding of food," Nirmala Sitharaman said. "This opens the way for implementation of the WTO trade facilitation deal."
The proposals will be reviewed by the World Trade Organization's General Council, she added, expressing the hope that approval would clear the way for India to sign a protocol enabling implementation of the trade accord.
We are glad to say that US has appreciated and now openly supported our concerns on public stockholding. #wto

"While there was much media debate and concerns expressed regarding the impact of India's stand in the WTO, it has undeniably resonated across the world. Many countries saw merit in what we were asking for. India was not alone or isolated. Others were simply not speaking up," a press release issues by the Commerce Ministry said.
End of impasse at #WTO shall open way for implementation of Trade Facilitation Agreement.

Following are some of the salient points:
Reasons for India's Stand
> The Doha Development Agenda which was agreed in the year 2001 is the very first round dedicated to development. The agenda is a fine balance between market access and development issues.
(1/2 )We urge #WTO membership to take this forward in the General Council on behalf of the Ministerial Conference..

India, therefore, took the stand that till there was an assurance of our concerns being addressed, it would be difficult to join the consensus on the Protocol of Amendment for the Trade Facilitation Agreement.

Commitment to the Trade Facilitation Agreement
> India has reiterated its commitment to the Trade Facilitation Agreement a number of times.
> We recognise its value for trade and for that reason we agreed to it in the larger interest of global trade.
> However, for developing countries the benefits may not be commensurate with the associated costs. Implementation of the rest of the Bali Decisions will give some comfort to the developing countries and LDCs, even though most of the non-binding decisions do not hold out the promise of substantial gains for these countries. We will continue to work for the implementation of the Bali Package and the DDA.
India had asked WTO to amend the norms for calculating agri subsidies so that the country could continue to procure foodgrains from farmers at minimum support price and sell them to poor at cheaper rates without violating the WTO norms.
The current WTO norms limit the value of food subsidies at 10 per cent of the total value of foodgrain production. However, the quantum of subsidy is computed after taking into consideration prices that prevailed two decades ago.
There are apprehensions that once India would fully implement its food security programme it may breach the cap.
With the issue having been resolved, Sitharaman said: "We supported the Bali Package but when subsequent developments belied that hope, India had no option but to seek a course correction.
"India, therefore, took the stand that till there was an assurance of our concerns being addressed, it would be difficult to join the consensus on the Protocol of Amendment for the Trade Facilitation Agreement," she added.

Can Microsoft open source its crown jewel Windows | To invest Rs 1.4k cr in cloudSatya Nadella’s software bonhomie at Microsoft
Pankaj Mishra, ET Bureau Nov 14, 2014, 07.10AM IST

(After the new CEO Nadella…)
Can Microsoft open source its crown jewel Windows?
It was unimaginable and even blasphemous to ask this questions to Microsoft—at least until Steve Ballmer was at the helm.
But now, after the new CEO Nadella has shown that he is not shy of making bold moves no matter how irrational they may seem for the old guard at Microsoft, there is hope.
On Thursday, Microsoft announced plans to make .Net open source, allowing it to run on Apple's Mac and Linux. Millions of developers have been using .Net tools to build websites and write online applications for years—now they can do all that on two of Microsoft's biggest operating system rivals.
Since he took over, Nadella has made three decisions that reflect a new Microsoft waking up to the real world where enterprises are running different applications on diverse platforms, and are scoffing at the idea of being married to a single platform.
Earlier this month, Microsoft released free mobile versions of the three of its "office killer apps"—Word, Excel and PowerPoint. It also launched iPad versions of these apps and a preview version of Office apps for Android tablets.
As an Apple user craving to get the Office apps on iPhone for years, I can tell you the experience is great—it combines Apple's beautiful and intuitive interface with Microsoft's intelligent business applications.
In April this year, Microsoft announced a free version of its Windows operating system called "Windows for Internet of Things". The idea is to compete with Google's Android on phones and wearables.
All these decisions show that Microsoft has realized that it needs to imagine a world beyond OS licensing , which still is a cash cow. Cloud is where the future lies for most software , and it's also an area where rivals such as IBM , Apple and Google are moving to. Microsoft too has products such as Office 365 , Dynamics CRM and Azure that have a much better chance of dominating their markets in the cloud.
And finally, there's hope in asking the question—when will Windows go open source?

Cosmic first: European spacecraft lands on comet | All about the historic landingEuropean Space Agency's probe first to land on comet, but fails to anchor down
By AP | 13 Nov, 2014, 11.23AM IST
The European Space Agency says it has succeeded in landing a spacecraft on a comet for the first time in history.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
DARMSTADT/GERMANY: Landing with a bounce after traveling 4 billion miles, a European spacecraft made history Wednesday by successfully reaching the icy, dusty surface of a speeding comet - a cosmic first designed to answer big questions about the universe.
The landing by the washing machine-sized craft after a decade-long journey required immense precision, as even the slightest error could have resulted in stellar calamity.
Indications were that the spacecraft touched down almost perfectly, save for an unplanned bounce, said Stephan Ulamec, head of the lander operation.
"Today we didn't just land once. We maybe even landed twice," he said with a chuckle.
Ulamec said thrusters that were meant to push the lander, called Philae, onto the surface, and harpoons that would have anchored it to the comet failed to deploy properly. Initial data from the spacecraft indicated that it lifted off again, turned and then came to rest.
Scientists were still trying to fully understand what happened and whether those failures would affect the lander's ability to remain on the comet, called 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko . But so far, most of the instruments were working fine and sending back data as hoped, Ulamec said.
We're signing off shortly, but we leave you with replay hlighlights of this afternoon's events https://t.co/K4IRFgsn2y
— ESA (@esa) November 12, 2014
"Tomorrow morning we should know a lot more," he said.
The landing team at mission control in Darmstadt had to sweat through a tense seven-hour wait that began when Philae dropped from the agency's Rosetta space probe as both it and the comet hurtled through space at 41,000 mph (66,000 kph).
During the lander's descent, scientists were powerless to do anything but watch, because its vast distance from Earth - more than 300 million miles - made it impossible to send instructions in real time.
Finally, at 16:03 GMT (11:03 a.m. EST), the agency received a signal that the lander had touched down.
While it may take a while to determine the exact state of the 220-pound (100-kilogram) lander, the fact that it was resting on the surface of the comet was already a huge success - the highlight of Rosetta's decade-long mission to study comets and learn more about the origins of these celestial bodies.
The head of the European Space Agency underlined Europe's pride in having achieved a unique first ahead of its U.S. counterpart, NASA.
"We are the first to have done that, and that will stay forever," said the European agency's director-general, Jean-Jacques Dordain.
NASA contributed three instruments to the mission and its Deep Space Network of giant radio antennas has been key to communicating with Rosetta.
Eight-time spacewalking astronaut John Grunsfeld, now associate administrator for science at NASA, called the landing "a breakthrough moment in the exploration of our solar system and a milestone for international cooperation."
"The data collected by Rosetta will provide the scientific community, and the world, with a treasure-trove of data," he said in a statement.
Scientists have likened the trillion or so comets in our solar system to time capsules that are virtually unchanged since the earliest moments of the universe.
"By studying one in enormous detail, we can hope to unlock the puzzle of all of the others," said Mark McCaughrean, a senior scientific adviser to the mission.
The insight gleaned will give researchers the opportunity to test the theory that comets brought organic matter and water to Earth billions of years ago, giving them a key role in the evolution of life on our planet, said Klim Churyumov, one of the two astronomers who discovered the comet in 1969.
Rosetta and Philae will accompany the 2 {-mile wide comet as it races past the sun and becomes increasingly active in the rising temperatures. Between them, they will use 21 different instruments to take 3D images, analyze the comet's chemical composition and electrical properties, and even probe its internal structure with low-frequency radio signals.
Mission manager Paolo Ferri said there was no time to celebrate, because the lander had only enough battery power to operate for up to 64 hours. After that it will have to recharge, using solar panels to eke out an extra hour of operations each day.
Ferri said communications with the lander also needed to be stabilized, as there were intermittent connection problems after the touchdown. In the meantime, all the data that Philae collects is safely being stored for later transmission, he said.
Rosetta, which was launched in 2004, had to slingshot three times around Earth and once around Mars before it could work up enough speed to chase down the comet, which it reached in August. Rosetta and the comet have been traveling in tandem ever since.

Rosetta: Philae lander makes historic touchdown on comet
Text: AP
Hundreds of millions of miles from Earth, a European spacecraft made history by successfully landing on the icy, dusty surface of a speeding comet - an audacious cosmic first designed to answer big questions about the origin of the universe.
The European Space Agency celebrated the cosmic achievement after sweating through a tense seven-hour countdown that began when the Philae lander dropped from the agency's Rosetta space probe toward the comet as both hurtled through space at 66,000 kph.

Philae lander weighs100 kilogram
The agency then received a signal at 1603 GMT from the 100-kilogram Philae lander after it touched down on the icy surface of the comet named 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Philae had drifted down to the comet and latched on using harpoons and ice screws.
"We definitely confirm that the lander is on the surface," said flight director Andrea Accomazzo.

Further checks needed to ascertain state of the lander
While further checks are needed to ascertain the state of the lander, the fact that it is resting on the surface of the speeding comet is already a huge success.
It marks the highlight of the decade-long Rosetta mission to study comets and learn more about the origins of these celestial bodies.

ESA ahead of NASA
The head of the European Space Agency underlined Europe's pride in having achieved a unique first ahead of its US counterpart NASA.
"We are the first to have done that, and that will stay forever," said ESA director-general Jean-Jacques Dordain.

Linking solar system to time capsules
Scientists have likened the trillion or so comets in our solar system to time capsules that are virtually unchanged since the earliest moments of the universe.
"By studying one in enormous detail, we can hope to unlock the puzzle of all of the others," said Mark McCaughrean, a senior scientific adviser to the mission.

Modi keen on Malaysian model of work assessmentPM Narendra Modi keen on Malaysian model of performance assessment
PTI Nov 13, 2014, 10.21AM IST
(The prime minister said…)
NAIR NAY PYI TAW: As part of his endeavour to constantly evaluate the performance of his government, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is taking a cue from the Malaysian model, calling it an "excellent example".
During his meeting with his Malaysian counterpart Najib Razak yesterday, Modi said he was greatly impressed by the performance assessment mechanism that is in place in the southeast Asian country.
Modi told Razak that he had had discussions on this subject with some Malaysian officials who had worked on it, Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Syed Akbaruddin told reporters here.
The prime minister said that this is an excellent example of how monitoring of performance is done. But he said Malaysia is more than only governance reform.
While this was governance reform, Modi also felt that Malaysia has been open for economic reforms and he felt that both Malaysia and India could work together in areas like housing.
Modi said public housing was a major focus of the new Indian government which plans to go for large scale public housing by 2022. And he felt that Malaysian companies who had expertise in these would be welcome specifically in public housing projects.
To keep the government departments on their toes and deliver on the BJP's poll promise to bring "Achchhe Din" (good days), the prime minister is understood to be keen on revamping the Performance Management and Evaluation System (PMES), currently run by a division at the Union government's Cabinet Secretariat.
Razak set up the Performance Management and Delivery Unit, commonly known as PEMANDU, in his office in September 2009, just a few months after taking over.
PEMANDU oversees implementation, assesses progress, facilitates and supports delivery and drives progress of the Government Transformation Programme and the Economic Transformation Programme launched by Razak, who heads the unit as its chairman.

(The government is also planning…)
NEW DELHI | BENGALURU: Indian government software applications are set to make the shift to open source, potentially boosting the pace at which such programmes are developed, and leading to millions of dollars in savings by moving away from proprietary systems.
The government is readying a policy that calls for open source software to be used as part of the Digital India initiative. The government is also planning to create a Github-like repository of software that can be collaboratively developed.
"We don't want to make it a question of ideology but wherever possible, we want to make use of open source," RS Sharma, secretary, department of electronics and information technology, told ET. "We are also preparing something like a SourceForge, where we will open up the source code of all the existing software and crowd source development like on Github," he said.
Github and SourceForge are popular internet repositories for software code that can be shared and revised by many people.
Experts feel that this will radically improve egovernance and add up significant savings as code and applications can be reused. Governments in India are expected to spend $6.4 billion on IT products and services in 2014, according to Gartner. "The advantage is that every consulting firm will not have to re-invent the software," said Sharma. The policy intends to speed up development and deployment of e-governance projects across various sectors in the government.
"Open source has offered us the best way to out of vendor lock-in and unpredictable financial commitments," said Jay Pullur, founder and CEO, Pramati Technologies, who is also part of software product think tank Ispirt.
According to an early version of the 'Policy On Collaborative Application Development by Opening the Source Code of Government Applications', accessed by ET, the source code of hundreds of custom applications run by various government bodies is to be shared among government agencies and maintained in a common repository.
"The open code policy will ensure faster deployment of IT projects, speeding up the pace of innovation and reducing failure rates of projects," said Venkatesh Hariharan, director of Alchemy Business Solutions LLP, a company focused on technology for development in Indian language computing and open source education technology.
The repository will avoid duplication of applications and solutions to a large extent. For instance, a state wanting to adopt a particular application just has to go to the repository and customise it. "It is perverse that each state develops its own treasury application from scratch when it could be the same code," said Hariharan.
While open source experts agree that the policy is a step in the right direction, they caution that like most government initiatives, it would make a real impact only if implemented well. "Because open source is open code, you can rework on it, re-conceptualise it. And India would need a lot," said Parminder Jeet Singh, executive director at IT for Change .
Pullur said, "Given the diversity and plurality of the nation, open source adoption is the best approach and rightly chosen by the government." Singh added that India has had a policy for open standards, which was drafted in 2010, but its implementation was "very shabby". He hoped that the new policy had the "highest political backing". Another advantage would be scaling up skill development in open source.

LG failed to grow sales in India for 3rd yea...LG Electronics fails to grow its sales in Indian market in FY14

("Focus on premiumisation…)
KOLKATA | MUMBAI: LG Electronics failed to grow its sales in the Indian market for the third straight year in FY14, raising fresh questions about the South Korean electronics major's strategy of focusing on premium products.
LG Electronics India , which was the country's largest consumer electronics company just five years ago, is now reduced to nearly a fourth of its towering rival Samsung after it reported just 1% rise in net sales for the year ended March 2014 at Rs 11,580 crore as per its latest filing to the Registrar of Companies (RoC). Samsung India , in comparison, grew its sales 45% at Rs 40,392 crore.
Samsung's exponential growth is powered by its booming mobile handset business, true, but LG India is losing ground to others and is struggles to hold on to its market share across product categories. Sony India, for example, has narrowed the gap with LG significantly with Rs 10,000 crore in sales last fiscal and it's targetingRs 12,000 crore this year.
Four senior industry executives ET spoke to pointed to a host of strategic factors that halted LG's growth in India in recent years. They include: LG repositioning itself as a premium brand with higher price tags and focus on high-end products; focus on exclusive stores in a market where a bulk of sales now happen at large multibrand chains; failure to fill the void created after exiting Rs 2,500-crore CRT television business last year; and, inability to crack the smartphone market.
"Apart from internal changes in business strategy where the focus is on driving profit, LG has been hit hard by the slowdown in sales of the white goods industry which was flat in last three years and it not being able to grow fast enough in categories like smartphones and flat televisions, which grew exponentially," one of them said.
LG, however, refused to acknowledge any strategic failure. "It seems that you are planning to do a story based on outdated and historical data in this fastmoving world," an LG India spokesperson said in response to a detailed questionnaire sent by ET. "We do not subscribe to the facts and figures relied on by you. Any story and news item based on such factually incorrect data may not reflect the correct picture," the spokesperson said.
Its focus on premiumisation did help LG India boost its profitability. Despite flat sales, the company reported an impressive 31% growth in its profit for 2013-14 at Rs 634 crore. "The parent is not much perturbed by LG India's flat sales since it is delivering healthy profit and that too in home appliances and air-conditioners, which are tough businesses," an industry executive said. This is at a time when the parent company is reporting losses and betting on few top geographies like India and its smartphone business to get back into black.
The LG spokesperson said the company is registering impressive business growth this year. "During this festive season, we have broken all our previous records. We would like to reiterate that LG has the highest market share in consumer durables category. With the robust product portfolio based on Indian insights, LG will further strengthen its market shares," she said.
While LG India has been trying to gain a foothold in the booming Indian smartphone market, just released data by Counterpoint Research shows that its share has declined to 1% in the quarter ended September, down from 1.4% in the year-ago period. Tarun Pathak, senior analyst at Counterpoint Research, said that while LG is one of the few vendors offering devices in the premium segment, sales are more polarised towards Apple iPhone due to aspirational nature of the brand.
"Right now, LG is sandwiched and facing competition from Apple and Samsung at the premium end, while in the entry-tomid segment the local and Chinese smartphone vendors are ruling. LG needs to be more aggressive in marketing and should adopt leaner go-to-market strategy as it has a fantastic product portfolio," he said.
In white goods, while LG India has lost leadership in air-conditioners to Tata-owned Voltas in multi-brand outlet sales, Samsung and Whirlpool are giving it tough competition in products like double-door refrigerators, side-by-side refrigerators and fully-automatic washing machines.
However, LG is still the undisputed market leader in directcool refrigerators, semi-automatic washing machines and microwave ovens. In flat panel TVs, LG is at the third slot with the Samsung-Sony duo controlling more than 60% of the market.

(Delayed monsoon has not…)
PUNE: Craving for some gajar ka halwa? You may have to wait for a couple of more weeks for good quality carrot preferred for making the confection to reach the markets. And, be ready to pay more, too.
This year's delayed monsoon has not only affected the arrival of some typical winter vegetables and fruits, but has also led to a two-three fold increase in their prices. While carrot and green peas will take a fortnight to a month to reach the markets, strawberries will become easily available only from the first week of December, a delay of more than a month.
November to March is the peak season of green peas and carrots. Erratic rainfall has damaged/delayed local crops at many places.
"The local carrot that comes to Delhi has been delayed. We are getting carrots from areas near Alwar in Rajasthan but they are not preferred for making halwa," said Ramesh Kumar, carrots trader from Azadpur APMC in Delhi. Traders say the local crop from Haryana and Delhi is less by close to 50% this year. "As against 3000-4000 bags/day last year during this time, we are getting only 600-700 bags/day of carrots," said Kumar. Green pea prices too are higher than their normal rates for this time of the year.
"Matar is selling almost three times the price of last year," said Anil Malhotra, committee member of Azadpur APMC. Punjab matar is expected to come after a week. Pune APMC received only four quintals of matar on Wednesday and the prices ranged between Rs 50/kg to Rs 90/kg. Bapu Wadkar, vegetable trader from Pune APMC said, "Arrival of matar is first from Madhya Pradesh. Although the arrival has started, the quality is not good. In most consuming centres outside the growing regions of central and western India, green pea prices are between Rs 60/kg-100/kg."
Similarly, strawberries, which usually hits market from the last week of October, also have missed their usual harvesting time. The juicy fruit started reaching markets only since the past few days. Balasaheb Bhilare, president, All India Strawberry Growers' Association said, "The strawberry season has been delayed by almost a month due to delayed rainfall."

Oil @ $80: Top stocks experts say will benefit the most as fuel gets cheaperbranded textiles leader
(Investment theme: Stocks…)
MUMBAI: Indian markets are well positioned as with the fall in commodity prices such as crude oil & metals.
It will help companies which use these commodities as raw material, in improving their profit margins. According to analysts, the companies may pass through the lower input cost to customers still it gives some leeway in managing the efficiency and improving margins
Crude oil has corrected sharply after Saudi Arabia cut down oil price to the US after rise in US shale gas production. Metals, which rallied sharply in the last bull cycle, are facing a tough time due to slowdown in China.
"In the previous bull cycle of the equity markets we saw a significant rise in commodity prices which is not happening this time maybe because of slowdown in China or whatever other reason. So that is a very big positive for the raw material consuming industries," said Kunj Bansal , ED & CIO , Centrum Wealth Management.
"Companies like auto ancillary, companies like some of the consumer durables, companies like electrical and electronic equipments, fans and all which use steel could be a big idea wherein we can see a margin efficiency improvement," said Bansal added.
The other trend is the drop in crude oil prices. Industries such as plastics, petrochemicals, chemicals etc. use oil as raw material and are likely to benefit from lower input cost.
According to experts, overall the consumer goods sector will be a beneficiary commodity downturn. They can be bought at current levels and dips despite the stretched valuations most of them are available at.
"They are trading at stratospheric valuations and with some reason. Even as the economy was floundering for a while, the aspirational mode of consumers and families kept demand high for these products. The demographics are still favourable towards these companies," said Dipen Sheth, Head-Institutional Research, HDFC Securities
"Some of these valuations might look absurd right now but I do not think these valuations are likely to go away so if you look at the established leaders in the FMCG space like an Asian Paints or Nestle . Why should not a consumer goods company also trade at that kind of multiple and plus of course if they get benefits of lower commodity prices," he added.
He is bullish on Asian Paints despite the high valuations.
Sheth is also bullish on two stocks from consumer industry which he expects to give good returns in the long term.
Siyaram Silk Mills: They are going to announce results shortly. I do not think the results are going to make the stock run away anywhere but it is the branded textiles leader in the value space, it is a poly viscose fabric leader and has got an interesting bit of product mix. Higher value added fabrics are getting into their product mix. They have a fantastic distribution chain. They have been investing in their business for the last two or three years.
They are at the end of their capex cycle so there will be reasonably clean cash flows, high payouts. It is still going at 10x. I think there is value here.
Speciality Restaurants: They went into hibernation after the IPO. Their restaurants will take off as urban consumption revives and so you know what Jubilant trades at for example.
I do not think it is going to happen so spectacularly in the case of Speciality. But gross margins being where they are and food inflation now coming off, it is likely to drive their margin structure especially when occupancies increase.
When this catches the fancy of investors over the next two or three years when urban consumption takes off, people will notice this stock so we are putting our bets there for example.

Not the right time to book booking: AnalystDeepak Shenoy
In a chat with ET Now, Deepak Shenoy, Founder, Capital Mind shares his view on markets:
ET Now: What do you do now, do you stick by with the market or do you profit take because you did talk about now trading with caution at the 8400 level?
Deepak Shenoy: Yes, it is time for caution but it is not time for action in terms of profit booking. We would usually book profits when markets reverse rather than when markets go up because that is kind of accepting the fact that we do not know where the market is going to go.
We were looking at corporate profits and some completely incongruent with what seems to be the opinion in the market today, hardly anybody is bearish but corporate profits have been growing, the Nifty 50 companies that have announce results have shown a consolidated profit growth of less than 5% year on year for the same quarter, so that is a little bit of a worrying data stance.

Just 5% of Indian marriages are inter-caste: surveyAP Inter-caste marriages were rarest in Madhya Pradesh (under 1 per cent) and most common in Gujarat and Bihar (over 11 per cent).
TOPICS
social issue
30 per cent of rural and 20 per cent of urban households said they practised untouchability
Just five per cent of Indians said they had married a person from a different caste, says the first direct estimate of inter-caste marriages in India.
The India Human Development Survey (IHDS), conducted by the National Council for Applied Economic Research (NCAER) and the University of Maryland, also reported that 30 per cent of rural and 20 per cent of urban households said they practised untouchability. The IHDS is the largest non-government, pan-Indian household survey. It covers over 42,000 households, representative by class and social group. Its findings, yet to be made public, were shared exclusively with The Hindu. When married women aged between 15 and 49 were asked if theirs was an inter-caste marriage, just 5.4 per cent said yes, the proportion being marginally higher for urban over rural India.
There was no change in this proportion from the previous round of the IHDS (2004-05). Inter-caste marriages were rarest in Madhya Pradesh (under 1 per cent) and most common in Gujarat and Bihar (over 11 per cent).
Survey finds practice of untouchability
The India Human Development Survey said what female respondents interpreted as a “different caste” is likely to have been subjective, but ultimately closer to the lived reality of an inter-caste marriage.
“Questions on caste are some of the most complex questions Indian surveys can ask. The same person will say ‘I am Baniya’ today and say ‘I am Modh Banik’ tomorrow; both would be correct,” Sonalde Desai, a demographer who is Senior Fellow at NCAER and Professor of Sociology at the University of Maryland, who led the IHDS-II, told The Hindu.
“So the IHDS took a simple approach and asked women whether their natal family belongs to the same caste as their husband’s family, allowing us to bypass the complex issue of defining what caste means and get subjective percept-ions from our respondents,” Dr. Desai said.
The NCAER survey also asked respondents if they practised untouchability, following it up with a question on whether the respondent would allow a lower caste person to enter their kitchen or use their utensils.
A third of rural respondents and a fifth of urban respondents admitted to practising untouchability. The practice was most common among Brahmins (62 per cent in rural India, 39 per cent in urban), followed by Other Backward Classes (OBCs) and then non-Brahmin forward castes.
The only other estimate on the extent of inter-caste marriage came from an indirect method. Comparing the answers that the husbands and wives of the same household gave to the National Family Health Survey, researchers Kumudini Das, K.C. Das, T.K. Roy and P.K. Tripathy found that 11 per cent of couples in the 2005-06 NFHS stated different caste groups.
“This was an indirect way of estimating the extent of inter-caste marriages. We cannot say if it was accurate, but it was a way to approach the truth,” Dr. K.C. Das, Professor in the Department of Migration and Urban Studies at the Mumbai-based International Institute of Population Sciences (IIPS), explained to The Hindu.

Karnataka has mangrove patches, a study finds
Divya Gandhi
Mangroves act as “green shields” buffering the coastline against sea erosion, and the potentially devastating impacts of cyclones and tsunami.

The Forest Survey of India missed recording mangroves patches as they were not large
Scientists analysed a set of satellite imagery to discover mangrove, an unlikely ecological wealth on Karnataka’s coast that successive forest surveys of India have completely missed out. In fact, the State has a sizeable stretch of mangrove forests, a vibrant saline-water ecosystem generally associated with India’s east coast.
In a paper published recently in the journal Geophysics & Remote Sensing, researchers identify 300 hectares of mangrove forest in Karnataka, spread over three coastal districts. Mangrove shrubs, known best for a thriving aquatic life nurtured within their mesh of stilt-roots also serve a vital socio-economic function. They act as “green shields” buffering the coastline against sea erosion, and the potentially devastating impacts of cyclones and tsunami.
Its impact-reducing potential was best evident along the east coast after tsunami struck India in December 2004. The team looked at high spatial resolution, multi spectral data to infer the geographical distribution and status of mangroves, including plant species, along the coast. And they found that while mangroves have been declining in several parts of the world from timber harvesting and pollution, these forests in Karnataka have in fact grown spatially over the last two decades.
At the confluence of four rivers — Aghanashini, Gangavali, Sharavati and Venkatapura — and the Arabian Sea “is a long stretch of dense and tall mangrove vegetation… with a high number of mangrove plant species” locally known as Kandla or Sundari, says the paper. Mangroves exist and are growing in the districts of Udupi, Dakshina Kannada and Uttara Kannada. “The rejuvenation owes entirely to local conservation efforts, both by forest officials and communities, in reforestation and protection,” said lead author of the research paper T.V. Ramachandra, professor with the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru. These patches of mangroves went unrecorded by the Forest Survey because they are not very large, said co-author Bharath Setturu, of IISc. “FSI also only recently began using remote sensing and relied largely on ground-reporting.”
A devastating super cyclone of 1999, followed by the 2004 tsunami raised awareness about the irreplaceability of mangroves, he added. The rate of expansion indicates the mangrove’s resilience and ability to occupy new habitats, the paper says. In Aghnashini estuary, mangroves grew by four per cent between 1989 and 2010. A decline in shrimp culture in the 1990s led to a natural regeneration of mangroves, aided by reforestation with select mangrove species.
In the Gangavali estuarine region, mangroves went up from 48.77 to 51.59 per cent in the same time frame, this time from a reduction in monoculture plantation. Two other estuaries — Sharavathi and Venkatapura — showed a similar rejuvenation of mangrove species. Plant species such as Rhizophora mucronata, Sonneratia caseolaris, Avicennia officinalis, Sonneratia alba, and Kandelia candel representing both high salinity and low salinity tolerant shrubs were assessed in these estuaries.
The importance of mangroves cannot be emphasised more, Dr. Ramachandra said: “They support livelihood, essentially aquaculture, they supply medicinal plants, and fuel wood and construction materials. And in terms of ecological services, they stabilise shorelines, are nurseries for fish breeding and filter heavy metals.”
According to the paper, the value of an estuary is calculated as $19120 per hectare per year if all “goods and services” are taken into account: shrimps, fish and crabs; mangrove shrubs; nutrient cycling, hydrology, soil protection and a sink for carbon.

Filmmaker Rajkumar Hirani seems to be upset about what he’s seeing on the internet. While an online grocery store has used the logo of his upcoming film PK to lure customers, another merchandise website is selling cardholders that look like mini versions of the transistor used in the Aamir Khan-starrer film.
Aamir, Anushka, Rajkumar Hirani and Vidhu Vinod Chopra were seen at the teaser launch of PK.
The filmmaker is contemplating taking legal action against both the web portals. A source close to Hirani reveals, "He has been busy with the editing of the film, and has had no time to notice these things on his own. When people showed him the advertisement and the merchandise item, he was shocked. When he saw the advertisement on the grocery portal, he realised that they were using the logo of the film to sell grocery items like potatoes and onions. They are even cashing in on the release date as the value on the grocery item is Rs. 19 (the film is set to release on December 19)."
The online store that’s selling cardholders in the shape of a transistor used in film-maker Rajkumar Hirani’s upcoming release, showcased it on their website last week. A source says that Hirani will meet his legal advisor soon to discuss the matter with him and take appropriate action. "It’s amusing that an element we created is being used to sell potatoes, even before the release of the film. It’s a legal matter and needs to be tackled appropriately," says Hirani.

BJP hopeful of tie-up with Sena despite trust vote squabbleComments
With the Shiv Sena sitting in the Opposition, the possibility of the Uddhav Thackeray-led party joining hands with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to form the government seemed almost next to impossible on Wednesday. But according to insiders, the BJP may attempt to woo the Sena, though without any conditions, to expand the state Cabinet ahead of the winter session of the legislature, which is expected to start in Nagpur on December 8.
The BJP is hopeful of reaching an agreement with its former ally, which boycotted the union Cabinet expansion last weekend but has not yet quit the Narendra Modi government. 
Though refusing to comment further, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis told HT he plans to expand the Cabinet before the Nagpur session.
Revenue minister Eknath Khadse told the media the expansion will happen after a fortnight.
On Wednesday, the Shiv Sena made some calculated moves, fearing a total disenchantment in the BJP camp.
It did make noise against the trust vote, calling it anti-constitutional, but did not participate in the protests being
staged by the Congressagainst governor Ch Vidyasagar Rao.
The Congress got its five legislators suspended for two years on charges of manhandling the governor before he addressed the joint session.
Expectedly, the Sena legislators, who had taken the lead in blocking the governor’s car at the main gate before the Congressmen stepped, were spared by the government. Insiders in the BJP said their party did not want to humiliate the Sena further.
Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray’s close aide Milind Narvekar called on both Fadnavis and Khadse in their offices in the legislature on Wednesday and had a brief chat with them.
Sources said the Sena claimed the post of the Opposition leader because the Congress, too, wanted it. The Sena also responded to CM Fadnavis’ request for withdrawing from the Speaker’s contest.
In their failed talks, the Sena expected the BJP to concede its demands —10-12 ministerial berths with key portfolios and the post of deputy chief minister or home minister — to vote in favour of the trust vote on November 12.
But the BJP wanted the Sena to make “reasonable” demands, as the BJP has 121 seats. The two parties split just before the Assembly elections after 25 years together.
Some BJP leaders still prefer to take the Sena along as they believe associating with the NCP would be politically damaging in the future.

Delhi: African immigrant s rapists jailed  court ignores  sex worker  pastDelhi court upholds sex workers dignity, jails rapists

Four men who raped a Rwandan woman refugee in Delhi just weeks before the brutal December 16 gangrape shook the Capital have been found guilty and sentenced to the maximum penalty of 10 years in jail by a Delhi court.
The men, in their defence, had claimed the woman was a prostitute and an illegal immigrant who had falsely implicated them to find an excuse to stay on in the country. The court, however, said their argument “deserves to be rejected outright”.
During her cross-examination, the woman said she previously worked as a prostitute. However, the judge said it was irrelevant to the case. “Simply because the victim worked as a sex worker before the incident in question doesn’t confer any right upon anyone to violate her dignity,” additional sessions judge Kaveri Baweja said.
 
The court further noted that DNA evidence found on the convicts left no doubt there were physical relations between them and the rape survivor, adding “it is not the claim of the accused that the prosecutrix entered into sexual relations with the accused voluntarily”.
“This is a good judgment. The ministry of women and child has already clarified that no action needs to be taken against foreign nationals who may have been brought here and forced into trafficking. It’s good that the court has reinforced this stand,” Ravi Kant, president of NGO Shakti Vahini that works for gender  equality, told HT.
The convicts Deepak, Praveen, Vikas and Ashok Ekka — all Delhi residents — were sentenced to 10 years in jail for gang-rape and abduction.They were also ordered to pay a compensation of Rs. 59,000 to the rape survivor.
According to the rape survivor’s statement, she was walking towards Gandhi Nagar around 7pm on December 1, 2012 when three men in a car grabbed her.
She was then drugged, brutally beaten and raped in the moving car before she lost consciousness. She woke up naked and bleeding on the banks of the Yamuna.
Her clothes, wallet and money were later recovered from the homes of the accused.

Nine months later  police find Sunandas belongings missing9 months later, 'Sunanda's belongings missing'
Karn Pratap Singh , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, November 12, 2014

Nine months after she was found mysteriously dead in a hotel room, the Delhi Police have woken up to find that some of the personal belongings of Sunanda Pushkar have been missing all this while.
Police sources said they have not found the clothes Sunanda was wearing when she had checked into the hotel. She was found dead on her bed in her night dress. The police also did not find her footwear in the room. Her handbag is also missing. It was unlikely that Sunanda, the wife of former Union minister Shashi Tharoor, was not carrying her purse when she checked into the hotel.
The police did find a bag in the room but it only had a few Alprax tablets. They now believe that someone must have removed Sunanda’s belongings.
The police realised this last week when they revisited the crime scene - suite number 345 of the Leela Palace hotel where Sunanda was found dead on January 17. The police team was accompanied by forensic experts from CFSL and members of the AIIMS medical board that had conducted Sunanda’s autopsy.
Earlier, an AIIMS medical board, while submitting its fresh report on the cause of Sunanda’s death, had highlighted the laxity on the part of south Delhi police in terms of collecting evidence.
Following its advice, the police had written to the AIIMS medical board and CFSL, asking their representatives to accompany them during their revisit to the crime scene. 
The crime scene investigation, which should have happened much earlier, took place only after the board in its final opinion reiterated its earlier stand that Sunanda had died of poisoning.
A police officer privy to the inquest proceeding said that evidence collection from the crime scene was done by the forensic experts and the entire procedure was videographed. “Since the initial investigation was done by the SDM, we had limited role to play in the matter,” said the police officer.
Throughout the investigation, the top brass of the Delhi Police remained tight-lipped on the probe into Sunanda’s death.

Dinanath Batra to guide Haryana on educationDinanath Batra to guide Haryana on education
Navneet Sharma , Hindustan Times  Chandigarh, November 12, 2014
First Published: 22:19 IST(12/11/2014) | Last Updated: 10:00 IST(13/11/2014)
RSS ideologue Dinanath Batra will advise Haryana’s new Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government on education as part of a new committee of educationists, the state’s education minister said on Wednesday.
 
The move to rope in Batra,  a controversial author and activist devoted to recasting India’s history from the perspective of the Hindu right, is the first sign of the role the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) may play in policy formulation in Haryana.
 
Education minister Ram Bilas Sharma said the committee comprising well-known educationists and experts, including retired teachers and professors from the state education department, and Jat and Hindu educational institutions, will advise to the state government on steps to improve the education system.
 
“I will constitute an advisory committee of educationists under the tutelage of Dinanathji Batra to give advice on education-related issues,” Sharma told HT in an exclusive interview.
 
Sharma said the government decided to choose Batra, national convenor of the RSS-backed Shiksha Bachao Andolan Samiti, because he was a well-known educationist.
 
“He is a well-known educationist from Haryana. When he was principal of Gita School in Kurukshetra, I had worked with him as teacher,” said Sharma.
 
Batra, who was responsible for the pulping of American scholar Wendy Doniger's book on Hinduism for allegedly causing religious offence, has been at the centre of controversy for his efforts to Indianise education.
 
A one-time RSS pracharak and president of the Shiskha Sanskriti Utthan Nyas, he was in the news recently for demanding the revamp of education, curriculum and textbooks to introduce concepts that promote “modernity with Indian values”.
 
Historians have dismissed his books , which have been recommended as secondary reading in Gujarat schools, as nothing but works of “fantasy”.
 
According to media reports, the books contain several moral and political prescriptions such as a proposal to redraw the map of India in line with the right-wing idea of an Akhand Bharat. They also suggest that birthdays should not be celebrated by blowing candles on the grounds that it is Western culture. Instead, they should be marked by wearing swadeshi clothes, having havans, reciting mantras such as the Gayatri mantra and feeding cows.
 
His Shiksha Bachao Andolan Samiti has also reportedly convened a national conference of academics and experts to examine the national education policy. The new Haryana government has already halted the ongoing revision of textbooks for government schools in the state.
 
On the role of the RSS in policy formulation in the state, Sharma said the organisation was working nation-wide and had played a big role in “character building and value education”.
 
“The RSS will definitely have a role. The chief minister (Manohar Lal Khattar) is an old pracharak. I have been a pracharak too,” he added.

Helped by softening prices of food items, the retail inflation declined to 5.52 per cent in October, the lowest since the new series of data was introduced in January 2012.
This is the fourth consecutive month of decline in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) based inflation or retail inflation which had fallen to 6.46 per cent in the previous month.
The overall food inflation measured on CPI came down to 5.59 per cent in October as against 7.67 per cent in the previous month.

RBI's next monetary policy is due on December 2, 2014.

Power Grid shares fall 3% on disappointing Q2 earningsPower Grid shares fall 3 per cent on disappointing Q2 earnings
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: November 12, 2014  | 18:23 IST
Power Grid Corporation shares fell over 3 per cent on the bourses, wiping out Rs 2,379 crore from its market valuation, after the company reported a decline in net profit for the quarter ended September 30.
After falling 3.69 per cent to Rs 142 in intra-day trade on the Bombay Stock Exchange, shares of the state-owned company finally ended 3.09 per cent lower at Rs 142.90. On the National Stock Exchange, it settled at Rs 143.05, down 3.12 per cent from its previous close.
Tracking weakness in the stock, the company's market value dipped by Rs 2,379.58 crore to Rs 74,759.42 crore.
In terms of volume, 2.21 lakh shares of the company changed hands on BSE while more than 35 lakh shares were traded on NSE during the day.
The company had on Tuesday reported a marginal decline in net profit for the quarter ended September at Rs 1,201.27 crore due to higher finance cost.
Power Grid's net profit during the corresponding quarter last financial year stood at Rs 1,239.2 crore, the company had said in a filing to the BSE.
Its total income during the July-September quarter increased 5 per cent to Rs 4,309.26 crore from Rs 4,104.43 crore a year-ago. Power Grid's finance cost increased by 23.41 per cent to Rs 989.09 crore from Rs 801.41 crore in the comparable period last year.

Gold demand rises by 39 per cent for Sept-quarterMeenakshi Sharma and Rajendra Jadhav     Mumbai   Last Updated: November 13, 2014  | 14:32 IST

Gold demand in the country jumped by more than a third in the September-quarter, in sharp contrast to the rest of the world, boosted by jewellery demand for the wedding season, the World Gold Council said on Thursday.
Domestic demand climbed up by 39 per cent to 225.1 tonnes in the July-September period of the current financial year, the second highest on record for the quarter, even as global demand fell to its lowest in nearly five years, according to the industry body.
Consumption in China, the world's other major buyer of gold, plunged 37 per cent year-on-year in the corresponding period. Although domestic demand overtook China for the quarter, it still lagged for the total from the first nine months of the year.
Thus, the country once again took over as the world's biggest gold consumer, buying 225.1 tonnes of gold jewellery, coins and bars in the previous quarter, compared to 182.7 tonnes in China.
"Demand will continue to have positive growth over last year as this is a good demand period and a lot of marriages are happening," said Somasundaram PR, head of the WGC's domestic operations.
Jewellery demand in the country rose by 60 per cent in the third quarter, but investment demand dropped 10 per cent.
The WGC maintained its prediction that domestic demand would reach 850-950 tonnes for the year, driven by jewellery purchases.
However, gold investment demand is likely to fall to 25 per cent of total demand this year, from 37 per cent the year before, Somasundaram said, as a sharp price drop has shaken the confidence of investors in bullion as a store of value.
The industry body said jewellery demand was also boosted by a weakening of gold prices in rupee terms and by widespread confidence in the new government, along with the onset of the festival season.
Gold imports for September surged 450 per cent to US $3.75 billion.
"Demand for the fourth quarter as a whole is expected to be healthy, but the September surge in imports is unlikely to be replicated," WGC said.
The jump in domestic demand for gold comes after a weaker period in FY14 when consumption was hurt by curbs on imports.
Struggling with a high trade deficit, the government in the 2013-14 fiscal raised its gold import duty to a record 10 per cent and made it mandatory to export a fifth of all bullion imports.

Govt resolves food security issues with USIndia, US resolve impasse over food security issues at WTO

Paving the way for implementation of trade facilitation pacts at WTO , India and US have resolved an impasse over food security related issues while safeguarding interest of Indian farmers.
With the US agreeing to support India's proposal on public stockpiling of food, it would now go for ratification by the WTO General Council to facilitate signing of Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) that has been stalled for months.
Announcing the breakthrough, Commerce and Industry Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that India and the US have successfully resolved their differences on the public stockholding issue for food security purposes in WTO.
This will "pave the way for spurring the WTO to more such success," she said, while expressing confidence that members would "take the matter forward in WTO in a constructive spirit".
The Minister further said that many nations saw merit in India's stand at WTO and that the US has also "appreciated and now openly supported our concerns on public stockholding."
"India has never obstructed trade facilitation. We were only trying to safeguard our farmer's interests," she added.
"WTO General Council will receive India's proposal and US will support us," Sitharaman said, while adding that there was a greater understanding of India's position after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's  visit to the US.
India is a strong supporter of the multilateral trading system and we are committed to strengthen it. Bali agreement was not perfect. We had raised these issues for a course correction. We have raised our issues. We are happy to say our differences have been resolved," she said in a series of tweets.

Alibaba says `Singles Day shoppers spend $2 bn in first hourAlibaba says `Singles Day’ shoppers spend $2 bn in first hour

Reuters The logo of the Alibaba Group is seen inside the company's headquarters in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province November 11, 2014. The "11.11 Shopping Festival", which Alibaba says is the world's biggest 24-hour online sale, began in 2009 when just 27 merchants on the company's Tmall.com site offered deep discounts to boost sales during an otherwise slack period.
Reuters Employees and journalists take pictures and shoot video of an electronic board showing the online transaction value on Alipay, an online payment system of China's leading e-commerce retailers Taobao.com and Tmall.com, at parent company Alibaba's headquarters in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province early November 11, 2014. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd said about $2 billion worth of goods were sold on the e-commerce giant's websites within the first hour and 12 seconds of its annual shopping festival.
Shanghai, Nov 11:  
Alibaba said a record $2 billion of goods were sold in the first hour of its Singles Day shopping bonanza in China today, maintaining the day’s dominance as the world’s biggest retail event as it went global for the first time.
The e-commerce giant said that amount was more than a third of the $5.8 billion full-day sales recorded on the same day last year and analysts say this year will blow that out of the water.
Alibaba has been pushing November 11 as Singles Day — so named for the number of ones in the date — since 2009 as it looks to tap an expanding army of Internet shoppers in China, which has the world’s biggest online population.
Singles Day already surpassed major shopping festivals in the U.S. in terms of transaction value last year, toppling the combined online sales of $3.7 billion recorded on Thanksgiving Day, Black Friday and Cyber Monday, according to an estimate by Internet analytics firm comScore.
The day was originally marketed as an “anti-Valentine’s Day” in China featuring hefty discounts to lure the country’s singletons and price-sensitive buyers.
It has been expanded globally this year to include overseas merchants and customers.
Within the first hour and 12 seconds, more than $2 billion) of deals were settled on both domestic and international retail marketplaces, Alibaba said in a statement, adding that 45.7 per cent of the transactions were made via mobile devices.
Headquartered in the eastern city of Hangzhou, Alibaba debuted its shares in New York two months ago with a record-breaking $25 billion initial public offering.
The giant operates China’s most popular online shopping platform, Taobao, which is estimated to hold more than 90 per cent of the online market for consumer-to-consumer transactions.
The company does not sell products directly but acts as an electronic middleman. It also owns other marketplaces, including business-to-consumer platform Tmall.
More than 27,000 brands and merchants are participating in this year’s Singles Day, while consumers in more than 220 countries and regions will be able to join the 24-hour spending spree, the statement said.

Bank strike may hit trading volumes tomorrowBank strike may hit trading volumes tomorrow

MUMBAI, Nov 11:  
Dealers are bracing for low volumes across all markets in India on Wednesday as unions at most banks have called for a nationwide strike that is expected to leave trading rooms with minimal staffing but not shut down activity altogether.
The strike is expected to hit all state-run banks, and also some private lenders, and could also impact market functions such as trade settlements to some extent, the dealers said.
Still the Reserve Bank of India will operate as usual and can provide funds via its overnight repo window, traders also said.
"There will be minimum presence in the treasury department to run the necessary functions," said a dealer at a state-run bank.
"So volumes will be affected in government securities, call and forex."
Trade unions have called a bank strike on Wednesday for all state-controlled lenders over a set of demands including for higher wages and a five-day work week.
Vishwas Utagi, one of the leaders of a union representing state-run lenders, said he expected 1 million employees to participate in the strike, although the number could not be independently verified.

Spirituality may speed up patients  recoveryCircumcision advised for teenage boys
Spirituality may play a huge role in a patients’ recovery from illness when there is little hope, meaning and purpose in their life, a new study suggests.
Researchers said the term ‘spirituality’ is now widely used to describe the qualities that give people hope, meaning and purpose.
In the case of patients, it can aid their recovery, they said.
“It helps to sustain health care workers and patients by recognising and supporting a sense of meaning and purpose in life,” said Melanie Rogers, a Senior Lecturer and Advanced Nurse Practitioner at the University of Huddersfield.
“It can improve resilience in patients and practitioners alike, in addition to improving the experience of illness and crisis in patients,” said Rogers.
She acknowledges that for some people, spirituality derives from religious beliefs. But for many others it stems from factors such as their relationships, community connections and special interests.
“Spirituality and the practitioners approach to their patients play a huge part in recovery from illness,” said Rogers.
“One way is to spend time listening to the patient – being fully present and engaged in the relationship. Spirituality is about the patient being the focus and it is very practical, not at all airy fairy, and we know it sustains health care workers and patients,” said Rogers.

Moderate drinking healthy for some people: StudyCircumcision advised for teenage boys
Moderate alcohol consumption can protect against coronary heart disease, but only for people who have a particular genotype, according to a new study.
The study included 618 Swedes with coronary heart disease and a control group of 3,000 healthy subjects. The subjects were assigned to various categories based on the amount of alcohol they consumed (ethanol intake).
They were tested in order to identify a particular genotype (CETP TaqIB) that previous studies had found to play a role in the health benefits of alcohol consumption.
The results confirm the findings of the earlier studies. Moderate consumption of alcohol helps protect people with the genotype against coronary heart disease.
“In other words, moderate drinking has a protective effect among only 15 per cent of the general population,” said Professor Dag Thelle, Professor Emeritus at Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg.
The researchers believe that the advice frequently given about the health benefits of moderate alcohol consumption is far too sweeping.
“Moderate drinking alone does not have a strong protective effect. Nor does this particular genotype. But the combination of the two appears to significantly reduce the risk of coronary heart disease,” said Professor Lauren Lissner, who also participated in the study.
The genotype codes for the Cholesterylester transfer protein (CETP), which affects the ‘good,’ cardio-protective HDL cholesterol that helps remove excess lipids from the blood vessels. One hypothesis is that alcohol somehow affects the CETP in a way that benefits HDL cholesterol.
A second hypothesis is that alcohol contains healthy, protective antioxidants.
The researchers believe that one or both of the hypotheses may prove correct, but the mechanisms by which HDL cholesterol or antioxidants might act remain unknown.
The study was published in the journal Alcohol.

Analyst Corner: Outperform on Adani Ports on SEZ landmonetisationKotak Mahindra Bank: Deal and after
We maintain ‘outperformer’ on Adani Ports & SEZ (APSEZ) with a March 2016-based revised price target of R342 from R313 earlier, the price revision reflecting increased visibility on SEZ land monetisation. We like APSEZ for its strong asset base, visibility on cargo and sustained cash flows.
With the Mundra SEZ now receiving its final environment clearance, we expect a pick-up in its development. With a land bank of 16,000 acres, this SEZ is likely to be a key value driver going forward. We expect 28% earnings CAGR over FY14-17e.
APSEZ adjusted consolidated PAT grew 6.3% y-o-y to R590 crore, led by land related income of R200 crore. Reported PAT after considering derivative loss of R16 crore grew 68% y-o-y to R570 crore.
Consolidated cargo volumes grew 25% y-o-y to 35.2 million tonnes led by strong growth in coal and container cargo even as crude volumes remained weak due to maintenance shutdown at HMEL’s Bhatinda refinery. Cargo at Mundra grew 8% y-o-y to 26.6 million tonnes, at Dahej by 31% y-o-y to 3.3 million tonnes and Hazira by 48% y-o-y to 1.45 million tonnes. Dhamra was consolidated for the first full quarter with cargo of 3.6 million tonnes.
Consolidated revenues grew 44% y-o-y to R1650 crore and ebitda grew 39% y-o-y to R1050 crore. Ebitda margin declined 230 bps y-o-y to 63.5%. Consolidated net debt increased to R16,500 crore from R12,500 crore as on March 2014 due to acquisition of Dhamra and restatement of forex loans.

Higher valuation than Sensex makes mid caps a trickychoiceKotak Mahindra Bank: Deal and after
Selecting stocks from the mid-cap space has turned tricky for investors despite their potential to offer higher earnings growth over the next two years, thanks to the outstanding gains made by most of these scrips in the year so far.
On the back of a 50% rally so far in 2014, the BSE mid-cap index currently trades at a near-peak relative valuation to its large-cap counterpart, the 30-share Sensex. Currently, the mid-cap index is trading at a one-year forward price-to-earnings ratio of 15.77; the Sensex is trading at a P/E multiple of 15.57.
While more than a half of the BSE mid-cap universe has outdone year-to-date Sensex returns (31%), as many as 30 stocks from the 267 constituents have more than doubled this year.
Market experts say after three years of under-performance, mid caps had a high potential to catch up, but, now, as a general re-rating of the space may be over, investors ought to turn stock-specific, given that many of these are trading way ahead of their fundamentals.
According to Nilesh Surana, head of equity at Mirae Assets Global investments India, now that the overall valuation gap to the market has been breached, companies with scalable businesses and good earnings visibility should be preferred. “The focus should shift towards cash-flow generation from an optimism of re-rating potential,” added Surana.
In a recent strategy note, Axis Capital argued that while the mid-cap space usually does well when the economic growth surprises, individual mid caps have their own long-term sustainability shortcomings.
The brokerage used several financial and operational parameters, including EPS growth, RoE expansion, pricing power, scalability, ability to generate free cash and de-risked business model, to shortlist its mid-cap picks.
As per data compiled by Bloomberg, the consensus one-year forward earnings growth for the BSE mid-cap index with 267 stocks stands at 57% compared to a 24% growth projected for the top-30 companies that constitute the Sensex.
However, data also suggest that some of the frontrunners in the latest rally continued to demonstrate inferior financial performance in the last three quarters. For example, companies like BASF, Century Textile, Wockhardt, Muthoot Finance, State Bank of Bikaner, EIH and Hexaware Tech, which have either reported losses in the three months to September or seen profit growth decline in three of the last four quarters, have rallied anywhere between 60% and 85% in the year so far.
According to UBS, as small- and mid-cap stocks (SMID) have continued to rally after the election on hopes of an acceleration in growth recovery, many stocks are running ahead of fundamentals.
The brokerage noted that foreign inflows over the past 3-4 years have increasingly come from exchange-traded funds, Global Emerging Markets (GEM) and international funds, which are not big buyers of SMID stocks; inflows from dedicated India funds, on the other hand, have shrunk.
“While local institutions have finally started to see inflows, retail participation has increased. This provides technical support for SMIDs in the near term, as has arguably happened over the past 3-4 months,” noted analyst Gautam Chhaochharia in the report.

Nashik onion farmers turn to othercropsGold futures price falls on global cues
Farmers in Nashik, India’s largest onion belt, have begun to turn their back on onion cultivation and are looking at other lucrative options.
“Farmers have been suffering losses for three to four years on account of natural calamities and have not been getting good prices. Seed shortage and higher prices demanded by seed companies are also forcing them to look at other crops. In the next two years, Maharashtra could face a major setback in onion cultivation,” Nanasaheb Patil, chairman, Lasalgaon Agriculture Produce Market Committee ( APMC), warned.
According to data shared by the agriculture department, kharif onion has been planted on 7,662 hectares as against the usual 20,584 hectares this year. In late kharif as well, plantation has fallen to 23,380 hecta-res as against an average area of 35,500 hectares. Around 30% of traditional onion farmers have preferred to plant other crops, industry watchers said.
Patil agrees, saying that while it is difficult to gather accurate data, several farmers in the region have been talking about shifting to other crops because of falling prices and seasonal factors in addition to greater government intervention. Farmers are reportedly shifting to bajra, jowar and corn. Rising cost of production is also affecting the sentiment since this is a labour-intensive crop. The cost of production comes to R56,000 per acre to R90,000 per acre and the yield barely comes to 88 quintals per acre which is not viable for farmers, Patil pointed out.
Niphad, Sinnar, Yeola, Dindori, Devala, Malegaon, Satana and Nandgaon are considered major onion growing areas in Nashik. According to data shared by department officials, there has been a marked decrease in plantation of onion in 8 talukas of the district. This year, farmers went into loss because of factors such as hailstorms and non-seasonal rain. The two month delay in the monsoon led to delay in the kharif crop.
Seed shortage has been another major issue. Seed plots are sensitive crops and need to be carefully nurtured in times of non-seasonal rain.
“While Mahabeej has announced a rate of R1,700 per kg, other seed companies have begun to charge rates to the tune of R3,700 per kg and R4,500 per kg. Although National Horticulture Research & Development Foundation (NHRDF) does supply seeds, this is not enough to meet the requirements of farmers,” a farmer said.
RP Gupta, director of NHRDF, says acreage has been going down for late kharif and rabi seasons. There has been a delay in planting this year and farmers have not been getting prices they desired, he said.
Patil said that although farmers talk of shifting to other crops, this cannot be considered a solution. The government needs to intervene.
Average wholesale onion price at Lasalgaon was recorded at R1,375 a quintal last week. The minimum and maximum prices were recorded at R500 and R1,580 a quintal, respectively. Around 10,000 quintals of onions were auctioned at Lasalgaon.
In Pimpalgaon, average wholesale onion price was recorded at R1,400 a quintal . The minimum and maximum prices were recorded at R800 and R1,700 a quintal, respectively. Around 6,250 quintals were auctioned at Pimpalgaon.

No stock limits on commodities in regulated warehouses:FMCAcceding to a long-pending demand by the commodity futures market regulator as well as participants, the government has excluded items stored in regulated warehouses from the ambit of stock limits imposed by state governments to control hoarding.
“The commodities kept in regulated warehouse (registered by the Warehousing Development and Regulatory Authority) have been
exempted from stockholding limits under the Essential Commodity Act, 1955, subject to the condition that the warehouses publish the information of stock available with them on real-time basis,” the Forward Markets Commission (FMC) said in a letter to various commodity exchanges on November 7.
The commodity futures market regulator has now asked the exchanges to inform market participants about the decision.
The decision was taken  to remove any perceived anomalies between the Essential Commodities (EC) Act and Forward Contracts Regulation Act (FCRA). While the EC Act permits states to fix limits on stocks a commodity dealer can hold, the FCRA allows a holder of a commodity futures position to offer or take delivery of essential items from warehouses without any limits.
Late last month, consumer affairs secretary Keshav Desiraji had written to then economic affairs secretary Arvind Mayaram, approving the proposal.
“An advisory has been issued to all states in this regard,” Desiraju had said in the letter. The WDRA, with which all warehouses catering to the futures markets are mandated to be registered, is under the administrative control of the consumer affairs ministry, while FMC was last year shifted to the finance ministry following a R5,600-crore settlement crisis at the National Spot Exchange Ltd (NSEL).
“This is a good move by the government, as it will attract more volumes and more  genuine investors to trade in a structured market in a transparent manner,” said CP Krishnan, director at Geojit Comtrade.
Hailing the move, SMC Comtrade chairman DK Aggarwal said many traders were not hedging large volumes due to stock limits imposed by various states on essential items.
Commodity exchanges’ turnover goes down Commodity exchanges’ turnover dropped 15% in the second fortnight of October from a year before, although the fall is much lower than that of 51% recorded during the April-October period this fiscal.
Market participants have blamed a 0.01% transaction tax on non-farm commodity derivatives, imposed since July, the spill-over effect of a settlement crisis at the National Spot Exchange Limited, curbs on gold supplies and an investor shift towards equity for the plunge in turnover.
The trading value of various commodities in the second half of October hit R2,69,776.07 crore, compared with R3,17,322.72 crore a
year before, according to the FMC data.
Although the pace of the slide was slower than in the previous months,  the turnover of various exchanges hit R34,52,214.15 crore in the April-October period, as against R71,60,162.84 crore, the data showed.
FMC has also “discontinued” guarseed and guargum contracts traded on the  Multi-Commodity Exchange (MCX) in October, November and December.
The MCX itself had requested for the discontinuation of guar contracts.  Moreover, to curb volatility, the FMC has also asked  exchanges to impose a minimum initial deposit amount of 5% for guargum and guarseed.

Narendra Modi (file photo)
Nay Pyi Taw, Nov 12:  
Prime Minister Narendra Modi today invited Malaysian companies to come to India in a big way, saying there are a “lot of opportunities” for them since he is giving high importance to the ambitious ‘Make in India’ campaign.
Modi’s call came during a bilateral meeting with his Malaysian counterpart Najib Razak at the Myanmar International Convention Centre on the sidelines of the 12th ASEAN-India summit on the second day of his ten-day three-nation tour of Myanmar, Australia and Fiji.
“I am giving lot of emphasis to makeinindia & want to invite Malaysian companies to come to India. There are lot of opportunities,” Modi tweeted shortly after his meeting.
India has traditionally relied on investments from Japan, South Korea, Europe and the US.
Modi told Najib that Malaysia and India have worked together in the past and that the two countries can take this much further under his leadership.
Noting that Malaysia has worked a lot on affordable housing, Modi said its companies can work in this area since his government wants every Indian to have a home by 2022.
Modi and Najib also invited each other to visit their countries.
“Reformers meet, share thoughts on government and economic reforms,” External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Syed Akbaruddin tweeted, referring to the Modi—Najib meeting.
With the total trade between the two countries being USD 12.3 billion in January to November 2013 period, against Malaysia—China trade of USD 95 billion, Indian officials said there is an excellent scope to augment the bilateral trade.

Sensex up 98.84 pts  closes above 28 000-mark for first time; Nifty ends at new peak of 8 383.30Kotak Mahindra Bank: Deal and after
The BSE Sensex today closed above the 28,000-mark for the first time and the Nifty touched 8,400-level with sustained buying by foreign funds in auto, banking, FMCG and consumer durable stocks amid hopes of easing inflation and encouraging IIP numbers.
Continuing its surge for the third day, the BSE Sensex hit fresh life-time high of 28,126.48. After paring some gains, the 30-share index settled at an all-time closing high of 28,008.90, up by 98.84 points, or 0.35 per cent, over the previous close. It surpassed the earlier record closing of 27,915.88 touched on November 5.
The gauge had gained 41.43 points in the previous two sessions.
It took 45 trading sessions from September 2 to November 12 to reach the psychological 28,000-level from 27,000.
The NSE Nifty crossed the key 8,400-mark for the first time to hit an all-time high of 8,415.05, breaching its earlier record of 8,383.05 on November 10.
However, some profit-booking at record levels trimmed part of gains but the Nifty ended at a new record high of 8,383.30, up 20.65 points. It surpassed its previous closing peak of 8,362.65 in yesterday’s trade.
A host of positive developments on domestic as well as global fronts buoyed the market and lifted key indices to new highs.
Brokers said sentiment remained positive and foreign funds continued their buying spree on the domestic bourses and retail investors enlarged positions amid strong quarterly earnings posted by blue-chip companies and hopes of further push to economic reforms by the Centre after the recent Cabinet reshuffle.
Further, expectations of encouraging economic data such as inflation for October and IIP numbers for September, to be released after market hours today, buoyed trading sentiments, they said.
Meanwhile, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) remained the main driving force behind the current bull-run. FPIs bought shares worth a net Rs 458.04 crore yesterday, according to provisional data from the stock exchanges.
Sensex components which supported the key indices to hit fresh life-time high were Axis Bank (3.02 pc), Bajaj Auto (2.10 pc), HDFC Ltd (1.12 pc), SBI (0.17 pc), ICICI Bank (1.33 pc), HDFC Bank (0.44 pc), ITC Ltd (1.55 pc), Bharti Airtel (0.64 pc), BHEL (0.88 pc), Coal India (0.10 pc), Dr Reddy (0.58 pc), Hero MotoCorp (1.50 pc), Tata Motors (1.71 pc) and TCS (0.55 pc).
Sectorwise, BSE Auto index gained the most by rising 1.18 per cent, followed by Bank index 1.12 per cent, FMCG 0.96 per cent and Consumer Durables index 0.55 per cent.
Buying activity in small and midcap also gathered momentum, with the BSE midcap index rising by 0.47 per cent and smallcap index by 0.20 per cent.
Indian shares hit record highs before CPI data
(Reuters) Indian shares touched record highs for the second time this week as rate-sensitive stocks such as Axis Bank rose on hopes easing inflation would prompt the central bank to cut interest rates earlier than expected.
Consumer inflation in October, due at 5:30 p.m. (1200 GMT), is expected to have eased to a record low of 5.80 percent, dragged by sharp drops in food and oil prices, according to a Reuters poll.
If the forecast is met, it would also make the central bank’s inflation targets – 8 percent by January 2015 and 6 percent a year later – appear more attainable.
“The market is expecting inflation to come down very fast. So if the rates are not cut then certainly some momentum will be lost,” said Vinod Nair, head of fundamental research at Geojit BNP Paribas Financial Services Ltd.
The benchmark BSE index closed 0.35 percent up, after earlier rising as much as 0.78 percent to an all-time high of 28,126.48.
The broader NSE index rose 0.25 percent after earlier gaining as much as 0.63 percent to a record high of 8,415.05.
Rate-sensitive stocks led, with Axis Bank rising 3.1 percent and ICICI Bank ending 1.3 percent higher.
Kotak Mahindra Bank rose 1.7 percent and HDFC Bank  advanced 0.4 percent.     Among non-banking lenders, Mahindra and Mahindra Financial Services Ltd surged 7.5 percent, while LIC Housing Finance ended 4.1 percent higher.
Some auto stocks also rose. Two-wheeler manufacturers Bajaj Auto gained 2 percent, Hero MotoCorp ended 1.5 percent higher, while car maker Maruti Suzuki India  gained 0.9 percent.
Tata Motors also advanced 2 percent on optimism ahead of its September-quarter earnings on Friday.
Tyre shares rose as investors expect falling crude oil and rubber price to boost companies’ margins.
Apollo Tyres gained 3.2 percent, JK Tyre and Industries rose 3.1 percent and Ceat Ltd  ended 6.6 percent higher.
Bayer CropScience ended up 10.2 percent after earlier marking its all-time high of 2,749 rupees after its September-quarter profit growth bucked the trend of weak earnings at rivals.
Among decliners, consumer goods stocks fell on worries that higher-than-expected good and services tax (GST) may restrict profit growth. Media reports on Wednesday said a government panel suggested GST rate of 27 percent.
Hindustan Unilever Ltd HLL.NS&gt; fell 0.3 percent and Marico Ltd lost 1.7 percent.

Power Grid Q2 profit declines to Rs 1 201.27 crState-run Power Grid Corporation (PGCIL) posted a marginal decline in its net profit at Rs 1,201.27 crore for the quarter ended September 30 due to higher finance costs.
The company’s net profit during the corresponding quarter last fiscal stood at Rs 1,239.2 crore.
Its total income during the July-September quarter increased five per cent to Rs 4,309.26 crore from Rs 4,104.43 in the year-ago period.
The company’s finance cost increased by 23.41 per cent to Rs 989.09 crore from Rs 801.41 crore in Q2 FY14.
“The decline in profits cannot be directly compared to the performance of last quarter as the Q2 FY14 witnessed gain of Rs 157.14 crore towards income from consultancy sale of products, which was not realised this quarter,” company’s chairman and managing director R N Nayak told reporters here.
Apart from this, the transmission income in the last quarter included Rs 209.71 crore being recognised as one time differential tariff for one of a projects in Burma.
“If the one time gains are separated from the total income, the profits as well as the income from operations would have been much better,” he said.
The Navratna company has so far spent Rs 3321.31 crore out of the Rs 5,321 crore it raised through FPO last year for funding its projects.
PGCIL currently owns and operates transmission network of about 1,11,700 ckm and 186 extra high voltage double current (EHVAC) and high voltage double current (HVAC) substations having transformation capacity of more than 2,18,000 MVA.

US  China reach surprise deal on climate changeDelhi cab rape case: Uber cab driver Shiv Kumar Yadav arrested in Mathura
The world’s top carbon emitters, the US and China, today reached a surprise deal on climate change calling for ambitious action to limit greenhouse gases, in a move that could lead to India de-linking itself from China at future global climate negotiations.
In a major breakthrough, Chinese President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Barack Obama, announced respective post-2020 goals of coping with climate change after a comprehensive round of talks here.
Under the agreement, US intends to achieve an economy-wide target of reducing its emissions by 26 – 28 per cent below its 2005 level in 2025 and to make best efforts to reduce its emissions by 28 per cent, a joint statement issued at the end of the talks here said.
For its part, China intends to achieve the peaking of CO2 emissions around 2030 and to make best efforts to peak early and intends to increase the share of non-fossil fuels in primary energy consumption to around 20 per cent by 2030, it said.
This is the first time China has agreed to peak its CO2 emissions, US officials said.
The surprise agreement between the top two biggest emitters of greenhouse gases came amid a debate in Indian official circles about the need for
India to de-hyphenate itself from its long association with China on climate issues.
According to a 2012 survey, the biggest contributors to fossil fuel emissions included China 27 per cent, US 14 per cent, the European Union 10 per cent, and India 6 per cent.
New Railway Minister and India’s “sherpa” for the G20 summit, Suresh Prabhu has called for India and China to go their own ways on climate issues as India’s near-complete alignment with China at global climate talks has been hurting New Delhi’s interests.
In a recent media interaction, Prabhu had argued that while India and China may have some similarities in terms of social indicators China is way ahead of India.
Also India’s greenhouse emissions are far lower than that of China, he said.
India at present is part of the BASIC group in the climate change negotiations. Its other members included China, South Africa and Brazil.
Commenting on Prabhu’s comments, Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar said his ministry will articulate a stand and this matter would be discussed in the next two weeks before the climate talks to be held in Lima in December.
Elaborating on today’s US-China agreement, American officials said US expects that China will succeed in peaking its emissions before 2030 based on its broad economic reform programme, plans to address air pollution, and implementation of Xi’s call for an energy revolution.
China’s target to expand total energy consumption coming from zero-emission sources to around 20 per cent by 2030 is notable, they said.
This will require China to deploy an additional 800 – 1,000 gigawatts of nuclear, wind, solar and other zero emission generation capacity by 2030, more than all the coal-fired power plants that exist in China today and close to total current electricity generation capacity in US, a fact sheet circulated by the White House said.
Their agreement came ahead of next year’s make-or-break global climate conference in Paris.
Both US and China hope that by announcing these targets now, they can inject momentum into the global climate negotiations and inspire other countries to join in coming forward with ambitious actions as soon as possible, preferably by the first quarter of 2015, the joint statement said.
The two presidents resolved to work closely together over the next year to address major impediments to reaching a successful global climate agreement in Paris, it said.
They will also jointly push international climate change negotiations for a new agreement to be reached as planned at a conference in Paris next year.
Addressing a joint press conference after their talks, Obama said the agreement is “a major milestone in the US-China relationship”.
“It shows what’s possible when we work together on an urgent global challenge,” he said.
The two sides also announced steps to increase technological cooperation on climate related issues.
The two countries have established the US-China Climate Change Working Group (CCWG), under which they have launched action initiatives on vehicles, smart grids, carbon capture, utilisation and storage, energy efficiency, greenhouse gas data management, forests and industrial boilers.
They also agreed to work together towards the global phase down of hydro fluorocarbons (HFCs), very potent greenhouse gases and created the
US-China Clean Energy Research Centre, which facilitates collaborative work in carbon capture and storage technologies, energy efficiency in buildings, and clean vehicles.
They have agreed on a joint peer review of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies under the G-20, the joint statement said.
These will include expansion of the cooperation on “smart grids” that enable efficient and cost-effective integration of renewable energy technology through private sector commercial agreement of a first-of-its-kind 380 MW concentrating to build a solar plant in China, the White House fact sheet said.

Bay low fails to rustle up strength  set to finish an ordinary runBay ‘low’ fails to rustle up strength, set to finish an ordinary run
Vinson Kurian
Tweet
Thiruvananthapuram, November 12:  
A persisting low-pressure area over the central Bay of Bengal has failed to rustle up strength and moved in to the southwest Bay closer to the Sri Lanka-Tamil Nadu coast.
A ‘chilled-out’ sea surface after a predecessor rained it out during an extended stay over the central and southwest Bay last weekend had put paid to any hopes of the incumbent gaining much strength.
The core of the system is approaching south Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka and could generate rain over the coast and progressively into adjoining interior peninsula over the next couple of days.
In this manner, rains will grow into south coastal Andhra Pradesh and Kerala apart from coastal, north and south interior Karnataka, an India Met Department update said.
Meanwhile, international weather models agree a rain-maker Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) wave may strengthen over Africa and move slowly eastwards over the Indian Ocean in the next two weeks.
The MJO wave travels periodically from west to east from the western hemisphere into Africa before entering the Indian Ocean and progressively into the Pacific.
Fresh MJO wave
The wave travels high in the atmosphere but exerts major influence over cloud formation at the ground level as it traverses over the region.
It sets up low-pressure areas, depressions and even cyclones and has also been associated with the onset of the monsoons. It has a dry phase with exactly the opposite effect at the ground level.
According to the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, there is some variation in how fast the MJO is likely to move across the Indian Ocean.
Some models say it would enter the Maritime Continent (the Indonesian archipelago et al) by the end of the fortnight.
Outlook for Bay
Not surprisingly, the US National Centres for Environmental Prediction sees possibility of some action being triggered in the Bay of Bengal between November 20 and 28.
This would be of crucial interest for Tamil Nadu, parts of which are still suffering from a rain deficit during the northeast monsoon till date.
Shrikesh Pandiyan, a weather enthusiast based in Chennai, told BusinessLine over phone that Kanchipuram, Tiruchirapalli, Thiruvannamalai and Vellore districts have posted significant rain deficits.
Chennai may have recorded excess rain of 31 per cent but the catchment areas of major reservoirs that supply water to the metropolis have not commensurately benefited.

Women driving Internet user growth in urban India: IAMAI-IMRBDelhi cab rape case: Uber cab driver Shiv Kumar Yadav arrested in Mathura
More women are now going online than men and their user-base has grown about 30 per cent this year across metros and tier I cities, an IAMAI-IMRB report said today.
According to the report, ‘Internet in India’, female Internet users have grown at about 30 per cent to an estimated 20.77 million this year from 16 million in 2013.
On the other hand, the male user-base in urban India grew at 25 per cent.
The survey was conducted across 35 cities with more than one million population in India.
“This is a happy trend and we believe if it continues, the currently skewed ratio between men and women stands a chance of being rectified in the near future,” the report said.
India was estimated to have 243 million Internet users at the end of June 2014.
The fastest growth was seen in the college going students category at 62 per cent to 7.29 million this year from 4.51 million in 2013.
The number of school girls in urban India logging online increased 34 per cent to 2.88 million from 2.15 million last year.
Similarly, non-working women category grew 18 per cent year-on-year to 5.83 million to 4.93 million, while the working women category grew eight per cent to 4.77 million from 4.41 million last year.
“The report also found that in urban areas, 60 per cent of the working women and 47 per cent of non-working women access Internet daily,” it said.

Oil India profit dips 33 pct in Q2Express IT Awards: India needs its own version, not replica, of Silicon Valley
Oil India Ltd, the nation’s second biggest state-owned explorer, today reported a 33 per cent drop in its September quarter net profit as crude oil production fell and prices slumped.
Net profit in July-September at Rs 608.33 crore, or Rs 10.12 per share, was 32.68 per cent lower than Rs 903.64 crore, or Rs 15.03 per share, net profit in the same period last fiscal, the company said in a statement here.
“Due to lower international crude oil price, the gross crude oil price realisation for Q2 is lower by 6.54 per cent to USD 101.25 per barrel, as compared to USD 108.33 in Q2 FY2013-14. The net realisation is USD 45.25 per barrel as compared to USD 52.33,” it said.
OIL, which along with other upstream oil producer ONGC makes good a portion of losses that fuel retailers incur on selling diesel and cooking fuel at government controlled rates, said its subsidy outgo in Q2 was marginally lower at Rs 3,394.16 crore as against Rs 3,486 crore a year ago.
Its crude oil production fell over 4 per cent to 0.879 million tons but natural gas output was 4.2 per cent higher at 0.694 billion cubic meters.
Sales fell 17.5 per cent to Rs 2.622.26 crore.
The company said it has received a notice of demand for Rs 1,324.79 crore from Assam Value Added Tax Authority claiming tax on the fuel subsidy paid to fuel retailers and on transportation charges on crude oil. “Company is contesting the demand and filed a writ petition before the
High Court and considered it not a liability.”
The subsidy payout dented its revenue by Rs 2,238.30 crore, OIL said.

Voice vote draws flak from Sena, Congress
Mumbai, November 12:  
Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis’ 13-day-old minority Government managed to win a vote of confidence motion on Wednesday through a voice vote, with the NCP abstaining from voting. However, the course of events drew sharp criticism from the Congress and Shiv Sena, who accused the Government of not adhering to constitutional methods.
BJP’s former ally Shiv Sena, which now sits in the Opposition, accused the Government of failing to prove its majority on the floor of the House. It said the Assembly Speaker had acted in a partisan manner and not followed constitutional methods while presiding over the confidence motion.
On Wednesday, after BJP MLA from Aurangabad Haribhau Bagde was elected as Speaker of the Assembly, a one-line motion was moved by BJPs member Ashish Shelar, seeking vote of confidence in the Government.
Ayes and Noes
The motion was declared passed by the Speaker after the ‘Ayes’ and ‘Noes’. But as soon as it was passed the Shiv Sena and Congress sought the ‘poll method’, wherein a headcount is taken of those supporting the motion and those opposing it.
The poll method is an alternative to voice votes. However, this demand was not accepted by the Speaker, who said the request ought to have come in earlier.
Eknath Shinde of the Shiv Sena, who was declared as the Leader of Opposition, criticised the “throttling of democracy” by the BJP. “It is a deception on the people of Maharashtra but Shiv Sena will not allow any wrong decision to be passed in the Assembly. The Assembly must run as per constitutional rules but here they are being destroyed. Our party had sought a poll but the trust vote was passed by voice vote,” he said.
Before the vote of confidence was called for the Speaker was unanimously elected by the Assembly. The Sena and the Congress withdrew their candidates.

Union tells JLR workforce to reject pay deal
Vidya Ram
Range Rover Evoque cars are on display at a car dealer in Berlin, August 23, Changing fortunes Successful new launches such as the Range Rover Evoque have driven up sales REUTERS
Tata-run car major had offered 3.6 per cent pay hike in the first year plus bonus
London, November 12:  
The Unite union is recommending that its members reject a pay deal offered by Jaguar Land Rover ahead of a ballot due to take place on Thursday.
“There will be a recommendation to reject the pay deal,” Alex Flynn, a spokesperson for the union Unite, told BusinessLine.
The ballot of union members across JLR’s plants in the UK is set to take place on Thursday, with results due at the end of the day or on Friday, and will determine whether or not they accept a recent pay deal put forward by JLR following pay and condition negotiations.
“Senior shop stewards have met and don’t think the deal meets expectations of members,” Flynn said.
The ballot follows a final pay offer made by Jaguar Land Rover last month, which includes a pay rise of 3.6 per cent in the first year and a bonus and 3 per cent in the two following years.
Negotiated settlement
JLR has expressed its disappointment over the failure to reach an agreement and says it remains committed to reaching a negotiated settlement.
Last month, at the opening of JLR’s new engine plant near Wolverhampton, Executive Director Mike Wright said it was “unfortunate” that trade unions had rejected what JLR deemed a “very generous pay offer.”
“We are confident we will get a negotiated settlement,” he said at the time.
In addition to the proposed pay rise, shop stewards are concerned about proposed changes to the pension scheme, the spokesperson for Unite said.
“The company is looking at making 240 million pounds of savings from the pension scheme….people will understand why our members are unhappy — there are people who have been paying into it for the past 20 years.”
He added that another point of contention was a proposal that it would take six years for new starters at the company to reach a full rate of salary. “It’s simply too long.”
“Broadly speaking, our members have made great sacrifices when the company was in great difficulty, including taking an 18-month pay freeze…this is a company that is highly profitable and our members feel they should be getting a bigger share of its success.”
Should members vote against accepting the pay offer — in the ballot determined by a simple majority — the union would be urging Jaguar Land Rover to get round the negotiating table to reach a deal that did meet expectations, the spokesperson said. In 2009 JLR and its workers struck a deal whereby a temporary freeze in pay and a four-day working week was introduced in return for no compulsory job cuts as the company contended, along with the rest of the auto industry, with a sharp drop in demand.
Change in fortunes
Since then, JLR has seen a dramatic change in fortunes with sales globally driven by a raft of successful new launches such as the Range Rover Evoque and demand from new growth markets such as China.
In the quarter ending in June this year JLR made a pre-tax profit of £924 million.
Last month, it opened its first engine manufacturing centre in nearly 20 years near the English city of Wolverhampton, which will employ 1,400 by the time it reaches full capacity.
It also recently opened a factory in China in partnership with Chinese automaker Chery and is set to open one in Brazil in 2016.
Since 2009 it has nearly doubled its workforce from around 16,000 to over 30,000.

Stunning Aishwarya silences critics4 Things New Moms Can Learn from Aishwarya Rai
Bollywoodshaadis.com –  Wed 12 Nov, 2014 5:37 PM IST
Share 0
Have you seen recent photos of Aishwarya Rai Bachchan? Stunning is an understatement. This Bachchan bahu endured all the media storm about her weight post Aradhya; she took her own time to savour motherhood and embrace her weight, and has now emerged even more stunning than ever. We have a lot to learn from here, especially all you expecting and new mothers. Here is a story we pulled up from our archives for you.

Aishwarya Rai Bachchan inaugurates the new store of Kalyan Jewellers in Ghatkopar, Mumbai.

*************************************************************************************
The world’s most beautiful woman, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan had one of the most hyped pregnancies in India ever. All eyes were on her as the world waited for the birth of Beti B. But one thing must be said about Aishwarya, she sure knew how to handle all the hype and hoopla and take everything in her stride. Let us look at the 4 things which every new mother should learn from this gorgeous mom.

Top 5 Most Talked About Bollywood Star Kids
Baby comes first- Always
Aishwarya’s pregnancy weight gain sure raised a few eyebrows. The media wrote many unflattering things about her, but she did not allow it to affect her. She hit back strongly stating that her angel, Aradhya was her priority. In an interview with Anupama Chopra, she went on to state that, “Weight gain can happen at any point in time and it is something that you are dealing with anyway and it is ok. It is not the outside that defines who you are.” So do not let any nasty comments affect you. Take care of your baby first and ensure that your bundle of joy is healthy and happy.
Fat is beautiful
Post pregnancy, a lot of women lounge around in their tracksuits and jammies, their hair in disarray and their skin splotchy. But have you seen Ash and her post pregnancy pictures? She looks stunning, impeccably dressed in clothes that suit her present figure and not a hair out of place.
Just because your child takes up most of your time is no excuse to dress shabbily. Aishwarya glows beatifically whenever she makes a public appearance. So, ladies, take out your make up kit and your pretty shoes. A bit of kohl, a dash of lip gloss and some rouge can really enliven your face and make you look gorgeous.
Career should not take a back seat
Aradhya has just turned one and Aishwarya is now looking at a few scripts so that she does not give up on her career completely. It is true that your baby should be your priority, but as he or she starts growing up, you can start focusing on your career also. If you cannot work full time then, you must freelance or take up a part time gig. Develop a hobby and have a little ‘me’ time as well. Everything will fall in place if you understand yourself and your baby’s needs well.
Lose flab at a right time
Compare Aishwarya’s immediate post pregnancy pictures with her latest calendar shoot pictures, and you will be surprised. She has definitely lost a few kilos! When asked about her fitness mantra, she maintained that she is not looking for a drastic weight loss. She is taking her own time and is working out in the gym as well as going for power yoga.
Slowly and steadily we are getting to see the old Aishwarya, whose smiles could bring a million heartbeats to a halt.
So once you are ready, hit the gym and take your exercise routine seriously. Don’t expect to shed ten kilos in a couple of months. Set realistic targets and you will be at peace with yourself.

India signs tax info exchange pact with Saint Kitts & NevisIndia signs tax info exchange pact with Saint Kitts & Nevis
PTI

United Nations, Nov 13:  
To help in its efforts to crack down on suspected black money stashed abroad, India has entered into an information exchange pact with Saint Kitts and Nevis, a two-island Caribbean country, perceived as a safe haven for offshore funds.
The agreement was signed by India’s Permanent Representative to the UN Asoke Kumar Mukerji, and his counterpart from Saint Kitts and Nevis Ambassador Delano Frank Bart at the Indian mission here.
The agreement is modelled on other tax information exchange agreements and would cover taxes imposed by both the countries, the Indian mission said in a statement.
It would include information relevant to administration of domestic tax laws of each country in terms of assessment, tax claims and prosecution. The agreement would also encompass information on banking details, ownership information of companies and information relevant to administration of domestic laws and taxes in both the countries.
While Switzerland has been the focus of India’s fight against suspected black money stashed abroad, various agencies and investigations have pointed out large-scale instances of illicit funds having been channelized abroad through various offshore locations widely known as tax havens.
A number of island nations in Caribbean and other parts of the world figure among such locations. However, many such locations, including Saint Kitts and Nevis, have agreed in recent years to improve business practices within their jurisdictions and come clean of such charges.
India has also signed information exchange pacts on tax matters with a number of such locations including Bahamas, Bermuda, Liechtenstein, Gibraltar, British Virgin Islands, Isle of Man, Cayman Islands, Jersey, Macau, Liberia, Argentina, Guernsey and Monaco, among others.
A Special Investigation Team is currently looking into the black money issue, including the cases related to untaxed money stashed abroad by Indians.
In one of its reports recently submitted to the government, the SIT, however, observed that absence of criminal legal treaties between India and tax haven nations is one of the major impediments in initiating steps to bring back illegal funds stashed abroad by Indians.
India has 37 Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties or Multilateral Assistance Treaties with about 37 countries which does not include “many of the tax havens like Cayman Islands, Guernsey, Lichtenstein, Monaco, Bermuda, Malta, British Virgin Islands and others” where a number of suspect black money probes are being conducted by Indian investigative agencies.
SIT has been informed by various agencies that the existing treaties like Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) and Tax Information Exchange Treaty (TIEA) were not helpful.
These treaties provide only for collection of documents and do not help in attachment or restraint of funds or assets of a suspect black money holder from India.

Microsoft patches two-decade crack in Windows softwareMicrosoft patches two-decade crack in Windows software
PTI
Tweet
San Francisco, Nov 13:  
Microsoft issued an emergency patch today for a dangerous flaw that has existing in Windows operating software for nearly two decades.
The vulnerability, disclosed by IBM security researchers, has been in every Windows operating system since 1995 and could allow a hacker to take control of computers after luring Internet Explorer browser users to booby-trapped Internet pages.
A hacker who successfully exploited the weakness could have the same control of a machine as the user, but taking advantage of the flaw was deemed “tricky” and there was no evidence hackers had managed to pull off such a move.
“We released Security Bulletin MS 14—064 to help protect customers against this issue and customers with automatic updates enabled do not need to take an action as they are automatically protected,” Microsoft said in an email response to an AFP inquiry.
Robert Freeman of IBM X—Force said in a blog post: “This complex vulnerability is a rare, ‘unicorn—like’ bug found in code that IE relies on but doesn’t necessarily belong to.
“The bug can be used by an attacker for drive—by attacks to reliably run code remotely and take over the user’s machine.”
The software fix, labelled “critical” by Microsoft, was one of 32 patches released by the US technology titan as part of its routine update cycle.
Windows powers about 90 per cent of computers worldwide.

Delhi Metro  Mundra UMPP among 6 Indian projects in KPMG markets reportDelhi Metro, Mundra UMPP among 6 Indian projects in KPMG markets report
PTI

New Delhi, Nov 13:  
The Delhi Metro, the Yamuna Expressway, and Tata Power’s Mundra ultra mega power project in Gujarat are among the six ventures that have figured in the list of the world’s most innovative, impactful infrastructure projects prepared by international accounting firm KPMG.
The other three projects in the KPMG’s Infrastructure 100: World Markets report are the Gujarat International Finance Tec-City (GIFT), the Interceptor Sewage System and the Narmada Canal Solar project.
These projects were evaluated on the basis of their scale, feasibility, complexity, innovation and impact on society, KPMG said.
“Each country has its own approach to developing and funding infrastructure, yet all share the universal challenge of creating the right conditions to attract investment so desperately needed,” James Stewart, KPMG’s Chairman of Global Infrastructure said.
Opened in 2012, the 165-km, six-lane Yamuna Expressway is India’s longest motorway, connecting the capital New Delhi with Agra and creating a corridor for economic growth, the report said.
By dramatically reducing the travel time between these two historic cities, the $1.9-billion project will have a lasting impact on villagers, tourists, traders and working professionals and should expand trade.
The expressway also has symbolic value by showcasing the country’s ability to develop world-class infrastructure.
Ten years after its first line opened, the $2.3-billion Delhi Metro continues to expand, setting a shining example of how to carry out an effective public works programme.
Taking heed of the problems experienced by the Kolkata Metro — which was badly delayed and 12 times over budget — the development team utilised innovative procurement and strong project and contract management techniques, it said.
The $4.4-billion Mundra Ultra Mega Power Project is a major, coal-fired thermal power plant serving the states of Gujarat, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Haryana and Punjab.
A 25-year concession has led what is a landmark PPP for the Indian energy sector, the report said.
The Narmada canal solar project, another innovative initiative in Gujarat, conserves water and generates energy.
The $17.9-million Narmada Canal Solar project will place a solar photovoltaic grid over the top of a 5.5 km section of the canal, preventing water from evaporating and producing renewable power, the KPMG report said.
In a form of PPP, Megha Engineering and Infrastructure Ltd will build the plant and maintain it for 25 years, it said.
Traditional financial services and IT centres may soon be looking over their shoulders at the Gujarat International Finance Tec City (GIFT) in India.
The $20-billion mega-project combines connectivity, infrastructure and transportation with sustainable and environmentally sensitive growth.
India’s $323-million Interceptor Sewage System is designed to divert sewage to treatment plants, enabling the river’s water to be used for horticulture and cleaning purposes, the report said.
Stewart, in the report, also said private capital continues to play a critical role, but investors need economic and political stability before committing.
Consistency and sustainability are key in setting policy, the right regulatory environment and establishing a steady deal flow through project pipelines.
“India’s infrastructure has been a roller coaster ride. While in the past few years we have seen a decline in interest around the infrastructure sector, the new Government is taking a number of measures to revive investment.
“We believe this could lead to a re-rating of Indian infrastructure,” Arvind Mahajan, Head, Government and Infrastructure, KPMG in India, said.
The report looks at infrastructure based on the dynamics of four key markets: mature international markets like Canada, Australia, the UK, economic powerhouses including the US and BRIC countries, smaller established markets such as Chile, Sweden, New Zealand, Korea and emerging markets.
The panel of independent industry experts evaluated over 400 diverse and compelling projects to ultimately select the final 100.

Scientists develop single dose nano-medicine for osteoporosisScientists develop single dose nano-medicine for osteoporosis
PTI
Tweet
New Delhi, Nov 13:  
A nanoparticle that can stimulate growth of bone forming cells and deliver the drug used for osteoporosis straight to the affected area has been developed.
A team of engineers and pharmacologists from Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore and Al—Ameen college of Pharmacy, Bangalore, has come up with the modified Zoledronic acid (ZOL) drug, which has proved to be effective in treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis.
What makes this novel mode of treatment even more special is the use of extremely small particles, called nanoparticles, for drug delivery, says a release by Gubbi Labs.
About nine million bone fractures occur each year due to osteoporosis, a progressive bone disease in which bone loses both its mass and density, thereby becoming weaker.
Current treatment regimes involve restricting further bone damage, but not restoring previous strength.
ZOL is a commonly used drug, successfully reducing risk of fracture in post—menopausal women. However, its prolonged use can cause several adverse effects like unwanted bone changes.The modified ZOL drug used in the study has a high affinity to bone and prevents further bone loss.
“We have designed a new formulation, where the ZOL is first adsorbed on nanoparticles of hydroxyapatite and carried to osteoporotic bone by intravenous injection”, said lead author Deepak Kumar Khajuria.
“We are able to demonstrate successfully that this formulation not only prevents further bone loss, but also stimulates bone growth”, he added.
The team used 12-week-old female rats, whose ovaries were removed so that bone remodelling would not occur. Various doses of Hydroxylapatite (HA, which can be found in teeth and bones within the human body), ZOL and a combination of both were tested on the rats.
Three months after the treatment, the lumbar vertebra and femur (thigh bone) were tested for mechanical properties.
Both showed better strength and structure after the combined treatment. A host of sensitive biochemical tests to predict whether new bone growth occurred were also carried out, all of which showed improvement with the combined treatment.
The binding of ZOL to synthetic HA maybe an effective way of delivering the two important minerals for bone structure — calcium and phosphate. While ZOL on one hand has been seen to kill the bone dissolving osteoclast cells, HA on the other has been shown to promote the bone forming osteoblast cells. The combination of both as shown in this study has taken best of the two properties and improved bone properties.
“The key aspect that was intriguing us during the early days of this study was that the carrier was also showing amplified benefit toward overall therapeutics when delivered along with the basic medicine like bisphosphonate,” said Prof Rema Razdan.
“It took us several years to design a systematic scheme of investigation and method of correlation through various biochemical tests and mechanical testing of bone samples to establish the underlying complex process of nano— functionalised therapeutics and the efficacy of a single— dose,” said Prof Roy Mahapatra, who supervised the nanoparticle synthesis, characterisation and biomechanical testing.
This study shows a way forward for treatment or reversal of osteoporosis in humans, but further clinical trials are needed before reaching the medical shelf.

Doctor blames tainted drugs for deaths after sterilisation surgeryDoctor blames tainted drugs for deaths after sterilisation surgery
Reuters
PTI Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh meets a woman who underwent sterilisation surgery receive treatment at a hospital in Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh.
PANDARI (Chhattisgarh), Nov 13:  
The doctor whose sterilisation of 83 women in less than three hours ended in at least a dozen deaths said on Thursday the express operations were his moral responsibility and blamed adulterated medicines for the tragedy.
R. K Gupta, who says he has conducted more than 50,000 such operations, denied that his equipment was rusty or dirty and said it was the government's duty to control the number of people that turned up at his family-planning "camp".
"It is up to the administration to decide how many women would be kept for operation," a visibly upset Gupta told Reuters from the police station where he is being held in custody. He faces charges of causing death by negligence.
"If they kept in that place 83 women, it is my moral responsibility to operate (on) all the women. If I decline to do that I would have faced public agitation," said Gupta, who was awarded a state honour 10 years ago for his sterilisation work.
India is the world's top steriliser of women, and efforts to rein in population growth have been described as the most draconian after China. Indian birth rates fell in recent decades, but population growth is among the world's fastest.
With more than 4 million Indians sterilised every year, a system of quotas encourages officials and doctors to cut corners, activists say.
Gupta said health workers gave the women ciprofloxacin, a commonly prescribed antibiotic, and ibuprofen, a pain killer, after the operations, which were conducted in a grimy room of an unused private hospital in a village called Pandari in the state of Chhattisgarh.
At least 13 women have died so far, with scores more still hospitalized and some critically ill. Some of the sick women were operated on by a different doctor at a second camp on Monday. Gupta said this was evidence he was not to blame.
"I am not the culprit. I have been made scapegoat. It is the administration which is responsible for this incident," he said, speaking in a dimly lit police hostel room after being taken into custody from a friend's house on Wednesday night.
The government of Chhattisgarh, one of India's poorest states, banned five batches of drugs and a batch of surgical cotton wool on Wednesday pending further investigations. The banned medicines include Indian-made brands of ciprofloxacin and ibuprofen and were used in Gupta's sterilisation camp, a government statement said.
Rights groups say India's sterilisation programme is coercive because ill-educated women are often offered money to accept surgery without knowing the full risks. State government officials who run the programme are pressed to meet quotas.
Protocols state that doctors should spend at least 15 minutes on each operation and perform a maximum of 30 in a day. Several doctors told Reuters it was common to perform up to 90 sterilisations a day, leaving little time to maintain hygiene.
Gupta said it was the responsibility of the government to clean the clinic, which police say was filthy, and to provide him with more instruments. Asked why he didn't complain, Gupta said the conditions were normal and he kept his equipment clean.
Gupta said he generally took between two and five minutes on each operation, and that this gave two assistants time to clean scalpels.
He said allegations by a senior government official that the tools were rusty were untrue and that he wore gloves and a gown.
"They are dipped in spirit after an operation and then reused. If I feel it is not working well I change it. I do about 10 operations with the same knife. Towel clips are also reused after being dipped in spirit," he said.
Police say the room used as an operating theatre was hung with cobwebs, and that the fast turnover of operations meant there was no time to change bloodied sheets. Activists say the rushed nature of the programme meant disaster was almost inevitable at some point.
"It's a mystery," Gupta said of the deaths. "I never came across any such complications in the past."

Mathew Martoma loses bail pleaMathew Martoma loses bail plea

Martoma, 40, was sentenced in federal court last month by US District Judge Paul Gardephe for his role as the “central figure” in the most lucrative insider trading scheme ever charged involving USD 275 million in illegal profits and avoided losses.
New York, Nov 13:  
Mathew Martoma, the Indian-origin portfolio manager, sentenced to nine years in jail on insider trading charges for the most lucrative insider trading scheme in US history, has lost his bid to remain free on bail.
Martoma, 40, was sentenced in federal court last month by US District Judge Paul Gardephe for his role as the “central figure” in the most lucrative insider trading scheme ever charged involving USD 275 million in illegal profits and avoided losses.
Martoma was also ordered to forfeit a USD 9.3 million bonus he earned through the insider trading as well as his interests in his Florida home and several bank accounts.
He was ordered to surrender in prison on November 10 and had moved court for bail pending appeal, saying his appeal will raise “several other close questions including that evidence was improperly excluded and his sentence was both procedurally and substantively unreasonable“.
The Second US Circuit Court of Appeals yesterday rejected Martoma’s bid for bail pending appeal, saying he has “failed to show that the appeal raises a substantial question of law or fact”.
Martoma had won a delay of his surrender to prison while his motion was in appeals court, which also vacated the stay of his surrender date and he would now have to report to prison on a new date.
Federal prosecutors said that given the verdict of the appeals court, there is no basis to further delay the imposition of Martoma’s prison sentence.
“The government has confirmed with the Bureau of Prisons that it is prepared to accept Martoma at his previously designated institution as soon as Martoma is ordered to surrender by the court,” prosecutors said.
Martoma’s lawyers have however sought permission that he be granted leave to report to prison by November 18 so that he can settle his affairs before his prison term begins and can “spend a few additional days” with his wife and three young children” in order to help prepare the children for the impending separation from their father.
Martoma’s jail sentence, among the longest handed down for insider trading, was in line with what Manhattan’s top federal prosecutor Preet Bharara had sought before the hearing.
The India—born federal attorney had described Martoma’s role in the insider trading scheme as “central” and sought a prison term of over eight years along with forfeiture of his bonus saying the sentence should be “commensurate with the seriousness of the offense conduct and the unprecedented ill—gotten gains that it generated”.

Gold futures rise on spot demand  short-coveringGold futures rise on spot demand, short-covering
PTI
Tweet
New Delhi, Nov 13:  
Gold futures recovered by 0.27 per cent to Rs 25,857 per 10 grams today as speculators covered-up their short positions at prevailing levels amid pick-up in demand in the spot market.
At the Multi Commodity Exchange, gold for delivery in December rose Rs 69 or 0.27 per cent to Rs 25,857 per 10 grams with a business turnover of 609 lots.
In a similar fashion, the metal for delivery in February next year moved up by Rs 42 or 0.16 per cent to Rs 26,012 per 10 grams with a trade volume of 7 lots.
Market analysts said the rise in gold futures was mainly due to covering-up of short positions by speculators at prevailing levels and a firm trend at the spot market on the back of pick-up in demand but a weak trend overseas, capped the gains.
Meanwhile, gold fell as much as 0.4 per cent to $1,157.54 an ounce in Singapore today.

India  US resolve impasse over food security issues at WTO: Commerce MinisterIndia, US resolve food row, signalling end to WTO impasse
Amiti Sen
WTO General Council to discuss New Delhi’s proposal in December
New Delhi, Nov 13:  
India and the US reached a compromise on issues relating to food security and trade facilitation at the World Trade Organisation (WTO), which could soon lead to a resolution of the current impasse in global trade talks.
However, neither country shared the finer details of the agreements. US Trade Representative Michael Froman said the bilateral agreements were a result of discussions between President Barack Obama and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Commerce and Industry Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, who said an agreement has been reached with the US, ducked questions on whether Washington had agreed to concessions over and above an indefinite continuation of the ‘peace clause’, which it had already agreed to last month.
“These are details that we will share with the General Council of the WTO when it meets next month. We don’t want to disclose them here,” she told reporters here on Thursday.
Subsidy caps
A peace clause is an undertaking that action won’t be taken against a member for breaching agriculture subsidy caps (fixed at 10 per cent of production) till the formula for calculating such subsidies is re-worked. The concessions, which India had been pitching for, include dropping the condition that the tool can be used only when subsidies are non-trade distortive and on submission of data.
Sitharaman made it clear that India was pleased with the compromise.
“We are extremely happy that India and the US have successfully resolved their differences relating to the issue of public stockholding for food security purposes in the WTO in a manner that addresses our concerns. This will end the impasse at the WTO and also open the way for implementation of the Trade Facilitation Agreement,” she said.
India had refused to support a protocol on trade facilitation — a pact to ease movement of goods between borders by upgrading infrastructure and improving processes — on July 31, as agreed to in Bali last December, as it wanted a better deal on food security.
For a permanent solution
New Delhi had demanded that, as a permanent solution, the subsidies should either be dropped from the list of trade-distorting subsidies, calculated on a more recent base year (as opposed to existing base year of 1986-88), or indexed to inflation.
The agreement between the US and India also sets out elements for an intensified programme of work and negotiations to arrive at such a permanent solution, the US Trade Representative’s office said in a statement.
Congress’ charge
Congress leader and former Commerce Minister Anand Sharma said: “We have not been holding any bilateral negotiations on this issue. Then, how can the Government hold a bilateral meeting and claim that issues have been resolved? It has to be discussed in a ministerial conference.” At the WTO’s Bali ministerial, Sharma had negotiated that a permanent solution should be found latest by the eleventh ministerial scheduled in 2017. “We had ensured that India’s interests will be protected. I do not think there is any change in the position,” Sharma told BusinessLine.

Sensex trading flat; oil & gas stocks plungeSensex sheds 68 points on profit-booking
Our Bureau/Agencies
Tweet
Mumbai, Nov 13:  
The Sensex and the Nifty ended the session marginally in the red due to profit-booking by funds and retail investors amid firm European cues.
The 30-share BSE index Sensex fell 68.26 points or 0.24 per cent to end at 27,940.64 and the 50-share NSE index Nifty ended at 8,357.85, down 25.45 points or 0.3 per cent.
Among BSE sectoral indices, oil & gas index succumbed to heavy profit-booking and was down 1.63 per cent, followed by realty 1.44 per cent, PSU 1.32 per cent and India infrastructure index 0.78 per cent.
On the other hand, IT and TECk indices were the star-performers and were up 0.99 per cent and 0.74 per cent, respectively, followed by healthcare 0.56 per cent and consumer durables 0.36 per cent.
Infosys, Dr Reddy's, Cipla, Wipro and Bharti Airtel were the top five Sensex gainers, while the major losers were SSLT, Tata Power, ONGC, GAIL and Axis Bank.
India Forex Advisors in a report said: "The consumer inflation fell to a record low for the month of October at 5.52 per cent against 6.46 per cent in September. The expectation was around 5.8 per cent for the month. The numbers were dragged down by a slow pace of increase in crude and food inflation.
Food inflation came in at 5.59 per cent in October vs 7.67 per cent in the previous month. Whereas petrol prices have been cut six times since August this year, diesel prices have been lowered twice since they were deregulated by the government. The RBI is hesitant to cut interest rates until it is confident the inflation is reduced to meet its target of 6 per cent by January 2016.''
European shares rose 0.4 per cent in the opening trade in a small rebound from falls on Wednesday, and Asian and emerging markets shares had also inched higher.
Stoxx 50 climbed 22.83 points or 0.75 at 3,070.13 and FTSE 100 was up 18.58 points or 0.28 per cent at 6,629.62.

Chinese incursion into Arunachal Pradesh not serious issue: ParrikarHat-trick and 400th Barcelona FC goal for Lionel Messi
Union Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar today said reported incursions by China into Arunachal Pradesh were “not serious” and being effectively tackled by Army on day-to-day basis even as he underlined the need to set up infrastructural back up to handle “these kind of problems”.
“Chinese intrusion is not a serious issue. It is a serious issue for media. The incidents of incursions by China are a small issue that is being tackled by Army chief or the concerned commander in that area,” Parrikar told reporters at a press conference here on his first visit to his home state after taking charge as Defence minister.
Parrikar said there are large tracts of land along the imaginary border and many a times the forces cross it.
“The issue should be considered as serious when they (China) set up their camps in our territory,” he said.
Parrikar said the incursions like the one reported in Arunachal Pradesh “happen many a times in many sectors and are tackled within a day or couple of days.”
“It is not correct to call them as major intrusions. They are breach of LAC,” he added.
Launching a scathing attack on Congress, Parrikar said most of the defence deals executed during the erstwhile Congress-led regime got “stuck up” due to lobbying, vested interest and kickbacks involved.
Underlining the need to remove procedural bottlenecks, Parrikar said if not done it would affect the procurement process.
“The issue of procurement for armed forces has been taken on priority. This is very crucial to built the capability of the armed forces,” the defence minister said.
Interestingly, Union Minister of State for Home Affairs Kiren Rijiju had last month denied any incursion by China’s People’s Liberation Army in Taksing area of Arunachal Pradesh in recent times.
“It is a natural phenomenon as troops from both the sides usually trespass into each other’s territory by mistake as there is no definite demarcation of the border,” he had said.

Digvijay attacks Modi on cow slaughter issueHat-trick and 400th Barcelona FC goal for Lionel Messi
Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh today attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the issue of cow slaughter, latching on to his meeting with a business tycoon involved in beef production.
Singh’s attack has come at a time when the Prime Minister is on foreign soil as part of his three nation tour of Myanmar, Australia and Fiji.
The Prime Minister, who arrived in Myanmar today will attend the India-ASEAN and East Asia summits during the visit.
“PM had breakfast with CEO of Cargill Group: Cargill Beef Co-largest Beef producer kills eight million cows & produces 80 billion pounds of beef!” Singh said on micro-blogging website Twitter.
In other tweets, he wrote, “Meat exports registered highest growth during earlier NDA regime. Would Modi consider ban on cow slaughter as he has been promising?
“Or he is too busy unloading the Sangh baggage and its legacy to occupy central space of Congress and appropriate Congress’legacy !.”
Modi had in the run up to the Lok Sabha polls attacked the UPA government on meat export issue while BJP and its affiliates have been raising the issue of cow slaughter for a long time.
Attacking the ruling party over the issue, Singh said in other tweets, “BJP Govt in MP has disbanded Gau Sewa Ayog set up by us. BJP only uses religion to incite violence and has nothing to do with religion.”
He also alleged, “VHP activists extort money from Cattle Traders and sell Cattle to other Traders” and asked “Can VHP give me the names of Gau Shalas they are running?”
Singh, a former MP chief minister also alleged that in Guna in Madhya Pradesh, the district Gau Shala run by RSS has prime land but it doesn’t have cows.
“But the premises are being used to run Saraswati Shishu Mandir!” he alleged.
The Congress leader also took a dig at the newly appointed chief of Prasar Bharti Dr. A Surya Prakash.
“Surya Prakash newly-appointed Chief of Prasar Bharti-“No Constitutional bar to be a Right Winger” I agree. But would it be impartial like BBC.
“Or DD would be broadcasting only Mohan Bhagwat and Modi ‘Puran’? Do we see a Goebbels in making?” he tweeted.

Fadnavis dares Oppn to bring no confidence motionHat-trick and 400th Barcelona FC goal for Lionel Messi
Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, whose 13-day-old BJP government survived a controversial trust vote in the Legislative Assembly in voice vote, has dismissed allegation of “foul play” by opposition Shiv Sena and Congress, saying all rules and procedures were adhered to in the passage of the motion.
Fadnavis also dared the opposition to move a no confidence motion against his government, saying he has majority.
“Congress and Shiv Sena did not ask for a poll (division of votes) at the appropriate time. Since Congress has always been in power it has forgotten the rules about when to ask for division of votes,” Fadnavis told reporters here tonight.
The passage of the trust vote, crucial for the survival of the minority BJP government, was mired in controversy with the Congress and BJP’s erstwhile ally Shiv Sena accusing the ruling government of failing to prove its majority and “strangulating democracy”.
Earlier in the day, a one-line motion moved by BJP MLA Ashish Shelar seeking confidence of the House in the BJP government was declared passed by voice vote even as Shiv Sena and Congress insisted on division.
“If the demand (for division) was brought at the right time, we would have accepted the demand. We went through the legal way while opposition parties did not follow rules,” the CM said.
Daring the opposition to move a no confidence motion against his government and to move court if they feel so, Fadnavis said, “We will win (the no confidence motion if it is brought) as we have majority. We have well wishers but their number cannot be told.”
Strongly disapproving the passage of the motion by voice vote, Shiv Sena and Congress have decided to petition Governor C Vidyasagar Rao to direct the government to seek a fresh vote.
MLAs of Sharad Pawar’s NCP, which had declared outside support to the government, remained seated quietly during the procedure amid din.
To a query if he disallowed division during the trust vote to protect the identity of his well-wishers, Fadnavis said, “My government has not rejected the NCP support but not accepted it either.”
When asked if he would act against NCP leaders allegedly involved in corruption cases, Fadnavis said, “My decisions would be in the welfare of people and won’t be to help individuals.”
He said appointment of the Leader of Opposition was not listed on the agenda in the copy received by his office. “We have asked the Legislature Secretariat to inquire how the item was included in the last minute,” the chief minister said.
Shiv Sena’s Eknath Shinde was today accorded the status of Leader of Opposition by Assembly Speaker Haribhau Bagde.

Human remains found at MH17 crash siteHat-trick and 400th Barcelona FC goal for Lionel Messi
Dutch forensic experts recovered further human remains at the crash site of downed flight MH17 in eastern Ukraine, but said they could not yet start salvaging the wreckage.
“A small team has recovered body parts at the site after pieces of the wreckage were lifted with a crane,” the Dutch defence ministry said in a statement.
Dutch experts, who are charged with body part recovery and also leading the probe into the fatal July 17 crash that killed all 298 on board, arrived at the site on Tuesday.
They are hoping to recover the debris from the doomed Malaysia Airlines flight, amid fears that full-scale fighting could break out again.
The human remains will now be sent to Kharkiv for a first forensic check and be repatriated to the Netherlands at a later stage, the ministry said.
The Dutch team’s chief official, Pieter-Jaap Aalbersberg, said his small group had “done everything they could” to retrieve body parts and personal belongings.
“To continue, we would now need heavy equipment and far more forensic experts. At this moment it’s not possible,” Aalbersberg said in the statement.
He added the security situation around the crash site “remained fragile”.
Kiev and the West have claimed that the Boeing 777 was shot down in the conflict-torn area by separatist fighters using a BUK surface-to-air missile supplied by Russia. Moscow denies the charges, pointing the finger back at Kiev.
So far 289 victims had been identified through body parts recovered from the site, but no wreckage has been retrieved due to safety issues.
Dutch Foreign Minister Bert Koenders warned over the weekend that the last remains of MH17’s victims may never be recovered as five more coffins were flown back to the Netherlands.
The Defence Ministry said work had not started yet to recover parts of the wreckage for the air crash investigation.
Representatives from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which has been negotiating with separatists on behalf of the Dutch government, “were still in talks”.

Analyst corner: Reduce Cummins on subdued margin growth expectationsKotak Mahindra Bank: Deal and after
We maintain ‘reduce’ rating on Cummins India with a revised target price of R720 per share (earlier R640) as we roll-forward to September 2016e earnings of 19x. We build in higher export-growth estimates and related moderation in margin improvement. We revise our estimates to R26.7 (vs 27.5), R32.6 (vs 31.8) and R43.7 (vs Rs 39.9) for FY15-17, respectively. We build in the benefit of stronger export growth (for mid-range HP units). Related tax benefit (30-35% of overall from SEZ facility) is partly negated by lower margins and higher working capital for exports (as seen in Q2FY15).
Sequentially, export growth of 24% to R480 crore was driven by a one-time R50 crore order from China. Adjusted, the sequential growth was about 12%, driven by low HP and mid-range sales. Growth potential for the segment is strong in all three segments – low-HP export run-rate is expected to grow 3-4x over the next three years, high-HP exports are growing (bottomed out a year ago) and potential scale-up of mid-range HP exports will possibly start from early CY15. We believe this can drive 40-45% revenue CAGR for exports over FY14-17e.
Cummins said it expects the recovery to be more linked with an increase in capital formation, which it expects will take place in early FY16. The government’s focus on making India a manufacturing hub is expected to support Cummins’ long-term growth potential. For FY15 it has maintained its 0-5% growth guidance.

India  only major economy  to see improved growth: Key factsFIPB role shrinks amid easier FDI flows
India is the “only major economy” that is projected to see a pick up in growth momentum whereas mixed trends are predicted for the developed world, Paris-based think tank Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said on Wednesday.
The readings, for the month of September, are based on Composite Leading Indicators (CLI) that are designed to anticipate turning points in economic activity relative to trend.
In September, CLI for India touched 99.1, the highest since May this year when it stood at 98.6. In August, the same was at 99.
The OECD in its last forecast had also scaled down India’s GDP estimate for the current fiscal to 5.4 % but raised it to 6.4 % next fiscal.
Most of the major economies — developed and developing — including the United States, Brazil, China and Russia, are expected to witness stable growth momentum.
The CLI points to growth losing traction in Japan, much of the Euro zone as well as United Kingdom.
Last month, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank projected 5.6 % growth rate for India this year, citing renewed confidence in the market due to a series of economic reforms pursued by the new government.
India’s economic growth was below 5% in the last two financial years. Recently, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) forecast economy to grow at 5.5 % in 2014-15 and at 6.3 % in 2015-16

Diaspora eyes Narendra Modi boost to India-Australia tiesFIPB role shrinks amid easier FDI flows
Since migrating to Sydney from Mumbai in 2000, Praful Desai has maintained economic as well as family ties with his homeland by investing in real estate in Gujarat, the business-friendly state that grew in prominence under then chief minister Narendra Modi.
With Modi now prime minister, Desai says he has the confidence to invest elsewhere in India.
He is betting on Modi’s upcoming visit to Australia to strengthen ties with the near 300,000-strong Indian diaspora in the country, with a friendly tax regime for non-residents and options for dual citizenship on the wish list.
“Expat Indians want to connect more with India,” said Desai, who works in advertising and is the vice president of the Council of Indian Australians Inc.
“Modi will probably give us an assurance that the India growth story is intact. That’s the kind of thing people want to hear that will drive a lot of money back home.”
Modi came to office in May with a mandate to create jobs and kickstart the Indian economy after a long period of sluggish growth. His signature ‘Make in India’ and ‘Clean India’ initiatives include targeting expats for investment.
Modi’s popularity with non-resident Indians was underscored on a recent visit to the United States, where he received a rockstar reception and sold out Madison Square Garden.
He is expected to draw 16,000 people to his rally in Sydney on Monday, while 270 people have booked on the “Modi Express” train for fans, which will run from Melbourne to Sydney.
Modi is also expected to meet 200 prominent Indian businessmen and entrepreneurs and students in Sydney.
Modi “wants every Indian living in Australia to feel that their leader has come to meet them, he wants to know them and even seek their support for projects back home,” an Indian foreign ministry official said.
TRADE, INTELLIGENCE, SECURITY
Modi wants a more comprehensive security and intelligence dialogue with Australia, which is looking at India to buy more minerals in particular.
But progress on trade has been slow, with Australian exports to India falling 22 percent in 2013 to A$12 billion ($10.2 billion). That’s a far cry from Australia’s A$150 billion two-way trade with China and the A$40 billion goal by 2015 set two years ago by former Prime Minister Julia Gillard.
However, a recently sealed civil nuclear deal to sell uranium to India is seen as a sign of growing trust between the two nations, along with Modi’s visit, the first by an Indian leader since 1986.
“Exports have fallen but expectations are that this will bounce back,” said Rory Medcalf, senior research fellow on India Strategic Affairs at the University of New South Wales.
“The India-Australia relationship is reaching a new maturity and it’s reaching a tipping point where it will become a much more comprehensive and trusting relationship.”
After Australia, Modi is due to visit Fiji, which has a large ethnic Indian community.

India  US resolve impasse over food security  clears way for WTO trade dealFIPB role shrinks amid easier FDI flows
Paving the way for implementation of trade facilitation pacts at WTO, India and US have resolved an impasse over food security related issues while safeguarding interest of Indian farmers.
With the US agreeing to support India’s proposal on public stockpiling of food, it would now go for ratification by the WTO General Council to facilitate signing of Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) that has been stalled for months.
Announcing the breakthrough, Commerce and Industry Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that India and the US have successfully resolved their differences on the public stockholding issue for food security purposes in WTO.
This will “pave the way for spurring the WTO to more such success,” she said, while expressing confidence that members would “take the matter forward in WTO in a constructive spirit”.
The Minister further said that many nations saw merit in India’s stand at WTO and that the US has also “appreciated and now openly supported our concerns on public stockholding.”
“India has never obstructed trade facilitation… We were only trying to safeguard our farmer’s interests,” she added.
“WTO General Council will receive India’s proposal and US will support us,” Sitharaman said, while adding that there was a greater understanding of India’s position after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the US.
“India is a strong supporter of the multilateral trading system and we are committed to strengthen it. Bali agreement was not perfect. We had raised these issues for a course correction… We have raised our issues… We are happy to say our differences have been resolved,” she said in a series of tweets.
“India is a strong supporter of the multilateral trading system and is committed to strengthening it and ensuring that the WTO remains a key pillar of the global economic edifice.
“The WTO is in the best interest of developing countries, especially the poorest and most marginalised ones among them, and we are determined to work to strengthen this institution,” Sitharaman said in a statement.
She also said that “plurilateral trading arrangements among a few cannot substitute the multilateral system and are also against the spirit of the fundamental WTO principles of transparency and inclusiveness”.
There have been suggestions from some WTO members recently that the trade pacts can go ahead plurilaterally if there are differences between a few members.
India had made it clear that it would not ratify the TFA, a pact that eases global custom norms, until a permanent solution was found on the food subsidy issue.
India had asked WTO to amend the norms for calculating agri subsidies so that the country could continue to procure foodgrains from farmers at minimum support price and sell them to poor at cheaper rates without violating the WTO norms.
The current WTO norms limit the value of food subsidies at 10 per cent of the total value of foodgrain production. However, the quantum of subsidy is computed after taking into consideration prices that prevailed two decades ago.
There are apprehensions that once India would fully implement its food security programme it may breach the cap.
With the issue having been resolved, Sitharaman said: “We supported the Bali Package but when subsequent developments belied that hope, India had no option but to seek a course correction.
“India, therefore, took the stand that till there was an assurance of our concerns being addressed, it would be difficult to join the consensus on the Protocol of Amendment for the Trade Facilitation Agreement,” she added.
“We are extremely happy that India and the US have successfully resolved their differences relating to the issue of public stockholding for food security purposes in the WTO in a manner that addresses our concerns.
“This will end the impasse at the WTO and also open the way for implementation of the Trade Facilitation Agreement.
“We are confident that the membership will take the matter forward in the WTO in a constructive spirit. This would be an important contribution by the WTO reflecting its commitment to development.
“We urge the WTO membership to take this forward in the General Council on behalf of the Ministerial Conference and pave the way to spurring the WTO to more such successes,” the Minister added.

Analyst corner: Buy DCB Bank on steady performanceKotak Mahindra Bank: Deal and after
We maintain ‘buy’ on DCB Bank with target price of R102 (earlier R94), assigning 1.7x FY16e adjusted book value (ABV). Withstanding challenges, DCB Bank has made a remarkable turnaround and is well-placed to deliver steady performance. The stack is trading at 1.6x FY16 ABV.
DCB Bank’s loan growth picked up to 31% y-o-y in Q2FY15 as it gained traction in corporate banking (up 33% y-o-y, 5.2% q-o-q). This was further aided by healthy growth in retail segment (up 35% y-o-y, 13% q-o-q) and agri (up 78% y-o-y, albeit down q-o-q given higher base in Q1FY15). Retail growth was driven by healthy growth in mortgage segment (up 35% y-o-y, 10.4% q-o-q—more tilted towards LAP portfolio).
Management continued to maintain a cautious stance on SME book due to stress in this segment. Hence, the bank continued with its strategy of focusing on small-ticket loans, leading to a flat SME book.
The bank continued to report healthy NIMs at 3.72%, largely drawing support from 6 bps q-o-q improvement in funding cost (7.73%) which offset the 24 bps decline in lending yields. During the quarter, DCB Bank used excess SLR investment to support the lending requirement, reflected in CD ratio inching up to 81% from 79% in previous quarter. Going forward, management expects slight pressure on NIMs from current level.

From 28k peak  market eyes macrosKotak Mahindra Bank: Deal and after
Improving domestic macros, supported by a sharp plunge in crude oil prices, have fulled interest in the Indian equity markets, which is reflected in the multiple peaks scaled by the 30-share Sensex this year.
On Wednesday, the benchmark index reached another milestone, closing above 28,000 for the first time. The Sensex ended the session at 28,008.9, up 98.84 points, or 0.35%.
At a time when global commodity prices are cooling off, India provides a better growth potential than its emerging market peers, making it the preferred choice of foreign investors.
Global investment bank Macquarie draws a parallel between India and Indonesia, with both countries having seen a regime change in 2014 and enjoying a favourable structural growth potential. Investor expectations for reform delivery are, however, higher from PM Narendra Modi than Indonesian president Jokowi, it says.
“In India, the conclusive election outcome, assuring political stability, and Modi’s good track record have raised investor expectations regarding the government’s ability to undertake much-needed structural reforms,” says Macquarie.
The contours of market rally over the last few months indicate that the Street is keeping a close watch on the pace of reforms undertaken by the BJP government, and that a stronger reform directive may be required for higher FII purchases.
Between late March and early June, the Senex mopped up gains of 3,000 points in just 45 trading sessions on pre- and post-election euphoria.
However, after the Union Budget was presented in July, the rally fizzled out, with investors awaiting clarity on the policy framework.
While the market alpped up the government decisions to deregulate diesel prices and carry out fresh auctions of coal blocks, experts have stressed on the importance of sustained economic reforms.
According to Kotak Institutional Equities, India will gain from the emerging global scenario if it continues to pursue the right policy mix to improve its macros.
Deutchse Bank, which recently set a Sensex target of 29,000 for March 2015, expects aggressive reform-oriented policies to emerge as a core catalyst for markets.

Traders forex chatroom banter exposedTraders’ forex chatroom banter exposed

The traders that attempted to manipulate the foreign exchange markets used chatrooms to share information about currency orders and gave themselves macho pseudonyms such as “The players”, “the A team” and “the 3 musketeers”, the UK financial watchdog’s investigation has revealed.
On Wednesday, the Financial Conduct Authority published chatroom messages showing how traders worked together to manipulate the benchmark, including “how can I make free money with no fcking heads up” [sic] and “cheers for saying you were same way helped me go early”.

Australian banks urged to boost capital
Other messages showed the traders’ fear of being found out: “[don’t] want other numpty’s in mkt to know [about information exchanged within the group] but not only that is he gonna protect us like we protect each other.”
The shared information allowed them to match up orders and align trading strategies at and around the fix. A fix is a benchmark rate based on trades taking place in a given time window; and certain fixings, especially the WM Reuters rate used in calculating key global bond and equity indices, are popular with asset managers who want to trade at the same rate used to value their portfolios.
Foreign exchange dealers usually quote two prices – for buying or selling a particular currency pair – making their money from the spread between the two rates. But banks offering a fixing service guarantee their clients the market mid-rate at this point in time. Traders with big orders to process therefore risk losing a significant amount if the market moves against them in the run-up to the fix – and the incentive to collude and try to make the exchange rate move in their favour is strong.
Citi
The FCA detailed one example of how some traders at Citi were able to manipulate the 1.15pm daily fix of exchange rates by the European Central Bank.
On the day in question, Citi had net buy orders of €200m and would benefit if it was able to move the ECB fix rate upwards.
Traders were able to “build” this order to €542m by using chatrooms to co-ordinate with traders at other firms who transferred their buy orders to Citi.
Furthermore, traders in a chatroom with net orders in the opposite direction to the desired movement at the fix sought to transact before the fix with traders outside the chatroom. The FCA said this practice was commonly referred to as “leaving you with the ammo”, building the volume of orders held by the traders in the chatroom in the desired direction and increasing their potential influence on the fix.
Having netted off its sell order with another party, one trader commented in the chatroom: “U shud be nice and clear to mangle”. The FCA said: “We read the word ‘mangle’ in this context as an attempt to manipulate the fix.”

In the 15 seconds before the ECB fix, Citi placed four buy orders of increasing size and price which were priced at a level above the prevailing offer price. The FCA said Citi’s trading in this case generated a profit of $99,000.
After the fix, traders in the chatroom commented: “impressive”, “lovely” and “cnt teach that”.
HSBC
The FCA gave an example of how on one day it believed HSBC was involved in the manipulation of the 4pm WM/Reuters fix for the sterling-dollar rate. It allegedly colluded with traders from at least three other banks who, like it, were wanting to drive the rate lower.
From transcripts of chatroom conversations, about half an hour before the 4pm fix, a HSBC trader says “Let’s go”. Reply from Firm A: “yeah baby”, then: “hopefuulyl a fe wmore get same way and we can team whack it” [sic].
A trader from Firm D tells the trader from Firm A to “bask the fck out of it”.
Firm A then tells HSBC that a deal has been done with Firm E, which is buying. “Taken him out . . . so shud have iot rid of main buyer for u . . . im stilla seller of 90 . . . gives us a chance” [sic].
In depth
HSBC ended up selling £70m between 3.32pm and the start of the fix window. The FCA said these early trades were designed to take advantage of the expected downwards movement in the fix rate following the discussions within the chatroom.
In that time, the rate fell from $1.6044 to $1.6009.
HSBC then sold £311m during the fix window. HSBC and Firms A-C accounted for 63 per cent of the value of sales on the Reuters platform that day. The fix price was eventually $1.6003.
After the fix the traders said the following in the chatroom:
“Nice work gent . . . I don my hat”, “dont mess with our ccy [currency]”, “loved that mate . . . worked lovely . . . pity we coldn’t get it below the 00” and “we need a few more of those for me to get back on track this month”.
HSBC’s profit in this trade was $162,000, the FCA said.
JPMorgan
The FCA gave an example of a day when it says JPMorgan attempted to manipulate the 4pm WMR euro-dollar fix rate.
JPMorgan had net buy orders of €105m and wanted to move the fix rate up.
In a chatroom conversation, it offers to transfer this order to Firm A. Firm A says “maybe”. Firm A is buying €150m at the fix “for a top [account]”, adding “i’d prefer we join forces”. JPMorgan replies “perfick . . . lets do this . . . lets double team em”. Firm A replies “YESsssssss”. Later Firm A says to JPMorgan; “I got the bookies covered”, referring to dealers in the interdealer broker market.
By the fix, JPMorgan had built orders of €278m while Firm A’s orders were €240m.
We were EPIC at the fix yest
- Firm A
JPMorgan bought €57m in the two minutes before the fix window. The FCA said these trades were designed to take advantage of the expected upwards movement in the fix rate following the discussions within the chatroom.
During the fix window, JPMorgan bought €134m and Firm A bought €125m. Between them they accounted for 41 per cent of the euro-dollar trade.
‘So couldnt have been that $hit a week!!
- Firm B
JPMorgan’s profit in this trade was $33,000.
RBS
The FCA used an example of RBS attempting to manipulate the WMR GBP/USD fix on a day when it had net client sell orders at the fix and would benefit if it was able to manipulate the WMR fix rate lower.
Ahead of the fix, RBS shared information with other traders in the chatroom causing two of them to “net off” their buying and selling orders. Another firm responds by netting off part of its sell order with two other parties outside the chatroom.
The FCA said this practice was known as “clearing the decks” as traders netted off their orders with third parties outside the chatroom reducing the volume of orders that might otherwise be transacted at the fix in the opposite direction.
In a separate chatroom, RBS told three other traders: “We getting a lot Betty at fix” which the FCA said was trader slang for sterling/dollar, coming from “Betty Grable” which rhymes with “cable”.
‘We fooking killed it right’
- Trader
In the period leading up to the 4pm fix, RBS built the volume of currency it sold to £399m which the FCA said “was designed to take advantage of the expected downwards movement in the fix rate following the discussions within the chatroom”.
The FCA said that RBS made $615,000 profit on this trade.
UBS
The FCA gave an example of an occasion when it says UBS attempted to manipulate the 1.15pm ECB euro-dollar fix. UBS was a net seller and wanted to move the rate lower.
Ahead of the fix UBS had net sell orders of €250m, Firm A was selling €200m, while Firm B was selling €100m. Firm A’s order’s dropped to €100m but it said “hopefully taking all the filth out for u . . .”, meaning it had netted off some of its orders with people who might have traded against UBS.
Firm A and UBS then said they had done short trades, each of €25m. Firm B then indicated that these short positions should be held for only 12 minutes, i.e until the ECB fix.
Firm A says it is now selling €50m at the fix. “I getting chipped away at a load of bank filth for the fix . . . back to bully [meaning €50m] . . . hopefully decks a bit cleaner”.
By the fix, UBS had sell orders of €200m and had increased its short position to €50m. Firm B had a short position of €50m. Firm C, a buyer, netted off with Firm A and Firm B, leaving it with €10m to buy at the fix.
Firm B then advised Firm C to “go late”, when the rate will be lower. Firm B copied into the chat a note from UBS, which said an earlier fix was “the best fix of my ubs career . . .” Firm B then added: “challenge”. Firm C replied “stars aligned”.
UBS’s net sell orders were €211m at the time of the fix.
At 13.14.59 UBS placed an offer to sell €100m at 1.3092, 3 basis points below the prevailing best bid. The ECB subsequently published the fix rate for euro-dollar at 1.3092. UBS’s order accounted for 29 per cent of the orders at the 1.15pm fix.
UBS’s trading in this example generated a profit of $513,000.
.............................................
In the US, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission also published transcripts from chatroom conversations between traders:
Three traders from Citi, JPMorgan and UBS discuss whether to invite a fourth into their private chatroom:
“Will he tell rest of desk stuff . . . or god forbid his nyk [New York office],” one trader asks. “That’s really imp[ortant] q[uestion],” another trader responds, adding: “dont want other numpty’s in mkt to know [sic] . . . is he gonna protect us like we protect each other against our own branches?”
A trader from HSBC visits multiple chatrooms in an attempt to manipulate the 4pm WMR fix, declaring he is a net seller in “cable” (a slang term for GBP/USD currency pairing):
“Hopefully a [few] more get same way and we can team whack it,” one trader responds. “ill do some digging”, says another prompting others to disclose their positions.
Simultaneously, in a separate private chatroom, the same HSBC trader informs other traders they should buy “cable” at the fix:
“Get lumpy cable at the fix ok” he said. A second trader replied “ta mate”. As the 4pm fix period closes, the HSBC trader comments: “I sold a lot up there and over sold by 100 hahaha”.
In another private chatroom, the HSBC trader discloses his position with traders at other banks before the closure of the fix period. The traders then share information about the size and direction of the orders at the fix period:
“You getting betty [Betty Grable, rhyming slang for cable] on the mumble still? We have nowt,” one trader asks. He then says: “Get it up to 60/70 then bash the fck out of it”.
Traders from Citi and JPMorgan co-ordinate within a private chatroom in an attempt to manipulate the EUR/USD fix:
“OK, I got a lot of euros,” says the first trader. A second trader responds: “ill take it if u dont want it”. The first trader replies: “lets double team it . . . how much u got?” and they jointly agree a trading strategy. Just after the 4pm fix, the first trader reported he was “hosed” and the second trader responded “ditto”.
Traders from UBS share their “scores” in a private chatroom:
Traders from UBS and three other banks exchanged their positions leading into the WMR 4pm fix. Once all four determined they were going to be trading in the same direction, one asked if “we gonna be able to get it to 05” to which another responded: “is that the royal fkn we?”. After the fixing window had closed, the chatroom members gave their “scores” or profits from the fix each claiming they made between $60,000 and $220,000 prompting one to add: “nice call”.

Cisco s campus in B lore: Lessons for PM s smart citiesLessons for PM Modi's smart cities

Moinak Mitra, ET Bureau
As the Chief Globalisation Officer at Cisco, Wim Elfrink prides himself on applying digital overlay to physical infrastructure.
He's also the brain behind the 2.18 million square feet Cisco Smart Campus in Bengaluru that houses eight glass-and-concrete buildings showcasing a digitally connected and sustainable environment where 8,500-odd techies don't have an assigned workplace.
The campus ecosystem resembles a smart city and is in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's big idea of digitising India by setting up 100 smart cities.

Sena slams BJP over NCP support  likens Pawar s party to mousePrint
Shiv Sena in its mouthpiece 'Saamana' said that NCP 'nibbled the state coffers like a mouse'.
By: Press Trust of India | Mumbai | Posted: November 12, 2014 5:48 pm | Updated: November 12, 2014 5:50 pm
Though Maharashtra government led by Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has won the trust vote in the Assembly but before the House went for voting, the opposition Shiv Sena slammed the BJP government and warned its former ally that it will be disrespecting people’s mandate if it takes support of NCP which “nibbled the state coffers like a mouse”.
“(Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra) Fadnavis once said that he wants to run the government for the people. But how do you plan to run the government taking support of a party that has been discarded by the people of the state?
“Will you win the trust vote taking support of a party which has nibbled at the state coffers like a mouse? Will you take support of a mouse?”, the Sena said in an editorial in its mouthpiece ‘Saamana’.
Taunting its former ally, the party said the BJP is ready to take Sena’s support to save face during the trust vote, but is unrelenting on carrying forward talks regarding Sena’s role in the state government.
“BJP asks us to give it support on the basis of similar ideologies and principles. You (BJP) also know that the ideology of NCP is only to loot Maharashtra,” it alleged.
“But you (BJP) have nothing to do with that? You are ready to take their unconditional support,” the Sena said while asking the BJP “on whose tunes it plans to dance now”.
It is a strange scenario where the party with largest mandate is joining hands with a party that fared badly during the recent Assembly elections, the Sena said.
“Why was the NCP thrown to the fourth position this time? What kind of principles does the BJP talk about when it agrees to take support of a party which was relegated to the fourth position by the people,” it said.
“Saving the government is the only priority of BJP, for which it will also take support of the MIM which is working towards vitiating the minds of people,” the Sena alleged.

BSE introduces two new segments for listed firmsBSE introduces two new segments, 'D' and 'DT' for listed firms
PTI     Mumbai   Last Updated: November 12, 2014  | 19:50 IST

Leading stock exchange Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) has introduced two new segments, 'D' and 'DT', for listed companies to provide guidance to the investors.
"The companies which would apply for listing on the exchange through direct listing norms would be placed in the Group 'D' for trading in normal segment and in Group 'DT' for trade to trade segment," the BSE said in a circular.
In trade to trade segment, only delivery-based transactions are allowed and traders can't take intra-day positions.
BSE has classified equity scrips into categories such as Group A, Group B, Group T, among others, to provide a guidance to the investors. Group A is the most tracked segment consisting of about 200 scrips, while Group B consists of more than 3,000 stocks.
The classification is based on several factors like market capitalisation, trading volumes and numbers, track records, profits, dividends, shareholding patterns, and some qualitative aspects.
"All rules, regulations, norms/ guidelines pertaining to trading, risk management, clearing, settlement etc applicable presently and from time to time for scrips in the existing Groups would also be applicable to scrips in Group D and DT," BSE noted.

Vladimir Putins newest enemy: AustraliaBy Adam Taylor November 12 Follow @mradamtaylor

Australia will host the leaders of the Group of 20 nations at their annual meeting this weekend, with the world's major economies coming together in Brisbane for major talks. For one guest, however, there might not be a warm welcome.
Over the past few weeks, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has repeatedly warned Russian President Vladimir Putin that he intended to take him to task for his government's alleged role in shooting down of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over Ukraine in July. Pointing to widely accepted evidence that Kremlin-backed rebels shot down the plane, Abbott has argued that Russia should not just help more with the investigation but should also pay compensation to the victims.
It's an emotional issue for many Australians -- 38 of the passengers killed on the flight were citizens of the country -- and one that the prime minister has seized on. Abbott, a conservative politician who has frequently caused controversy  in Australia, went so far as to publicly threaten to  "shirtfront" the Russian president -- a colloquialism from Australian rules football that means to bump someone "forcefully in the chest."
"I am going to be saying to Mr. Putin, 'Australians were murdered; they were murdered by Russian-backed rebels using Russian-supplied equipment,'" Abbott added -- though he later walked back his comments, promising only a "robust" discussion with Putin.
In the end, Abbott decided to bring forward his confrontation with Putin, challenging him for 15 minutes at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Beijing on Tuesday. According to the Guardian , the Australian leader told his Russian counterpart that he had evidence that the missile launcher used to down the Malaysia Airlines plane had come from Russia and was returned to Russia afterward. Abbott pointed to the example set by the United States when it shot down Iran Air Flight 655 in 1988 and subsequently apologized and paid compensation to the victims' families.
The response may not be what Abbott was hoping for, however. Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, joked to Russian reporters that Abbott "did not even try" to "shirtfront" Putin, and on Wednesday, a representative of the Russian Embassy in Canberra flatly rejected the Australian position.
"We totally refute the allegations and we want to commit to the full and impartial international investigation," spokesman Alexander Odoevskiy told the Sydney Morning Herald . "If the prime minister has, as he declares, any clear evidence, then he should bring it to the table. We haven't seen it." Odoevskiy also told the newspaper that the situation with Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was "incomparable" to Iran Air Flight 655 due to the lack of agreement over who was was behind the downing of the plane.
To make matters worse, Australian media are also reporting that Russia may be flexing its military muscles near Australia. 7News reported  Wednesday that "four Russian warships are bearing down on Australian waters, led by the guided missile Cruiser, Varyag, the flag ship of Russia's Pacific fleet." Australia's government has downplayed this development, pointing out that the "movements of these vessels [are] entirely consistent with provisions under international law." Any direct military confrontation between the two nations certainly appears extremely unlikely, though the movement of the ships draws an interesting parallel with a number of  "unusual" recent incidents involving Russian air power in Europe.
It leaves Abbott in an awkward position. For all his tough talk, an apology from Russia seems as distant as ever, and his macho "shirtfront" comment has been widely mocked; one online survey published by the paper Sydney Morning Herald found that the majority of readers were unhappy with his efforts. And while Putin may receive a cold reception in Brisbane, he's probably sure he has come out on top.

national championship
India’s new wonder girl of swimming, Maana Patel of Gujarat, bettered her own mark in the women’s 100m backstroke at the 68th senior National aquatic championship on Wednesday.
The opening day saw two more records in the men’s section with Saurabh Sangvekar of Maharashtra and Services’ P.S. Madhu eclipsing the previous bests while winning the 400m freestyle and 100m backstroke events respectively.
The 14-year-old Maana maintained the sequence of creating records that she had started in the senior nationals at Thiruvananthapuram last year. Manaa cut short her previous best of 1:06.58 (set in 2013) by recording 1:05.47 in the 100m backstroke heats. She won the final but could not better the timing set in the morning.
“I felt a lot energised in the heats and also enjoyed a nice rhythm to get that timing in the heats. I could not warn up properly ahead of the final and that seemed to upset the tempo,” said Maana, who has won five gold medals in the junior Nationals with a record in each effort.
Brilliant effort
Saurabh’s outstanding performance in the first event of the day — where he beat the defending champion Sajan Prakash of Railways to win the men’s 400m freestyle with a record timing — lit up the proceedings.
Saurabh made a perfect start and led all along to win in 3:56.17 seconds, erasing the record of 3:58.51 set by Sajan in the previous Nationals. “I had timed 3.59 in the Incheon Asian Games. Since then I am targeting 3.54 and am happy to reach nearer to it today,” said Saurabh.
Madhu peaked at the right moment as clocked a record-breaking 57.95 seconds to beat back the challenges of M. Arvind of Karnataka and Rohit Havaldar of Maharashtra, who had the top two positions in the heats.
The results (finals):
Men’s: 400m freestyle: 1. Saurabh Sangvekar (Mah) 3:56.17s (NR, Old 3:58.51 by Sajan Prakash (RSPB), 2013), 2. Sajan Prakash (RSPB) 3:56.78, 3. Anand A.S. (Ker) 4:07.95. 200m breaststroke: 1.

A new front opens in e-tail war as Snapdeal goes shopping for talentExpress IT Awards: India needs its own version, not replica, of Silicon Valley
Between now and March next year, online marketplace Snapdeal.com will hire as many as 15 people a day as it looks to treble its headcount to cope with expansion plans and a target base of 100,000 sellers.
The Delhi-based e-retailer is hoping to have close to 4,500 professionals on board, up from 1,300 it had in March 2014, keeping enough of a bench to take care of the natural attrition of 10%. A good part of the firm’s war chest of $860 million, consequently, will go towards beefing up the team, with compensation slated to be higher by 35-40%.
The sales team will nearly treble to 600-700 from the present 250 in the next two months while the supply chain and operations vertical will double from a 200-member unit to a 400-member team to penetrate deeper into the tier II/III cities. The technology team will be stronger at 1,200 people compared with 400 at present; the firm has budgeted for an investment of $250 million in this area.
“We started the year with 1,300 people but we’ve had to rethink the strategy as we revised the growth targets,” Saurabh Nigam, vice-president, human resources, Snapdeal, told FE.
The bulk of the recruits — 60-65% — will be junior employees while 20-25% will be mid-level managers and the rest senior executives.
The firm plans to hit campuses of management and engineering colleges and hopes to hire 150 management graduates and 400-500 engineering graduates.
Snapdeal CEO Kunal Behl had told FE a couple of months ago his firm had grown 600% year-on-year. “We clocked $1 billion in annualised sales earlier this year, two and a half years after starting the current line of business, with an investment of less than $100 million and around 1,000 people. We have 50,000 sellers already and our goal is to have a million sellers in next three years,” Behl had said. Snapdeal reported a loss of Rs 264.6 crore in FY14, up from Rs 120 crore the year before. Revenues registered a fivefold increase to Rs 168.1 crore.
The firm’s technology team will be ramped up as it plans a new development centre in Bengaluru, in addition to the one in Delhi. “We want to create a technology ecosystem which is comprehensive and difficult to replicate and are looking at some senior professionals,” Nigam said. The e-tailer will foray into seven new areas.
With the domestic e-commerce market poised to become a $6-billion industry in 2015, frontline e-tailers like Flipkart, Snapdeal, Amazon, Myntra and Jabong are expected to hire nearly 60,000 professionals this fiscal. Flipkart plans to hire about 12,000 professionals this fiscal, while Myntra and Jabong plan to increase their headcount by 700 approximately.

IMF's Christine Lagarde sees jobs shortfall in G20 growth target
AFP Nov 13, 2014, 11.09AM IST
("Moving the needle up two…)
BRISBANE: International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde has backed the G20's pledge to raise economic output by 2.0 percent in the next five years, but warned it will not create all the jobs needed.
Speaking to the Australian Financial Review from Washington before heading to Brisbane for this weekend's meeting of the world's 20 biggest economies, Lagarde said focusing on growth was the right strategy.
Host Australia has pushed for members to commit to reforms, including cutting red tape and encouraging private infrastructure investment, in a bid to boost the group's economic output by US$2 trillion.
"Moving the needle up two points over five years is certainly an improvement," the former French finance minister said in comments published Thursday.
"Is it going to be sufficient to deliver all the jobs that are needed? No. But it's certainly a step in the right direction if it is implemented."
In a report ahead of the summit, the IMF said the world economy faced stiff headwinds from sluggish growth in Europe and Japan and a slowdown in emerging economies.
It trimmed its growth forecast for the year to 3.3 percent, from 3.4 percent, citing geopolitical tensions and volatility in financial markets, and urged advanced economies to tackle high unemployment by spending more to generate jobs.
"The recovery is under way but is uneven, fragile and with downside risks on the horizon," Lagarde told the financial daily newspaper.
On the upside, the Washington-based body said a nearly 20 percent fall in oil prices since September would, if sustained, aid growth.
Lagarde said she had a "strong confidence" a deal on the 2.0 percent goal would be reached this weekend and praised the government of Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott for focusing the G20 agenda.
"I think the Australians have done something to be satisfied and proud of because there are deliverables and they are passing the baton to Turkey with a bunch of good things done," she said.
"Early on they identified the agenda, they were very focused and did not try to cover the entire planet of issues. They managed to pull off the growth agenda."
US President Barack Obama, China counterpart Xi Jinping and India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi are among the leaders to be hosted by Abbott in Brisbane for the two-day summit.

A special Bangladesh tribunal has sentenced an opposition politician to death for his role in killing people and other crimes during the nation’s 1971 independence war against Pakistan.
M.A. Zahid Hossain Khokon, of the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party, is a fugitive and believed to be in Sweden with his son and daughter.
He was convicted of leading the killings of people, looting and arson attacks during the war.
Bangladesh blames Pakistani soldiers and local collaborators for the deaths of 3 million people during the nine-month war. An estimated 200,000 women were raped and about 10 million people were forced to take shelter in refugee camps in neighboring India.
Head judge of a three-member panel A.T.M. Fazle Rabbi said the tribunal found him guilty of 10 of 11 charges he faced.

Cops to probe role of Salem aide in murder bid on builderssonPosted: November 13, 2014 12:57 pm | Updated: November 13, 2014 2:42 pm
By Santoshee Gulabkali Mishra
The Thane Police Crime Branch is probing the alleged involvement of arrested gangster Abu Salem’s aide Mohammad Hasan Mehandi Hasan Ali Shaikh, commonly known as Hasan Ali, in connection with the alleged conspiracy to kill Sandeep Lohariya, son of murdered Navi Mumbai builder Sunilkumar Lohariya.
Hasan Ali is currently lodged in Central jail along with Salem, after being arrested in connection with the murder of builder Pradeep Jain.
On March 24, the Thane Crime Branch had registered a case against Navi Mumbai builder Suresh Bijlani, Mahesh Bijlani and Anuragh Garg, former police inspector Emmanuel Amolik as well as other accomplices identified as Sanjay Birajdar alias Patil, Rupesh Singh and Tinu Bishte alias Bishtya.
The Bijlani brothers, Garg, and Amolik are among the several accused arrested for Sunilkumar’s murder, and are alleged to have hatched the plan to eliminate Sandeep too, as he was proving to be an obstacle for them in their efforts to secure bail.
“We have recorded statements from Bishte, Birajdar and Singh, as well as from Hasan Ali’s wife Haseena in the presence of a judicial magistrate under provision of the section 164 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC).
Bishte and Birajdar had accompanied Haseena when she had gone to meet Hasan Ali in the Taloja Central Jail. We have also collected evidence about Hasan Ali’s alleged role in the conspiracy. Hasan Ali is Salem’s right-hand man and driver,” said a senior office with the Thane Crime Branch.
Birjdar has allegedly claimed that Hasan Ali, during a court appearance at a sessions Court in Mumbai, had handed him a slip of paper instructing him to meet Amolik in the Thane sessions court along with Singh.
“We are planning to arrest Hasan Ali for his involvement in the conspiracy to kill Sandeep. Bishte and Birajdar have both said in their statements that they were promised a huge amount of money as well as development rights of various properties in Navi Mumbai,” said the officer.
Bishte, according to sources, has further said that after meeting Amolik, he took a local train to Ambarnath, where he and Singh discussed the contract and Singh asked him not to tell anyone about their meeting with Amolik during this conversation.

Reminiscing the days spent together with filmmaker Ravi Chopra , who passed away on Wednesday, Bollywood screen icon Amitabh Bachchan said he is “filled with grief and sorrow” on his “dear friend’s” death. (See Pics: Bollywood celebs at Ravi Chopra’s residence )
“ Ravi Chopra , my dear friend and director and producer passed away suddenly today (Wednesday), my son called to give me the news,” Big B wrote in his official blog late Wednesday.
The veteran filmmaker, who was hospitalised in Breach Candy hospital in Mumbai, passed away at around 3.30 p.m Wednesday. The 68-year-old had been reportedly suffering from a severe lung ailment since the last few years.
Son of legendary producer and director late B.R. Chopra and the nephew of late Yash Chopra, Ravi is remembered for his soulful storytelling in films like “The Burning Train”, “Aaj Ki Awaz”, and “Baabul”, among others.
On TV, he directed epic dramas like “Mahabharat” and “Ramayan”.
“Filled with grief and sorrow, and unable to find words that could possibly describe what I go through, it is difficult to imagine those days spent together…”
“What does one write on such occasions, silence is the best condolence…,” an emotional Big B said.
Chopra’s debut as a director happened with “Zameer” with Big B and veteran actress Saira Banu. Later on, the actor worked with him in “Baghban”, “Baabul”, “Bhoothnath” and “Bhoothnath Returns”.
“It is the time in life when you do not make friends, but lose them,” Amitabh Bacchchan tweeted.
The 72-year-old star is in the city to shoot Shoojit Sircar’s “Piku”.

MMRDA writes to state  wants to rule its transportcorridorsThe MMRDA is now planning to start work on the 33.5-km Colaba-Bandra-Seepz Metro, which is currently in the tendering process.
Mumbai | Posted: November 13, 2014 12:51 pm
Even though a Metro corridor and a monorail have already started operating and more lines are being planned, the city’s development authority is confused about whose jurisdiction the alignment for the projects falls under and if clearances from the local body are required.
The MMRDA has written to the state government seeking clarification on the same. It wants to be appointed as the special planning authority of corridors where it is planning public transport projects.
UPS Madan, metropolitan commissioner at MMRDA, said that currently under the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning (MRTP) Act, there is no provision to construct viaducts or stations on roads within the city’s development plan.“Ultimately, even for a government building, a local body clearance is required. So we have written to the state government asking for clarity on this, as to who should give such clearances in case of construction of viaducts and stations on the city’s roads. To avoid such issues in the future, we have asked that the project implementing agency in such cases be appointed as the special planning authority for the areas under the alignment,” Madan said.
The development authority stumbled upon this quandary last month when it was writing to the Reliance Infrastructure-led Mumbai Metro One Pvt Ltd (MMOPL), saying that the latter had constructed more area than required at the Metro car depot in DN Nagar. The authority had asked MMOPL to hand-over the excess area constructed.
“There was lack of clarity regarding who should take action in case we find that there has been any violation,” Madan said.
He added that the issue of whether a local body clearance is needed was more pertinent to the Versova-Andheri-Ghatkopar Metro as it was on a public-private-partnership model and involved a private entity in charge of construction. The monorail, on the other hand, was constructed with MMRDA in charge.
“The Metro Act is also silent on this issue. It is derived from the Railways Act, which assumes that approvals of the local authority are not required for railway works. But it did not envisage a situation where a private player would execute such projects,” Madan said.
The 11.4-km Versova-Andheri-Ghatkopar Metro was completed and opened for public use in June. The 8.8-km Chembur-Wadala monorail was completed earlier in February, while work on the Wadala-Jacob Circle corridor is underway.
The MMRDA is now planning to start work on the 33.5-km Colaba-Bandra-Seepz Metro, which is currently in the tendering process.
Besides, they have also planned to construct a 40.2-km Dahisar-Bandra-Charkop Metro and a Wadala-Thane-Kasarvadavali Metro line.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi unequivocally rejected any linkage between religion and terrorism, even as he made a strong pitch for a “genuine international partnership” against all forms of terrorism.
In his address at the East Asia Summit here on Thursday morning, PM Modi said: “We support the East Asia Summit Declaration on the Islamic State. At the same time, comprehensive response against terrorism requires a genuinely international partnership against all terrorism. Those who believe in humanity must come together. We should also reject any linkage between religion and terrorism.”

Modi also referred to the increasing challenges of terrorism and extremism and the “close link with drug trafficking, arms smuggling and money laundering”.
While making a strong pitch for increased international cooperation on energy partnership, especially in the area of solar energy, and in combating pandemics, Modi also reiterated the responsibility of all nations in following “international law and norms on maritime issues” and also called for a “balanced Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement” that gives equal emphasis to goods and services.

Against the backdrop of China’s increasing belligerence over maritime disputes with southeast Asian nations, Modi underscored the point that “all nations have a responsibility to follow international law and norms on maritime issues” and that he “hoped for an early conclusion of a code of conduct to resolve the matter”.

Posters fail to amuse all  fuming women say not baby-makingmachinesBut the irritation over the campaign stems from a deeper issue — gender bias.
Written by Anjali Lukose | Mumbai | Posted: November 13, 2014 12:31 pm | Updated: November 13, 2014 12:35 pm
While some ‘Maje ni life’ loving Parsis are laughing at the ‘Jiyo Parsi’ advertisements that seek to encourage young Parsis to marry early and couples to have more children, others think the ads are bawdy and sexist.
Navaz Master, a 58-year-old woman who works with an NGO, felt the advertisement got it bang on about sons being too close to their mothers and Parsi women being too “choosy”. “I have 40 plus cousins who are unmarried and these ads are topical. Even I have advised my daughters to not keep looking out for Mr Perfect. The ads throw these typical Parsi issues in people’s faces and it is meant to be homourous. Whether it works to encourage youngsters is yet to be seen, but even if it encourages six out of 6,000, it will help the community,” she said, adding that the scheme and the religious laws should move towards being more gender neutral.
According to Parzor Project for the Preservation and Promotion of Parsi Zoroastrian Culture and Heritage, a UNESCO initiative, only one Parsi family in nine had a child below the age of 10. The numbers are far below replacement level with a Total Fertility Rate (TFR) of 0.88 and a vast aging population. Nearly 45 per cent adult males and 38 per cent adult females were unmarried, the Jiyo Parsi website stated.
“It is more of an attitudinal problem rather than financial constraints,” said HP Ranina, a Supreme Court lawyer. “In the 19th century, the Parsi population went up to 1,25,000 as women married early and had many children. But as more Parsi women got educated, they wanted to concentrate on their careers, rather than raise families. Such ads, even with financial incentives, do little to change attitudes,” he said.
But young Parsi women, most already plagued by family pressure to get married, are not amused. “I’m not a baby-making machine,” fumes Farzeen Khan (23), an amateur filmmaker living in Wadiabaug at Parel.
“Although it is a very useful scheme for Parsi couples, I found the ad campaign offensive. Getting married and having children is my personal choice. The ad about not having older parents to babysit if I delay having kids is so derogatory to older Parsis. Are my parents’ existence limited to babysitting their grandchildren,” she said, adding that the community should instead learn to welcome children of Parsis marrying outside the community if they wanted to increase the population.
But the irritation over the campaign stems from a deeper issue — gender bias. While benefits of the scheme, which provides counselling and financial support for fertility treatment, does not extend support to Parsi women married outside the community, it allows Parsi men to marry outside the community to avail of the scheme.

Oil Ministry grapples with payment options for RIL's KG-D6 gas
PTI Nov 13, 2014, 01.16PM IST
(As per the 15-day billing…)
NEW DELHI: Days ahead of the first payment by customers at the new gas price, the Oil Ministry is grappling with the issue of how to bill the gas produced from Reliance Industries' main fields in the KG-D6 block.
As per the 15-day billing cycle, gas producers are to raise the first invoice at the revised price of $ 5.61 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu) this weekend.
However, there is still no clarity on how to invoice the fuel from RIL's D1&D3 fields, which is to be sold at the old rate of $ 4.2 per mmBtu.
While announcing an across-the-board 33 per cent hike in natural gas prices, the government had on October 18 stated that customers of D1&D3 gas will pay the revised rates but RIL will get only $ 4.2, with the difference being deposited in a gas pool account maintained by state-owned GAIL.
Sources said the Oil Ministry is still grappling with the easier option of allowing RIL to raise bill at new rate of $ 5.61 and then depositing $ 1.41 in the gas pool account.
Or alternatively, asking customers to pay the old rate of $ 4.205 per mmBtu to RIL and the incremental $ 1.41 per mmBtu rate into the gas pool account, an option fraught with risks like payment defaults as well as being at odds with rights of the contractor under Production Sharing Contract.
Under the first option, at stake is just $ 4 million of additional revenue that $ 1.41 will fetch for about 7 million standard cubic meters per day of output from D1&D3 fields every fortnight.
Sources said this is too less an amount for any firm to swindle and not deposit in the gas pool account, thereby risking government action, including cancellation of contract.
On the other hand, the second option may lead to creating more complexities in a dispute which is primarily between the contractor (RIL) and the government, they said.
The government has not agreed to RIL's reasoning of geological complexities leading to output from D1&D3 dropping to one-tenth of the targetted 80 mmscmd and has levied penalty in the form of disallowing $ 2.376 billion in cost. RIL disputed this and has dragged the government to arbitration.
Pending award of arbitration, the government has disallowed higher gas rates for D1&D3. RIL will get the amount accumulated in the pool account if it wins the arbitration.
Sources said the gas sale-purchase agreement (GSPA) is primarily between seller (RIL) and buyers (fertiliser firms). Recovery provisions as well as built-in default redressal mechanism are there in the agreement.
If the government decides that the incremental revenue of $ 1.41 should go directly to the gas pool account, then GAIL does not have legal powers to recover any amount in case of default and the consequences of who pays in case RIL wins the arbitration.
Also, this may tantamount to involving a third party in a dispute which is primarily between the government and the contractor, they added.

China October data shows economy cooling further, need for more policy support

(Fixed-asset investment,…)
BEIJING: China's economy lost further momentum in October, with factory growth dipping and investment growth hitting a near 13-year low, reinforcing views that Beijing will need to do more to fight slackening growth.
Months of tepid performance in factories and the growing drag from a weakening housing market are putting Beijing's 2014 growth target of around 7.5 percent at greater risk.
Fixed-asset investment, an important driver of growth, grew 15.9 percent in the first 10 months of the year from a year ago, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Thursday. That was the weakest pace since December 2001.
October factory output rose 7.7 percent from a year earlier, which was higher August's 6.9 percent rise but below expectations and the second weakest pace since the height of the global financial crisis. Retail sales growth eased slightly to 11.5 percent, the slowest pace since early 2006.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales and industrial output to rise 11.6 percent and 8.0 percent, respectively, while fixed asset investment for the January-October was seen up 15.9 percent.
That followed data this week which showed inflation remained near a five-year low and producer prices fell for 32nd consecutive month, highlighting sluggish domestic demand.
"Chinese core October data came in uniformly softer and below consensus," said Dariusz Kowalczyk, senior economist at Credit Agricole CIB in Hong Kong.
"The data highlights downward pressure on the economy. It will encourage further monetary easing."
Despite a raft of stimulus measures, China's annual economic growth slowed to 7.3 percent in the third quarter, the weakest pace since the global financial crisis.
Many analysts believe additional support measures may be needed to offset the drag from the cooling housing market, but they are divided over whether authorities will take more forceful action such as cutting interest rates unless there is a risk of a sharper slowdown.
Growth in real estate investment, which affects about 40 other industries in China, cooled to 12.4 percent in the first 10 months of 2014 from a year earlier, with property sales and new construction continuing to fall.
In a bid to stem the slide in the property market, China cut mortgage rates and down payment levels for some home buyers in late September for the first time since the 2008/09 global financial crisis.
But economists are divided over whether the measures will have a long-term effect, pointing to massive inventories of unsold homes hanging over the market.
Policymakers have rolled out a series of measures since spring to bolster growth, including the latest move in late October and early November to approve over $100 billion worth of infrastructure projects.
The central bank, which pumped 769.5 billion yuan worth of three-month loans into banks in September and October, has pledged to keep its policy stance accommodative but stressed that it will not flood markets with cash.
Chinese top leaders, taking comfort from a relatively resilient job market, have flagged on many occasions that they would be more tolerant of slower economic growth while forging ahead with reforms to pursue a more sustainable growth model.
In the latest indication of Beijing's tolerance of slightly lower growth, Chinese President Xi Jinping said on Sunday that even if China's economy were to grow 7 percent, that would still rank it at the forefront of the world's economies.

(SBI, which has a significant…)
By Shreya Sinha & Sangita Mehta
MUMBAI: Two of India's biggest state-run banks -State Bank of India (SBI) and Bank of Baroda (BoB) -are diverging on how to go about their international operations as new rules begin to bite and past experiences are leading to different strategies.
SBI , which has a significant presence in the US and Europe , is moving to acquire more clients from the host countries in which it operates instead of lending to companies owned by Indians or Indian firmsbacked entities there.
However, BoB, which dominates Africa among Indian banks with branches in Kenya and Tanzania, says that it will prefer to lend to Indian or Indians-backed businesses since it is difficult to make a proper due diligence of local customers.
"We are also changing our focus from being a purely India-based bank to also local lending," said A Krishna Kumar, managing director of State Bank of India.
"Our current international book is 70% India related. We would try to make it 50% in the next few years."
But, peer Bank of Baroda sings a different tune.
"In foreign territories, you are always a foreigner. Since we have very small presence in overseas land, we will continue to focus on India-related parties because that is something we understand the best," said P Srinivas, executive director of Bank of Baroda.
In Bank of Baroda's portfolio, 70% of the business is India-related, while the rest is local. Srinivas added that except for Dubai where majority of business is with local customers, in most other regions India-related business is dominant.
Indian banks are mostly shifting their strategies to suit the local regulations, and in some cases are pruning their overseas operations as local economies are not offering much opportunity. Some private lenders such as ICICI Bank have even been repatriating capital from overseas branches.
Overseas business contributes nearly 12-13% of SBI's earnings, while international business is about 25-30% for Bank of India and Bank of Baroda's earnings. Justifying SBI's decision on increasing share of local business, Krishna Kumar said the locals do not take the bank as one among them.
"We have started doing that in various jurisdictions like the USA and UK . Also, unless you get a foothold in the local community, you are not recognised as a banker who is willing to lend locally," he said.As a strategy, he said that the bank will try to have more intensive contacts with bankers in those jurisdictions and go in for some syndication of loans.
At present, the State Bank of India has 190 overseas offices and reported an operating profit of $676 million for March 2014. Against this, Bank of India has 56 foreign offices, while Bank of Baroda has 104 global offices.

Samsung Electronics chases curved smartphone...Samsung Electronics chases curved smartphone wave to beat flat-screen crowd

On sale in South Korea since late October for close to $1,000, and also on sale in Japan, the Note Edge is soon to debut in the United States. 
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
SEOUL: Samsung Electronics Co Ltd aims to restore its crumbling lead in the global smartphone industry in part by ramping up high-end devices with curved screens full of advanced technology that's tough for rivals to replicate.
Yet as the South Korean giant seeks to make devices like the rigid-curve Galaxy Note Edge stand out from a crowd of flat, big-screen handsets, making money will depend on producing them cost-effectively and coaxing developers to tailor applications for the new format.
Samsung Electronics is headed for its worst annual profit in three years, under siege as Chinese firms like Xiaomi Technology Co and Lenovo Group Ltd reel in buyers with full-function touch-screen smartphones that are cheaper. Only Apple Inc has maintained full brand premium.
The collective industry move towards larger screens makes distinctive designs tougher to achieve, said Kim Nam-su, a senior Samsung Electronics designer and an architect of the Note Edge. "A change in the platform can bring about a variety of new considerations...I think a curved screen is a big solution for overcoming those challenges," he said.
As Samsung Electronics moves towards what analysts say could be a nearly one-third drop in operating profit this year, it's launching more mid-tier phones to counter cheaper rivals. But a high-tech edge for the premium market could also help it compete in an industry that international research firm CCS Insight sees growing to $331 billion by 2018 from $289 billion this year.
The Note Edge is not the first device to use a non-flat format. But the curved edge on the device is designed to be more than just a gimmick, offering shortcuts to apps, as well as customisation to display message notifications or stream headlines independent of the main screen.
RIGID CURVE
On sale in South Korea since late October for close to $1,000, and also on sale in Japan, the Note Edge is soon to debut in the United States. It has been well reviewed in the technology press, a departure from recent knocks that Samsung Electronics goods didn't stand out against the competition.
While the Note Edge's rigid curve sets it apart, in the premium handset market its rivals include devices like Apple's iPhone 6 Plus, LG Electronics Inc's G3 and HTC Corp's One M8 handsets.
Subsidiary Samsung Display Co and its rival LG Display Co Ltd are so far the only firms that can mass-produce the flexible displays needed to make curved smartphones, having invested more in developing the organic light-emitting diode technology used to manufacture them. Analysts say that investment lead will make it difficult for rivals to produce imitations quickly.
Samsung Electronics declined to give early sales figures or expected profit margins for the Note Edge, but the specialist screen technology required means the curved display is difficult to make and likely more expensive - something the firm needs to address. The Note Edge retails in South Korea for about $100 more than the company's flat-screen counterpart, the Note 4.
In addition, technology for other parts like batteries, circuit boards and touch-screen layers need to advance further to keep pace with radical screen designs. In a vicious cycle, per-unit costs will remain comparatively high until and unless components reach mass production.
"For future devices where concept designs include tightly rollable devices with a very small radius of curvature, every major component will need to be redesigned to fit into a package form factor that can withstand a high degree of flexing," said Strategy Analytics analyst Stuart Robinson.
Beyond hardware, the challenge for Samsung Electronics in making curved products must-have gadgets, rather than a gimmick,
is to convince potential buyers that they can do things on a curved gadget more easily and effectively than on a flat screen.
To do that, it must foster the development of applications offering users something new that makes a virtue of the differentiated screen curvature - and convince developers to invest in what remains a niche product for now.
"Every time the mobile phone industry has seen disruption is when the input or interaction experience has changed," said Counterpoint analyst Neil Shah. "Maybe now Samsung with bent, or flex displays could develop a new way of interaction with mobile devices, pushing an ecosystem around that."

Fadnavis govt. has lost people s trust: Senastate politics
Those who used "corrupt" means to reach the power centre should not claim "clean governance," it said.
A day after the first ever BJP-led minority Government in Maharashtra managed to sail through the trust vote by a controversial voice vote, the Shiv Sena said on Thursday that the Devendra Fadnavis Government has lost the trust of the people, though they won the "trust vote" in the Maharashtra Assembly,.
The Sena, which spelt out its view on the events inside and outside the Assembly, however continues to be ambiguous over its lone Minister in the Narendra Modi Government as well as its alliance with the BJP in the Mumbai municipal body and some other such civic bodies in other parts of the State.
An editorial in the party’s mouth-piece Saamna said, “Can those who win trust vote by sidelining the traditions of the House, win the trust of people? No matter how confidently you claim your victory, you have lost the moral right to govern this State.
Those who used the "corrupt" to reach the power centre should not claim "clean governance." Forget us, even the people of this State will not accept this trust vote that was won on voice vote,” it commented.
The manner in which the newly-elected Assembly Speaker Haribhau Bagade commended the trust vote motion for consideration of the House has been severely criticised by the Sena and the Congress.
'Rules flouted'
They have charged the Speaker of flouting the rules by ignoring persistent pleas of the Sena and the Congress for a ballot voting. However, the Speaker and the BJP have maintained that all rules were followed and the party would have won the confidence motion even after voting.
Since the BJP was short of 22 members for the simple majority, State Governor C. Vidyasagar Rao, while accepting the party’s stake to form a government had asked the Chief Minister to prove his majority on the floor of the Assembly before November 14.
'Opportunist move'
The NCP, with 41 MLAs, had announced its unilateral support to the BJP. NCP’s support to the BJP has been criticised as an opportunist move to save its leaders from several alleged corruption cases. The BJP has neither accepted nor rejected the NCP support.
The editorial questioned the need to bypass the ballot voting and clearing the confidence motion by voice vote. “Did you choose the voice vote, only to keep the support of ‘corrupt’ people under wraps? Were you not confident about your majority? Why couldn’t you show your clear majority on paper? Why was our demand of ballot voting sidelined?” it questioned.
It is not yet evident if the Sena wants to completely sever its ties with the BJP even after all the chargers and counter-charges on the events leading to the trust vote.
To completely break free, the Sena would be required not only to ask its representative in the Narendra Modi Government, Anant Geete, to quit, but also end its alliance with the BJP without whose support it would lose its majority in the cash-rich Mumbai municipality and several other municipalities it governs.

Peace clause  helps US  India end feud over WTO talksIndia, US settle row over food security
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, November 13, 2014
First Published: 11:24 IST(13/11/2014) | Last Updated: 08:26 IST(14/11/2014)

India and the United States scripted a compromise formula on food subsidies on Thursday, paving the way to remove a major irritant in the stalled World Trade Organization (WTO) deal on easing of customs rules.
As part of a revised proposal, India and the US have agreed for an indefinite “peace clause” on food security until a permanent solution is found, marking a major success for the Narendra Modi government in global trade talks withstanding mounting diplomatic pressure from developed countries.
A “peace clause” gives legal security to member countries and protects them from being challenged under other WTO agreements.
HT first reported on September 22 the possibility the of breakthrough during Prime Minister Modi’s visit to the US when he discussed the issue with President Barack Obama.
Developed nations have shown support for a “peace clause” that would agree to developing countries’ demands on food security for a period of four years.
India, however, was pressing for a guarantee for further exemption until a permanent solution is negotiated and to find a way to allow countries the right to provide higher levels of subsidies for their poor beyond these four years.
India had made it clear that state-funded welfare schemes for the poor were non-negotiable even as it took the blame for blocking the TFA in July, as it did not come bundled with a roadmap for rules on food subsidies. (AFP Photo)
The latest move will likely help WTO members ratify the so-called trade facilitation agreement (TFA) to make trade easier, faster and cheaper by making systems transparent and reducing red tape.
In July, India had withstood mounting pressure from the developed countries including the US, which had blamed New Delhi’s hard bargain strategy for the eventual collapse of the talks putting the WTO’s future in “uncertain ground.”
India had made it clear that state-funded welfare schemes for the poor were non-negotiable even as it took the blame for blocking the TFA in July, as it did not come bundled with a roadmap for rules on food subsidies.
"The United States and India reached agreement today (Thursday) on a set of measures intended to break the impasse in the work of the World Trade Organization (WTO) to implement the agreements reached last December," said a US government statement.
The two countries agreed that India's food security programmes would not be challenged under WTO rules "until a permanent solution regarding this issue has been agreed and adopted," it said.
India's commerce minister Nirmala Sitharaman tweeted that India and the US had "successfully resolved their impasse over food security issues in #WTO".
"WTO General Council will receive India's proposal and US will support us," she said.
Even after Modi's talks with Obama in September, India, however, held the view that without a permanent solution on food subsidies, public stockholding programmes such as buffer stock of food-grains will be hampered.
Existing rules cap the value of food subsidies at 10% of the value of production. But, the way the support is calculated at prices of more nearly three decades earlier means many countries would find it difficult to stay within the limit potentially attracting strong penalties from the trade body.
This will affect India’s food security programme and food grain procurement through the minimum support prices (MSP).
Bali package
New Delhi's decision in July to hold up the TFA to reduce trade barriers came after the WTO's members agreed at a December, 2013, meeting in the Indonesian island of Bali to implement the pact.
At the time of the Bali accord, WTO members agreed on a four-year "peace clause" to protect India from being punished over subsidies and stockpiles until a "permanent" solution" was reached. The agreement was due to take effect in mid-2015.
But after the Bali pact, Indian officials complained there were nearly two dozen meetings on the trade facilitation pact and just a handful on subsidies.
Bali was the first multilateral agreement concluded by the WTO since its inception in 1995.
It also signalled the first concrete progress on the Doha Round of trade liberalisation talks, launched in 2001 and aimed at underpinning development in poorer nations.
It took nearly a decade to conclude the trade facilitation part of the talks, which began in 2004.
"The agreement announced today (Thursday) between the US and India paves the way for full implementation of the WTO's Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA)...The agreement also reflects shared understandings regarding the WTO's work on food security," US Trade Representative Michael Froman said in a statement.
   
"We now look forward to working with all WTO members and with Director-General Roberto Azevedo to reach a consensus that enables full implementation of all elements of the landmark Bali Package, including the TFA," he added.

J-K Machil fake encounter: Seven armymen sentenced to lifeComments
A military court sentenced five soldiers, including two officers, to life imprisonment on Thursday for the staged killing of three Kashmiri civilians and passing it off as an anti-militancy operation in Jammu and Kashmir's Machil sector in 2010.
It is a rare case of soldiers being punished in Kashmir where the army is an object of hate and the target of frequent protests because of the controversial Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA), which gives it sweeping powers to search, arrest and shoot people.
The verdict, hailed by political parties in Kashmir but dismissed by some separatists as a political move with an eye on assembly elections, comes at a time when the army is under fire in the Valley for killing two Kashmiri boys mistaken for terrorists.
The men were allegedly lured by a former special police officer and his accomplices to Machil on the pretext of offering a job. They were later handed over to the army for Rs. 50,000 each and shot dead by troops in a staged encounter near the border with Pakistan on April 29, 2010. The army described them as Pakistani militants trying to sneak in from the Machil sector along the Line of Control. Their bodies were exhumed on May 28, 2010.
The controversial Machil killings triggered widespread protests and bloodshed in the Kashmir Valley in which 113 people were killed. They also led to calls for scrapping the contentious AFSPA, which the army says is necessary for battling militancy in the state.
Chief minister Omar Abdullah welcomed the sentencing and called it a "watershed moment" in Kashmir's history.
"This is a watershed moment. No one in Kashmir ever believed that justice would be done in such cases. Faith in institutions disappeared. I hope that we never see such #Machil fake encounter type of incidents ever again and let this serve as a warning to those tempted to try," Abdullah tweeted.
The soldiers found guilty and recommended for life term are the commanding officer of 4 Rajput Regiment, the unit involved in the encounter, Colonel Dinesh Pathania, Captain Upendra, Havildar Devinder and Lance Naiks Arun Kumar and Lakhmi. All services benefits of the soldiers have also been suspended.
"The process is still not completed as the confirmation of the sentence is yet to be done by appropriate authority (Northern Army commander)," said an army officer in Delhi.
Court martial proceedings were ordered against six soldiers in December 2013; they ended in September this year. One of them was not found guilty. HT reported on December 26, 2013 that if convicted, the accused could get life imprisonment.
Kashmiri separatists said the verdict was a good beginning if it is followed by justice in similar rights abuse cases.
"It's very positive. We welcome it but the real test lies if justice is done in other cases like Gaw Kadal and Hawal massacres that left more than 100 dead. It's good to make troops accountable," moderate Hurriyat leader Mirwaiz Umar Farooq told HT.
But some Kashmiri separatists said the sentence was a political move aimed at assembly elections in the state as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is hoping to expand its support to the Muslim-dominated Valley where it has no base.
"The elections are round the corner. There is political design in the sudden army magnanimity. India was never serious in delivering justice in Kashmir. Then it should do justice in hundreds of other such cases. The biggest justice is granting the right of self-determination to people," said Hurriyat chairman Syed Ali Geelani.

Surgeon held for Chhattisgarh sterilisation deaths  claims innocenceComments
Chhattisgarh police on Thursday arrested the surgeon whose botched sterilisations claimed the lives of 13 women in Bilaspur earlier this week, and will produce him in a court later in the day.

Dr RK Gupta was on the run since the first deaths were reported and an FIR was lodged against him on Tuesday.
The 59-year old surgeon, who was honoured by the Chhattisgarh government on January 26 this year for accomplishing a massive target on mass sterilisation in the state-run campaign, was detained at Baloda Bazar, about 70 km from Bilaspur. 
"He has been arrested today (Thursday) after he was detained in Baloda Bazar district. He will be produced before the court soon," Bilaspur inspector general of police Pawan Deo told HT, adding more arrests are likely to follow. 
Following his arrest, the surgeon told reporters he has been made a scapegoat.
"I am innocent. The health of the women deteriorated owing to the sub-standard drugs prescribed to them following the sterilisation surgery," he claimed.
Gupta, who had operated upon 83 women in six hours last Saturday at the Sakri health camp in Bilaspur (which would mean that he spent just two minutes per tubectomy), was suspended on Tuesday by the state government.
While eight women died on Monday, three on Tuesday and one on Wednesday and at least two dozen others are being treated in various hospitals.
During the campaign even women of primitive tribes, whose sterilisation is banned by the government, were reportedly "coerced" to attend such camps.
Twenty-four-year old Chaiti Bai, a member of Baiga community, died late on Wednesday evening following the botched laparoscopic tubectomy in the camp at Guarela-Pendra in Bilaspur.
Bilaspur commissioner Sonmoni Borah confirmed to HT there were two Baiga women among the 16 who were rushed to Bilaspur from Guarela-Pendra for immediate medical treatment after they underwent sterilisation operation.
Amid reports that rusted equipment were used in the surgeries, a team of doctors from Delhi's premier AIIMS hospital is in Bilaspur to investigate into the incident.
The state government also banned the sale of four medicines which were given to the women after the sterilisation at different camps in Bilaspur on Wednesday. The drugs have been sent to a Kolkata laboratary for tests and analysis.
In the wake of the deaths and the subsequent protests, the Chhattisgarh government has decided to institute a judicial probe into it.
During his visit to Bilaspur to meet the ailing women patients, chief minister Dr Raman Singh declared that judicial commission will inquire into the botched-up sterilisation deaths.
“Instead of any departmental inquiry I have decided for a judicial probe that will thoroughly investigate into every aspect," he said. This was his second visit to Bilaspur after the reports on deaths emerged following the sterilisation in the state-run camp.

Maharashtra assembly: Can BJP govt survive without Shiv SenaComments
Although chief minister Devendra Fadnavis' minority government passed its first test on the floor of the state Assembly through a controversial voice vote, the question on everyone's mind is whether the BJP will be able to hold on to its seat for the next five years.
Political analysts and sources within the party admit that the current scenario, where the NCPfs support is "issue-based", cannot last for the entire tenure.
With former ally Shiv Sena now positioned as the main Opposition party, the fate of the saffron alliance in the country's richest civic corporation, Mumbai, and the Sena's role in the NDA government are uncertain.
"It's obvious that the Delhi leadership has a plan, otherwise we wouldn't have taken such a huge risk. We are not fools to depend on the NCP. In the next six months, we will get several other legislators on board. It will not be difficult to get them elected on our party ticket," said a senior BJP leader, requesting anonymity.

He, however, said the rapprochement with Sena was still not a closed chapter. A section within the state BJP, including CM Fadnavis, want to join hands with the Sena instead of the NCP. A group within the Sena - including some of Uddhav Thackeray's close aides - are also hopeful of becoming part of the government.
Analysts, however, feel that Operation Lotus - breaking legislators from other parties and getting them re-elected on BJP symbol - as it had been dubbed in Karnataka, may not work in Maharashtra.
"In Maharashtra, there are five parties in the fray. It's not going to be easy to get 10 legislators re-elected. Logically, a mid-term election after one year is a strong possibility. Accepting the NCP as an ally will hit the BJP and PM Narendra Modi's image," said Prakash Bal, a political analyst.
But, at present, the BJP has little choice but to accept the NCP's support. Sharad Pawar's party with its 41 legislators will play an important role in getting important legislations such as the right to services bill, finance bills, Lokayukta amendment cleared in the state legislature in the next few sessions.
The NCP’s role will be more important in the Legislative Council with its 28 MLCs, where BJP (11 MLCs) cannot clear bills on its own strength. Many things now depend on the Sena. If Thackeray takes a confrontational stance and ensures the Opposition has an edge, BJP’s troubles will increase.
“If Thackeray continues to be indecisive, then Sena will be led down the garden path by the BJP. But if the BJP has to be forced to prove its numbers, then Uddhav will have to get aggressive,” said Bal.
The suspension of five Congress legislators for the next two years will also benefit the BJP, as it has brought down the numbers it needs for the next no confidence motion from 145 to 140.

Auto Sales Rise as Americans Keep on Truckin
We want to develop into a much bigger business in India: DKSH CEOSuprotip Ghosh      Follow @suprotip    Last Updated: November 17, 2014  | 12:09 IST
Joerg Wolle, President & CEO of DKSH Holding
Q- What kind of a market expansion services company is DKSH?
A- We help a diversity of company types to enter markets, typically those with comparatively higher entry barriers. Once we have established a presence for the products concerned, our next task is to expand market shares. DKSH is almost 150 years old, and has a unique tradition in Asia. Next year, we will hold our anniversary celebration in Yokohama, Japan. In fact, we are the oldest foreign company in Japan. DKSH stands for Diethelm Keller Siber Hegner, which are the family names of the young business pioneers who left Switzerland 150 years ago to seek their fortunes overseas. In 2002, i.e. 12 years ago, we merged these three original Swiss trading companies into one Group. Interestingly, none of those early Swiss nationals chose to venture into India because of the particular relationship between the British and India of that period.
The traditional trading house model of just being a middleman who buys here and sells there, simply has no sustainable future. We don't actually manufacture ourselves. Our mandate is to support our clients, who are product manufacturers by adding value to the whole sales process, and to sell those products on to our customers in various countries across Asia. Consequently, 'Market Expansion Services' are essentially branded as business services, covering the entire value chain. Take for example pharmaceutical companies. Their core competence is research and development to generate product innovation. Those activities and global marketing they undertake themselves. Sometimes, they choose to outsource manufacturing. By contrast, local market knowledge, such as handling of their products throughout an entire nation…... that is often not among their core competencies. Those vital skills they outsource to companies like ours. That is our definition of Market Expansion Services: Helping manufacturers and entrepreneurs to enter markets. And, once they have established a presence, we build their market shares in those countries for them. Obviously, we work with some companies who are new to certain Asian countries. On the other hand, we've also been working with other companies for over 50-60 years, consistently strengthening their position in the respective country involved.
Q- How do you do this?
A - The process usually begins with an assessment of the target market. We consider that market in the context of the products that our clients are offering, and match them to suit local requirements. The logic here is that what is good for America is not necessarily good for Vietnam, because the target customers and their particular needs are likely to be completely different. Next, we look at the business model, the products and the overall offering. We also brief our clients on what their competitors are doing and what the market trends are. Another key service is that we will then help them register their products. In the pharmaceuticals sector , this can take a very long time, sometimes even years. It is essential to comply with local regulations in each country. Once the products are registered, and ready for sale, we often take over those products from the logistics specialists who dispatch them by sea or air. We integrate these products into our own distribution centres, where we group them with related products and deliver them through our local field sales force. We sell to supermarkets, mom & pop shops, restaurants, bars - this is what we call capillary distribution. So, taking a country like Thailand, Market Expansion Services are not just delivering to a supermarket in Bangkok but also being capable of delivering to more remote areas known locally as "upcountry", all the way to the last beach bar in Koh Samui. All these activities are individual steps in what we call the value chain. Moreover, we also handle marketing or regulatory affairs.
Q- But there are marketing companies for MNCs who do this globally.
A- DKSH excels in local knowledge. We are the specialists for localized sales and marketing, physical distribution and also money collection. If you look at Roche or Novartis, in Malaysia for example, they have only one customer that pays them, which is us. We also do the money collection from all the doctors, hospitals, pharmacies, nurses' homes which we have selected. These are all dedicated value-added steps needed before the product reaches the end consumer.
Q- Are you de-risking their businesses?
A- Yes, we definitely de-risk their business, as we ensure the integrity of their value chain. Clients, if they just work with big wholesalers, and not professional Market Expansion Services specialists like us, don't have the entire value chain covered. The wholesaler buys from the client, who subsequently has no idea about what happens to his products next. For instance, if products are close to their expiry date, we ensure that those products are being moved off the supermarket shelf. In such cases we collect them, bring them back to our distribution centres, and destroy them. This is what we call reverse logistics, i.e. a carefully designed procedure guaranteeing that the end-customer does not end up with expired or contaminated products. So, apart from protecting consumers, we are relieving our clients of risk. We are providing these services at least at the same level, but at a better cost/risk ratio than the big multinationals themselves. These are the incentives that facilitate their decisions to outsource these services to us.
Q- What is your strategy in India?
A- The company is currently very much focused on our traditional Asian markets, mainly Southeast Asia - the ASEAN countries , plus Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Japan. Essentially, our focus is on four different business sectors: Consumer Goods, Healthcare, Performance Materials and Technology. With these four business units, we are active in 35 different countries. In terms of India, our presence here is still comparatively recent. We started out here 25 years ago with sourcing. At the time, we had a group of 20 specialists, who were sourcing ingredients and raw materials for the chemical, pharmaceutical, food and personal care industries which we exported from India and marketed in Europe, Japan and the rest of Asia. Five years ago, we were able to make a highly promising acquisition from the Tata Group. They were splitting off their chemical distribution unit, Voltas chemical trading, and we acquired those operations. That move added to the already successful sourcing and distribution businesses. And these operations have developed extremely well, resulting in our opening of different innovation centres. As I mentioned before, at DKSH we are not just about sales. We are always looking to enhance the entire value chain for our clients, while also thinking about how we can make life easier for our customers too. Our aim in India is very clearly to expand our existing businesses. We will not enter the consumer goods and healthcare distribution  sectors, at least not for the time being, owing to the sheer size of the country. Consequently, we will not be building up a capillary distribution network in this market.
Q- So, it is mostly sourcing?
A- Well, we started out with sourcing, but that isn't everything. While we are not necessarily experts on how to make good paint for, say, Indian cars, we are experts at on how to make good paint 'stick' to the car bodywork. We're active in specialty ingredients, not commodities. Such ingredients must fulfil the highest quality standards. By insisting on this aspect, we are helping our customers to raise the quality of their products and become more competitive.
Q- What are the trends like in India at this point? Do you see a way how you are going to do business in this country?
A- Yes, definitely. I am a fan of India, and always have been. Earlier, everybody was excited about the country and then you come in and are surprised by the bureaucracy, and it took us slightly longer than we expected to find the opportunities. [But] our personal experience is positive. But that's not all. We are also convincing our suppliers to come to India. They are forming an image of the positive points of this market: a huge amount of potential customers, a democratic system. Primarily, I am interested in doing business, but I can tell you now as a fan of India, the last few of months have been like a miracle from a political perspective. There's a whole different look about India in the world today. Your current prime minister [Narendra Modi] has done a great deal - he visited Japan and the US, opened the market to foreign investors. Rightly so, everybody's excited about it. The current political trend will help our business, which had already developed positively. We are positive and it is clearly our intention to develop steadily, but in solid steps, a bigger business in India.
Q- What are your plans over the next two to three years?
A- On a global level, we will grow organically. Today, we have thousands of customers and clients. We operate a solid network of more than 700 business locations across Asia across Asia.  Our business is growing very well.
Q- Continuing on the trends you see in India...
A- There is another trend that is becoming quite important in India today. Traditionally, you didn't have these huge trading conglomerates like in other parts of Asia. With India now coming increasingly onto the international radar screen, where people can be trusted and where it is worthwhile to invest, more and more multinational companies are taking a more serious look at India. Multinationals in particular, but also smaller family companies ideally want to deal with one particular Market Expansion Services specialist. Why? Because it is easier to deal with just one partner who you know and is trustworthy. Many clients work with us first in one country, first, then expand the business relationship to other Asian markets - so why not in India too?
I believe that life is becoming harder for the local distributors who are not active beyond India. And on our side, opportunities arise, because we can add India to our portfolio of Asian countries we are already dealing with. So, not only is DKSH growing organically, we are planning what we call smaller bolt-on acquisitions on a Group-wide basis.
Q- What is in it for Indian companies?
A- Indian companies are gaining more opportunities to export their products. If you look at Asia, there are three growth drivers. The first and most important are the middle classes that are expanding rapidly.
The second growth driver is the so-called growing inner-Asian trade. Many Asian countries have successfully developed from being a former "extended workbench" of the Western industries. They used to produce products for export to America or to Europe. They have evolved beyond that stage now, and are developing into very interesting domestic economies which are engaging in trade between themselves. A particularly good example is the ASEAN countries, with a population exceeding 650 million, with some of those countries boasting very high living standards nowadays.
The third growth driver, and a particularly positive one for us and the clients we help, is the trend towards increased outsourcing. With a three-year view on our markets, the Market Expansion Services industry in Asia will grow at an average 6.8 per cent, plus one per cent from increased outsourcing services per year up to 2018.

World Chess Championship game 2:  Whiz kid  Magnus Carlsen draws first blood  beats Viswanathan Anandprint
Defending champion Magnus Carlsen outplayed Viswanathan Anand on Sunday in 35 moves in the second game of the World Chess Championship being held at Sochi.
23-year-old Carlsen started with white and tore down Anand's Berlin defence by swinging the game first to queen's side and from there on to the king's side.
Carlsen opened with the Ruy Lopez line with e4 to which Anand replied with e5.
On the seventh move, the champion went in for an early trading of his white bishop for black's queen side knight, in the process disturbed Anand's pawn structure.
Game board
Here is the game board at the end of game 2. You can press the arrow buttons and play the game from scratch.
On move 11, Carlsen played a4 with an intention of creating a weak queen rook pawn for Anand. Undeterred Anand played a5 which in turn opened up the files for his two bishops.
In his next move, Carlsen traded his knight for Anand's black bishop. This shifted the play to the centre of the board.
He then brought his queen side rook into play moving it a3 to be ready for an attack. At this position, all his pieces were ready for action with the field clear for forward movement and ready for a long grind.
My engine says equal, but I would be starting to get nervous with all these pieces heading in the direction of my king #CarlsenAnand — Nigel Short (@nigelshortchess) November 9, 2014
Though there was no major threat for Anand's king, the piece mobilisation was a psychological attack.
At the end of the 22nd move, both players had two rooks, queen and seven pawns.
By this time, Carlsen had moved in to an active position, while Anand seemed to have lost the plot.
Somehow the attack paid off. A serious risk free pressure for Magnus now.. So far he is clearly dictating the terms. #CarlsenAnand — Anish Giri (@anishgiri) November 9, 2014
Anand, more popular of the two on social media, managed to achieve a tangible position but made a blunder in the end with h5, allowing Carlsen to take his queen to b7.
Along with his rook on e7, Anand decided to call it quits.
On Anand's blunder, Carlsen said he had to double check whether his queen's move was actually a winning one.
"It is a pity I threw it away," Anand said.
"Vishy self destructed today. I think he created a big hole for himself and it is nearly impossible to get out of," Susan Polgar, a four-time women's World chess champion, told IANS.
Just as in Chennai, I think Anand should have added a strategist on his team. His problem isn't in the openings but psychology #CarlsenAnand — Susan Polgar (@SusanPolgar) November 9, 2014
With his first victory as early as in the second tie of the 12-game match, Carlsen now leads the series by 1.5-0.5. Team Anand will now have to think of something out-of-the-box to contain the Carlsen juggernaut.

Samsung Fires Back at Nvidia With Chip Patents Lawsuit
Reuters | Updated On: November 12, 2014 08:49 (IST)
Buying Iron Ore for First Time in History, Says Tata Steel
San Francisco: Samsung Electronics Co Ltd has accused Nvidia Corp of infringing several of its semiconductor-related patents and for making false claims about its products, counter-suing after Nvidia filed a lawsuit against the Korean company in September.
Samsung, which filed its lawsuit on Monday, is seeking damages for deliberate infringement of several technical patents, including a few that govern the way semiconductors buffer and use data.
The Asian electronics company also accuses Nvidia of false advertising when it says its "Shield" tablet sports the world's fastest mobile processor, the Tegra. Samsung cites benchmarking studies performed by researchers at Primate Labs as proving that claim false.
Samsung's lawsuit, filed on Monday, came after Nvidia accused the Asian company and rival Qualcomm Inc of infringing patents on its graphics-processing unit (GPU).
"We'll review and respond to these new claims against us, and look forward to presenting our case on how Nvidia GPU patents are being used without a license," Nvidia said in a statement on Tuesday.
Nvidia also pointed to a benchmarking study that supported its claim that the Tegra was the fastest mobile processor on the market.

San Francisco: Yahoo Inc will pay about $640 million for automated advertising service BrightRoll, beefing up its ability to sell video ads in real-time to marketers.
The acquisition sustains chief executive officer Marissa Mayer's acquisition spree and sharpens the company's focus on video ads, which it hopes can offset declining Internet ad prices and decelerating growth.
Buying BrightRoll, which is profitable and expected to have revenues of more than $100 million this year, will make Yahoo's video advertising platform the largest in the United States, the company said in a statement on Tuesday.

Making Cars Safer: Have The Driver Do LessGovernment May Make PAN Must for Registering Charitable Trusts
Singapore: As millions of cars are under recall for potentially lethal air bags, designers are trying to reduce the need for the device - using sensors, radar, cameras and lasers to prevent collisions in the first place.
With driver error blamed for over 90 per cent of road accidents, the thinking is it would be better to have them do less of the driving. The US-based Insurance Institute for Highway Safety found that forward-collision warning systems cut vehicle-to-vehicle crashes by 7 per cent - not a quantum leap, but a potential life saver. Nearly 31,000 people died in car accidents in 2012 in the United States alone.
"Passive safety features will stay important, and we need them. The next level is now visible. Autonomous driving for us is clearly a strategy to realise our vision for accident-free driving," said Thomas Weber, global R&D head at Mercedes-Benz.
While giving a computer full control of a car is some way off, there's a lot it can do in the meantime.
For now, in some cars you can take your foot off the pedal and hands off the wheel in slow-moving traffic, and the car will keep pace with the vehicle in front; it can jolt you awake if it senses you're nodding off; alert you if you're crossing into another lane; and brake automatically if you don't react to warnings of a hazard ahead.
How close this all comes to leaving the driver out of the equation was illustrated by an experiment at Daimler last year: adding just a few off-the-shelf components to an S-class Mercedes, a team went on a 100 km (62 mile) ride in Germany without human intervention. "The project was about showing how far you can go, not just with fancy lasers, but with stuff you can buy off the shelf," said David Pfeiffer, one of the team.
Such features, however, require solving thorny problems, including how to avoid pedestrians.
While in-car cameras are good at identifying and classifying objects, they don't work so well in fog or at night. Radar, on the other hand, can calculate the speed, distance and direction of objects, and works well in limited light, but can't tell between a pedestrian and a pole. While traffic signs are stationary and similar in shape, people are often neither.
For a better fix on direction there's LiDAR - a combination of light and radar - which creates a picture of objects using lasers. Velodyne's sensors on Google's autonomous car, for example, use up to 64 laser beams spinning 20 times per second to create a 360-degree, 3D view of up to several hundred metres around the car.
Mercedes' 'Stop-and-Go Pilot' feature matches the speed of the car in front in slow traffic and adjusts steering to stay in lane using two ultrasonic detectors, five cameras and six radar sensors. "This technology is a first major step," said R&D chief Weber. "(However distracted the driver is), the system mitigates any accident risk in front."
The next stage, experts say, is a road network which talks to cars, and where cars talk to other cars. General Motors has said its 2017 Cadillac CTS will transmit and receive location, direction and speed data with oncoming vehicles via a version of Wi-Fi.
Other approaches include using cameras to monitor the driver. Abdelaziz Khiat, at Nissan Motor's research centre in Japan, uses cameras to track the driver's face to detect yawns, a drooping head suggesting drowsiness, or frowns that may indicate the onset of road rage.
These advanced safety features are fine - if you can afford them. The Insurance Institute survey found that the forward collision warning systems were available in fewer than one in every 20 registered vehicles in 2012.
In key markets across emerging Asia, says Klaus Landhaeusser, regional head of government relations at Bosch, many first-time car buyers don't want to spend more than $2,500. For that, he said, "you won't be able to introduce any safety features."
Road conditions are also key. "It will be a long time before we have software and algorithms that can see everything happening" on the roads in emerging markets, said Henrik Kaar, at auto safety equipment market leader Autoliv Inc.
And not everyone welcomes this progress. Some drivers complain the technology is intrusive, or is inconsistent. "If a safety feature is seen as intrusive or bothersome, a driver may try to circumvent or disable it," said Chris Hayes, a vice president at insurer Travelers.
The key appears to be ensuring that while humans remain in charge of the vehicle, they have good information and features that correct the errors they make.
"For a long time, people thought it was an all-or-nothing jump between humans in charge and fully autonomous vehicles," said Michael James, senior research scientist at Toyota Motor's U.S. technical centre. "I don't think that's the case anymore. People see it as a more gradual transition."

Regulators Fine Global Banks $3.4 Billion in Forex ProbeYou are here: Home Global Economy
Regulators Fine Global Banks $3.4 Billion in Forex Probe
Reuters | Updated On: November 12, 2014 14:43 (IST)
ECB Leaves Cost of Borrowing Unchanged
London/Zurich: Global regulators imposed penalties totalling $3.4 billion on five major banks, including UBS, HSBC and Citigroup on Wednesday for failing to stop their traders from trying to manipulate foreign exchange markets.
Royal Bank of Scotland and JP Morgan were also fined over attempts to rig currency benchmarks in a year-long probe that has put the largely unregulated $5 trillion-a-day market on a tighter leash, with dozens of dealers suspended or fired.
Switzerland's UBS swallowed the biggest penalty, despite being the first bank to come forward with evidence of possible misconduct, paying $661 million to Britain's Financial Services Authority (FCA) and the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).
UBS was ordered by Swiss regulator FINMA, which also said it had found serious misconduct of the bank's employees in precious metals trading, to hand over 134 million Swiss francs.
FINMA also instructed Switzerland's largest bank to automate at least 95 per cent of its global foreign exchange trading and limit bonuses for traders of foreign exchange and precious metals, where it said it had also found evidence of serious misconduct, to 200 per cent of their base salary for two years.
Other UBS high earners will have to get approval for their bonuses to go above that.
Regulators found evidence that traders had colluded to try and manipulate benchmark foreign exchange rates by sharing confidential information about client orders with one another right up until October 2013.
The traders used code names to identify clients without naming them and created online chatrooms with monikers such as "the players", "the 3 musketeers" and "1 team, 1 dream" in which to swap information.
The financial regulator in London, the global hub for foreign exchange (FX) trading, said it had launched a review of the spot FX industry that will require firms to scrutinise their systems and may involve them looking at how they do things in other markets such as derivatives and precious metals.
The FCA's first group settlement, worth more than $1.7 billion, is the biggest in British history and eclipses the 460 million pounds fines for alleged interest rate manipulation, reflecting increasing political and public demands that banks -- blamed for sparking the 2008 credit crisis -- are held accountable.
The five banks earned a 30 per cent discount for agreeing to settle early.
"Today's record fines mark the gravity of the failings we found and firms need to take responsibility for putting it right," the FCA's Chief Executive Martin Wheatley said.
"They must make sure their traders do not game the system to boost profits or leave the ethics of their conduct to compliance to worry about."
Barclays had been expected to be part of the settlement but the FCA said its investigation into the UK bank was continuing.
"Nice team work"
Investors had been braced for a speedy conclusion to the investigation after an earlier, sprawling inquiry into alleged rigging of interest rate benchmarks such as Libor gave regulators experience in how to cooperate globally.
In its settlement with HSBC, the FCA said that after attempts to manipulate one sterling/dollar currency fix that netted a $162,000 profit, traders congratulated one another, saying "nice work gents... I don my hat" and "Hooray nice team work".
Under instruction from increasingly intrusive regulators, banks did much of the groundwork themselves, handing over reams of online transcripts, clamping down on chatroom use and either suspending or firing more than 30 foreign exchange traders.
FINMA said it has started enforcement proceedings against 11 former and current employees of UBS
With the UK settlement out of the way, the focus shifts to ongoing US and UK criminal investigations and potential civil law suits.
The CFTC, which regulated swaps and futures in the United States, fined the five banks more than $1.4 billion but that does not resolve probes by the US Department of Justice and the New York's Department of Financial Services.
The FCA fines come days before world leaders are expected to sign off on proposals to reform currency markets when they meet at the G20 summit in Brisbane.
The foreign exchange probe proved particularly uncomfortable for British authorities because it cast a shadow over London's credentials as the world centre for foreign exchange trading, and also ensnared the Bank of England whose head Mark Carney is leading global regulatory efforts to overhaul the FX market.
The Bank of England said an internal probe had found no evidence that any of its officials had been involved in unlawful or improper behaviour.
The Bank has fired its chief foreign exchange dealer after it found information about serious misconduct, but said the dismissal was unrelated to a foreign exchange scandal.

Industrial production in September jumped 2.5 per cent compared to 0.4 per cent in August, government data showed on Wednesday.
A Reuters poll had predicted factory production to have increased by 0.6 per cent.
Industrial production growth as measured by IIP (Index of Industrial Production) had slowed down to a 5-month low in August, primarily due to contraction in manufacturing output and lower offtake of consumer goods.

Being Richest Great Pain  for This BillionaireBuying Iron Ore for First Time in History, Says Tata Steel
Shanghai: He may now be China's richest man but Jack Ma, the founder of e-commerce giant Alibaba, has admitted in a US television interview that being wealthy is actually causing him "great pain".
Ma has seen his fortune balloon to $19.5 billion after Alibaba's record-breaking $25 billion initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange in September, according to data compiled by Forbes magazine.
On Tuesday, the company chalked up a new record - $9.3 billion of sales conducted through its platforms during 'Singles Day', its 24-hour shopping promotion and the world's biggest online retail event.
But a successful stock listing and vast fortunes have caused him stress, Ma said in the interview.
"This month I'm not very happy - I think too much pressure," Ma told the broadcaster.
"Maybe the stock goes so up, maybe people have high expectations on you, maybe I think too much about the future and have too many things to worry about," he said.
Alibaba's share price has been on a steady uptrend since it debuted in New York two months ago. It closed at $114.54 on Tuesday, representing a nearly 70 per cent gain from its offer price of $68.
Ma said that people often tell him that being rich "is good" but admitted he found being the wealthiest man in China difficult.
"Yeah, it is good, but not the richest man in China. It's a great pain because when you're (the) richest person in the world, everybody (is) surrounding you for money," Ma said.
He said people now looked at him differently when he walked down the street, adding, "Spending money is much more difficult than making money."
His remarks echoed what he told state media in early October when he said being named China's richest man is "meaningless".
"My happiest days were when I used to earn 90 yuan ($15) a month," Ma once told state media.
He is looking at the possibility to establish a foundation to spend money "in a business way" and may even compete with US billionaire Bill Gates in the field of philanthropy, according to the news channel.
Ma was ranked as China's most generous person after he donated a 1.4 per cent stake in his firm to set up a charity focused on the environment, health care and education, according to a survey by wealth publisher Hurun in late October.

Wal-Mart to stagger its Black Friday dealsBy Sarah Halzack November 12 Follow @sarahhalzack

Wal-Mart will slowly open the spigot on its Black Friday deals this year instead of flooding customers with them all at once, a strategy that reflects consumers’ changing holiday shopping behavior.
The nation’s largest retailer will launch its first round of in-store Black Friday deals at 6 p.m. on Thanksgiving Day. That set of deals will have an emphasis on toys, home goods, movies and video games. Later, at 8 p.m., Wal-Mart will kick off its major electronics sales, which is to include small items such as Fitbit wristbands and bigger ones such as Samsung Smart high definition televisions. And for shoppers who prefer not to venture out on the Thanksgiving holiday, still more deals will kick in Friday at 6 a.m., when the retailer will offer 30 percent off some Samsung televisions and toys from Fisher Price and Monster High.
Wal-Mart says the rolling deals are designed to accommodate what it has heard from consumers about when they want to shop during the holiday weekend.
“Black Friday is no longer about waking up at the crack of dawn to stand in long lines and hope for the best. At Walmart, it’s become a family shopping tradition where everyone shops at some point throughout the weekend,” Duncan MacNaughton, chief merchandising officer of Wal-Mart U.S., said in a statement.
Online customers will be able to start shopping Wal-Mart’s holiday sales even earlier. Hundreds of Web specials will be available on Wal-Mart’s Web site beginning at 12:01 a.m. on Thanksgiving Day.
Wal-Mart is also taking steps to try to ensure that its stores are not chaotic on this crucial holiday shopping weekend. As it has done for several years, the store will issue wristbands to shoppers who are waiting to purchase key items. The wristbands effectively hold shoppers’ places in line, so they can browse other items in the store or grab a snack instead of standing in line (or sometimes sitting in chairs they bring along). Wal-Mart had previously announced it will aim to have all of its cash registers open at peak times during the holiday shopping season to ensure speedy checkouts.
Wal-Mart was among the last of the major retailers to announce its plans for Black Friday. Many of its rivals, including Target, Sears and Macy’s, will also kick off their deals at 6 p.m. on Thanksgiving Day. Some others, including Toys R Us and Best Buy, will start their sales at 5 p.m.
Best Buy is also staggering its Black Friday deals this year. The company announced Tuesday that its first batch of deals would kick off at 5 p.m. Thanksgiving Day. More deals will launch Friday at 8 a.m.

Minority Shareholders Oppose NSEL Merger With Financial Tech: ReportBuying Iron Ore for First Time in History, Says Tata Steel
New Delhi: Some minority shareholders of Financial Technologies India Ltd (FTIL) have raised objections to the proposed merger of the scam-hit National Spot Exchange Ltd (NSEL) with the company.
To ensure faster recovery of dues for entities hit by the Rs 5,600-crore fraud at NSEL, the government last month ordered the merger of the bourse with its parent firm FTIL.
This is also the first time that the Corporate Affairs Ministry ordered a forced merger of private entities using a provision in the Companies Act that allows the government to intervene for "essential public interest".
Sources said the ministry has received objections from some minority shareholders on the proposed amalgamation.
Specific details were not immediately available.
The payment crisis at NSEL came to light in July 2013 and the decision to merge it with FTIL has been taken as the bourse is "not left with any viable, sustainable business while FTIL has necessary resources to facilitate speedy recovery of dues".
The proposal would have a final shape after taking into account submissions or objections made by the shareholders and creditors of the two companies.

Core Inflation Seen Around 5.85% in October: AnalystsIndia's core consumer price index (CPI) was estimated to have risen 5.85 percent in October from a year earlier, easing from an around 5.9 percent rise in September, according to a Reuters snap survey of four analysts on Wednesday.
Two other analysts estimated core CPI at 5.80 percent.
Data earlier showed India's headline annual consumer price inflation eased for a third consecutive month in October to 5.52 percent, its lowest level since the government started releasing the data in 2012.

Iranian Stake Hurts Indian Oil s Revival PlanBuying Iron Ore for First Time in History, Says Tata Steel
New Delhi: Indian Oil Corp (IOC), the country's biggest refiner, is exploring options including a merger to save loss-making unit Chennai Petroleum Corp (CPCL), its chairman B Ashok told Reuters on Wednesday.
CPCL's attempts to raise funds have been constrained due to a 15.4 per cent stake held in it by a unit of Iran's Naftiran Inter Trade Co Ltd (NICO). Western sanctions against Tehran due to its nuclear programme have made businesses difficult for companies with ties to Iran.
"At the moment there are certain difficulties," Mr Ashok said. "CPCL requires infusion of funds and we are looking at various options including a merger of CPCL with IOC."
CPCL has informed the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction, a government body that identifies sick firms, about a significant reduction in its net worth due to volatile oil prices and forex losses in the year ended March 31.
The company in May planned a rights issue to raise up to Rs 1000 crore ($163 million) but abandoned it after NICO said it wanted to subscribe to the shares and maintain its holding.
Sanctions have toughened monetary transactions with Iran, making it difficult for the Indian company to raise funds from the market or allow parent IOC to infuse funds.
CPCL, whose two refineries can process 230,000 barrels per day of oil and account for about 5.4 per cent of India's total capacity, could not pay dividends to NICO in 2010-11 and 2011-12 due to the sanctions, it said in its annual report.
The refiner stopped processing Iranian oil in 2012 after losing insurance for those supplies, while cover for crude imports from other countries was cut due to its ties with the Iranian firm.
ICO has initiated steps to build a 5 million-tonnes-a-year liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal at Ennore in the country's east coast by the end of 2017 or early 2018, Ashok said. The company owns a 45 per cent stake in the LNG project.
"We are talking to various parties ... we will give a stake to whoever adds value to the project," Mr Ashok said.
IOC plans to buy 0.7 million tonnes annually of LNG from the Cameron LNG plant in Lousiana where Japan's Mitsubishi has a stake. It will buy 1.2 million tonnes from Petronas' British Columbia project in which it has a 10 per cent stake.

Regulators fined six global banks about $4.3 billion in foreign exchange rate-rigging case
JPMorgan Chase, Citibank among 6 firms hit with fines for attempts to manipulate foreign exchange market
In another black eye for the financial industry, U.S., British and Swiss regulators on Wednesday fined JPMorgan Chase & Co., Citigroup, Bank of America Corp. and three other global banks a total of about $4.3 billion to settle investigations into attempted manipulation of foreign exchange rates.
The fines, including the largest ever issued by Britain's Financial Conduct Authority, are the latest multibillion-dollar hit to the industry in the wake of alleged misconduct in the 2008 financial crisis and attempts to rig major international markets.
“The setting of a benchmark rate is not simply another opportunity for banks to earn a profit," said Aitan Goelman, director of enforcement at the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

"Countless individuals and companies around the world rely on these rates to settle financial contracts, and this reliance is premised on faith in the fundamental integrity of these benchmarks," he said.
"The market only works if people have confidence that the process of setting these benchmarks is fair, not corrupted by manipulation by some of the biggest banks in the world," Goelman said.
The CFTC settlement included a total of $1.48 billion in fines: $310 million each for JPMorgan Chase Bank and Citibank; $290 million each for the Royal Bank of Scotland and UBS; and $275 million for HSBC Bank.

------------
British regulators hit the five firms with a combined $1.7 billion in fines, and the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority levied a $138-million fine against UBS.
Several hours after those fines were announced, the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said it fined JPMorgan and Citibank $350 million each and also fined Bank of America $250 million for "unsafe or unsound practices" related to their foreign exchange businesses.
The settlements end investigation into attempted manipulation of benchmark foreign exchange rates to benefit the positions of traders at the banks, regulators said.
Citigroup said Wednesday it had “acted quickly upon becoming aware of issues in our foreign exchange business" and has changed its systems and monitoring "to better guard against improper behavior."
Barclays, another global bank under investigation in the foreign exchange probe, declined to take part in the settlement. Britain's Financial Conduct Authority said it was continuing to investigate the bank.
About $5.3 trillion changes hands each day in the foreign exchange market, one of the world's largest, with about 40% of the trades taking place in London, the agency said.
From Jan. 1, 2008, until Oct. 15, 2013, "ineffective controls at the banks" allowed their traders to put the firms' financial interests ahead of clients' in the market, the Financial Conduct Authority said.

The traders shared confidential information about clients' activities and colluded with traders at other banks to manipulate foreign exchange rates.
"Traders at different banks formed tightknit groups in which information was shared about client activity, including using code names to identify clients without naming them," the FCA said. These groups were described as, for example, "'the players," “the 3 musketeers,” “1 team, 1 dream,” “a co-operative” and “the A-team," the agency said.
Some of the manipulation occurred at the same time regulators were investigating possible manipulation of another benchmark, the London interbank offered rate, also known as Libor, which helps set interest rates around the world.
“Firms could have been in no doubt, especially after Libor, that failing to take steps to tackle the consequences of a free-for-all culture on their trading floors was unacceptable," said Tracey McDermott, the Financial Conduct Authority's director of enforcement and financial crime.
"If they fail to do so, they will continue to face significant regulatory and reputational costs,” she said.
With the latest action, the CFTC said it has fined banks more than $3.34 billion since 2012 for attempted manipulation of global financial benchmarks.
London-based Barclays said Wednesday it had “engaged constructively” with regulators, including the FCA and the CFTC, and had “considered a settlement on closely similar terms to those announced the morning."
"However, after discussions with other regulators and authorities, we have concluded that it is in the interests of the company to seek a more general coordinated settlement,” the bank said.
A person familiar with the matter said Barclays was holding out because it could not reach agreement with New York’s Department of Financial Services, headed by Benjamin Lawsky, who had set tougher conditions for a settlement, including a demand to install monitors within the bank.
The New York regulator, which has jurisdiction over foreign banks charted in New York State, is probing a dozen banks in its foreign exchange probe, including Deutsche Bank.

More Steps to Rationalise Subsidies on Anvil: Arun Jaitley
New Delhi: Petrol and diesel prices are likely to be cut by close to Rs 1 per litre this weekend on the back of sliding global oil rates.
This would be the seventh reduction in petrol prices since August and the third in rates of diesel since its decontrol last month.
(Read: How diesel price deregulation impacts you )
Following their fortnightly review practice, state-owned fuel retailers Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corp (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp (HPCL) are due to revise rates of petrol and diesel on Saturday.
In all probability, rates will be reduced if the current trend of declining international oil prices continues, industry sources said.
Petrol price was last cut by Rs 2.41 a litre on November 1. On the same day, the price of diesel was also reduced by Rs 2.25 per litre. ( Read more )
Since August, petrol price has been cumulatively cut by Rs 9.36 per litre.
At present, a litre of petrol in the national capital costs Rs 64.25 a litre, while diesel costs Rs 53.35 a litre.
Diesel price was for the first time in more than five years cut on October 19, by Rs 3.37 a litre, when the government decided to deregulated the fuel. This was followed by another cut on November 1.
Prior to the October 19 reduction, diesel rates were last cut in January 2009.
Sources said oil firms revise rates of petrol, which was deregulated in June 2010, and diesel on 1st and 16th of every month based on average international oil price and rupee-US dollar exchange rate.
Brent crude fell for a third day amid signs that Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) members are reluctant to reduce supply even as prices slumped deeper into a bear market. It declined by 82 cents to $80.85 per barrel. ( Read more )
Brent has lost almost 30 per cent since its June peak amid speculation that global supply is outpacing demand.

Yasser Arafat converted to Christianity before his death  says retired U.S. pastorBy Ishaan Tharoor November 12 Follow @ishaantharoor

There are a lot of controversies surrounding the Nov. 11, 2004, death of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, but the subject of his religious faith was never one of them. That is, until now.
In an interview published this week by a British Christian Web site , R.T. Kendall, a retired American pastor and prominent Christian writer, says his efforts to convert Arafat from Islam to Christianity may have borne fruit.
"It wouldn't surprise me to see him in heaven," Kendall tells Premier Christianity  magazine."I prayed with him five times, anointed him with oil, I gave him a [salvation] prayer… I'm not saying I know that he’s saved; I'm saying I wouldn't be surprised."
Kendall claims to have struck up a relationship with Arafat in 2002, facilitated by Canon Andrew White , a prominent Anglican cleric in Baghdad and an envoy of the Archbishop of Canterbury to the Middle East. Kendall says he met Arafat five times; on the third occasion, the Palestinian leader watched Mel Gibson's film "The Passion of the Christ."
"Arafat is in tears" by the film's end, Kendall says. On subsequent visits, Kendall apparently forced the issue, believing Arafat was secretly inclined to embrace Christianity but afraid of upsetting his Palestinian supporters.
In one meeting, Kendall describes what he says to Arafat through an interpreter: "I've come today with a proposition: I want you to confess openly, tell the world, that Jesus Christ died for his sins."
Kendall went on: "If you will do that," speaking to Arafat, "first of all you'll be given a peace unlike everything you've had in your life. You'll be given wisdom, which you need. You'll then be able to encourage many Arabs that have had dreams of Jesus."
"What I'm asking you to do will take more courage than anything you've ever done: that is to say before cameras that Jesus Christ died for your sins," Kendall supposedly concluded.
At this point, according to Kendall's narration, White attempts to change the conversation. Arafat simply blows the American proselytizer a kiss, which somehow reinforces Kendall's conviction that the Palestinian leader has come over to his side.
When Arafat died in 2004, Kendall says, he received phone calls from friends who supposedly had visions corroborating Arafat's embrace of Jesus.
If this sounds highly dubious to you, that's because it probably is. There are no other accounts of such a conversion.
Indeed, the main Arafat conversion story is that of his widow, Suha Arafat, who converted to Islam when she married the Palestinian leader in 1990.
In recent years, the main intrigue that surrounds Arafat has had to do with the nature of his death in a Paris hospital. Speculation that he may have been poisoned, possibly by the Israelis, led to a series of medical investigations , most of which have concluded that he was not poisoned.
The inquiries required his corpse being exhumed and reburied in a swift six-hour procedure . For Arafat, it was no resurrection.

Essar Opens Geneva Trading Office, Expands Europe Footprint
Reuters | Updated On: November 12, 2014 22:51 (IST)
Buying Iron Ore for First Time in History, Says Tata Steel
London/New Delhi: Essar Group has set up an office in Geneva to trade crude oil, refined petroleum products, coal, iron ore and steel, the head of the new company told Reuters on Wednesday.
The entity, PeaKom SA, began operations in September and will be a global trading platform for Essar, according to chief executive Gilles Sayer.
The opening cements the company's involvement in Europe, bolstering a presence that already includes London-based traders and the 245,000 barrel per day (bpd) Stanlow refinery in the UK.
"At this stage, the company in Geneva will straddle all the commodity flows of Essar," Mr Sayer said, adding that it could grow beyond that. In an emailed statement, PeaKom said it will use its banking relationships and deal origination as a "one-stop-shop" for Essar commodities.
Raman Jaggi, group treasurer of Essar, will serve as PeaKom's chief financial officer, and Guillaume de la Ville, formerly of BNP Paribas and Gunvor, has started as head of trade finance. Tarun Naruka, Essar's former corporate finance lead and Thibaut Barthelmé, formerly of Credit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, are also working with PeaKom.
Sources said the office includes up to ten people, but Mr Sayer declined to comment on the number of staff.
The expansion of Essar's European operations indicate that it is looking to maintain a long-term presence in the region, which could be of comfort to staff at the Stanlow refinery in Britain who watched as the Milford Haven plant in Wales was shuttered last week.
Jobs at European refiners are at risk as analysts say more than 1 million barrels per day of refining capacity in Europe will close due to fierce competition from state-of-the-art refineries opening in the Middle East and Asia.
The Stanlow refinery mothballed a crude distillation unit that accounted for one third of its production capacity in September in an effort to save the plant. Its capacity dropped to around 195,000 bpd from 296,000 as a result.

Can Mitch McConnell repair the SenateBy Sarah Binder November 12
Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky: Heir apparent to Henry Clay? (Michael Reynolds/EPA)
The Senate’s incoming majority leader, Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), has pledged to return the Senate to “regular order.”  As   McConnell put it the day after the elections, “First thing I need to do is get the Senate back to normal.” What would a “normal” Senate look like, and can McConnell make it happen?
McConnell is not the first leader to bemoan the state of the Senate.  Like Democratic and Republican leaders before him (for starters, Democrats Harry Reid, Tom Daschle and George Mitchell and Republicans Bill Frist, Trent Lott and Bob Dole), McConnell now advocates a Senate that strikes a balance between debate and action, as opposed to a chamber perpetually tied in knots by the parties’ parliamentary warfare. As McConnell argued on the Senate floor last January, after admitting just a smidgen of culpability for the Senate’s sorry state of affairs, “It just can’t be the case that senators — on either side — are content with the theatrics and the messaging wars that go on here day after day.”
What would a “normal” Senate look like?  Keep in mind that there is no such thing as “regular order” in the Senate.  This is not the House with a well-scripted rulebook and majority party stacked Rules Committee that empowers a simple majority to determine floor proceedings.  In fact, “regular” order in the Senate might better be characterized as irregular order: a collegial and deliberative floor process that places few (if any) limits on debate or on the number or content of amendments.
With a crowded floor agenda, intensely competitive and polarized parties and 100 ambitious senators, truly unlimited debate and amendment are things of the past.  Indeed, as Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.)   explained late one night on the Senate floor in 2011, “I have found over the last Congress and nine months that when I try to have an open amendment process, it is a road to nowhere.” Instead, party leaders attempt to negotiate unanimous consent agreements (UCAs) to bring measures to the floor — requiring that the parties whittle down the list of amendments on which they seek floor votes.   Even these agreements often proved out of reach for Reid, who decried Republicans’ demands to offer “unending amendments that are not germane or relevant.”   When the parties balked at each other’s demands, Reid would often block all amendments (“filling the tree”) and file for cloture; when Republicans voted en masse against cloture, measures went nowhere, even in some cases when a bipartisan bill was at stake. Even informal agreements between Reid and McConnell in recent years to get the Senate back on track failed to take hold.  In one such agreement early in 2011, Reid promised to stop filling the tree if Republicans would stop filibustering the motion to call up legislative measures.  Neither happened.
McConnell has vowed to allow the Senate to debate and vote on amendments on the Senate floor, presumably waiting until senators have exhausted themselves before moving to invoke cloture (requiring 60 votes).  Coupling floor changes with an invigorated committee process (to help the Senate generate bipartisan bills) and a longer work week (aka votes on Fridays), McConnell promises a return to normalcy — no matter the political cost imposed on Republicans by casting votes on potentially divisive issues.
Repairing the Senate may be McConnell’s first order of business, and he may well have some early successes.  But for several reasons, it will also be a tall order.
First, the partisan and electoral conditions that have collided to produce the Senate’s parliamentary arms race did not disappear with the election of a Republican-controlled Senate.  As Steven Smith notes in his new book on the Senate, various tactics of obstruction have become standard fare for Senate minorities, leading majority parties to respond with procedural shortcuts — including tough limits on minority amendments.  These developments on both sides of the aisle have produced changes in the way the Senate operates, changes both parties decry.  As Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.)  argued  on the Senate floor in 2011, “If we are going to bring this place back to a place where we can legislate, both sides have to back off.”  The question for McConnell is whether his promise to restore normalcy is conditional on the cooperation of Democrats.  If Democrats adopt the tactics honed by the Senate GOP in recent years, will McConnell still keep the Senate amendment and debate floodgates open?
Second, even if Democrats restrain from aggressive obstruction of GOP priorities, McConnell will inevitably face the type of decisions that confronted Reid. For example, what if more conservative Republican senators demand floor votes on amendments that would impose punitive measures against illegal immigrants or would promote a personhood amendment to the Constitution — two amendments that might put Republicans senators up for reelection in blue states in a tough spot (particularly if they face a primary threat from the right)?  Or what if Democrats offer amendments to raise the minimum wage or address pay equity for women, amendments on which blue state Republicans could feel both electoral pressures to support and party pressures to oppose? McConnell argues that senators should be willing to cast tough votes.  Will he keep his promise if such votes could impose an electoral cost on Republicans seeking to hold their Senate majority in 2016?
Third, McConnell can try to cajole his colleagues to work on Fridays.  But it won’t be easy.  Senate leaders, as Howard Baker used to say , herd cats.  Without the consent of rank and file senators, the new majority leader’s ability to keep the Senate at work will be taxed, not least by GOP colleagues anxious to hit the presidential campaign trail.
Fourth, encouraging committees to get back to work could also prove challenging.  My hunch is that we’ll see variation across committees in their members’ abilities and incentives to secure bipartisan support for their measures.  Committee jurisdictions matter: Sen. Jeff Sessions at the helm of the Budget panel, for example, is unlikely to see eye-to-eye with Democrats (particularly if Bernie Sanders takes the ranking seat).   At Environment and Public Works, Barbara Boxer has worked on infrastructure measures successfully with Republican Jim Inhofe, but incentives to cooperate will be slim if Inhofe uses his chairmanship to wage war on the EPA.  The banking panel could find bipartisan ground on reining in big banks, but cooperation could be undermined if the panel also seeks to eliminate key features of D0dd-Frank.  More generally, resuming “regular order” in the Senate requires some underlying incentives for cooperation.  Those might be increasingly hard to come by as an election draws near.
Finally, keep in mind that the incoming leader’s parliamentary promises do not explicitly address how the Senate will handle judicial and executive nominations.  I doubt McConnell will completely shut down advice and consent.  But the question arises: Will McConnell’s promise to restore normalcy to the Senate apply equally to legislative and executive business?  And how will the new majority handle the Democrats’ nuclear move to ban nomination filibusters?  As McConnell has said, “it’s hard to unring a bell” — especially, we might add, if one’s party stands to benefit when it regains the White House.
Ultimately, like his role model, fellow Kentuckian Henry Clay, McConnell seems to understand the value of a Senate better adept at balancing debate and action — at least now that Republicans are poised to assume the majority with McConnell at the helm.  I take McConnell at his word that the Senate can and should do better and that he’s committed at least to trying to get the Senate back to work.  That said, even “the Great Compromiser” Henry Clay knew the limits of free and open Senate debate: Clay was one of the first senators to call for a majority rule Senate.  Democrats, beware!

MWAA board OKs agreement for new construction at DCABy Lori Aratani November 12 Follow @loriara

The Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority’s board of directors on Wednesday approved a new agreement that will clear the way for construction of a new commuter concourse at Reagan National Airport.
The new concourse would be part of a $1 billion building plan at National, where passenger traffic has increased dramatically over the last several years. This year, MWAA officials expect more than 20 million people to fly through the airport. Airport officials think that growth will continue in 2015. As a result of the American Airlines/USAir merger, officials estimate an additional 2.4 million passengers will fly through Reagan.
The building program is part of a larger use and lease agreement between MWAA and the airlines which use its facilities at National and Dulles International Airport. It is the first new agreement between the airlines and MWAA since 1990. The deal must still be approved by the airlines, but MWAA officials say they don’t anticipate any problems.
The new commuter concourse would be built on land currently occupied by MWAA’s executive offices on the north side of the airport. Those offices would be relocated to other space on the National campus. Construction of a concourse would mean that passengers would no longer have to deal with the hassle of being bused from their flights to the terminal. As part of the project, officials also are looking at relocating airport security screening in Terminals B/C from National Hall upstairs to the arrivals level of the airport. That shift would open up more space for passengers once they pass through security, but would close off popular eating spots such as Legal Sea Foods and Ben’s Chili Bowl to the regular public.
Airport officials believe the shift will help their bottom line. Since passengers will have cleared security before they reach National Hall, they may be more likely to shop and eat in the hall. Right now, travelers may be reluctant to linger in the area too long because they may be concerned about still having to clear security.
But moving security to the departures level raises questions about how airport officials will deal with passengers who take Metro to the airport. Currently, those passengers walk off their trains and directly into National Hall. If that area is closed off to the general public, airport officials will have to come up with a new solution for the 16 percent of passengers who choose to take Metro to the airport.
The agreement between the airport and the airlines also would allow authority officials to share revenues between National and Dulles International airports, said Jack Potter, MWAA’s president and CEO. Under the previous deal between the authority and the airlines, revenues could not be shared between airports. This could boost the fortunes of Dulles, where officials are still trying to pay for a $5 billion expansion program at a time when overall passenger traffic at the airport has declined.
Airport officials were quick to note that the building program at National is not designed to increase capacity at the airport; rather it is an effort to accommodate the growing number of fliers already using the airport. There is not timeline for when construction will begin, but in a separate vote, the board approved  a $2.5 million contract for architecture, design and engineering services related to the building project. The agreement between the airlines and MWAA also includes plans for a smaller construction program at Dulles, but much of that is for maintenance, officials said.
In other board business, this was the last meeting for D.C. representative Shirley Robinson Hall and Maryland representative Dickie Carter, whose terms expire at the end of this month. Former Rep. Tom Davis also recently stepped down from his seat on the board representing Virginia. Davis, a former Virginia congressman was appointed Rector at George Mason University.
In his report to the Dulles Corridor Committee, Charles Stark, executive director of the Silver Line rail project said construction will soon begin on the station at Dulles. In response to a question from board members, Potter said that officials expect it will take until December 2015 to complete the close-out of the first phase of the rail line, which opened July 26 .

Food Ministry Recommends Raising Edible Oil Import TaxesYou are here: Home Industries
Food Ministry Recommends Raising Edible Oil Import Taxes
Reuters | Updated On: November 13, 2014 01:06 (IST)
Government May Make PAN Must for Registering Charitable Trusts
New Delhi: Food Minister Ram Vilas Paswan has said that his ministry wants to double the import tax on crude edible oils and raise that on refined oils by 50 per cent, but is waiting for other ministries to give their views before passing its recommendation to the Cabinet.
The world's biggest vegetable oil importer levies a 2.5 per cent tax on the crude variety and 10 per cent on refined. It imports nearly 60 per cent of its 18-19 million tonnes annual demand, mostly as palm oil from top producers Indonesia and Malaysia.
An increase in import duties could hit Malaysia's palm oil futures, the regional benchmark.
"We've been getting requests for raising import duties on edible oils and my ministry has recommended increasing the duty to 5 per cent on crude oils and 15 percent on refined oils," Mr Paswan told Reuters in an interview.
Now some other ministries, including the Ministry of Commerce, have to give their views on it, he said. After that process the recommendation would go to the Cabinet for approval.
A rising population, increasing prosperity and low oilseeds output are stoking India's vegetable oil demand.
In the current year that began in November 2014, India is likely to import a record 13 million tonnes of edible oils, a leading importer said in September, up from an estimated 11.6 million tonnes, including 8 million tonnes of palm oil, in 2013-14.
Lower food inflation would make it easier for India to raise import taxes on vegetable oils, said a senior food ministry official involved in the decision-making process.
Lower vegetable prices helped bring down wholesale food inflation to a near three-year low of 3.52 per cent in September.
Separately, Mr Paswan said he expects sugar mills to soon start operations in the biggest cane producing state of Uttar Pradesh.
Hit by a sharp rise in state-fixed cane prices and falling sugar prices, mills earlier this year warned of not starting operations in the new season that began in October. A senior government official on October 29 said mills were expected to start functioning from November.
"Let mills start their operations first," Mr Paswan said when asked if the government would extend incentives to mills for exports of raw sugar.

Report: Energy contractor and former lawmaker lobbied officials for no-bid contractBy Josh Hicks November 12 Follow @reporter_hicks

A top government contractor managing a key Department of Energy laboratory inappropriately sought help from lawmakers and Obama administration officials to obtain a no-bid contract extension worth $2.4 billion per year, according to a federal review .
In a report released Wednesday, Department of Energy Inspector General Gregory Friedman cited planning documents from Sandia Corporation  showing that the firm, a subsidiary of Lockheed Martin that operates Sandia National Laboratories, formulated a strategy to “campaign aggressively (Administration and Congress) to convince [then-Secretary of Energy Steven Chu] to extend the M&O contract.”
Former New Mexico congresswoman  Heather Wilson , a Republican, was involved in the efforts, according to the review. The ex-lawmaker now runs a consulting firm and serves as president of the South Dakota School of Mines & Technology.
Sandia’s tactics included persuading the New Mexico congressional delegation, a former U.S. senator, the head of the National Nuclear Security Administration and top advisers to the energy secretary to pressure Chu, the report said.
Friedman said the costs of the efforts were “borne by the U.S. taxpayers,” because Sandia paid for them with money that the federal government had previously given to the firm. He added that the plan represented a violation of federal acquisition guidelines and a federal law barring the use of congressionally appropriated funds to influence contracting decisions.
Sandia had sought a six-year, no-bid extension, but the Department of Energy ultimately extended the contract for two years without competition so the agency could prepare for a “full and open competition,” the inspector general said.
The company did not confirm or deny the findings when asked about them on Wednesday.
“Sandia takes these allegations seriously and has cooperated fully in the inspector general’s review of the issue,” said Heather Clark, a spokeswoman for the firm. She added that the organization is confident it can work with the Energy Department to resolve the concerns raised in the report.
Wilson, who left Congress in 2009 after an unsuccessful run for a Senate seat, denied the findings against her in an e-mail on Wednesday.

“I was not a lobbyist for Sandia and I did not contact any federal official – Congressional or Executive – for Sandia to try to extend the Sandia contract,” she said. “Indeed, I don’t think I met with any member of the New Mexico Congressional delegation or their staffs on any matter, at any time, for Sandia during this entire period. The DOE has never contacted me on this matter and their findings don’t mention me. If they intended to imply I was involved, their report is wrong.”
Friedman said by phone on Wednesday that Wilson was “deeply, deeply involved” in the tactics described in the report.
Wilson was connected to a previous controversy involving $450,000 in payments that Energy Department contractors paid to her firm in 2009 without documenting the work that was supposed to be done in return. Friedman said in a 2012 report that the justification for the billing did “not meet even minimum standards” for federal payments.
RELATED: Inspector general casts doubt on DOE contract work by ex-congresswoman Wilson
The report released Wednesday said Sandia employees urged federal lawmakers and officials to convince the Energy Department, the National Nuclear Security Administration and lawmakers of the “merits of contract extension without competition.”
In one 2009 e-mail, a senior member of the Sandia contracts team said the firm needed support from the then-head of the National Nuclear Security Administration, Thomas D’Agostino , to persuade Chu.
Sandia told the inspector general’s office that the efforts and costs in question were allowable under federal contracting guidelines and that they were necessary to show that the organization was fulfilling the Energy Department’s needs. The firm argued that its activities were typical “for any contractor intent on continuing a relationship with its sponsor,” the report said.
Friedman rejected that explanation, saying in his report that the use of federal funds to influence lawmakers and federal officials was “inexplicable and unjustified.”
The Energy Department agreed with the inspector general’s recommendations, which called for the agency to determine whether a violation of federal contracting guidelines occurred, ensure that Sandia employees do not contact government officials for help obtaining business, and recover any payments that DOE made to Sandia staff or consultants for inappropriate activities.
“We take this issue seriously, and are committed to taking corrective action and preventive measures to ensure it doesn’t occur again,” said Energy Department spokesman Brendan Daly.

Santana Moss says dry snitching to the media has to stopBy Scott Allen November 12 Follow @ScottSAllen

“There’s always drama, man,” Santana Moss said of the Redskins during the wide receiver’s weekly appearance with 106.7 The Fan’s Chad Dukes on Tuesday. “I’ve been here for 10 years and it ain’t been drama-free yet.”
Moss spent part of the bye week in Florida, where he saw his nephew play in a high school football game. He said he also saw the latest chapter in the Redskins’ latest drama-filled season unfold on Sunday’s pregame shows, watching Ryan Clark address Britt McHenry’s report that Robert Griffin III had alienated himself from his teammates on ESPN before changing the channel to Fox to see DeSean Jackson talk about his decision to stand up for Griffin.
“I think they did a pretty good job, man, just stating facts,” Moss said of his teammates’ guest appearances. “At the end of the day, it’s always going to be something. When it comes to it, we ain’t winning games, when you have a quarterback or two quarterbacks that have won for us and played a little decent, and then you have your starter, you have your guy coming back off of injury. Everyone has their own opinions, but when it comes down to our locker room, we’re going to ride with whatever coach rides with. It don’t really matter who’s out there, because at the end of the day, we’re trying to win games.”
Moss also tried to clarify the message that Jackson delivered to the team.
“I don’t think a lot of people realize what DeSean was trying to say,” Moss said. “Basically, what he was saying is that, regardless of whatever whose opinion, if you express your opinion, then you’re expressing your opinion and that’s where it should stop. He was kind of ticked off because whatever was said got out to the media and people were saying things that maybe you and someone was talking about, or someone else was talking. That’s got to stop, man. You got these cats dry snitching and telling media in-house business. They’re gonna find out a lot of stuff. They’re gonna ask a lot of questions, so if you’re one of the guys they talk to, you can tell them a lot. But stuff that’s kept in-house, kept in that meeting room, in that locker room, you can’t go out and leak that out to sources or whoever.”
As 106.7 The Fan’s Chris Lingebach notes , dry snitching is defined in the Urban Dictionary as “indirectly telling secrets or offenses to a person of authority or any person meant to be kept away from a secret or offense, sometimes inadvertently.” Moss’ assessment of the situation and talk of dry snitching would seem to jibe with NFL reporter Jason La Canfora’s recent comments that there are always a couple of bad apples with the Redskins who are willing to share things with the media.
Moss said he has no problem with the media doing their jobs, but that the locker room should remain a place where players can “kick back and do what we do when we’re not on the field.” He also expressed frustration with what Dukes described as the media’s fixation on Griffin.
“I’ve been irritated with it,” Moss said. “I mean, to be honest with you, I’ve been irritated with it. It has to be tough on Robert. And that’s why I say, at the end of the day, you have to look at his standpoint, when it comes down to it’s always about him. Regardless if it ain’t about him, it’s always about him. But, at the same time, being the player that he is and how he came in, it comes with the territory. So my hat’s off to him. However he handles it, my hat’s off to him because I know it’s tiring to me. … I guess until we’re winning games and doing what we’re supposed to do, then they won’t let up.”
And in the meantime, stopping the snitching — dry or otherwise — would probably help limit the drama.

Cold air takes over into Thursday  showers possible too; Winter outlook public event November 17Temperature Map
Temperatures: Latest D.C. area temperature map. See interactive map on our Weather Wall .
We eked out a nice day today, with caveats. Those winds have been whipping this afternoon as temperatures fall off highs in the 60s. If you’ve been out recently, you’ll certainly notice the cooler air beginning to arrive in earnest behind this morning’s cold front. Hope you enjoyed the warmth, it could be a while until it returns.
Through Tonight: Even though the cold front passed this morning, it took a while to get the cold air to begin spilling into the area. It’ll certainly advance well tonight, with most of the region falling into the 30s. Under mostly clear skies, lows range from near freezing in the colder suburbs to near 40 downtown. Winds are from the north around 5-10 mph with higher gusts.
Tomorrow (Thursday): We’re certainly under a different air mass than we’ve seen recently. Looks like we end up with a fair amount of cloudiness, and even some isolated showers are possible (30% chance) during the day (then some mood flakes at night??? ). Odds are probably best, and perhaps grow a bit, late. Despite highs only reaching the mid-40s to near 50, winds won’t be too bad, as they blow from the north around 5-10 mph. And while I left it for last, we could even see some snowflakes mix in, especially west of I-95, if precipitation hangs around into the night!

Jeb Bush on education reformBy Jennifer Rubin November 12 Follow @JRubinBlogger
Former Florida governor Jeb Bush recently gave an interview  on school reform, which was a key part of his agenda as governor and which he continues to support in his role as chairman of the Foundation for Excellence in Education. The interview is worth reading in full, but several points stand out.
George P. Bush, right, reacts as his father, Jeb Bush, gestures during an interview in Abilene, Tex. (LM Otero/Associated Press)
First, Bush’s education vision is more conservative than some might expect:
We need to end the government monopoly in education by transferring power from bureaucracies and unions to families. The era of defining public education as allegiance to centralized school districts must end.
Public education must be viewed from the lens of providing each child with the learning environment that best meets his or her needs. If we can send a low-income child to a parochial school, knowing that his odds of attending college will increase as a result, then that should be our mission.
I envision presenting parents with a marketplace of school choices—public, private, parochial, charter, virtual, blended, and home education. They then can choose the model that best equips their children for success.
And Bush has no problem shooting down liberal myths. (“So please do not confuse Florida’s class-size amendment with reform. Reform is about creating a more efficient, more effective education system that meets the needs of children. The class-size amendment has been a hugely expensive diversion from that goal.”) It is a reminder that while Bush’s tone may be less strident, his policies are every bit as conservative as many of the self-appointed conservative purists.
Second, reforms he supports have worked and especially benefited minority students. Bush noted that “in the 1990s, [National Assessment of Educational Progress] results revealed almost half our 4th graders read below a basic level. For our low-income kids, the number was more than 60 percent. In the 2013 NAEP results, Florida’s low-income 4th graders were tops in the nation for reading achievement.”
And finally, the Common Core fuss is less about education and Jeb Bush than an anti-Washington crusade. Bush seeks to defuse the issue:
 I support high academic standards. Period.
High academic standards are a basic element of reform. Yet, across the country, state standards have been abysmally low for too long, evidenced by the fact that 75 percent of high school graduates are not fully prepared for college or a good paying job. A recent study by the American Institutes for Research compared state standards with international assessments and found the difference between states with the highest and lowest standards was the equivalent of three to four grade levels.
Low standards are a tactic that takes pressure off teachers unions by accepting mediocrity and failure for kids. Our children can achieve great things when we set high expectations for them.
The Common Core State Standards are more rigorous standards than the great majority of states had in place previously. . . . States are free to modify the Common Core State Standards or adopt their own individual standards, because academic standards are the prerogative of the states.
Rather than attack critics, Bush puts the blame on the Obama administration: “The opposition to the common core has been mostly fueled by President Obama and his administration attempting to take credit for and co-opt a state-led initiative.”
In short, there is little for conservatives legitimately to grumble about, unless they are for standards-free education and no accountability. (“If state leaders don’t like common core, they should embrace the challenge of raising their standards even higher. I’ll be the first person in line to support them. Most importantly, the best, highest standards in the world won’t matter if we don’t accurately measure whether students are truly learning, and hold schools accountable for the results.”) Right-wing critics may find that supposed liabilities are actually advantages for him. It would be interesting to see him debate against pols who have never run anything or whose schools are worse than Florida’s.

Paulsen has been plagued by plantar fasciitis in his right foot, and missed a portion of Washington’s game at Minnesota on Nov. 2 because of it. It wasn’t clear when Paulsen suffered the hamstring injury.
Five other players — quarterback Robert Griffin III (ankle), safety Ryan Clark (shoulder), linebacker Keenan Robinson (shoulder), linebacker Ryan Kerrigan (wrist), running back Silas Redd (back) — practiced fully despite receiving treatment for injuries, according to Wednesday’s injury report.
Tampa Bay running back Doug Martin (ankle) and defensive end Gerald McCoy (groin) both missed Wednesday’s practice, according to the Buccaneers’ injury report.
Offensive tackles Anthony Collins (foot) and Demar Dotson (neck) both were limited in practice, as were defensive end Michael Johnson (hand), tight end Luke Stocker (hip) and cornerback Alterraun Verner (hamstring).
Quarterback Josh McCown practiced fully despite receiving treatment for a back injury.

President Obama has drastically complicated life for the Federal Communications Commission.
The FCC is struggling to draft rules to govern the way information flows over the Internet. By unequivocally and very publicly calling for an "open" Internet and for regulatory powers to keep it that way Monday, the president raised the stakes in  an already very intense debate.
Net neutrality — the name for policies that guarantee equal access to the Internet for all content providers and prevent Internet service providers from charging for speeding up the flow  — is a pretty bloodless term, one that doesn't sound likely to elicit powerful responses, like abortion or gun control or Kim Kardashian. And yet the FCC received nearly 4 million — 4 million!! — reactions during its public comment period on possible new rules and regulations.
And the dueling points of view couldn't be more starkly different.
Obama endorses net neutrality
To open-Internet proponents, the issue is fairness. Open up the pipes to the highest bidder and the big players, the Comcasts of the world, will likely squeeze out the little guy. The Internet has in  many ways democratized the flow of information, and the prospect of the giants  dominating it is offensive  to fans of the open approach. Political supporters of this approach tend to be Democrats.
The ISPs, and their Republican allies, see attempts to regulate the Net as hopelessly retro and disastrous for innovation, yet another case of big government's rapacious appetite for interfering where it doesn't belong.
The president's dramatic plunge into net neutrality reflects a disconnect between his stance and that of FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler, an Obama appointee. The high-profile weighing in clearly was designed to nudge the commission in the direction of a more absolute approach to net neutrality.
The crux of the disagreement is over what is called paid prioritization: paying for special treatment and faster service. Obama on Monday called for a flat ban; Wheeler, who sees the harm in a system that would allow fast lanes, has been seeking an approach that would allow some paid prioritization but would set the bar for it pretty high.
Central to the president's approach is reclassifying  Internet service providers so that they would be treated as public utilities, like the electric company. The FCC lawyers, however, aren't sure that a flat-out ban on Internet fast lanes would be legal under such a reclassification. They're also not sure the category would apply to mobile, which has become such a huge factor in how people access information. They were trying to figure out how to proceed when the president dropped his bombshell.
Q&A: Net neutrality — what is at stake?
The already fraught situation was complicated by a Washington Post story posted late Tuesday about a meeting between Wheeler and a group of Internet company executives after Obama's pronouncement. The story said that the FCC chief was "moving in a different direction" than the president and "preferred a more nuanced approach." "What I've got to figure out is how to split the baby," the story quoted Wheeler as saying.
I'm told that the quotes were accurate but that Wheeler was looking backward, not forward when he said them.
Asked about the future, FCC press secretary Kim Hart said, "Reports that Chairman Wheeler has decided on the best approach for implementing legally sustainable open Internet rules are inaccurate. No decision has been made. All options remain on the table, including Title II reclassification" as a utility.
So what next? Don't expect a resolution anytime soon. It's likely that at its Dec, 11 meeting,  the FCC will consider extending the process to get answers to additional questions, such as how Title II might apply to mobile and how the FCC should "forebear" — exclude — the Internet carriers from some requirements that apply to other utilities such as rate review.
However the FCC finally comes down, someone is going to be unhappy. And it's likely the convoluted mess will end up in court.

How not to think about gun control laws (or speech restrictions)By Eugene Volokh November 12 Follow @volokhc
I posted yesterday about a case (in which I’m consulting) that challenges Cal. Civil Code § 26820:
No handgun or imitation handgun, or placard advertising the sale or other transfer thereof, shall be displayed in any part of the premises where it can readily be seen from the outside.
This drew an odd comment that struck me as worth analyzing:
Just what the nation needs, an opening door to the prospect of a literal arms race conducted with TV commercials touting the firepower advantages of various semi-autos.
The commenter conceded that the law is unconstitutional, but suggested that people shouldn’t help challenge it:
I’m asking you, what are your values here? … Is there something wrong with a lawyer who says, “You know, that law can serve a good purpose, but pushing it to the max in the most extreme way doesn’t serve a good purpose, and it isn’t something I personally want to do?”
Now while I’m generally skeptical of gun control laws, there are plausible arguments for some such laws, even if I on balance think that the arguments don’t carry the day against the counterarguments. For instance, a common argument against allowing people to carry weapons in public is that even otherwise law-abiding people might get angry, get drunk, or needlessly create or escalate a confrontation if they had a gun, and as a result unnecessarily kill or injure someone. True, the argument would go, such laws aren’t going to protect us against mass murderers or even armed robbers, who are obviously willing to deliberately violate many laws that are much more serious than gun control laws. But the carry restrictions might protect us against people who are law-abiding when they have time to deliberate (when they decide whether to carry a gun), but who can do something wrong or foolish on the spur of the moment (such as misuse a gun that they did decide to carry).
My sense is that, on balance, the benefits of people being able to defend themselves with guns in public places exceed the risk, especially given the track record of the concealed carry rights revolution over the past 30 years. But the argument against allowing gun carrying strikes me as sensible, because it sets forth a plausible explanation of why a particular policy would avoid certain kinds of harms caused by a rival policy. It focuses on what an actual law might actually do, and explains why it might actually do it.
What troubles many gun rights supporters, though, is how many pro-gun-control (or, here, anti-gun-advertising) arguments lack this sort of plausible explanation. Consider some things about the comment that prompted the post:
1. The California law bans on-premises signs promoting handguns. It doesn’t ban TV commercials. I don’t know of any law banning TV commercials for guns. Yet somehow, despite this, I don’t think we’ve seen “a literal arms race conducted with TV commercials touting the firepower advantages of various semi-autos,” at least at any level that even pro-control forces would see as materially threatening the welfare of the “the nation.” Why would striking down a ban on on-premises handgun advertisements produce such a “literal arms race”? If you’re going to make a consequentialist argument against a law, shouldn’t you explain just why the law would have the allegedly bad consequences?
2. In any case, say that someone is “touting the firepower advantages of various semi-autos.” What exactly gives a semi-automatic weapon a practical “firepower advantage[]” over other guns? It could be magazine size, in the sense that higher capacity magazines let one fire more often between reloading. But again this law doesn’t focus on magazine size advertisements — and in any event the way California deals with this question (rightly or wrongly) is by actually regulating magazine size. So in California you couldn’t advertise sufficiently high-capacity magazines even without the law, because they are illegal to sell.
Of course, another common possible firepower advantage is caliber (though again the law doesn’t focus on advertisements touting guns’ higher caliber); a .45 is certainly more powerful than a .22. That makes it more deadly when used criminally — and more effective at stopping attackers when used for self-defense. Not everybody’s “values,” as I’m sure the commenter knows, are therefore much opposed to people owning higher-caliber weapons. And though it’s all well and good to appeal to our better natures, don’t you first have to persuade us that the thing you’re dreading (people buying higher-caliber handguns) is something we should dread, too?
3. Finally, note the lack of a sense of proportion in the condemnation of “pushing [the law]” — presumably, the protection of commercial speech — “to the max in the most extreme way doesn’t serve a good purpose.” I hadn’t really thought that allowing gun stores to display handgun signs (alongside their rifle and shotgun signs, and the off-premises handgun signs they are free to display) is pushing First Amendment law “to the max in the most extreme way.” Again, shouldn’t such a claim be supported with a plausible argument, rather than just asserted as if it’s obviously true?
There are interesting debates to be had about gun control policy. But sensible arguments on this subject have to actually explain why a particular policy will solve a particular problem, or why a particular other policy will exacerbate it.

The Ninth Circuit and the right to carry guns: Good-bye Peruta  hello Richards and BakerBy Eugene Volokh November 12 Follow @volokhc
In February, a three-judge Ninth Circuit panel held (in Peruta v. County of San Diego (9th Cir. Feb. 3, 2014) ) that the Second Amendment secures a right to carry guns in many public places, and not just to possess guns at home. Naturally, this has been quite controversial, but the San Diego County defendants decided not to ask the Ninth Circuit to rehear the case en banc (i.e., by an 11-judge panel). Today, the original panel refused to allow  California, the Brady Campaign, and a couple of other groups to intervene in the case in order to petition for rehearing. My understanding is that, in principle, the would-be intervenors could try to get the court to rehear en banc this denial of the petition to intervene — but it’s not very likely.
As a practical matter, though, this decision probably doesn’t mean much, because the same issue has been raised in Baker v. Kealoha, which challenges Honolulu’s restrictive licensing scheme, and in Richards v. Prieto, which challenges the Yolo County (California) scheme. The panel held in plaintiffs’ favor in those cases, citing Peruta, and those defendants did file en banc rehearing petitions. So the Ninth Circuit will now consider those petitions. Stay tuned for what the Ninth Circuit does.

Govt reaches breakthrough in row over WTO pactIndia, US resolve impasse over food security issues at WTO

Commerce and Industry Minister Nirmala Sitharaman (Photo: Reuters)
Paving the way for implementation of trade facilitation pacts at WTO , India and US have resolved an impasse over food security related issues while safeguarding interest of Indian farmers.
With the US agreeing to support India's proposal on public stockpiling of food, it would now go for ratification by the WTO General Council to facilitate signing of Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) that has been stalled for months.
Announcing the breakthrough, Commerce and Industry Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that India and the US have successfully resolved their differences on the public stockholding issue for food security purposes in WTO.
This will "pave the way for spurring the WTO to more such success," she said, while expressing confidence that members would "take the matter forward in WTO in a constructive spirit".
The Minister further said that many nations saw merit in India's stand at WTO and that the US has also "appreciated and now openly supported our concerns on public stockholding."
"India has never obstructed trade facilitation. We were only trying to safeguard our farmer's interests," she added.
"WTO General Council will receive India's proposal and US will support us," Sitharaman said, while adding that there was a greater understanding of India's position after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's  visit to the US.
India is a strong supporter of the multilateral trading system and we are committed to strengthen it. Bali agreement was not perfect. We had raised these issues for a course correction. We have raised our issues. We are happy to say our differences have been resolved," she said in a series of tweets.

Priyanka Chopra and Shah Rukh Khan to host TV showtogetherThe actress will be hosting the show along with the superstar and the two will add a lot of peppy and witty elements to it.
By: BollywoodHungama.com | Mumbai | Posted: November 13, 2014 12:59 pm
Few months ago, prior to the release of the blockbuster ‘Happy New Year’, it was reported that Shah Rukh Khan will be a hosting a show which is produced by the ‘Got Talent’ producer Simon Cowell.
Though speculations then claimed that it was a part of the promotions for ‘Happy New Year’, producer Morani always denied it and maintained that it was individual event. Now, it has finally been revealed that Shah Rukh Khan’s ‘Don’ costar, Priyanka Chopra too will be a part of this. The actress will be hosting the show along with the superstar and the two will add a lot of peppy and witty elements to it. It is also being said that they will perform on stage but that decision is yet to be taken.
The show in question is an extension of ‘Got Talent’ and ‘India’s Got Talent’ titled ‘Got Talent World Stage’ where 10 performers/ performing groups will be showing their talent on stage live. The said show will be held in Mumbai on December 6. The other details of the same are still being kept under wraps. Apart from them, a few Bollywood celebrities like Jacqueline Fernandez and Varun Dhawan will be performing and judges of India’s Got Talent Malaika Arora Khan, Kirron Kher and Karan Johar will also grace the event.

TEV Project, the slot-car highway
Depending on the region in which they are registered, NEVs are limited by law (and usually, by engine output) to speeds below 25mph or 35mph. The best resemble earnest attempts at space capsules, the worst evoke street-legal golf carts (and often because they are, quite simply, street-legal golf carts).
But not the Cruser Sport. This forthcoming model from Ecocruise, a startup based in the Pacific northwest US state of Washington, sooner evokes a dune buggy than a municipal-course beverage cart. When you consider its pedigree, that makes a lot of sense.
Ecocruise is the brainchild of Steve Leighty, a veteran of the off-road motorsports industry, having founded Kasea Motorsports in the 1990s. Beginning by importing Chinese scooters, Leighty realised he could design and build sportier vehicles – ATVs, dirt bikes and motorcycles – himself, and ship the prototypes to China, Korea and Taiwan to be mass produced; the production versions were then sold back to customers in the US. Business prospered, but by 2004 Leighty was ready for a new challenge, and turned his attention to electric mobility.
The two-seater Cruser Sport is the first Ecocruise model to hit the streets, and it is anything but boxy, with a swooping carbon fibre body over exposed tubular steel, plus a covered rear hatch and T-tops. Exposed suspension and 14in aluminium wheels impart a beefy stance, and the bucket seats reinforce the off-road lineage. Safety – hardly an afterthought, even for low-speed neighbourhood electrics –  comes in the form of US Department of Transportation-approved safety glass and seatbelts, antilock brakes and a two year bumper-to-bumper warranty and three-year warranty on the lithium-ion batteries. Leighty claims that the topmost battery package will take the Cruser Sport up to 60 miles on a charge.
The car will retail for $8,500 to $11,900 in the US, depending on motor and battery options, when deliveries commence in January 2015. Shortly thereafter the company plans to release the more conventional one-seater EZIP-4 for around $3,800. A line of service and utility vehicles, including electric scooters, will follow. Distribution in the US is managed through a group of roughly 50 independent retailers, while in Europe, an expected partnership with UK’s Urban Mover will provide a readymade dealer network.
And lest the putter-perfecting neighbourhood-electric user be denied, Cruser Sports will soon  be available in golf-cart form, too.

In economic data released yesterday, retail inflation, which the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) tracks in setting lending rates, slowed to a record low of 5.52 per cent in October from 6.46 per cent a month earlier, helped by slower annual rises in food and fuel prices.
Industrial output grew a better-than-expected 2.5 per cent year-on-year in September, its fastest pace in three months, helped by a rebound in the capital goods sector, separate government data showed.
Indian markets have set a series of new highs since the third week of October, aided by strong foreign inflows and positive momentum from the government's reform measures. Foreign institutional investors have pumped in close to Rs 10,500 crore since October 20.
Mehraboon Irani, principal & head at private client group business at Nirmal Bang Securities, said positive macro-economic data is raising expectations of a RBI rate cut in the first quarter of next year. Besides that stimulus measures announced by the Bank of Japan and the fall in oil prices is perking up sentiment about Indian markets.
Dr. Arvind Virmani, former chief economic adviser of government of India, said inflation is on a downward trend with data showing across-the-broad slowing trend in price rise.
At 2:45 p.m. the Sensex was down 100 points to 27,908 while Nifty fell 37 points to 8,346. Bank of Baroda and PNB fell over 1 per cent after the recent outperformance of banking stocks on rate cut hopes.
BPCL was the biggest loser among Nifty stocks. The oil retailer fell over 4 per cent after the excise duty hike on petrol and diesel. HPCL slumped over 5 per cent while Indian Oil fell over 2 per cent.

Indian-Origin Executive Becomes Youngest Goldman Sachs PartnerBuying Iron Ore for First Time in History, Says Tata Steel
Wall Street's most famous firm Goldman Sachs has promoted Kunal Shah, 32, to the coveted role of 'Partner'. The Indian-origin executive, who is currently a managing director at Goldman, is the youngest in the investment giant's most coveted club.
Goldman now has 467 partners, an elite group, representing about 1.6 per cent of its 33,500-strong workforce. The position of Partner brings with it some of the biggest Wall Street perks including a lucrative paycheck with salaries of about $900,000 and a portion of the bank's bonus pool which is divided up among only the partners. The Partners also have access to special investment opportunities that are not available to other employees.
However, the record for becoming the youngest Goldman Sachs Partner is held by Eric Mindich who was promoted in 1994 at the age of 27.
Mr Shah is among the 78 individuals to be promoted to this position, and is one of the five persons of Indian-origin to have made the cut in Goldman Sachs in 2014 class of Partners. Goldman Sachs selects its partners every two years through an extremely secretive and rigorous months-long selection process.
Mr Shah was promoted to managing director at the investment banking giant at the age of 27. The Cambridge University math graduate was also named in Forbes '30 under 30' Finance list in 2011.
He has been a rising star at Goldman since he joined the company in London in 2004, analysing interest rate products, before trading on the global macro desk, according to Forbes.
The other persons of Indian-origin named to the firm's elite group are Meena Lakdawala Flynn, Manikandan Natarajan, Umesh Subramanian and Rajesh Venkataramani.
"These appointments recognise some of the firm's most senior professionals and acknowledge their embodiment of our culture and values, and their leadership of the firm's business and people," Goldman Sachs Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein said in a statement. "We look forward to their continued strong performance and leadership in the years ahead."
The 2014 class of Partners includes 11 women, 23 employees from investment banking, 25 from securities, 11 from investment management, four from merchant banking and three from research.
They will become Partners of the firm starting January 1 next year.

The Menorah principle and the unravelling of public religiosityBy Eugene Kontorovich November 13
The Board of Education Montgomery County, Maryland has cancelled all religious holidays . The move by the rather politically liberal county came in response to demands from Muslim groups to a dd Islamic holidays to the school calendar.
In an essay in 1n 1997, predicted the demise of conventional, innocuous Christian public observances as the obvious consequence of what I called the “Menorah Principle” – the notion that religious minorities must share equal, not pro rata, space with the majority religion makes public (i.e., governmental) religious symbolism effectively unworkable. In a nation with a multitude of religions followed by less than one percent of the population, giving everyone a turn will in the long run render public religious displays or any kind either meaningless, incoherent, or excessive. (Today, Buddhists (0.7%) Hindus (04.%) and New Agers (0.4%) make up a comparable share of the population to Moslems (0.6%).)
As I explained in an op-ed published in New York Post (July 1, 1997) entitled “The Gridlock to Come in Our Public Square”:
Come December, the traditional Christmas tree displays that usher in the holiday season at New York City public schools will be joined not just by the Jewish menorah, but by the Muslim star and crescent as well. To settle a federal lawsuit, the Board of Education agreed that any holiday symbol in the schools should be accompanied by symbols of festivals from other religions and cultures to “reflect different beliefs.”
The board avoided a First Amendment landmine by presuming the star and crescent to be secular symbol, as the US Supreme Court declared Christmas trees to be in 1989. But the settlement still has a major problem: America`s public square simply doesn`t have the room to give equal space to all the faiths in the world.
***
The implicit theory here is that religious equality gives each minority, no matter how small, a positive right to have its icons trotted out by Christians during their joyous – and harmless – observances. But the Muslims broke no new ground with their suit. They quite naturally sought the same privileges afforded the other religious minority, the Jews.
In 1906, thousands of Jewish students boycotted city schools, successfully demanding the abolition of mandatory Christian religious assemblies. Fair enough. But the demands did not stop with the end of majority coercion. Jews began to insist that the government elevate their religious symbols to the same public status as the Christian ones. Hence, the obligatory pairing of Christmas trees and menorahs, and, in many districts, an ecumenical vacation day on Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur.
In America, Christianity is different from other faiths in one salient respect. Christians are 84 percent [down to 78.4% in 2014!] of the population while the runners up [are less than 2 percent each].
For better or worse, the nation was founded by Protestants and built by Christians, who indelibly marked American culture with the trappings of their faith. It is hubris to somehow think that one`s tiny group is being shortchanged when the festivals receive less public recognition than those of the primary religion.
Call this demand for equal status the “Menorah Principle.”… Once this principle triumphs, equity dictates that it must apply to all groups. The game plays out much like affirmative action, with its ever-growing list of preferred categories. Other groups, like the Muslims, inevitably piggy-back on the Jews` victories.
For example, in New Jersey`s Cherry Hill, a school district far less diverse than New York, the Christmas holiday displays are crowded with Christmas trees, menorahs, Kwanzaa candle holders and gold-laminated pictures of Buddha.
The list is sure to grow. Groups that at first don`t particularly care will eventually demand the same treatment as the others, if only to avoid being left behind when the rest are made “equal”.
***
Given America`s vast diversity, the Menorah Principle is untenable, even destructive. Take holidays for starters. If Christmas is an official national holiday, then why not the twelve days of Kwanzaa and the month-long Muslim festival of Ramadan? Even the calendar year is a scarce resource: If we honor all the special claims of the diverse U.S. populace, the many holidays would leave little time left for work or school.
Unless society draws a line—and the only obvious place to draw it is at Christianity—an unmanageable tumult will ensue: gridlock in the public square.
Of course, if one opposes public religious displays of any kind, one might like whatever intensifies the internal contradictions, as Marx would say. I think the First Amendment allows for public religious displays, and a sense of proportion should counsel minority religions not to demand equal billing. The neutral principle needed to avoid this would of course sweep Jewish holidays from the public religious list, but this should not cause them distress. Jews who believe in equality should be happy to be treated similarly to other religions of similar size. And as the Montgomery decision augurs, Jewish holidays will surely be stricken anyway, as the Menorah Principle contains the seeds of its own undoing.

Michigan district court strikes down states anti-domestic-partnership law on animus groundsBy Dale Carpenter November 13
A Michigan district court today struck down a state law barring local governments from offering health care and other fringe benefits to the same-sex domestic partners of their employees, holding that the ban violates the Equal Protection Clause because it reflects unconstitutional animus against same-sex couples. The decision by Judge David M. Lawson (a Clinton appointee) in Bassett v. Snyder overturns a Michigan law signed by Governor Rick Snyder in 2011. Taken together with DeBoer v. Snyder , the Sixth Circuit decision last week that devoted an entire section to the animus claim against state anti-SSM laws, it further raises the profile of animus analysis as the issue of gay marriage is poised to arrive at the Supreme Court.
Judge Lawson’s opinion differs from the Sixth Circuit’s consideration of animus on more than just the outcome. The Sixth Circuit asked only “whether anything but prejudice to the affected class could explain the law” and declined to search for what it characterized as subjective maliciousness in the hearts of millions of voters. Bassett reflects a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of how animus analysis actually works in the Supreme Court’s quadrilogy of animus cases (Moreno, Cleburne, Romer, and Windsor) (as I’ve explained it in the Supreme Court Recview  here  and in an extended VC post here ) as well as in the Sixth Circuit’s own precedents.
To begin with, the search for impermissible animus does not depend on examining the subjective motives of legislators or voters. Instead, it rests on consideration of a variety of objective factors that do not require courts to read minds or discern the contents of hearts. As the district court recognized:
The Sixth Circuit has identified [an] expanded list of factors that can be used to detect whether state action was motivated by a discriminatory purpose: (1) the impact of the official action on the group challenging the classification; (2) the historical background of the challenged decision, especially if it reveals numerous actions being taken for discriminatory purposes, (3) the sequence of events that preceded the state action, (4) procedural or substantive departures from the government’s normal procedural process, and (5) the legislative or administrative history. Moore v. Detroit Sch. Reform Bd., 293 F.3d 352, 369 (6th Cir. 2002) (citing Village of Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 266-68).
This list of objective considerations comes from cases in which plaintiffs claim some racially disparate impact in a law that is nevertheless racially neutral on its face. In such cases, the Supreme Court has required plaintiffs to show that the government was motivated by an impermissible racial purpose. That impermissible purpose can detected, in turn, by looking at the objective indicators of an impermissible purpose, like statements of legislators, unusual departures from usual practice, a history of discrimination, etc.
The list of objective factors to sniff out an impermissible racial purpose mirrors closely the objective factors  in the Supreme Court’s animus quadrilogy , in which the Court looks for an impermissible animus-based (as opposed to race-based) purpose to demean or to injure an unpopular group. The list of such indicia of animus includes: (1) considerations of statutory text (textual); (2) the political and legal context of passage, including a historical background demonstrating past discriminatory acts, and a departure from the usual substantive considerations governing the decision (contextual); (3) the legislative proceedings, including evidence of animus that can be gleaned from the sequence of events that led to passage, the legislative procedure, and the legislative history (procedural); (4) the law’s harsh real-world impact or effects (effectual); and (5) the utter failure of alternative explanations to offer legitimate ends along with means that really advance those ends (pretextual).
The Sixth Circuit did not consider these factors from the disparate-racial-impact cases or from the Court’s animus quadrilogy in its DeBoer decision.
Moreover, contrary to the Sixth Circuit’s analysis treating animus as merely a species of ordinary rational-basis review, the animus inquiry does not end when the state brings forward one or more slender but conceivably rational justifications for its law targeting a class. Once animus is found to be a motivating factor (not the sole factor or even the dominant factor) behind the law, as the district court recognized, the analysis is over. The law, as I have characterized it, is “tainted” by animus and is unconstitutional . (See also Professor Susannah Pollvogt’s analysis of the decisive role of animus here .)
In an animus case, the existence of hypothesized and imaginable rationalizations that would support a law in the usual rational-basis case won’t cut it. That is the lesson of the entire animus quadrilogy, in which justifications that would ordinarily support constitutionality failed to save the laws targeting a class, even if the classification itself wasn’t a “suspect” one. Consider the cited cost-saving and anti-fraud justifications for excluding non-traditional households from the food stamp program in Moreno; the safety concerns for residents of a home for the cognitively disabled that were relied upon in Cleburne; the freedom-of-association interests and resource-conservation preferences offered for excluding homosexuals from specific anti-discrimination protections in Romer; and a host of possible justifications, including fears of judicial activism, used by Congress to justify the exclusion of married same-sex couples from all marital benefits in Windsor. Any of these threadbare justifications would likely have sufficed in a standard rational-basis case, as opponents tirelessly pointed out, and as they continue to do today in support of excluding same-sex couples from marriage. But they don’t suffice in an animus case, where the usual rational-basis deference to government exclusion of an unpopular class is inoperative.
Admittedly, the animus inquiry was somewhat more straightforward in today’s Bassett decision than it was in DeBoer. As the district court noted, Michigan has always been a strong “home rule” state, meaning that localities were traditionally entrusted with deciding important benefits and anti-discrimination protections for their own employees. The anti-domestic-partners law departed abruptly from this usual practice for gay couples and for them alone, which itself is an “unusual discrimination” that triggers suspicion of animus, as it did for different reasons in Romer (the unprecedented scope of Colorado’s anti-gay law) and in Windsor (Congress’s departure from the usual federalism-based practice of deferring to states’ own definitions of  marriage).
When such unusual discrimination is placed in the context of a long history of anti-gay discrimination in the law, a legacy the Sixth Circuit itself recognized in DeBoer, it strengthens the inference that the law was rooted in prejudice and unthinking stereotypes about same-sex couples.
Finally, none of the purported rationales supporting the total exclusion of same-sex domestic partners from health and other benefits were creditable. Even the supposed cost savings were unsupported and illusory, which would not be a problem in an ordinary rational-basis case but is a problem where animus has already been detected. Thin justifications quickly start to look pretextual, as mere covers for ill will, when animus is afoot.
The equal-protection animus analysis is more complicated in DeBoer in some respects. There is not the same kind of unusual departure from a historical practice in recognizing only opposite-sex marriages as there is in stripping localities of home rule for the purpose of excluding same-sex couples alone from all benefits. But the challenged constitutional amendments in the DeBoer case were unusual departures from regulation of family law because they constitutionalized marital definitions for the first time. To what end? That unusual act of constitutionalizing the issue, combined with other indicia of animus (including the universally recognized history of anti-gay discrimination in the states), cannot be saved by pointing to whatever makeweight and tenuous rationalizations (like promoting “responsible procreation” among opposite-sex couples) that a state might now offer to target gay couples for exclusion from marriage.
Even the remaining exclusion of same-sex couples from marriage reflected in longstanding state statutes may be vulnerable to animus attack based on the other objective factors noted above. It can hardly escape notice that states have consciously and steadfastly refused to include same-sex couples in their marriage statutes, in addition to specifically excluding them through anti-SSM state constitutional amendments and through state “mini-DOMAs” that deny all recognition to married same-sex couples from out of state. A failure to include, as well as an affirmative act to exclude, may also reflect animus against a class. That is at least a question the Supreme Court may now consider. The heightened attention to animus in the very Circuit from which the marriage cases will likely come to the Court raises the possibility that animus analysis will play at least some role in the ultimate outcome.

Democratic Senator Tim Kaine calls the war against ISIS illegalDemocratic Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia recently called the ongoing war against ISIS “illegal” because it lacks congressional authorization:
Sen. Tim Kaine said Wednesday there’s no legal authority for the current U.S. mission against ISIS in Iraq and Syria.
“We have been engaged in a war — that is not about imminent defense of the United States — without legal authority,” the Virginia Democrat said at the Wilson Center on Wednesday…
The mission is not covered by either the wording or intent of the 2001 and 2002 authorizations for use of military force as the White House argues, Kaine said, adding that such an argument is “ridiculous” and inconsistent with President Barack Obama’s previously stated interpretation of the AUMF.
Kaine, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has proposed a new, limited authorization, specifically targeted to the current mission against ISIS. “We should deal with it right away,” he said, stressing that it could be accomplished in the lame-duck session in Congress.
I think Kaine is absolutely right about this. In previous posts, I explained why the operation against ISIS requires new congressional authorization and was not authorized by either post-9/11 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force or the 2002 AUMF (see here and here ).
I also think that Kaine is right to call on Congress to address this issue sooner rather than later. Among other things, it has become more urgent thanks to President Obama’s recent dispatch of 1500 more troops to Iraq .
Like Kaine, I also believe there may well be good justification for using force against ISIS in order to keep it from becoming more powerful, protect vulnerable civilians, and hopefully reverse the gains the terrorist group has already made. But Kaine is right to emphasize that a large-scale military operation like this one requires “a political consensus” behind it. A congressional resolution endorsing the mission and clearly delineating its scope could help achieve that goal. If there is not enough support for such a resolution to pass, that suggests we do not really have the political will to see the mission through, and should cut our losses while we still can. Even aside from constitutional issues, it is unwise to enter a potentially difficult war without broad political support. Such a policy risks a quick collapse of will as soon as any setbacks occur. And fighting and losing is often both more costly and more dangerous than not fighting at all would have been.
Kaine previously outlined his position on the need for congressional authorization here . He deserves credit for being willing to stand up to a president of his own party on this issue. Kaine’s stance on the legality of the war is similar to that outlined by GOP Senator Rand Paul . But, obviously, it is much easier to attack a president of the rival party than the leader of your own.

The historic U.S.-China climate deal doesnt do enough to save the planetBy Chris Mooney November 12 Follow chriscmooney

Climate experts on Wednesday said the historic  agreement  between the United States and China to curb greenhouse gas emissions, though a major breakthrough, still will likely not move the world back into a climate safe zone that would avert the worst effects of global warming.
According to the deal, the United States will reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by up 28 percent below their 2005 level. It would do so by 2025. China, meanwhile, pledges to limit its fast-rising carbon dioxide emissions to the level reached in 2030 and no higher. It will also try to get 20 percent of its energy from non-fossil fuels sources by then, if not earlier.
The agreement comes after another similar  announcement recently by the European Union. EU members committed to reduce their collective emissions by 40 percent below their 1990 level. They are promising to do that by 2030.
With Europe, China and the United States all pledging to take action, the world's three largest sources of emissions are for the first time working to significantly prevent the warming of the planet. "If China, the U.S., and the E.U .… got in a room, that's about 60 percent of global emissions right there," said Princeton climate scientist Michael Oppenheimer.
Despite the burst of activity, however, climate experts warn that even these ambitious efforts are unlikely -- without concerted further action -- to solve the world's climate challenges. On Wednesday, for example, a grim report released by the International Energy Agency suggested  that the world is on track to pump so much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere by 2040 that it will cause irreparable harm to the planet's ecosystems.
The IEA says that humans can only emit about 1,000 additional gigatonnes of carbon dioxide (one gigatonne is equal to a billion metric tons) into the atmosphere before passing a dangerous threshold.
Climate scientists warn that pumping more carbon dioxide than that into the atmosphere would likely cause a more-than-2 degree Celsius rise in global temperatures over levels that existed before the rise of industry in the 19th century.
Such a rise could cause dramatic sea-level rise due to the melting of the planet's ice sheets, threats to agriculture, and more severe weather.
Experts were scrambling on Wednesday to determine how the new U.S.-China agreement affects the 2 degree target. "The answer we’ve come to so far is that it depends," said Taryn Fransen, a senior associate at the World Resources Institute, an environmental think tank. "I think the big question in terms of total emissions is going to be when and at what level China peaks" its emissions.
According to  projections from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the world is churning out more than 30 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide annually from energy use. The United States accounts for a little over five gigatonnes, Europe produces about four gigatonnes, and China emits about 9.5 gigatonnes.
But global emissions are also still on a rise, meaning that in coming years the global annual number is projected to exceed 40 gigatonnes. The International Energy Agency says under current its projections -- which do not account for the brand new U.S.-China agreement -- the world will produce the threshold-breaking 1,000 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide by 2040.
Forecasting changes to emission patterns is extremely difficult and imprecise, and it's not clear just how significant an impact the new agreement would have on these projections. But climate experts say that it's unlikely the new agreement -- without further action by both developing and developed countries -- would be enough to avert some of the worst outcomes.
"Obviously, if only the U.S. and China were doing something, then we’d fall short," explains David Hawkins, director of climate change programs at the Natural Resources Defense Council. "And it’s also true that if we don’t do anything more than this deal, we would bust [the] budget."
Nonetheless, the experts underscore that this deal has a symbolic value that goes far beyond the literal emissions cuts (or caps) that have now been pledged, precisely because the world's top two greenhouse gas emitters have now both come to the table.
If the agreement lays the groundwork for a broader global agreement -- one that encompasses other major emitters like India, Japan, and Russia -- then that is the real payoff. That agreement could happen in Paris in late 2015, when the nations of the world gather to try to achieve a global agreement to cut greenhouse gas emissions.
"I take what happened last night as really one of the most important developments that I’ve seen in the international negotiations over the last 5 to ten years," says Robert Stavins, an environmental economist at the Harvard Kennedy School. That is not because of the literal emissions reductions that China and the United States have pledged, but rather because of the fact that they lay a foundation for more movement in reducing the emissions of other developing nations (besides China).
The Earth system, after all, doesn't care about political victories -- only raw physics. "The planet doesn’t give A’s for effort," says  Nathaniel Keohane , who heads the international climate program of the Environmental Defense Fund. "Deeper reductions will be needed but this is a very good first step."

Shelter for homeless: SC asks Centre to call meeting ofstatesHomeless people sleeping on a city pavement. ( Express photo )
By: Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: November 13, 2014 1:30 pm
The Supreme Court today asked the Centre to convene a meeting of chief secretaries of all the states within 10 days to find out the steps taken by them so far to provide shelter to homeless persons.
A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice H L Dattu also asked the Urban Development Ministry to “find out ways and means to provide necessary temporary shelter to all homeless people in the entire country”.
“It is desirable that a responsible person of the Urban Development Ministry will call a meeting of chief secretaries of all the states to find out what steps they have taken in implementing the scheme of urban homeless people,” the bench, also comprising justices Madan B Lokur and A K Sikri, said.
It said that a report, giving details of the actions taken so far, be filed within three weeks and the meeting of the Chief Secys has to be convened within 10 days.
During the brief hearing, the bench said that it will not hear the matter relating to homeless persons in the national capital as the Delhi High Court is already seized of it and has been monitoring the development in the case.
Perusing the affidavit filed by some of the states, the bench said, “We can make out nothing from the affidavit. It’s not clear as to what they have done.”
The counsel for Delhi, however, said that 231 night shelters have been set up in the national capital and out of them, 84 are permanent and they can provide shelters to 17,000 homeless people here.
Prashant Bhushan, appearing for one of the parties, said that as per the census of the Delhi government, there are 39,000 homeless people in the city alone and the government claims that it can provide shelters to 17,000 persons only.
Moreover, these shelters lack basic civic facilities like water and sanitation, he said.

A special Bangladesh tribunal has sentenced an opposition politician to death for his role in killing people and other crimes during the nation’s 1971 independence war against Pakistan.
M.A. Zahid Hossain Khokon, of the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party, is a fugitive and believed to be in Sweden with his son and daughter.
He was convicted of leading the killings of people, looting and arson attacks during the war.
Bangladesh blames Pakistani soldiers and local collaborators for the deaths of 3 million people during the nine-month war. An estimated 200,000 women were raped and about 10 million people were forced to take shelter in refugee camps in neighboring India.
Head judge of a three-member panel A.T.M. Fazle Rabbi said the tribunal found him guilty of 10 of 11 charges he faced.

IMF's Christine Lagarde sees jobs shortfall in G20 growth target
AFP Nov 13, 2014, 11.09AM IST
("Moving the needle up two…)
BRISBANE: International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde has backed the G20's pledge to raise economic output by 2.0 percent in the next five years, but warned it will not create all the jobs needed.
Speaking to the Australian Financial Review from Washington before heading to Brisbane for this weekend's meeting of the world's 20 biggest economies, Lagarde said focusing on growth was the right strategy.
Host Australia has pushed for members to commit to reforms, including cutting red tape and encouraging private infrastructure investment, in a bid to boost the group's economic output by US$2 trillion.
"Moving the needle up two points over five years is certainly an improvement," the former French finance minister said in comments published Thursday.
"Is it going to be sufficient to deliver all the jobs that are needed? No. But it's certainly a step in the right direction if it is implemented."
In a report ahead of the summit, the IMF said the world economy faced stiff headwinds from sluggish growth in Europe and Japan and a slowdown in emerging economies.
It trimmed its growth forecast for the year to 3.3 percent, from 3.4 percent, citing geopolitical tensions and volatility in financial markets, and urged advanced economies to tackle high unemployment by spending more to generate jobs.
"The recovery is under way but is uneven, fragile and with downside risks on the horizon," Lagarde told the financial daily newspaper.
On the upside, the Washington-based body said a nearly 20 percent fall in oil prices since September would, if sustained, aid growth.
Lagarde said she had a "strong confidence" a deal on the 2.0 percent goal would be reached this weekend and praised the government of Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott for focusing the G20 agenda.
"I think the Australians have done something to be satisfied and proud of because there are deliverables and they are passing the baton to Turkey with a bunch of good things done," she said.
"Early on they identified the agenda, they were very focused and did not try to cover the entire planet of issues. They managed to pull off the growth agenda."
US President Barack Obama, China counterpart Xi Jinping and India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi are among the leaders to be hosted by Abbott in Brisbane for the two-day summit.

India calls for text negotiations for UNSC reform by 2015

UNITED NATIONS: Describing the unreformed UN Security Council as a "seriously impaired organ," India has emphasised the urgent need to achieve reform of the powerful body by next year, saying a text should be tabled to begin "actual negotiations" on its reform and expansion.
Highlighting the shortfalls of an unreformed Security Council, India's Permanent Representative to the UN, Ambassador Asoke Mukerji said that even in the area of its core competence, the 15-nation body is unable to act with credibility essentially due to its unrepresentative nature.
"The Council, which has the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, is today a seriously impaired organ. The litany of crises dotting the international landscape, involving the lives of millions of people, which the Council does not have the will or there sources to address, demonstrates this vividly," Mukerji said here yesterday in a General Assembly session on 'Equitable Representation and Increase in Security Council Membership'.
Mukerji said a text would provide a "refreshing contrast" to all previous rounds of the process so far where "we must be the only forum in the United Nations to be negotiating without actually having a negotiating text on the table before us".
He stressed that without a negotiation text, it is "impossible" for nations to demonstrate their commitment to multilateralism and flexibility to reach an outcome by 2015.
He added that the inter-governmental negotiations should not be perceived to be biased against any individual country or group of countries just because a text is on the table.
"However, if there is no negotiation text on the table, then we would surely have just cause to detect a bias against those of us who are seriously engaged in implementing the explicit mandate given to us by our leaders in the 2005 for early reform of the Security Council," he said.
Mukerji welcomed the appointment of Jamaican Ambassador Courtney Rattray as Chair of the Inter-Governmental Negotiations and called on the General Assembly to "truly empower" Rattray by giving him "a text on the basis of which all of us can begin to engage in actual negotiations".
He urged that once the negotiation text authorised by the President of the General Assembly is placed before member states by Rattray, "we engage in the give and take of actual negotiations to define what early reform of the Council actually means for the vast majority of us in this Assembly.
"It would be a blot on the collective integrity of this organisation if we were to turn our backs to this subject and ignore it completely when our leaders meet next year for the historic 70th Anniversary Summit of the UN," he said.
Significantly, the US also supported for the first time the need to achieve UNSC reforms by next year saying "the landmark year of 2015 is a compelling moment for the membership to consider appropriate ways to achieve successful Council reform".
The US position is similar to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's statement in the General Assembly in September in which he said that the UN, including the Security Council, must be reformed by 2015 to make it more democratic and participative.

WTO impasse ends:  Peace clause  helps US  India end feud over food subsidiesIndia, US settle row over food security
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, November 13, 2014
First Published: 11:24 IST(13/11/2014) | Last Updated: 08:26 IST(14/11/2014)
Comments
India and the United States scripted a compromise formula on food subsidies on Thursday, paving the way to remove a major irritant in the stalled World Trade Organization (WTO) deal on easing of customs rules.
As part of a revised proposal, India and the US have agreed for an indefinite “peace clause” on food security until a permanent solution is found, marking a major success for the Narendra Modi government in global trade talks withstanding mounting diplomatic pressure from developed countries.
A “peace clause” gives legal security to member countries and protects them from being challenged under other WTO agreements.
HT first reported on September 22 the possibility the of breakthrough during Prime Minister Modi’s visit to the US when he discussed the issue with President Barack Obama.
Developed nations have shown support for a “peace clause” that would agree to developing countries’ demands on food security for a period of four years.
India, however, was pressing for a guarantee for further exemption until a permanent solution is negotiated and to find a way to allow countries the right to provide higher levels of subsidies for their poor beyond these four years.
India had made it clear that state-funded welfare schemes for the poor were non-negotiable even as it took the blame for blocking the TFA in July, as it did not come bundled with a roadmap for rules on food subsidies. (AFP Photo)
The latest move will likely help WTO members ratify the so-called trade facilitation agreement (TFA) to make trade easier, faster and cheaper by making systems transparent and reducing red tape.
In July, India had withstood mounting pressure from the developed countries including the US, which had blamed New Delhi’s hard bargain strategy for the eventual collapse of the talks putting the WTO’s future in “uncertain ground.”
India had made it clear that state-funded welfare schemes for the poor were non-negotiable even as it took the blame for blocking the TFA in July, as it did not come bundled with a roadmap for rules on food subsidies.
"The United States and India reached agreement today (Thursday) on a set of measures intended to break the impasse in the work of the World Trade Organization (WTO) to implement the agreements reached last December," said a US government statement.
The two countries agreed that India's food security programmes would not be challenged under WTO rules "until a permanent solution regarding this issue has been agreed and adopted," it said.
India's commerce minister Nirmala Sitharaman tweeted that India and the US had "successfully resolved their impasse over food security issues in #WTO".
"WTO General Council will receive India's proposal and US will support us," she said.
Even after Modi's talks with Obama in September, India, however, held the view that without a permanent solution on food subsidies, public stockholding programmes such as buffer stock of food-grains will be hampered.
Existing rules cap the value of food subsidies at 10% of the value of production. But, the way the support is calculated at prices of more nearly three decades earlier means many countries would find it difficult to stay within the limit potentially attracting strong penalties from the trade body.
This will affect India’s food security programme and food grain procurement through the minimum support prices (MSP).
Bali package
New Delhi's decision in July to hold up the TFA to reduce trade barriers came after the WTO's members agreed at a December, 2013, meeting in the Indonesian island of Bali to implement the pact.
At the time of the Bali accord, WTO members agreed on a four-year "peace clause" to protect India from being punished over subsidies and stockpiles until a "permanent" solution" was reached. The agreement was due to take effect in mid-2015.
But after the Bali pact, Indian officials complained there were nearly two dozen meetings on the trade facilitation pact and just a handful on subsidies.
Bali was the first multilateral agreement concluded by the WTO since its inception in 1995.
It also signalled the first concrete progress on the Doha Round of trade liberalisation talks, launched in 2001 and aimed at underpinning development in poorer nations.
It took nearly a decade to conclude the trade facilitation part of the talks, which began in 2004.
"The agreement announced today (Thursday) between the US and India paves the way for full implementation of the WTO's Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA)...The agreement also reflects shared understandings regarding the WTO's work on food security," US Trade Representative Michael Froman said in a statement.
   
"We now look forward to working with all WTO members and with Director-General Roberto Azevedo to reach a consensus that enables full implementation of all elements of the landmark Bali Package, including the TFA," he added.

Machil fake encounter case: Seven armymen sentenced to lifeComments
A military court sentenced five soldiers, including two officers, to life imprisonment on Thursday for the staged killing of three Kashmiri civilians and passing it off as an anti-militancy operation in Jammu and Kashmir's Machil sector in 2010.
It is a rare case of soldiers being punished in Kashmir where the army is an object of hate and the target of frequent protests because of the controversial Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA), which gives it sweeping powers to search, arrest and shoot people.
The verdict, hailed by political parties in Kashmir but dismissed by some separatists as a political move with an eye on assembly elections, comes at a time when the army is under fire in the Valley for killing two Kashmiri boys mistaken for terrorists.
The men were allegedly lured by a former special police officer and his accomplices to Machil on the pretext of offering a job. They were later handed over to the army for Rs. 50,000 each and shot dead by troops in a staged encounter near the border with Pakistan on April 29, 2010. The army described them as Pakistani militants trying to sneak in from the Machil sector along the Line of Control. Their bodies were exhumed on May 28, 2010.
The controversial Machil killings triggered widespread protests and bloodshed in the Kashmir Valley in which 113 people were killed. They also led to calls for scrapping the contentious AFSPA, which the army says is necessary for battling militancy in the state.
Chief minister Omar Abdullah welcomed the sentencing and called it a "watershed moment" in Kashmir's history.
"This is a watershed moment. No one in Kashmir ever believed that justice would be done in such cases. Faith in institutions disappeared. I hope that we never see such #Machil fake encounter type of incidents ever again and let this serve as a warning to those tempted to try," Abdullah tweeted.
The soldiers found guilty and recommended for life term are the commanding officer of 4 Rajput Regiment, the unit involved in the encounter, Colonel Dinesh Pathania, Captain Upendra, Havildar Devinder and Lance Naiks Arun Kumar and Lakhmi. All services benefits of the soldiers have also been suspended.
"The process is still not completed as the confirmation of the sentence is yet to be done by appropriate authority (Northern Army commander)," said an army officer in Delhi.
Court martial proceedings were ordered against six soldiers in December 2013; they ended in September this year. One of them was not found guilty. HT reported on December 26, 2013 that if convicted, the accused could get life imprisonment.
Kashmiri separatists said the verdict was a good beginning if it is followed by justice in similar rights abuse cases.
"It's very positive. We welcome it but the real test lies if justice is done in other cases like Gaw Kadal and Hawal massacres that left more than 100 dead. It's good to make troops accountable," moderate Hurriyat leader Mirwaiz Umar Farooq told HT.
But some Kashmiri separatists said the sentence was a political move aimed at assembly elections in the state as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is hoping to expand its support to the Muslim-dominated Valley where it has no base.
"The elections are round the corner. There is political design in the sudden army magnanimity. India was never serious in delivering justice in Kashmir. Then it should do justice in hundreds of other such cases. The biggest justice is granting the right of self-determination to people," said Hurriyat chairman Syed Ali Geelani.

Watch: Victims' families satisfied with verdict 
Timeline of the case:
April 29, 2010: Relatives of three civilians, all residents of Nadihal village in north Kashmir, file a missing persons report
April 30, 2010: Army claims it has killed three infiltrators at Machil near the Line of Control
May 28, 2010: Bodies are exhumed after relatives identify the clothes of the victims in a police station.
June 2010: Chief judicial magistrate records statements of a senior police officer and three constables from north Kashmir’s Kalaroos police station. The army also starts Court of Inquiry against the accused soldiers.
December 2011: The army invokes the Army Act to seek transfer of Machil fake encounter case from criminal court to court martial on grounds that accused army personnel were on active duty
December 2013: The army announces court martial of six accused soldiers.

Surgeon arrested for sterilisation deaths says he was framedComments
Chhattisgarh police on Thursday arrested the surgeon whose botched sterilisations claimed the lives of 13 women in Bilaspur earlier this week, and will produce him in a court later in the day.

Dr RK Gupta was on the run since the first deaths were reported and an FIR was lodged against him on Tuesday.
The 59-year old surgeon, who was honoured by the Chhattisgarh government on January 26 this year for accomplishing a massive target on mass sterilisation in the state-run campaign, was detained at Baloda Bazar, about 70 km from Bilaspur. 
"He has been arrested today (Thursday) after he was detained in Baloda Bazar district. He will be produced before the court soon," Bilaspur inspector general of police Pawan Deo told HT, adding more arrests are likely to follow. 
Following his arrest, the surgeon told reporters he has been made a scapegoat.
"I am innocent. The health of the women deteriorated owing to the sub-standard drugs prescribed to them following the sterilisation surgery," he claimed.
Gupta, who had operated upon 83 women in six hours last Saturday at the Sakri health camp in Bilaspur (which would mean that he spent just two minutes per tubectomy), was suspended on Tuesday by the state government.
While eight women died on Monday, three on Tuesday and one on Wednesday and at least two dozen others are being treated in various hospitals.
During the campaign even women of primitive tribes, whose sterilisation is banned by the government, were reportedly "coerced" to attend such camps.
Twenty-four-year old Chaiti Bai, a member of Baiga community, died late on Wednesday evening following the botched laparoscopic tubectomy in the camp at Guarela-Pendra in Bilaspur.
Bilaspur commissioner Sonmoni Borah confirmed to HT there were two Baiga women among the 16 who were rushed to Bilaspur from Guarela-Pendra for immediate medical treatment after they underwent sterilisation operation.
Amid reports that rusted equipment were used in the surgeries, a team of doctors from Delhi's premier AIIMS hospital is in Bilaspur to investigate into the incident.
The state government also banned the sale of four medicines which were given to the women after the sterilisation at different camps in Bilaspur on Wednesday. The drugs have been sent to a Kolkata laboratary for tests and analysis.
In the wake of the deaths and the subsequent protests, the Chhattisgarh government has decided to institute a judicial probe into it.
During his visit to Bilaspur to meet the ailing women patients, chief minister Dr Raman Singh declared that judicial commission will inquire into the botched-up sterilisation deaths.
“Instead of any departmental inquiry I have decided for a judicial probe that will thoroughly investigate into every aspect," he said. This was his second visit to Bilaspur after the reports on deaths emerged following the sterilisation in the state-run camp.

Detroit starts down the road to recovery  respectUpdated: November 10, 2014 03:23 IST
Detroit starts down the road to recovery, respect
AP
AP Detroit emergency manager Kevyn Orr addresses the media during a news conference in Detroit on Friday.
TOPICS

The largest U.S. city to endure bankruptcy has exited insolvency $7 billion lighter in debt, but the effects of civic neglect linger for many in Detroit who still fall asleep to echoes of gunfire and awake surrounded by blocks and blocks of abandoned houses.
A federal judge on Friday approved outgoing emergency manager Kevyn Orr’s long—term fiscal recovery plan, which calls for $1.7 billion to remove blight, train city workers, hire more first responders and shore up services to improve the lives of Detroit residents. The city will spend $420 million to raze vacant houses and clear lots; $167 million for new police, fire and EMS vehicles; and $715 million to hire and train workers and for other general upgrades.
Some Detroit residents, like Eugene Weller and Bishop White, wonder how long it will be before they see and feel a full recovery in the city that once was home to nearly 2 million residents and pulsed to the around—the—clock rhythm of auto assembly lines that kept people working and off the streets.
“If it’s going to better everything, I’m for it,” said White, a 67—year—old retired auto worker. “If they are going to (just) fix up downtown neighborhoods, no. I ain’t for it. People still live out here. They’re like forgotten.”
White’s home is one of only four occupied houses on his west—side block and is sandwiched between two empty lots. He wants to buy a lot from the city; crews razed the house that had been there, but the former basement sags and needs more backfill. It’s another example of something the city failed to do right the first time, White said.
“I’m not going to put no money in the lot and then have to live next door to this,” he said, pointing in frustration at the hard, pock—marked dirt.
Restructuring won’t be easy. There will be lean years as elected city leaders search for ways to increase revenue.
Mayor Mike Duggan has said making Detroit more functional could persuade residents to stay and attract new ones. The city’s population is about 688,000, down nearly 30 percent from 2000 and a far cry from the 1.2 million in 1980.
Detroit’s Land Bank has been awarded $52 million in federal money to demolish at least 3,300 of more than 40,000 vacant structures; about 2,300 are already gone. A public lighting authority also is installing thousands of street lights in once—dark neighbourhoods. And Duggan has solicited plenty of community, private foundation and corporate support on a blight eradication plan.
Other improvements include a high—speed rail line being built through Detroit’s downtown and improving Midtown neighbourhoods, and a new professional hockey arena and entertainment district is being built just north of downtown.
The $1.7 billion called for in the plan is “seed capital ... really developing the city’s property tax base so those changes can be sustained at a higher level,” according to Pat O’Keefe, a municipal turnaround specialist and chief executive of O’Keefe and Associates. “The ability to attract industry, commerce and residents is ultimately what’s going to drive the feasibility of the bankruptcy reorganization plan.”
Adding jobs will also help spur any renewal. In his 2013 proposal to creditors, Orr wrote that Detroit’s unemployment rate was more than 18 percent.
“Job creation is a crime preventer,” said Andra Rush, founder of a Michigan—based trucking company, among other things. Detroit Manufacturing Systems a joint venture with Rush’s company that began in 2012, that makes car and truck interiors and has 800 workers is growing and trying to fill about 200 jobs.
And just being able to take home a paycheck also means a lot to people who have struggled for years to find jobs, said Rush.
“It can change the lives of families forever,” Rush said.
Change can’t come quick enough for Weller, who lives in the neglected Brightmoor neighborhood in northwest Detroit. There is gunfire many nights of the week and none of the 10 vacant houses on his block has yet been torn down.
“If you’re out at night and you’re walking through the street you don’t know who is going to come out of these houses,” said Weller, 62, who moved from Texas three years ago to be closer to his children.
Still, the city has fixed a few street lights and installed a new one.
“The neighborhood looks a whole lot better now. You can more or less see what’s going on,” Weller said.

The government is exploring options to set up a facility to monitor advance income tax filings by companies and high networth individuals, on the lines of dedicated monitoring of returns and tax deducted at source (TDS) categories.
The move is in line with the government’s plan to tighten the tax system and improve monitoring of domestic transactions.
It will also help achieve tax collection targets as the overall economic growth improves and companies report higher quarterly earnings, a senior income-tax department official said.
“The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) is evaluating the options and all factors will be considered before any decision is taken. It’s too early to say when the centre will be ready but we expect things to move fast as the department is committed to improve tax collection targets,” Vivek Varun Prasad, chief commissioner of income tax, told HT. “It will also help in faster resolution of grievances.”
The CBDT currently has two central processing centres (CPCs) for monitoring tax returns and TDS. While CPC for returns is located at Bangalore, the CPC at Gurgaon monitors TDS filings.
Although the location of the third centre is still being discussed, it is learnt that Pune and Hyderabad are being considered for their connectivity strengths.
Advance tax collection is closely tracked since it acts as an indicator of the health of Indian companies. Under the Income Tax Act, companies are required to pay 15% of their total advance tax in the first quarter (April-June period), while the remaining tax amount is paid in slabs of 30%, 30% and 25% in the successive quarters respectively.
The government has stressed on improving tax collection targets and bringing back unaccounted money stashed overseas. Recently finance minister Arun Jaitley asked the tax department to monitor domestic black money.

Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi (L) and JP Nadda have ceased to be members of the Select Committee of Parliament after being sworn in as ministers.
The meeting of the Select Committee of Parliament scheduled for Wednesday to deliberate the Insurance Bill for hiking foreign direct investment (FDI) limit in the sector has been postponed as Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi and JP Nadda have ceased to be members after being sworn in as minister of state (independent charge) for minority affairs and health minister respectively.
Bharatiya Janata Party's Rajya Sabha member of Parliament Chandan Mitra, who is the chairman of the committee said, "The meeting has been postponed and would be held as soon as the replacement is made for the two members." The regular procedure would have to be followed to appoint two new members and the next meeting cannot be held until this is done, he added. "As soon as this procedure is completed, the meeting will take place so that the Insurance Bill is cleared in time for being introduced in the Winter Session."
According to sources, the committee was earlier expected to submit its final report to the government in the third week of November. Mitra emphasised that the deadline for introducing the Bill, aimed to raise the FDI cap in the sector from 26 per cent to 49 per cent, in the Winter Session, beginning on November 24, would not be missed.
The National Democratic Alliance government had agreed to the demand of the Congress-led Opposition in August to refer the Bill to the 15-member committee. The meeting is expected to discuss the provisions of the Bill in detail to address concerns of the Congress so that it can be approved in the Winter Session.
According to sources, the Congress has indicated that it will support the Bill if the government agrees to drop amendments proposed to the earlier Bill, which was introduced during the United Progressive Alliance regime.

No invite to PM Narendra Modi: Naidu accuses Cong of "small-mindedness"Sources said that Congress will not invite any leader of BJP and its allies for the event.
By: Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: November 12, 2014 4:46 pm
Hitting out at Congress for not inviting PM Modi to an event to mark Jawaharlal Nehru’s birth anniversary, Urban Development Minister Venkaiah Naidu on Wednesday said it shows the “small- mindedness of the party and its leadership”.
“Nehru was the first Prime Minister of India and Modi is the current Prime Minister. I am amused by the decision of the Congress to not invite Modi to the conference on Nehru when it is inviting leaders from various other countries,” Naidu said here on the sidelines of the inauguration of the Vivekananda Shelter for Homeless at Rohini.
“It only reflects the small-mindedness of the Congress party and its leadership. I am also amused by the reason given by Congress for not inviting the PM, that Modi did not believe in Nehru’s ideology,” he said, adding that “the decision of the Congress party only amused me, though it is not a surprise”.
Sources in Congress have said that no leader of BJP or its allies would be invited to a two-day international conference to be held here on Nov. 17 and 18 which aims to highlight the legacy and worldview of Nehru. The event will be attended by a host of international leaders and representatives of various political parties from India and abroad.
Taking exception to Congress’ decision, Naidu said, “Leaders of different parties may have different thinking and ideologies. But prime ministers, whether past or present, are national leaders and should be seen as such rather than citing ideological differences.”

Tata Steel Q2 net up 37 %
Special Correspondent
annual report
Tata Steel on Wednesday reported a 37 per cent growth in its consolidated net profit for the second quarter of 2014-15 at Rs.1,254 crore. However, the company was benefited by the one-off gain of Rs.1,147 crore from sale of its land in Borivali, Mumbai. Consolidated total income for the period slid 2.4 per cent at Rs.35,777 crore largely due to lower realisations in its European operations..
The profit before exceptional items stood at Rs.1,302 crore (Rs.1,398 crore). Production of steel was almost unchanged at 6.5 million tonne (6.48 million tonne). Addressing a press conference, Koushik Chatterjee, Group Executive Director (Finance & Corporate) said the company was able to maintain profitability levels during the quarter “despite several challenges in the market and the environment.”
The company generated around Rs.4,400 crore of cash flows from operations that were “deployed primarily in the ongoing capital expenditure program helping us marginally decrease the net debt levels.” The consolidated net debt at around Rs.68,000 crore was down Rs.1,600 crore over the year-ago period due to a recent refinancing of $7 billion debt. The capital expenditure in the first half of the year was at Rs.4,500 crore.
In its Indian operations, Tata Steel’s net profit was up 59 per cent at Rs.2,476 crore on 9 per cent higher sales of Rs.10,701 crore. There was a planned shutdown of one of the vessels for long products for 36 days and operating profit was down marginally at Rs.3,196 crore (Rs.3,202 crore) owing to higher iron ore prices. Owing to the shortage of ore in the domestic market, T.V. Narendran, Managing Director, Tata Steel (India & SE Asia) said the company imported 2.2 million tonne in the financial year to date.
Mr. Narendran expected volumes to be ramped up in the next two quarters even as there were strong headwinds due to regulatory uncertainty regarding mining and cheap imports.
Tata Steel Europe reported a profit before tax of Rs.113 crore against a loss of Rs.152 crore in the year-ago period.

NSEL-FTIL merger opposedmerger, acquisition and takeover
Some minority shareholders of Financial Technologies have raised objections to the proposed merger of scam-hit National Spot Exchange Ltd (NSEL) with the company.
To ensure faster recovery of dues for entities hit by the Rs.5,600-crore fraud at NSEL, the government last month ordered the merger of the bourse with its parent firm Financial Technologies (India) Ltd (FTIL).
This is also the first time that the Corporate Affairs Ministry ordered a forced merger of private entities using a provision in the Companies Act that allows the government to intervene for “essential public interest”.
Sources said the ministry had received objections from some minority shareholders on the proposed amalgamation.
Specific details were not immediately available.
The payment crisis at NSEL came to light in July 2013, and the decision to merge it with FTIL has been taken as the bourse is “not left with any viable, sustainable business while FTIL has necessary resources to facilitate speedy recovery of dues.”
The proposal would have a final shape after taking into account submissions or objections made by the shareholders and creditors of the two companies.

A breakthrough is expected in talks between the government and the World Trade Organization (WTO) to end a deadlock on implementing a global trade deal struck in 2013, two sources close to the talks said on Thursday.
"The minister is going to announce a breakthrough at the WTO," said one of the sources, who spoke on conditions of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak on the record to the press.
Trade minister Nirmala Sitharaman was due to give a statement shortly, a government official in the national capital said.
At the end of July, Prime Minister Narendra Modi pulled the plug on implementing a Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) struck in Bali in 2013, linking it to the emotive issue of rural poverty in the country.
The government had wanted indefinitely to extend a 'peace clause' to protect a subsidised food distribution scheme until the WTO could strike a definitive deal on stockpiling. In Bali, the WTO agreed that the clause would expire in four years.
The trade row had isolated the domestic economy and plunged the trade body into its worst crisis in two decades, as countries led by the United States considered abandoning the principle of consensus under which the 160-nation group works.

Dipping crude price not to benefit public as govt plans to raise duty on petrol  dieselFIPB role shrinks amid easier FDI flows
The government would mop up further benefits of a sliding international price of crude oil by raising the excise duty on both petrol and diesel by Rs 1.50 per litre so as to leave the pump prices unchanged.
Ahead of a possible reduction this weekend in prices of both decontrolled products, secretaries of finance and petroleum met on Tuesday to consider raising the excise duty matching the proposed cut so as to leave the consumers unaffected while benefitting the national exchequer which is groaning under a lower realisation of indirect taxes.
Moreover, it would partially make up for the loss in revenue from excise and customs duty because of the wider economic slowdown.
The first discussion on this issue was held last week in the finance ministry and the two secretaries Tuesday agreed to a duty hike before the state-run oil marketing companies revise rates of petrol and diesel on Saturday, said sources.
The Centre levies a specific per litre duty, unaffected by the price movement, of Rs 9.20 per litre of central excise duty is levied on petrol and Rs 3.46 per litre in the case of diesel. Apart from raising government revenue, the move is seen as a fund buffer to plug the deficit in case crude prices harden in the future. Also, a stiff price rise in such a situation would create more flutter were the government to pass on the crude price rise in terms of stiff increase in petrol and diesel prices.
Petrol has lost Rs 12 per litre in over a year while diesel has gone down Rs 5 per litre in less than three months. A further cut in pump prices would make future upwards revision definitely unpalatable politically, said sources.
Petrol prices are down to Rs 64.24 a litre in Delhi now from a peak of over Rs 76 in September 2013. Diesel is down from Rs 58.97 per litre to Rs 53.35 in Delhi and its fall gave the government leeway to take the politically tough decision to decontrol its price on October 18. Crude oil prices are forecast to dip further in December considering the futures trade, said sources.

London: Gandhi statue garners donations from across the globeEconomist Meghnad Desai, who chairs the trust gathering funds for a statue of Mahatma Gandhi in Parliament Square, said on Wednesday that small and large donations were pouring in from across the globe.
Photo of Gandhi statue cast, produced by noted British sculptor Philip Jackson.
Presenting an update on the statue announced by Chancellor George Osborne during his visit to India in July, Desai, who chairs the Gandhi Statue Memorial Trust, told newspersons that work on completing the sculpture, and on the fundraising was ‘going full steam ahead’.
Desai said during the briefing at the House of Lords: "I had a call yesterday from someone in India and he promised me a six-figure sum in donation. He is a good friend and I am looking forward to that."
He added: "The word is spreading around. We are getting very good support from donors and we have lots of pledges and money is also coming in through our website. I have also written to my colleagues in the House of Lords and they are doing their bit to help too. We are pretty sure we will achieve what we have set out to achieve."
He did not disclose the full amount raised so far, but indicated that ‘plenty of pledges’ were coming in from big donors. Small donations were also continuing to flow into the trust’s website from all over the world, he added.
There are efforts to ensure that the statue unveiling is done by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, though no confirmation has been delivered so far.
From all indications the statue will be ready for unveiling and the required funds raised by January end. However, he said the trust could not give an assurance of the precise date of unveiling, as its mandate was limited to raising the funds.
Noted British sculptor Philip Jackson gave a detailed account of how he chose a particular image for Mahatma Gandhi, helped by photographs and books given by Desai and the Indian High Commissioner, Ranjan Mathai.
Jackson was also able to give Gandhi a look of determination, when he met Gopalkrishna Gandhi, in London, who told him about this particular quality that Gandhi possessed. The statue is now in the process of being cast in bronze and would be ready for the proposed unveiling in early 2015.
Deepak Yadav, a UK-based Indian entrepreneur who has donated generously, spoke about why it was important for young people come forward and donate. He said he did not consider it a donation, but an honour and an investment in the future.

RBI needs to do more to curb unregulated investment fundsNeha Dasgupta and Suvashree Choudhury     Mumbai   Last Updated: November 13, 2014  | 11:39 IST
Photo: Reuters
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) may have tightened rules for the country's "shadow banks" this week, but it has yet to tackle the complex problem of unregulated, "chit" or small investment funds that serve hundreds of millions of villagers and small businesses.
India, analysts say, needs to do more to get to grips with the roughly 18,000 collective investment funds raising money from small investors, often by promising exaggerated returns.
Although these funds are legally supervised by states, they attract little scrutiny from the country's under-resourced regulators. Meanwhile, both the RBI and the government are grappling with the practicalities of the problem, and neither has indicated how they will tackle it.
Little data exists on how much money these funds have raised from investors, but it adds up. A fund run by media conglomerate Saradha Group in West Bengal state went bust last year, wiping out as much as $3.7 billion in deposits.
The problem is accentuated as large banks are reluctant to push into less profitable areas, leaving 41 per cent of households in India without bank accounts and an easy target for chit funds.
"With newer scams coming up, it requires a combined regulator approach and ideas," said Mangesh Kulkarni, analyst at brokerage Almondz Global Securities. "The government needs to take more steps, to decide which entity needs to come under which regulator. I don't think RBI can take a call on its own."
Rules unveiled on Monday by the central bank, demanding more reserves and tougher rules on loans, cover the roughly 12,000 non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) that are registered with the RBI.
These NBFCs play a key role in extending banking and credit to areas that traditional finance cannot reach. But operating alongside these are about 18,000 funds that are far less regulated.
State finance officials say they have limited resources or financial know-how to oversee these funds and say the country needs to accelerate the availability of banking resources.
"We need a special intelligence collection team consisting of bankers and skilled professionals who can gather information, identify problems in financial schemes," said Arvind Srivastava, secretary in the budget and resources division with Karnataka.
"Increased banking coverage where people do not have access to banks would help," he added.
Meanwhile, a policy maker with direct knowledge of the RBI's policymaking discussions said the central bank governor, Raghuram Rajan , was debating the role the central bank could take in regulating NBFCs not already registered with it.
"(Rajan) is apprehensive," he said. "We need more market intelligence and greater co-ordination with other regulators."

India overtakes China as world s biggest gold consumerGlobal gold demand falls to near 5-year low in Q3, says WGC
Jan Harvey     London   Last Updated: November 13, 2014  | 13:14 IST

Global gold demand fell to its lowest in nearly five years in the third quarter as Chinese buying slid by a third, the World Gold Council said on Thursday, putting it back behind India as the world's biggest gold consumer.
Total gold demand fell 2 per cent to 929 tonnes in the third quarter, the data, prepared in conjunction with GFMS analysts at Thomson Reuters, showed. That is the lowest since the last three months of 2009.
Last year's number one consumer China saw a 39 per cent drop in jewellery consumption as well as a 30 per cent fall in bar and coin investment. Combined demand fell 37 per cent.
India once again took over as the world's biggest gold consumer, buying 225.1 tonnes of gold jewellery, coins and bars last quarter, compared to 182.7 tonnes in China.
India, which lost its crown as the leading gold buyer to China in 2011, saw a 60 per cent surge in jewellery demand in the third quarter.
"Our forecast for the full year is the same for both India and China. We expect demand in both to come in at between 850-950 tonnes," Alistair Hewitt, head of market intelligence at the World Gold Council, said. "Both remain very positive pillars of gold demand."
Demand for gold snowballed in the wake of the financial crisis that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, as investors sought the metal as a portfolio diversifier and safe store of value.
It peaked in 2011 at 4,702 tonnes, but had fallen to 4,080 tonnes by last year. Prices XAU=, which crashed 28 per cent last year, have fallen another 3.3 per cent in 2014. This year the WGC expects gold demand to stabilise.
"We expect gold demand to be largely similar to last year, at between 4,000-4,100 tonnes," said Hewitt.
The third quarter marked the seventh consecutive quarter of outflows from exchange-traded funds. Holdings of the vehicles, which issue securities backed by physical gold, fell 41.3 tonnes last quarter, the data showed.
Global demand for gold jewellery, the biggest single area of consumption, fell 4 per cent to 534 tonnes.
Among supply sources, mine production rose 1 per cent to 812 tonnes, while scrap supply fell 25 per cent to 250.5 tonnes. Year to date, 2014 has seen the lowest level of recycling since 2007, the WGC said.

Food Stockpiling
("Both have resolved differences…)
NEW DELHI: India has reached an agreement with the United States on public stockpiling of food on Thursday, paving the way for the implementation of a global trade facilitation deal that has been stalled for months.
"India and the United States have resolved their differences on public stockholding of food," Nirmala Sitharaman said. "This opens the way for implementation of the WTO trade facilitation deal."
The proposals will be reviewed by the World Trade Organization's General Council, she added, expressing the hope that approval would clear the way for India to sign a protocol enabling implementation of the trade accord.
We are glad to say that US has appreciated and now openly supported our concerns on public stockholding. #wto

"While there was much media debate and concerns expressed regarding the impact of India's stand in the WTO, it has undeniably resonated across the world. Many countries saw merit in what we were asking for. India was not alone or isolated. Others were simply not speaking up," a press release issues by the Commerce Ministry said.

Commitment to the Trade Facilitation Agreement
> India has reiterated its commitment to the Trade Facilitation Agreement a number of times.
> We recognise its value for trade and for that reason we agreed to it in the larger interest of global trade.
> However, for developing countries the benefits may not be commensurate with the associated costs. Implementation of the rest of the Bali Decisions will give some comfort to the developing countries and LDCs, even though most of the non-binding decisions do not hold out the promise of substantial gains for these countries. We will continue to work for the implementation of the Bali Package and the DDA.
India had asked WTO to amend the norms for calculating agri subsidies so that the country could continue to procure foodgrains from farmers at minimum support price and sell them to poor at cheaper rates without violating the WTO norms.
The current WTO norms limit the value of food subsidies at 10 per cent of the total value of foodgrain production. However, the quantum of subsidy is computed after taking into consideration prices that prevailed two decades ago.
There are apprehensions that once India would fully implement its food security programme it may breach the cap.
With the issue having been resolved, Sitharaman said: "We supported the Bali Package but when subsequent developments belied that hope, India had no option but to seek a course correction.
"India, therefore, took the stand that till there was an assurance of our concerns being addressed, it would be difficult to join the consensus on the Protocol of Amendment for the Trade Facilitation Agreement," she added.

Why LG failed to grow sales in India | Xiaomi  Moto make fight tough for Android OneLG Electronics fails to grow its sales in Indian market in FY14

("Focus on premiumisation…)
KOLKATA | MUMBAI: LG Electronics failed to grow its sales in the Indian market for the third straight year in FY14, raising fresh questions about the South Korean electronics major's strategy of focusing on premium products.
LG Electronics India , which was the country's largest consumer electronics company just five years ago, is now reduced to nearly a fourth of its towering rival Samsung after it reported just 1% rise in net sales for the year ended March 2014 at Rs 11,580 crore as per its latest filing to the Registrar of Companies (RoC). Samsung India , in comparison, grew its sales 45% at Rs 40,392 crore.
Samsung's exponential growth is powered by its booming mobile handset business, true, but LG India is losing ground to others and is struggles to hold on to its market share across product categories. Sony India, for example, has narrowed the gap with LG significantly with Rs 10,000 crore in sales last fiscal and it's targetingRs 12,000 crore this year.
Four senior industry executives ET spoke to pointed to a host of strategic factors that halted LG's growth in India in recent years. They include: LG repositioning itself as a premium brand with higher price tags and focus on high-end products; focus on exclusive stores in a market where a bulk of sales now happen at large multibrand chains; failure to fill the void created after exiting Rs 2,500-crore CRT television business last year; and, inability to crack the smartphone market.
"Apart from internal changes in business strategy where the focus is on driving profit, LG has been hit hard by the slowdown in sales of the white goods industry which was flat in last three years and it not being able to grow fast enough in categories like smartphones and flat televisions, which grew exponentially," one of them said.
LG, however, refused to acknowledge any strategic failure. "It seems that you are planning to do a story based on outdated and historical data in this fastmoving world," an LG India spokesperson said in response to a detailed questionnaire sent by ET. "We do not subscribe to the facts and figures relied on by you. Any story and news item based on such factually incorrect data may not reflect the correct picture," the spokesperson said.
Its focus on premiumisation did help LG India boost its profitability. Despite flat sales, the company reported an impressive 31% growth in its profit for 2013-14 at Rs 634 crore. "The parent is not much perturbed by LG India's flat sales since it is delivering healthy profit and that too in home appliances and air-conditioners, which are tough businesses," an industry executive said. This is at a time when the parent company is reporting losses and betting on few top geographies like India and its smartphone business to get back into black.
The LG spokesperson said the company is registering impressive business growth this year. "During this festive season, we have broken all our previous records. We would like to reiterate that LG has the highest market share in consumer durables category. With the robust product portfolio based on Indian insights, LG will further strengthen its market shares," she said.
While LG India has been trying to gain a foothold in the booming Indian smartphone market, just released data by Counterpoint Research shows that its share has declined to 1% in the quarter ended September, down from 1.4% in the year-ago period. Tarun Pathak, senior analyst at Counterpoint Research, said that while LG is one of the few vendors offering devices in the premium segment, sales are more polarised towards Apple iPhone due to aspirational nature of the brand.
"Right now, LG is sandwiched and facing competition from Apple and Samsung at the premium end, while in the entry-tomid segment the local and Chinese smartphone vendors are ruling. LG needs to be more aggressive in marketing and should adopt leaner go-to-market strategy as it has a fantastic product portfolio," he said.
In white goods, while LG India has lost leadership in air-conditioners to Tata-owned Voltas in multi-brand outlet sales, Samsung and Whirlpool are giving it tough competition in products like double-door refrigerators, side-by-side refrigerators and fully-automatic washing machines.
However, LG is still the undisputed market leader in directcool refrigerators, semi-automatic washing machines and microwave ovens. In flat panel TVs, LG is at the third slot with the Samsung-Sony duo controlling more than 60% of the market.

(The company’s net profit…)
MUMBAI: Shares of oil marketing company BPCL were witnessing profit booking after CLSA downgraded the stock to 'Underperform' from 'Buy' after second quarter results.
The company's net profit in September quarter fell by about 50 per cent to Rs 464.20 crore from Rs 931.13 crore in the corresponding quarter last fiscal.
According to the management, sharp fall in crude oil prices impacted gross refining margins (GRMs )in second quarter. It expects to see improvement in GRMs in third and fourth quarter.
Average GRMs for half year ended September was $2.36 per barrel.
The company is taking measures to improve non-fuel side of business.
CLSA is of the view that that oil marketing companies no more benefit from falling crude price. The brokerage cautions that these companies may have to bear one-time inventory losses due to declining crude oil prices.
"Recent stock price builds in continuation of supernormal marketing margins and ignores the risks of upcoming competition from private players," the CLSA report said.
"Marketing margin and volumes of OMCs will be at risk as competition from private players ramps up in the auto fuel marketing space in the coming months," it added.
The last minute subsidy reimbursement from government has boosted Q2 earnings, the report says
CLSA has revised its target price upwards to Rs 800 from Rs 675 earlier.

India  US resolve WTO impasseclimate change (politics)
Food security deadlock resolved ahead of WTO meet
Decks have been cleared for a possible global trade deal after India and the U.S agreed on the way forward to break the logjam in global trade negotiations. With the agreement in place, India is all set to move its proposal on food security before the WTO’s General Council at its next meeting scheduled for early December.
This proposal will seek to make open-ended the interim protection of a ‘peace clause’ that was agreed to at the Bali Ministerial last December.
The clause safeguards support prices for farmers against the WTO’s limits on agricultural subsidies. India was in danger of breaching these subsidy caps.
India wants to make sure that this protection would be available in perpetuity, should a permanent solution to the problem of the WTO agriculture subsidy caps not be found. Whether the Bali Declaration provides that the ‘peace clause’ could be available beyond 2017 was open to interpretation.
India’s right
Announcing that an agreement had been reached with the U.S, Minister of State for Commerce and Industry Nirmala Sitharaman said on Thursday that the U.S had agreed that India’s right to protect its right to food security cannot be denied by the WTO, paving the way for removing the imperfections in the Bali Ministerial package.
U.S Trade Representative Michael Froman also released a statement which said the agreement with India reflected shared understandings regarding the WTO’s work on food security.
Sources on the Indian side indicated that the resolution was possible after an understanding was reached with the U.S that India’s subsidies are not trade-distorting and aimed at achieving food security. India, on the other hand, was able to reassure the U.S that it was not opposed to trade facilitation and in fact was on course to implement it.
Nirmala Sitharaman: we are moving towards a satisfactory resolution of the impasse at WTO; all our concerns being addressed favourably.
— Puja Mehra (@pujamehra) November 13, 2014
Clears way for TFAs
“The agreement announced today between the United States and India paves the way for full implementation of the WTO’s Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA), the first multilateral trade agreement to be concluded in the history of the WTO,” the U.S statement on the India-U.S. agreement on food subsidies said on Thursday.
At the WTO’s Ministerial Conference held in Bali last December, all its members, including the U.S and India, had agreed to a package of measures including a TFA and a commitment to find a permanent solution to the problematic agricultural subsidy caps. India’s position is that the WTO’s farm subsidies need to be updated as they are benchmarked to food prices of the 1980s.
Efforts to put the TFA in place were dealt a setback in July, when India refused to ratify, it raising concerns over the unsatisfactory progress on the WTO’s work on food security issues. The U.S statement said that delay has now been overcome with the agreement with India in place for moving forward with the full implementation of the Bali package.
“We supported the Bali Package but when subsequent developments belied that hope, India had no option but to seek a course correction,” the India statement said. It also said that the impasse at the WTO was now likely to end, opening the way for implementation of the TFA.
“We are extremely happy that India and the U.S have successfully resolved their differences relating to the issue of public stockholding for food security purposes in the WTO in a manner that addresses our concerns,” the India statement said. The agreement will facilitate Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s bilateral meetings at the ongoing G-20 summit in Brisbane.

India  ASEAN can be great partners: Modiheads of state
A new era of economic development, industrialisation and trade has begun in India, he said at the India—ASEAN summit at Nay Pyi Taw in Myanmar.
Asserting that there are “no irritants” in the India-ASEAN relationship, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday told ASEAN leaders that a new era of economic development, industrialisation and trade has begun in India and they can be “great partners” for each other.
As India seeks to deepen its engagement with the 10-nation bloc of small and medium economies, Modi said both India and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are keen to enhance their cooperation in advancing balance, peace and stability in the region.
“The ASEAN community is India’s neighbour. We have ancient relations of trade, religion, culture, art and traditions. We have enriched each other through our interaction. This constitutes a strong foundation of a modern relationship,” Modi said in his opening statement in Hindi at the 12th India—ASEAN summit in the Myanmarese capital.
“That is why our world view is similar in many respects; our mutual confidence and trust is strong. We have no irritants in our relationship. We see encouraging opportunities and challenges in the world in similar ways,” he said.
Observing that India and the ASEAN have been successful to a considerable extent in pursuing their dreams, Modi said they have laid a foundation for a strong and comprehensive strategic partnership.
“My government has been in office for six months and the intensity and momentum with which we have enhanced our engagement in the East, is a reflection of the priority that we give to this region,” the Prime Minister said at the summit held at the sprawling Myanmar International Convention Centre on the second day of his 10—day three—nation tour of Myanmar, Australia and Fiji.
“A new era of economic development, industrialisation and trade has begun in India. Externally, India’s ‘Look East Policy’ has become ‘Act East Policy’,” he said.
“Rapidly developing India and ASEAN can be great partners for each other. We are both keen to enhance our cooperation in advancing balance, peace and stability in the region,” the Prime Minister said.

Tech wars: Samsung aims to restore crumbling...Samsung Electronics chases curved smartphone wave to beat flat-screen crowd

On sale in South Korea since late October for close to $1,000, and also on sale in Japan, the Note Edge is soon to debut in the United States. 
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
SEOUL: Samsung Electronics Co Ltd aims to restore its crumbling lead in the global smartphone industry in part by ramping up high-end devices with curved screens full of advanced technology that's tough for rivals to replicate.
Yet as the South Korean giant seeks to make devices like the rigid-curve Galaxy Note Edge stand out from a crowd of flat, big-screen handsets, making money will depend on producing them cost-effectively and coaxing developers to tailor applications for the new format.
Samsung Electronics is headed for its worst annual profit in three years, under siege as Chinese firms like Xiaomi Technology Co and Lenovo Group Ltd reel in buyers with full-function touch-screen smartphones that are cheaper. Only Apple Inc has maintained full brand premium.
The collective industry move towards larger screens makes distinctive designs tougher to achieve, said Kim Nam-su, a senior Samsung Electronics designer and an architect of the Note Edge. "A change in the platform can bring about a variety of new considerations...I think a curved screen is a big solution for overcoming those challenges," he said.
As Samsung Electronics moves towards what analysts say could be a nearly one-third drop in operating profit this year, it's launching more mid-tier phones to counter cheaper rivals. But a high-tech edge for the premium market could also help it compete in an industry that international research firm CCS Insight sees growing to $331 billion by 2018 from $289 billion this year.
The Note Edge is not the first device to use a non-flat format. But the curved edge on the device is designed to be more than just a gimmick, offering shortcuts to apps, as well as customisation to display message notifications or stream headlines independent of the main screen.
RIGID CURVE
On sale in South Korea since late October for close to $1,000, and also on sale in Japan, the Note Edge is soon to debut in the United States. It has been well reviewed in the technology press, a departure from recent knocks that Samsung Electronics goods didn't stand out against the competition.
While the Note Edge's rigid curve sets it apart, in the premium handset market its rivals include devices like Apple's iPhone 6 Plus, LG Electronics Inc's G3 and HTC Corp's One M8 handsets.
Subsidiary Samsung Display Co and its rival LG Display Co Ltd are so far the only firms that can mass-produce the flexible displays needed to make curved smartphones, having invested more in developing the organic light-emitting diode technology used to manufacture them. Analysts say that investment lead will make it difficult for rivals to produce imitations quickly.
Samsung Electronics declined to give early sales figures or expected profit margins for the Note Edge, but the specialist screen technology required means the curved display is difficult to make and likely more expensive - something the firm needs to address. The Note Edge retails in South Korea for about $100 more than the company's flat-screen counterpart, the Note 4.
In addition, technology for other parts like batteries, circuit boards and touch-screen layers need to advance further to keep pace with radical screen designs. In a vicious cycle, per-unit costs will remain comparatively high until and unless components reach mass production.
"For future devices where concept designs include tightly rollable devices with a very small radius of curvature, every major component will need to be redesigned to fit into a package form factor that can withstand a high degree of flexing," said Strategy Analytics analyst Stuart Robinson.
Beyond hardware, the challenge for Samsung Electronics in making curved products must-have gadgets, rather than a gimmick,
is to convince potential buyers that they can do things on a curved gadget more easily and effectively than on a flat screen.
To do that, it must foster the development of applications offering users something new that makes a virtue of the differentiated screen curvature - and convince developers to invest in what remains a niche product for now.
"Every time the mobile phone industry has seen disruption is when the input or interaction experience has changed," said Counterpoint analyst Neil Shah. "Maybe now Samsung with bent, or flex displays could develop a new way of interaction with mobile devices, pushing an ecosystem around that."

The victory lifted Misbah one ahead of Imran Khan and Javed Miandad’s joint Pakistan record of 14 test victories
Misbah-ul-Haq became Pakistan’s most successful test captain with a thumping 248-run victory in the first test against New Zealand on Thursday.
The victory lifted Misbah one ahead of Imran Khan and Javed Miandad’s joint Pakistan record of 14 test victories.
New Zealand’s No.10 Ish Sodhi delayed the inevitable for over an hour on the fifth and final day and top-scored with a gritty career-best 63 before he was the last man to go.
Sodhi shared a 54-run last-wicket stand with Trent Boult.
Chasing a 480-run target, New Zealand was left lurching at 174-8 on the fourth day as they failed to cope with either the spinning duo of Yasir Shah (3-74) and Zulfiqar Babar (2-48) or the reverse swing of Imran Khan (2-37) and Rahat Ali (2-48).

Maharashtra assembly: Is it possible for BJP govt to survive without SenaComments
Although chief minister Devendra Fadnavis' minority government passed its first test on the floor of the state Assembly through a controversial voice vote, the question on everyone's mind is whether the BJP will be able to hold on to its seat for the next five years.
Political analysts and sources within the party admit that the current scenario, where the NCPfs support is "issue-based", cannot last for the entire tenure.
With former ally Shiv Sena now positioned as the main Opposition party, the fate of the saffron alliance in the country's richest civic corporation, Mumbai, and the Sena's role in the NDA government are uncertain.
"It's obvious that the Delhi leadership has a plan, otherwise we wouldn't have taken such a huge risk. We are not fools to depend on the NCP. In the next six months, we will get several other legislators on board. It will not be difficult to get them elected on our party ticket," said a senior BJP leader, requesting anonymity.

He, however, said the rapprochement with Sena was still not a closed chapter. A section within the state BJP, including CM Fadnavis, want to join hands with the Sena instead of the NCP. A group within the Sena - including some of Uddhav Thackeray's close aides - are also hopeful of becoming part of the government.
Analysts, however, feel that Operation Lotus - breaking legislators from other parties and getting them re-elected on BJP symbol - as it had been dubbed in Karnataka, may not work in Maharashtra.
"In Maharashtra, there are five parties in the fray. It's not going to be easy to get 10 legislators re-elected. Logically, a mid-term election after one year is a strong possibility. Accepting the NCP as an ally will hit the BJP and PM Narendra Modi's image," said Prakash Bal, a political analyst.
But, at present, the BJP has little choice but to accept the NCP's support. Sharad Pawar's party with its 41 legislators will play an important role in getting important legislations such as the right to services bill, finance bills, Lokayukta amendment cleared in the state legislature in the next few sessions.
The NCP’s role will be more important in the Legislative Council with its 28 MLCs, where BJP (11 MLCs) cannot clear bills on its own strength. Many things now depend on the Sena. If Thackeray takes a confrontational stance and ensures the Opposition has an edge, BJP’s troubles will increase.
“If Thackeray continues to be indecisive, then Sena will be led down the garden path by the BJP. But if the BJP has to be forced to prove its numbers, then Uddhav will have to get aggressive,” said Bal.
The suspension of five Congress legislators for the next two years will also benefit the BJP, as it has brought down the numbers it needs for the next no confidence motion from 145 to 140.

Tamil film Thirudan Police a tribute to fathers: Caarthick RajuPrint
By: Indo-Asian News Service | Chennai | Posted: November 13, 2014 1:49 pm
“It’s an emotional story that focuses on the bond between a father and son. The film starts on the conflict between a disciplinarian father and his wayward son. The relationship is explored in such a way that it becomes a tribute to fathers,” Caarthick Raju.
Director Caarthick Raju’s forthcoming Tamil action-comedy “Thirudan Police”, which releases in cinemas Friday, will focus on a father-son relationship that will be explored as a tribute to all fathers.
“It’s an emotional story that focuses on the bond between a father and son. The film starts on the conflict between a disciplinarian father and his wayward son. The relationship is explored in such a way that it becomes a tribute to fathers,” Caarthick Raju.
A special song on fathers comes with the end credits. “We came up with this idea of having pictures of all the technicians and actors with their fathers. We end the film with an emotional song. I decided that featuring photographs of the team with their fathers will be a great idea,” he said.
The inspiration for the father-son relationship, which he assures won’t be melodramatic, came from a short story Caarthick’s father had written.
“You wouldn’t find an overdose of drama. I can guarantee it. Moreover, the father-son bond is explored at some important instances, and not on a full-length basis,” he added.
The other aspect of the film is a thriller featuring a cop with a vengeance.
“My script is based on the hide-and-seek’ game that children play. The story is how hide-and-seek continues to be played in adulthood when a thief and a cop come head-to-head,” he said.
Featuring Dinesh and Aishwarya Rajesh, “Thirudan Police” is jointly produced by S.P Charan and J. Selvakumar.
Dinesh had committed to the project even before his last release “Cuckoo”. “I felt Dinesh was most apt for the film because his attitude is best suited for the script. Nobody else would look best in the role of a police constable. We all remember police inspectors and commissioners, but rarely does anyone remember a constable,” he said.
Caarthick added that audiences will get to see the “fun, pain and suffering of a police constable through the eyes of Dinesh”.
The film also features John Vijay, Bala Saravanan, Nithin Satya and Rajendran.

RBI to invite payment bank applications by ...RBI to invite payment bank applications by month-end: Raghuram Rajan
PTI Nov 13, 2014, 02.12PM IST
(Addressing micro-financiers…)
MUMBAI: The Reserve Bank by month-end will invite applications for setting up small finance and payment banks, which will cater to low-income households and small businesses, after putting in place final norms in this regard.
These banks are expected to bring in a large chunk of the public, especially in rural areas and other places with low penetration, into the formal banking system.
"We visualise mobile companies, companies with large rural presence, may be shops, may be kiosks, as well as possibly the post offices seeking payment bank licences," RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan said.
"In the weeks to come, we would put out the final guidelines on payment banks. The guidelines are currently with the government for comments. I am hopeful that by the end of the month we will call applications for both small finance and payment banks," he said at a micro finance conclave, organised by the Nabard here.
Deepening the financial inclusion was one of the five items of agenda Rajan had set for himself after he took over last year.
The central bank had earlier awarded universal banking licences to infra lender IDFC and micro lender Bandhan. The two new licences were issued after a gap of 12 years.
One of the suggestions from the industry on the draft guidelines on small banks, Rajan said, is allowing all-India small finance banks instead local area ones.
But, the governor said, if at all the proposal was accepted, they will be allowed to take only deposits and extend loans predominantly to small entities.
Stating that the small bank licence would offer avenue for successful micro-finance institutions to migrate to banking licence without it affecting their core business of working with small and the excluded, Rajan said a decision on this has to come from the government.
Small finance banks would provide a whole suite of basic banking products such as deposits and supply of credit, but in a limited area of operations.
Payment banks would offer a limited range of products such as demand deposits and remittances. They would have a widespread network of access points particularly in remote areas, either through their own branch network or through business correspondents or through networks provided by others.

Tata Tele in talks for Smart City ProjectNon-Voice Services
(Bharti Airtel, Vodafone…)
NEW DELHI: Tata Teleservices is in talks with multiple departments and government bodies of the country to provide Wi-Fi service under Narendra Modi Government's Rs 78,000 crore 100 Smart Cities project , a top official said.
"Various cities and state governments are doing trials and we are part of some of those trials. We have started discussions with multiple departments and government bodies for Wi-Fi service under the project," Sunil Tandon, Tata DoCoMo's Head of Non-Voice Services , told ET.
Tandon said that high speed internet will be an integral part of all Smart City roll outs and Wi-Fi will be one of the methods of providing it. "Wi-Fi will exist alongside many other technologies and will be the most optimum way for providing internet access in certain use cases and certain geographies," he added.
Tata Teleservices had launched its Wi-Fi business last year and has now expanded its service across top eight cities -Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Chennai, Kolkata, Pune and Ahmedabad.
Bharti Airtel, Vodafone India , Idea Cellular and Sistema Shyam Teleservices are some telecom service providers that are offering Wi-Fi services in select cities of the country.
While airwaves and mobile permits need to be purchased for 2G, 3G and 4G data services, Wi-Fi airwaves are freely available globally and can be used as an alternate proposition for connecting to the Internet in a limited geographic area.
Tata Tele has made Wi-Fi services available in more than 1,200 hotspots, and is now expanding services across these cities to increase its revenue from data services in the country. It is adding more hotspots across airports, hotels, malls, retail chains, fast-food chains, educational institutes and cafes across these cities.
In the last 12 months, Tata Tele has seen the number of users on its Wi-fi network growing by 2.5 times, while data traffic has gone up by almost 3 times. "The coming 12 months will be higher," Tandon reckons.
The company also provides public hotspots in certain areas across all these cities. Wi-Fi on the go is another area, though in its early days which Tata Tele wants to tap in the coming future. It is looking at providing service in public transport. CDMA player Sistema Shyam already provides Wi-Fi services in Gurgaon's Rapid Metro.
"Currently our focus is to build scale in only the top cities rather spreading across the country. In top cities, there is more data consumption happening. The intent, in the next four to six quarters, is to reach a critical mass before we go for the next round of roll outs," Tandon said.
According to him, certain central and state government departments and ministries are looking at providing Wi-Fi service to people at large, which Tata Tele would be tapping going forward.
The telco has 3G networks in nine telecom circles in the country. Tandon said that Wi-Fi service complements its cellular networks in these circles. "In some countries, 70% traffic comes from Wi-Fi networks. In India, it is just the opposite, thus there's a lot of head room for data to grow through Wi-fi hotspot, provided there's critical mass."
On the competition from incumbent telcos, Tandon said that the space is in early stages, thus competition is good as it bring more consumer awareness and make the service more prevalent across.

WTO stand-off ends: India  US strike deal over food subsidy; full Bali package next targetIndia, US settle row over food security
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, November 13, 2014
First Published: 11:24 IST(13/11/2014) | Last Updated: 08:26 IST(14/11/2014)
Comments
India and the United States scripted a compromise formula on food subsidies on Thursday, paving the way to remove a major irritant in the stalled World Trade Organization (WTO) deal on easing of customs rules.
As part of a revised proposal, India and the US have agreed for an indefinite “peace clause” on food security until a permanent solution is found, marking a major success for the Narendra Modi government in global trade talks withstanding mounting diplomatic pressure from developed countries.
A “peace clause” gives legal security to member countries and protects them from being challenged under other WTO agreements.
HT first reported on September 22 the possibility the of breakthrough during Prime Minister Modi’s visit to the US when he discussed the issue with President Barack Obama.
Developed nations have shown support for a “peace clause” that would agree to developing countries’ demands on food security for a period of four years.
India, however, was pressing for a guarantee for further exemption until a permanent solution is negotiated and to find a way to allow countries the right to provide higher levels of subsidies for their poor beyond these four years.

The latest move will likely help WTO members ratify the so-called trade facilitation agreement (TFA) to make trade easier, faster and cheaper by making systems transparent and reducing red tape.
In July, India had withstood mounting pressure from the developed countries including the US, which had blamed New Delhi’s hard bargain strategy for the eventual collapse of the talks putting the WTO’s future in “uncertain ground.”
India had made it clear that state-funded welfare schemes for the poor were non-negotiable even as it took the blame for blocking the TFA in July, as it did not come bundled with a roadmap for rules on food subsidies.
"The United States and India reached agreement today (Thursday) on a set of measures intended to break the impasse in the work of the World Trade Organization (WTO) to implement the agreements reached last December," said a US government statement.
The two countries agreed that India's food security programmes would not be challenged under WTO rules "until a permanent solution regarding this issue has been agreed and adopted," it said.
India's commerce minister Nirmala Sitharaman tweeted that India and the US had "successfully resolved their impasse over food security issues in #WTO".
"WTO General Council will receive India's proposal and US will support us," she said.
Even after Modi's talks with Obama in September, India, however, held the view that without a permanent solution on food subsidies, public stockholding programmes such as buffer stock of food-grains will be hampered.
Existing rules cap the value of food subsidies at 10% of the value of production. But, the way the support is calculated at prices of more nearly three decades earlier means many countries would find it difficult to stay within the limit potentially attracting strong penalties from the trade body.
This will affect India’s food security programme and food grain procurement through the minimum support prices (MSP).
Bali package
New Delhi's decision in July to hold up the TFA to reduce trade barriers came after the WTO's members agreed at a December, 2013, meeting in the Indonesian island of Bali to implement the pact.
At the time of the Bali accord, WTO members agreed on a four-year "peace clause" to protect India from being punished over subsidies and stockpiles until a "permanent" solution" was reached. The agreement was due to take effect in mid-2015.
But after the Bali pact, Indian officials complained there were nearly two dozen meetings on the trade facilitation pact and just a handful on subsidies.
Bali was the first multilateral agreement concluded by the WTO since its inception in 1995.
It also signalled the first concrete progress on the Doha Round of trade liberalisation talks, launched in 2001 and aimed at underpinning development in poorer nations.
It took nearly a decade to conclude the trade facilitation part of the talks, which began in 2004.
"The agreement announced today (Thursday) between the US and India paves the way for full implementation of the WTO's Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA)...The agreement also reflects shared understandings regarding the WTO's work on food security," US Trade Representative Michael Froman said in a statement.
   
"We now look forward to working with all WTO members and with Director-General Roberto Azevedo to reach a consensus that enables full implementation of all elements of the landmark Bali Package, including the TFA," he added.

Machil fake encounter case: Seven army personnel sentenced to lifeComments
A military court sentenced five soldiers, including two officers, to life imprisonment on Thursday for the staged killing of three Kashmiri civilians and passing it off as an anti-militancy operation in Jammu and Kashmir's Machil sector in 2010.
It is a rare case of soldiers being punished in Kashmir where the army is an object of hate and the target of frequent protests because of the controversial Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA), which gives it sweeping powers to search, arrest and shoot people.
The verdict, hailed by political parties in Kashmir but dismissed by some separatists as a political move with an eye on assembly elections, comes at a time when the army is under fire in the Valley for killing two Kashmiri boys mistaken for terrorists.
The men were allegedly lured by a former special police officer and his accomplices to Machil on the pretext of offering a job. They were later handed over to the army for Rs. 50,000 each and shot dead by troops in a staged encounter near the border with Pakistan on April 29, 2010. The army described them as Pakistani militants trying to sneak in from the Machil sector along the Line of Control. Their bodies were exhumed on May 28, 2010.
The controversial Machil killings triggered widespread protests and bloodshed in the Kashmir Valley in which 113 people were killed. They also led to calls for scrapping the contentious AFSPA, which the army says is necessary for battling militancy in the state.
Chief minister Omar Abdullah welcomed the sentencing and called it a "watershed moment" in Kashmir's history.
"This is a watershed moment. No one in Kashmir ever believed that justice would be done in such cases. Faith in institutions disappeared. I hope that we never see such #Machil fake encounter type of incidents ever again and let this serve as a warning to those tempted to try," Abdullah tweeted.
The soldiers found guilty and recommended for life term are the commanding officer of 4 Rajput Regiment, the unit involved in the encounter, Colonel Dinesh Pathania, Captain Upendra, Havildar Devinder and Lance Naiks Arun Kumar and Lakhmi. All services benefits of the soldiers have also been suspended.
"The process is still not completed as the confirmation of the sentence is yet to be done by appropriate authority (Northern Army commander)," said an army officer in Delhi.
Court martial proceedings were ordered against six soldiers in December 2013; they ended in September this year. One of them was not found guilty. HT reported on December 26, 2013 that if convicted, the accused could get life imprisonment.
Kashmiri separatists said the verdict was a good beginning if it is followed by justice in similar rights abuse cases.
"It's very positive. We welcome it but the real test lies if justice is done in other cases like Gaw Kadal and Hawal massacres that left more than 100 dead. It's good to make troops accountable," moderate Hurriyat leader Mirwaiz Umar Farooq told HT.
But some Kashmiri separatists said the sentence was a political move aimed at assembly elections in the state as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is hoping to expand its support to the Muslim-dominated Valley where it has no base.
"The elections are round the corner. There is political design in the sudden army magnanimity. India was never serious in delivering justice in Kashmir. Then it should do justice in hundreds of other such cases. The biggest justice is granting the right of self-determination to people," said Hurriyat chairman Syed Ali Geelani.

Sterilisation deaths: Arrested surgeon blames  sub-standard drugsComments
Chhattisgarh police on Thursday arrested the surgeon whose botched sterilisations claimed the lives of 13 women in Bilaspur earlier this week, and will produce him in a court later in the day.

Dr RK Gupta was on the run since the first deaths were reported and an FIR was lodged against him on Tuesday.
The 59-year old surgeon, who was honoured by the Chhattisgarh government on January 26 this year for accomplishing a massive target on mass sterilisation in the state-run campaign, was detained at Baloda Bazar, about 70 km from Bilaspur. 
"He has been arrested today (Thursday) after he was detained in Baloda Bazar district. He will be produced before the court soon," Bilaspur inspector general of police Pawan Deo told HT, adding more arrests are likely to follow. 
Following his arrest, the surgeon told reporters he has been made a scapegoat.
"I am innocent. The health of the women deteriorated owing to the sub-standard drugs prescribed to them following the sterilisation surgery," he claimed.
Gupta, who had operated upon 83 women in six hours last Saturday at the Sakri health camp in Bilaspur (which would mean that he spent just two minutes per tubectomy), was suspended on Tuesday by the state government.
While eight women died on Monday, three on Tuesday and one on Wednesday and at least two dozen others are being treated in various hospitals.
During the campaign even women of primitive tribes, whose sterilisation is banned by the government, were reportedly "coerced" to attend such camps.
Twenty-four-year old Chaiti Bai, a member of Baiga community, died late on Wednesday evening following the botched laparoscopic tubectomy in the camp at Guarela-Pendra in Bilaspur.
Bilaspur commissioner Sonmoni Borah confirmed to HT there were two Baiga women among the 16 who were rushed to Bilaspur from Guarela-Pendra for immediate medical treatment after they underwent sterilisation operation.
Amid reports that rusted equipment were used in the surgeries, a team of doctors from Delhi's premier AIIMS hospital is in Bilaspur to investigate into the incident.
The state government also banned the sale of four medicines which were given to the women after the sterilisation at different camps in Bilaspur on Wednesday. The drugs have been sent to a Kolkata laboratary for tests and analysis.
In the wake of the deaths and the subsequent protests, the Chhattisgarh government has decided to institute a judicial probe into it.
During his visit to Bilaspur to meet the ailing women patients, chief minister Dr Raman Singh declared that judicial commission will inquire into the botched-up sterilisation deaths.
“Instead of any departmental inquiry I have decided for a judicial probe that will thoroughly investigate into every aspect," he said. This was his second visit to Bilaspur after the reports on deaths emerged following the sterilisation in the state-run camp.

MOM 2 possible in 2018 or 2020: Isro chiefprint
Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) is not the end but a beginning. There can be a MOM 2 either in 2018 or 2020, Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) chairman Dr K Radhakrishnan said.
“We have shown our ability to put a spacecraft around the Red Planet. When it will happen is still not clear but launch of MOM 2 will certainly not be in 2016. It can be possible either in 2018 or 2020. But this will be explored after the scientific community comes up with the requirements,” Radhakrishnan said.
Besides Chandrayaan 2, other main projects, he said, included the revised Aditya mission to study the sun. “The spacecraft will have some more instruments. We are looking at an appropriate moment for the launch that has a connection with the solar cycle,” he said at the launch of a book—Reaching for the stars: India’s journey to Mars and beyond by Pallava Bagla and Subhadra Menon.
Asked if Isro was at any stage of the nearly 15 month journey, doubtful of the end result of MOM, he replied, “We had logistic and technology hurdles but team Isro never says no. Our job has always been to make impossible things possible.”

Positive IIP  inflation data may bolster economyEconomic outlook brightens on positive IIP, retail inflation data

The country's economic outlook brightened on Wednesday with a surprise pickup in industrial output and further cooling in consumer prices, data showed, boosting Prime Minister Narendra Modi's bid to end the longest slowdown in growth in decades.
Retail inflation, which the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) tracks in setting key policy rates, slowed to 5.52 per cent in October from a multi-year low of 6.46 per cent a month earlier, helped by slower annual rises in food and fuel prices.
Industrial output unexpectedly grew 2.5 per cent year-on-year in September, its fastest pace in three months, helped by a rebound in the capital goods sector, separate government data showed.
The official data released on Wednesday is expected to bolster the outlook for the domestic economy, which is recovering weakly from a two-year spell of below 5 per cent growth.
Economic growth hit a two-and-a-half-year-high of 5.7 per cent in the quarter ended June 30, prompting some economists to predict 6 per cent growth for the financial year ending March 31, 2015, higher than the 5.5 per cent estimate by the central bank.
However, lacklustre industrial production since then has led some to trim their more optimistic projections.
Cooling prices will intensify pressure on the central bank to cut interest rates in a bid to stimulate consumer demand, which powers 60 per cent of the economy.
"A rate cut at this juncture will no doubt add to the existing positive growth impulses," said Prithviraj Srinivas, an economist with HSBC.
"But such a move would also increase the risk that the RBI misses its inflation target... To return inflation back to the level last seen in the period between 1999 and 2005, when CPI inflation averaged just 4 per cent."
Worries that price pressures would revive once food prices pick up due to a weak monsoon and the fading of base effects led the RBI to leave the lending rates on hold for a fourth straight monetary policy review meeting in September.
The central bank is widely expected to maintain the status quo when it reviews monetary policy on December 2.
Slowing inflation, however, has bolstered hopes for a rate cut in 2015, triggering a rally in the bonds market .

After appeal  India wants  unconditional  release of fishermenPrint
By: Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: November 12, 2014 10:25 pm
A day after it filed an appeal against the Sri Lankan high court verdict giving death sentence to five Indian fishermen, India on Wednesday said it wants “immediate and unconditional” release of its nationals.
India’s reaction assumes significance in the backdrop of the reported statement by Sri Lankan Minister Prabha Ganesan that President Mahinda Rajapaksa was ready to pardon the fishermen on death row for alleged drug smuggling if the Indian High Commission in Colombo does not proceed with an appeal against the sentence.
“The government has always been insisting on the immediate and unconditional release of its fishermen who been sentenced to death the Lankan court. And any avenue which enables that will be pursued,” government sources told PTI, indicating that it will not take back the appeal.
India, on Wednesday, filed an appeal in the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka against a verdict of the high court awarding death sentence to the five fishermen for alleged drug smuggling.
Emerson, P Augustus, R Wilson, K Prasath and J Langlet, all hailing from Tamil Nadu, were apprehended in 2011 and were sentenced to death by the Colombo High Court on October 30.
Earlier this week,    External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Syed Akbaruddin had said the government would do everything
possible to ensure return of the Indian fishermen in accordance with Sri Lanka’s legal and executive process.
“It is a matter on which we place very high priority. It is also a matter on which we are exploring a variety of avenues to ensure that those citizens of India return to India safely. These avenues are being pursued in accordance with Sri Lanka’s legal system and Sri Lanka’s executive role in the process,” he had said.
The court ruling had triggered fiery protests in parts of Tamil Nadu and sporadic violence broke out in and around Rameswaram island as a large number of people staged protests.
The issue of fishermen is very emotive for both Sri Lanka and India, where Tamil Nadu-based parties including AIADMK and DMK have been regularly pressing the government to take up the matter with the Lankan authorities seriously and have often resented high-profile visits from the island nation.
Earlier, in the week, there were also reports originating from Colombo that Rajapaksa and Prime Minister Narendra Modi had spoken to each other on the issue. However, there was no official confirmation on it from the Indian side.

UN authorises patrols against Somali piratesThe UNSC has voted unanimously to authorise international ships to keep patrolling sea lanes off Somalia.
By: Associated Press | United Nations | Posted: November 13, 2014 5:36 am
The UN Security Council has voted unanimously to authorise international ships to keep patrolling sea lanes off Somalia and protecting shipping in the Indian Ocean from pirates who threaten the delivery of humanitarian aid and the safety of key maritime routes.
The resolution adopted yesterday said counter-piracy efforts by states, regions, organisations, the maritime industry and others “have resulted in a sharp decline in pirate attacks as well as hijackings since 2011.”
But the council expressed grave concern at the threat that pirates pose not only to commercial shipping but to fishing activities and the safety of seafarers and at the “increased pirate capacities” and their expansion into the Indian Ocean and adjacent seas.
The resolution authorises anti-piracy patrols for another year by foreign ships including vessels from the European Union, NATO, South Korea, New Zealand, the United States, China, India, Iran, Japan and Russia.
UN political chief Jeffrey Feltman told the council in October that the last time a large commercial vessel was hijacked was over two years ago. But he warned that Somali pirates are still holding 37 people.
The International Maritime Bureau has said there were only seven attacks and attempted attacks off Somalia last year, down from 49 in 2012 and 160 in 2011, the epidemic’s peak.
“This positive trend shows that the international community’s counter-piracy strategy is working,” said the spokesperson for Britain’s UN Mission, who customarily is not named. “However, we need to remain vigilant as the underlying causes of piracy remain.”
Somalia has been trying to rebuild after establishing its first functioning central government since 1991, when warlords overthrew a longtime dictator and turned on each other, plunging the impoverished nation into chaos. Al-Shabab rebels have been pushed out of key cities but they are not yet defeated and the government remains weak.
The resolution recognises that ongoing instability is an underlying cause of piracy “while piracy, in turn, exacerbates instability by introducing large amounts of illicit cash that fuels additional crime and corruption in Syria.”
The council urged all 193 UN member states to criminalise piracy under their domestic laws and called for prosecution of all those involved in pirate attacks and the immediate release of all seafarers being held.

HTC Desire 816 G: Consider this only if you want a big displayIndian rupee to edge higher tracking Asian pairs; flows key
Taiwanese smartphone maker HTC first launched its Desire 816 phablet in June at a price of Rs 24,450 in India. After three months, in September, it introduced the cheaper version in the form of Desire 816 G at a price of Rs 18,990. The only major difference is that the former houses a 1.6 GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 processor while the Desire 816 G has a 1.3 GHz quad-core MediaTek processor. There are not many phablets featuring a 5.5-inch screen in the sub Rs 20,000 range, so, is the Desire 816 G a good buy? We check out.
Quick specs: 5.5-inch 1280 x 720 HD display | 1.3 GHz quad-core MediaTek processor | Android 4.4.2 KitKat OS | 1 GB RAM | 8 GB internal memory expandable up to 32 GB | 13MP rear camera with auto-focus | 5 MP front camera | Dual Nano SIM (GSM + GSM) | 2600 mAh battery
Price: Rs 18,990
Design: It looks exactly similar to older Desire 816. The front of the phone houses two speakers vents and the 5 MP front camera. There are no capacitive buttons. The back is made out of glossy plastic and cannot be removed. The top right of the phone includes two nano SIM card slots along with a microSD card slot, covered by a plastic flap. The power/wake and volume buttons are on the left, which is frustrating sometimes specially while clicking pictures.
Despite the large 5.5-inch screen, the phone doesn’t compromise on one-handed operability or grip.The review unit was all-white, so, I easily managed to make it look dirty. The phone appears sleek and stylish but the glossy plastic back, makes it slippery.
The phone feels solid but the build quality is not strong. It’s a delicate smartphone which needs to be handled with care.
Display: The 1280 x 720 HD display is decent. HTC is not offering something unique in the display of this phablet. However, there is no Corning Gorilla glass or similar protection, which is very surprising! The display is good for watching movies, playing games and average users shouldn’t have any complains. The viewing angles are good and offer decent outdoor visibility as well.
Performance: In the age of octa-core processors, HTC is not offering anything tempting at least on paper. However, the quad-core MediaTek processor performs well. I did not witness any lags and again average users shouldn’t have any complains related to the performance. Overall, the experience is smooth.
Camera: The smartphone comes with a good camera. The images captured in low light also come with fair amount of detailing. Daylight images are even better with accurate colours. The 5 MP front camera also captures good quality selfies provided if you can hold a 5.5-inch phone with one hand. Overall, users will love the camera of this smartphone.
Connectivity: There are no issues with connectivity.
Battery: The 2600 mAh battery does a decent job. It can easily last an entire day for an average user.
Storage: The device offers 8GB of internal storage out of which around 4 GB is available. The memory can be further expanded up to 32 GB. So, investing in more storage is recommended.
Verdict: HTC has done a decent job by placing a 5.5-inch phone in Rs 18,000 segment. If you want to buy a large screen phone with a good camera then you can consider the HTC Desire 816 G. The Asus Zenfone 6 is another option at a price of Rs 16,999.
But if you are happy with a 5-inch display, then buying this phone makes little sense as you might find it difficult to fit (any) 5.5-inch screen phone inside your jeans pocket, especially while riding a bike. Also, there are several other 5-inch smartphones at a lower price.

Indians charged for running fraudulent investment schemePrint
By: Press Trust of India | New York | Posted: November 13, 2014 1:59 pm
Two Indians have been charged by US authorities for running an alleged high-yield investment scheme through which they sought to exploit investors by pervasive social media pitches on Facebook, YouTube and Twitter.
The Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Enforcement Division alleges that Pankaj Srivastava and Nataraj Kavuri offered “guaranteed” daily profits as they anonymously solicited investments for their investment management company called Profits Paradise. They invited investors to deposit funds that supposedly would be pooled with money from other investors and traded on foreign exchanges as well as in stocks and commodities.
They created a website and related social media sites to describe the profits as “huge”, “lucrative”, and “handsome”, and they characterised the risk as “minimal.” SEC alleges that the guaranteed returns were false and that the investments being offered bore the hallmark of a fraudulent high-yield investment programme.
Srivastava and Kavuri attempted to conceal their identities by supplying a fictitious name and contact information when registering their company’s website address. They also communicated under the fake names of “Paul Allen” and “Nathan Jones.” After the SEC began its investigation into the investment offering, the company website was discontinued.
“Srivastava and Kavuri used excessive secrecy in their effort to swindle investors through social media outreach and a website that attracted as many as 4,000 visitors per day,” said Stephen Cohen, Associate Director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement. “Our investigation stopped the constant solicitations once the website disappeared, and successfully tracked down the identities of the perpetrators behind those fraudulent solicitations.”
According to the SEC’s order instituting administrative proceedings, Srivastava and Kavuri used the Profits Paradise website and YouTube videos to detail three investment plans. Postings on the company’s Facebook page promised investors they could “Enjoy Hassle Free Income” and advertised a “5 per cent Referral Commission.”
The scheme also utilised a Twitter account to steer potential investors to the company website, and Srivastava and Kavuri created a Google Plus page to promote the investment. The SEC’s Enforcement Division alleges that the duo violated the provisions of the federal Securities Act and will litigate the matter before an administrative law judge.
“We urge investors to exercise extreme caution if they are approached to invest in a website promising incredible returns with minimal or no risk. So-called high-yield investment programs are often frauds,” said Lori J Schock, Director of the SEC’s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy. The SEC appreciated the assistance of the Securities and Exchange Board of India in investigating the matter.

India overtakes China as largest gold consumerMeenakshi Sharma and Rajendra Jadhav     Mumbai   Last Updated: November 13, 2014  | 14:32 IST
(Photo: Reuters)
Gold demand in the country jumped by more than a third in the September-quarter, in sharp contrast to the rest of the world, boosted by jewellery demand for the wedding season, the World Gold Council said on Thursday.
Domestic demand climbed up by 39 per cent to 225.1 tonnes in the July-September period of the current financial year, the second highest on record for the quarter, even as global demand fell to its lowest in nearly five years, according to the industry body.
Consumption in China, the world's other major buyer of gold, plunged 37 per cent year-on-year in the corresponding period. Although domestic demand overtook China for the quarter, it still lagged for the total from the first nine months of the year.
Thus, the country once again took over as the world's biggest gold consumer, buying 225.1 tonnes of gold jewellery, coins and bars in the previous quarter, compared to 182.7 tonnes in China.
"Demand will continue to have positive growth over last year as this is a good demand period and a lot of marriages are happening," said Somasundaram PR, head of the WGC's domestic operations.
Jewellery demand in the country rose by 60 per cent in the third quarter, but investment demand dropped 10 per cent.
The WGC maintained its prediction that domestic demand would reach 850-950 tonnes for the year, driven by jewellery purchases.
However, gold investment demand is likely to fall to 25 per cent of total demand this year, from 37 per cent the year before, Somasundaram said, as a sharp price drop has shaken the confidence of investors in bullion as a store of value.
The industry body said jewellery demand was also boosted by a weakening of gold prices in rupee terms and by widespread confidence in the new government, along with the onset of the festival season.
Gold imports for September surged 450 per cent to US $3.75 billion.
"Demand for the fourth quarter as a whole is expected to be healthy, but the September surge in imports is unlikely to be replicated," WGC said.
The jump in domestic demand for gold comes after a weaker period in FY14 when consumption was hurt by curbs on imports.
Struggling with a high trade deficit, the government in the 2013-14 fiscal raised its gold import duty to a record 10 per cent and made it mandatory to export a fifth of all bullion imports.

Modi effect: Why India is red hot again after falling off the global mapHow Narendra Modi can solidify India's appeal to fickle global investors
By Ruchir Sharma,  | 13 Nov, 2014, 01.12PM IST
The consensus GDP growth forecast for 2015 has been falling steadily for other large emerging markets, but is ticking higher for India. 
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
The global investment community is known for its manic mood swings, but even by that standard its rediscovered love for India is neck-snapping. Cast as a submerging nation a year ago, the country is now the toast of the fast money crowd. This year they've poured more money into India than into any other emerging country, and have helped to make Mumbai one of the hottest stock markets in the world, with a gain of nearly 30%.
No other developing country has undergone this kind of image upheaval. India has morphed in the eyes of the world from a star to a dud to a star again, and all within the last five years. For now, however, there are good reasons why India seems to be everyone's favourite emerging nation.
It is the only big one that has stopped disappointing its international suitors. The consensus GDP growth forecast for 2015 has been falling steadily for other large emerging markets, but is ticking higher for India. One big factor is the fall in prices for oil and other commodities, which has sent commodity-exporting economies like Brazil and Russia into recession , but is a boost for a big energy importer like India.
Better yet, low oil prices help take the edge off of inflation in India, now one of the very few nations enjoying the auspicious combination of increasing growth and falling inflation. The current account deficit too has declined from 5% of GDP in 2013 to about 2% this year in India, even as it deteriorates elsewhere. The rupee has lost 6% of its value against the surging dollar, but other currencies at the heart of the 2013 scare have fallen harder since then, by 15% on average. Investment has yet to pick up in India, but investment is flat to flailing everywhere else, too.
India is also the only emerging nation that has delivered on hopes for new leadership. Six big developing countries held pivotal national elections this year, and global markets were eagerly anticipating the victory of reform-minded leaders, especially in Brazil, Indonesia and India. As it happened, only Narendra Modi won with a clear mandate.
Elsewhere in the emerging world, politics has lost its economic promise. Russia and Turkey remain under the control of aging autocrats with waning interest in reform. China's leaders seem hobbled by the unmanageable debt burden that is dragging down its growth rate. Mexican President Pena Nieto's big-bang attack on monopolies has generated surprisingly little pop for economic growth and his popularity ratings are declining.
In Brazil, the markets were rooting for the defeat of Workers Party President Dilma Rousseff , but she narrowly won last month. High hopes for President Joko Widodo of Indonesia are fading, with the realisation that he lacks the parliamentary backing to push real change. Drop all these disappointments, and only Modi survives as a potential reformer who has the clout to get things done. Though some critics say Modi has so far made only painless changes, his recent call for a "trans-formative" budget in 2015 has global investors assuming that the big-bang reform is on its way.
So why wouldn't everyone embrace India? The hype is itself a worrying sign. The risk is that the country will start believing its own reviews, and get complacent all over again. India has a long record of abandoning reform when the future looks bright, which helps explain why in recent decades — including the post-1991 liberalisation era — there has never been any five-year period when it has grown more than a point or two faster than the emerging world average, even though it should be relatively easy to grow fast from India's low base.
With the annual growth rate of emerging economies likely to average around 4% for the rest of this decade, India will have to break out of its normal path if it wants to achieve a growth rate of 7-8%.

China October data shows economy cooling further, need for more policy support

(Fixed-asset investment,…)
BEIJING: China's economy lost further momentum in October, with factory growth dipping and investment growth hitting a near 13-year low, reinforcing views that Beijing will need to do more to fight slackening growth.
Months of tepid performance in factories and the growing drag from a weakening housing market are putting Beijing's 2014 growth target of around 7.5 percent at greater risk.
Fixed-asset investment, an important driver of growth, grew 15.9 percent in the first 10 months of the year from a year ago, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Thursday. That was the weakest pace since December 2001.
October factory output rose 7.7 percent from a year earlier, which was higher August's 6.9 percent rise but below expectations and the second weakest pace since the height of the global financial crisis. Retail sales growth eased slightly to 11.5 percent, the slowest pace since early 2006.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales and industrial output to rise 11.6 percent and 8.0 percent, respectively, while fixed asset investment for the January-October was seen up 15.9 percent.
That followed data this week which showed inflation remained near a five-year low and producer prices fell for 32nd consecutive month, highlighting sluggish domestic demand.
"Chinese core October data came in uniformly softer and below consensus," said Dariusz Kowalczyk, senior economist at Credit Agricole CIB in Hong Kong.
"The data highlights downward pressure on the economy. It will encourage further monetary easing."
Despite a raft of stimulus measures, China's annual economic growth slowed to 7.3 percent in the third quarter, the weakest pace since the global financial crisis.
Many analysts believe additional support measures may be needed to offset the drag from the cooling housing market, but they are divided over whether authorities will take more forceful action such as cutting interest rates unless there is a risk of a sharper slowdown.
Growth in real estate investment, which affects about 40 other industries in China, cooled to 12.4 percent in the first 10 months of 2014 from a year earlier, with property sales and new construction continuing to fall.
In a bid to stem the slide in the property market, China cut mortgage rates and down payment levels for some home buyers in late September for the first time since the 2008/09 global financial crisis.
But economists are divided over whether the measures will have a long-term effect, pointing to massive inventories of unsold homes hanging over the market.
Policymakers have rolled out a series of measures since spring to bolster growth, including the latest move in late October and early November to approve over $100 billion worth of infrastructure projects.
The central bank, which pumped 769.5 billion yuan worth of three-month loans into banks in September and October, has pledged to keep its policy stance accommodative but stressed that it will not flood markets with cash.
Chinese top leaders, taking comfort from a relatively resilient job market, have flagged on many occasions that they would be more tolerant of slower economic growth while forging ahead with reforms to pursue a more sustainable growth model.
In the latest indication of Beijing's tolerance of slightly lower growth, Chinese President Xi Jinping said on Sunday that even if China's economy were to grow 7 percent, that would still rank it at the forefront of the world's economies.

Swaraj Paul s group plans to set up manufacturing plantSwaraj Paul's group to set up mattress manufacturing plant in Haryana
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: November 13, 2014  | 16:22 IST
PM Narendra Modi (Reuters)
Acting on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 'Make in India' campaign , Lord Swaraj Paul's Caparo group plans to set up a manufacturing facility in India to produce its range of luxury mattresses by end of next fiscal.
"We plan to set up a manufacturing facility for mattresses in Bawal in Haryana by end of year 2015. We want to build the plant that has the right scale and right skill," Caparo India Chairman Angad Paul told PTI.
Paul did not share details of investment the company will be making in the new plant.
At present, Caparo's luxury mattress range 'Dream Catcher' priced between Rs 1.5-20 lakh, is imported from UK.
The company, which has opened an exclusive showroom in Gurgaon, plans to open more showrooms in metros and mini metros in the coming months, the company said in a statement.
When asked if the company is looking at launching cheaper version of the mattresses, Paul said that it will not compromise with quality to sell a lower priced product.
Caparo, which has a business partnership with UK's Harrison Spinks to make mattresses, also plans to export made in India mattresses across the world.
Praising PM Modi, Paul said: "This government is following a path of being much more fair, which is what I consider important. It is, at least right now, looking at making a proper stab at corruption and patronage, which is essential for this country's progress."
Caparo Group designs and manufactures value-added steel and engineering products for the automotive, aerospace, transport, infrastructure and defence sectors.

Here's what a sustained $20 drop in oil prices does to the world's major economies

(A research note from Societe…)
By Andy Kiersz
Oil prices have been tumbling in recent weeks. The price of brent crude fell below $80 per barrel today for the first time in since September 2010.
That's down from around $115 earlier this summer.
A research note from Societe Generale's Michala Marcussen takes a look at the possible effects of a drop in oil prices on the world economy. She plugged a sustained $20/barrel drop in oil prices into Britain's National Institute of Economic and Social Research's NiGEM software, a sophisticated global macroeconomic model, and saw what would happen to global GDP in the following years.
For oil exporting countries, there would be an immediate negative shock to GDP growth as a result of the oil price drop. Meanwhile, there might be a strong bump in GDP growth for oil-importing countries, most notably the US, Canada, and some countries in Asia.
The researchers also include a number of caveats, given that economic simulations and predictions of this nature are always filled with assumptions and uncertainties.
Societe Generale's results are summarized in the chart. The blue part of the bars show the effect of the price drop after one year, brown after two years, and grey after three years.
"As seen from the chart, a $20/b decline in the oil price adds 0.26pp to World GDP after the first year of the shock," Marcussen wrote.
Russia stands out as the big loser in the first year.

Feels like a match now: NakamuraAP Norway's chess grandmaster Magnus Carlsen, right, plays a game against India's Viswanathan Anand, left, during the Zurich Chess Challenge 2014 in Zurich.

“Wow!!!”
That tweet by World No. 7 Anish Giri of the Netherlands best summed up the reaction to Viswanathan Anand’s victory in the third game of the World championship against Magnus Carlsen in Sochi on Tuesday.
“Just a fantastic game from start to finish by Anand,” tweeted world No. 9 Hikaru Nakamura of the United States. “For the first time in 15 games, it feels like a match!”
According to world No. 2 Fabiano Caruana, Carlsen either forgot, or mixed up his opening preparations.
News to me!
He also denied he had been helping Anand for the match. Caruana said he had heard about it, “but neither of us (Anand or me) are aware of that.”
World No. 21 Teimour Radjabov of Azerbaijan felt it would be tough to predict the result now. “Now, no predictions please, it’s the street fight.”
Former world championship challenger Nigel Short of England said Anand’s preparation was far superior, while Carlsen found himself in a difficult position and could not find a way out.
Former women’s world champion and popular chess analyst Susan Polgar tweeted: “We are at an interesting point in this match. Carlsen has lost a world championship game for the first time. How will he handle it?"

India Cements returns to black in Q2Updated: November 12, 2014 23:17 IST
India Cements returns to black in Q2
K. T. Jagannathan
earnings
The India Cements Ltd. (ICL) has returned to black in the second quarter ended September 30, 2014, after reporting loss for four quarters in a row.
It has reported profit for the quarter despite a drop in volume and rising cost pressures. This was possible mainly due to an increase in net plant realisation.
The company reported a net profit before tax of Rs.7.49 crore for the quarter under review against a loss of Rs.31.44 crore in the same period last year. Sales volume was down three per cent at 23.51 lakh tonnes against 24.40 lakh tonnes. Net sales were higher at Rs.1,131.68 crore against Rs.1,085.93 crore. The company took a knock of Rs.8.81 core in foreign exchange loss during the quarter under review.
Variable cost was up four per cent due to a combination of increase in freight charges caused by load curbs by transport authorities and increase in royalty, among others.
The net plant realisation for the quarter under review stood at Rs.3,506, up from Rs.3,060 a tonne in the same quarter last year. Sequentially, there was an increase of nearly Rs.200 a tonne in net plant realisation for the quarter under review vis-à-vis the first quarter of the current year.
Addressing a press conference here on Wednesday, T. S. Raghupathy, Special Adviser to the Group, said the cement industry reported a nine per cent growth in the first-half. However, the growth in the South was the weakest among the regions, he pointed out. Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, the principal markets for India Cements, virtually saw de-growth, he said. The bifurcation of composite Andhra Pradesh was expected to trigger a rise in demand, he said. “We have not seen this happening. Every one is taking a cautious approach,” he added. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) had observed that the company could not adjust certain non-recurring exceptional items of expenses (recompense paid to banks of Rs.57.13 crore and fuel and electricity charges of Rs.69.43 crore) against general reserves as part of the merger of Trinetra Cement and Trishul Concrete Products with The India Cements. Consequently, the audit committee of the company has recommended modification of the financial statements, which resulted in the loss increasing to Rs.162.41 crore for 2013-14, up from Rs.35.85 crore reported earlier.
To a query on the proposed move to raise funds to the tune of Rs.500 crore, V. M. Mohan, President, Corporate Finance, said it was primarily intended to improve the leverage and meet normal capital expenditure.
On the move the spin off Chennai Super Kings (CSK) into an independent entity, he said this could help CSK to look at sports in its totality going forward.
The shares of India Cements closed on the BSE at Rs.108.10, down from Rs.109.10 on Tuesday.

Sensex  Nifty surge on positive economic dataMarket update: Sensex snaps rising trend, ends 68 points lower led by oil stocks

The benchmark BSE Sensex on Thursday fell from all-time level to settle the day 68 points lower at 27,940.64 as investors became cautious after excise duty on petrol and diesel was hiked even as inflation cooled off and factory output grew in signs of economic recovery.
The Sensex rose in early trade on hopes of rate cut after inflation softened to 5.52 per cent in October.
Three-month high industrial production growth of 2.5 per cent in September also boosted the sentiment, brokers said.
But soon profit-booking emerged after the government hiked excise duty on petrol and diesel prices by Rs 1.50 a litre each to mop up an additional Rs 13,000 crore in revenue.
Some investors fear this may weaken the fight against inflation, a broker said.
After a highly volatile trade, the bellwether index finally settled the day at 27,940.64, showing a loss of 68.26 points or 0.24 per cent from its yesterday's close, snapping three days of rise.
The 50-share Nifty also lost by 25.45 points or 0.30 per cent to 8,357.85.
On Wednesday, the benchmark index had ended at an all-time closing high of 28,008.90 and also hit intra-day high of 28,126.48 on sustained foreign funds inflows driven by economic reforms undertaken by the government recently.
Meanwhile, foreign institutional investors bought shares net of Rs 459.47 crs on Wednesday as per the provisional figures issued by stock exchanges.
The 30-share index in the previous three days had gained by 140.27 points or 0.50 per cent in the last three days.
"Indian equity markets cheered CPI and IIP with benchmark indices opening higher. But profit-taking was seen at higher levels.
"OMC (oil marketing companies) stocks witnessed profit booking, most banking shares were also weak on the index while IT and pharma stocks lifted the index," said Kiran Kumar Kavikondala, Director & CEO, WealthRays Securities.
Stocks of state-run BPCL, HPCL and Indian Oil Corp ended up to 6.11 per cent lower. ONGC was among the biggest Sensex losers, plunging by 2.03 per cent, while RIL fell by 0.53 per cent.
Major Sensex losers were SSLT (2.56 per cent), Tata Power (2.47 per cent), ONGC (2.03 per cent), Gail (1.58 per cent), Axis Bank (1.49 per cent), Hero Motocorp (1.38 per cent), HDFC (1.14 per cent), SBI (0.84 per cent) and ICICI Bank (0.83 per cent).
Infosys rose by 1.77 per cent, followed Dr Reddy's Lab 1.01 per cent, Cipla 0.91 per cent.
Among the sectoral indices, Oil&Gas fell by 1.63 per cent, followed by Realty 1.44 per cent, Metal 0.76 per cent, Bankex 0.71 per cent and Auto 0.39 per cent, while IT rose by 0.99 per cent and Teck 0.74 per cent.
The total market breadth turned negative as 1,733 stocks finished in the red, while 1,314 stocks closed in green. The total turnover dropped to Rs 3,529.31 crore from Rs 3,649.38 crore on Wednesday.
"The benchmarks were seen upholding sideways bias on Thursday as well, after the better than expected macro-economic data failed to trigger the directional move. In line with the key index, the sectoral indices too traded mixed whereas profit taking in the cash segment pushed the market breadth in the red," said Jayant Manglik, President, Retail Distribution, Religare Securities.
Sixteen scrips out of the 30-share Sensex pack ended lower while 14 others closed higher.
Asian markets were trading mixed.
Key indices in Hong Kong, Japan, Taiwan, and Singapore ended higher by 0.34-1.14 per cent, while indices in China and South Korea finished lower by 0.34-0.36 per cent.

(The move, first announced…)
NEW YORK/NEW DELHI: IT services major Wipro has bagged a $143 million 5-year outsourcing deal from Levi Strauss as the US-based denim apparel maker looks to cut 500 jobs in a restructuring exercise.
The move, first announced in March 2014, is expected to generate net annualised cost savings of $175-200 million once fully implemented.
Levi Strauss & Co has entered into a Master Services Agreement with India's third-largest software services firm to outsource "certain global business service activities within the functional areas of information technology, finance, human resources, customer service and consumer relations."
"The initial term of the agreement is five years with activation of certain components of the Outsourced Services commencing during the first quarter of 2015. The company has the right to renew and extend the agreement for up to two additional one-year periods.
"The company will pay Wipro for the services through a combination of fixed and variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on the company's actual need for such services. The company expects to pay Wipro a minimum of approximately $143 million over the initial term of the agreement," Levi said in a regulatory filing to the US SEC .
Earlier this week, Levi had said that its next phase of the global initiative includes "elimination" of around 500 positions primarily reflecting the Outsourced Services as well as a further reduction of management layers, an increase in spans of control, the removal of duplicative roles and other structural changes.
"The company anticipates the elimination of positions will be substantially completed within the US within the second half of fiscal 2015 to accommodate the transition of Outsourced Services to Wipro.
"The Final estimates for headcount, timing and charges in certain areas of the international business are subject to completion of applicable local works counsel and other consultative processes."
The San Francisco-based jeans maker said it expects to incur restructuring and related charges in the range of $45-55 million, the majority of which will be recognised in the fourth quarter of 2014.
The charges consist of cash expenditures principally related to severance benefits, retention bonuses and consulting fees.
In a statement, Levi said: "In this next phase of the productivity initiative, approximately 500 positions will be eliminated, primarily due to the decision to partner with Wipro."
Wipro will provide support for certain business services within information technology, finance, human resources, customer service and consumer relations, it added.

NEW DELHI: The Centre is planning to invest Rs 450-500 crore on providing basic computer education to about 50 lakh people over the next three years with the help of private companies, a note on which will be sent to the Cabinet for approval shortly.
The investment will be made under a project called Disha in certain identified districts, a senior government official said, adding that the computer literacy programme will be critical for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's pet project, Digital India , which hopes to bridge the digital divide in the country.
"The government will choose the districts where this programme will be run. A basic 20-hour computer education programme will be designed for those undertaking the course," said the official, requesting anonymity.
The government will select private entity or entities, which will be paid Rs 500 per student for the training, but the funds will be released only once the people clear a test. In the second phase, those who clear the test will be given an option of taking advanced computer courses comprising a 50-hour module. The government will pay the private company Rs 1,000 per student for this phase, the official said.
Computer literacy will be key to the success of the project through which the government hopes to connect 2.5 lakh gram panchayats throughout the country at a cost of Rs 1.13 lakh crore. The BJP-led government hopes to deliver a string of services such as e-education, e-health and e-governance through a national broadband network which is expected to be in place by 2017.

MUMBAI: Sesa Sterlite, a diversified natural resources company, today said its board has approved development of Gamsberg-Skorpion Integrated Zinc project in South Africa and Namibia for USD 782 million, to be invested over a three-year period.
The amount will be spent on the development of open pit zinc mine in Gamsberg, South Africa, as well as the conversion of Skorpion Zinc Refinery in neighbouring Namibia, it said.
Majority of the investment, around USD 630 million, will go towards developing an open-pit zinc mine, concentrator plant and associated infrastructure at Gamsberg. The balance investment will be used to convert the refinery at the Skorpion Mine in Rosh Pinah, Namibia thereby enabling it to refine zinc concentrates from the Gamsberg mine into special high grade zinc meta, the release said.
"The Gamsberg-Skorpion Integrated Zinc Project is central to Vedanta's long term aspirations for Southern Africa," Sesa Sterlite chief executive officer Tom Albanese said in a media statement.
Vedanta estimates that the Gamsberg project, which is located near the town of Aggeneys in South Africa's Northern Cape Province, will create 1,500 jobs during construction and result in around 500 permanent jobs. The Gamsberg project will be operated under the auspices of Black Mountain Mining which is 74 percent owned by Sesa Sterlite.
The remaining 26 per cent interest in BMM is held by Exxaro Resources, a diversified resource company listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, the release said.
The first phase of the Gamsberg open pit mine is expected to have a total lifespan of around 13 years with the first ore likely to be produced in 2017/18.
The Gamsberg Zinc Project involves the development, construction and commissioning of a 40 lakh tonne ROM open-pit zinc mine, concentrator and associated infrastructure at Gamsberg, 20km from the town of Aggeneys. The company expects to commence construction of the new mine during the first quarter of 2015, the release added.

By: Press Trust of India | Brisbane | Posted: November 13, 2014 3:33 pm
Australia on Thursday said it is tracking four Russian navy ships off its north coast, a move Prime Minister Tony Abbott said was a sign of Moscow’s military assertiveness with relations strained after the downing of Flight MH17 in Ukraine.
The appearance of the fleet coincides with Vladimir Putin’s arrival at the G20 summit in Brisbane this weekend and follows a highly anticipated exchange between the Russian leader and Australian premier Tony Abbott in Beijing. Putin’s presence in Brisbane was questioned given Australia’s anger at the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 in July, in which 298 people died in rebel-held eastern Ukraine, including 38 Australian citizens and residents.
But the G20’s consensus was that he should attend despite Kiev and the West claiming the plane was blown out of the sky with a missile supplied by Russia, an allegation Moscow denies. “Defence is monitoring Russian naval vessels that are currently transiting through international waters to the north of Australia,” the Australian Defence Force said in a statement.
Australian media reports said they include a “heavily armed” cruiser and destroyer, a tug boat and a refuelling vessel. Australia said the Russian navy has previously been deployed in conjunction with major international summits. A warship from Russia’s Pacific Fleet accompanied former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev’s visit to San Francisco in 2010.
John Blaxland, an international security expert at the Australian National University, said having ships off Australian waters was “huff and puff” by Putin designed to reinforce his “tough, he-man image”. “This is a show of force, a stage-managed event and is all for show,” he told AFP.
“People don’t go around doing this unless they feel insecure and need to assert themselves. It’s consistent with Putin’s chest-out, posturing behaviour. It bolsters his domestic credentials.” Abbott famously vowed to “shirtfront” Putin – an Australian Rules football term in which a player charges an opponent – in Brisbane over the downing of MH17.

‘Beauty and The Beast’, a retelling of the classic fairytale, will get a release on more than 60 screens in India, becoming the most widely exposed French film in the country in recent times.
Distributor Kamal Jain, who has acquired the rights of the film, says the movie has been promoted on a wide scale and he is hopeful about its success in India because of the popularity of the story ‘Beauty and The Beast’.
“‘Beauty and The Beast’ is the most widely publicised and getting the biggest release among the French films released in India in recent times. It is being released on more than 60 screens and will be shown in all major cities. We have promoted it really well.
“Everyone from kids to elders are familiar with the story of the film. There have been many films made on the popular story so when I watched this particular movie, I thought it should be shown here. The canvas of the film is brilliant. It is a huge costume drama, made on a budget of Rs 300 crore and is so lavish,” Kamal told PTI at the screening of the film here.
Kamal said that the release of ‘Beauty and The Beast’ can also pave the way for exposure of Indian audience to French cinema. “I have brought French films to India earlier too and I am really optimistic that this cinema will receive a positive response here. In fact Indian films are loved there for their colours and vibrancy,” he said.
The distributor does not have immediate plans of any Indo-French production but is keen for such collaborations.
“We would like to explore the possibility of Indo-French collaborations, it would be really nice. There is nothing at the moment but if I get an opportunity I would love to be involved in such a project,” he said.
‘Beauty and The Beast’, directed by Christophe Gans and starring Vincent Cassel and Lea Seydoux, is releasing here tomorrow.

Government keeping eye on madrasas with foreign teachers: RajnathSinghBy: Press Trust of India | Gurgaon | Posted: November 13, 2014 3:29 pm
Government on Thursday said it was monitoring the activities of some madrasas over suspicions that foreign teachers there were indoctrinating young students in the jihadi ideology.
“We are keeping an eye on every activity,” Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh said on the sidelines of a function in Gurgaon.
He was replying to a question over reports of Bangladeshi nationals teaching students at a madrasa in West Bengal’s Burdwan and Centre’s plans to conduct a survey to check whether foreign nationals were deployed in seminaries.
The Burdwan madrasa’s teachers, affiliated to banned terror group Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB), were allegedly involved in indoctrinating young students and attracting them to jihadi ideology .
A secret report submitted to the Home Ministry by security agencies has suggested that madrasas with Indian teachers were not involved in any jihadi or separatist activities or indoctrination.
The report has red-flagged madrasas which have teachers of Bangladeshi or Pakistani origin, saying there are examples of such madrasas actively radicalising young minds.

Stocks that can return upto 80% | Sensex in red; Jubilant Food up 6%  Unitech slips 6%Devang Mehta
("Both these companies belong…)
ET Now caught up with Devang Mehta of Anand Rathi Financial Services for his outlook on some sectors and stocks. Excerpts:
ET Now: Which is the next TVS Srichakra?
Devang Mehta: Right now, probably the market is hunting for such stocks. There are a lot of such ideas. We do not know if these would emulate TVS Srichakra and become multi-baggers, but they could probably give you 50% to 80% return in a year's time.
Some stocks that immediately come to my mind are Sundram Fasteners and Igarashi Motors . Both these companies belong to the auto component or the auto ancillary universe, which has been cyclically doing very well on the back of good demand. These two, along with Kalyani Steel and others, could give you 40% to 60% type of returns .
Another stock, again from the same space, would be Atul Auto. It is into the production of three-wheelers. Their capacity is going to double in the next two to three years. It will do well.
ET Now: Anything else that is looking interesting from the small or the midcap pharma end?
Devang Mehta: One stock that we like from the pharma universe is Granules. The company's earnings growth has been triggering very well. It is in a growth phase. But it is not on the radar of most people. Granules would be one stock we would bet our money on in the midcap pharma space.
ET Now: What is the PE multiple for Granules, and what makes you bullish on Granules?
Devang Mehta: The PE multiple for it would be around 17-18 times one-year forward. But the more important thing is that the company is slowly but surely growing and it has not seen the sort of a dream run that other pharma companies have seen.
We feel there is substantial upside for them from here on. Their results have been very good, and the export demand being excellent.
ET Now: Lots of people are beginning to talk about the road sector. What is your sense on the road players? Anything interesting here?
Devang Mehta: You need to be very selective over here. The largest stock pick that would come to the mind is L&T. It is going to get the benefit of infra as well as the capital goods cycle turning. NCC is our top pick in the mid or small cap basket for infrastructure.
We do not like stocks like IVRCL for the time being. We feel there is still a lot of pain for them for another six months. But given the business model that NCC has at the current juncture, we feel it is about to be rerated. We see about 30% to 40% upside for NCC going forward.

Gold prices likely to maintain negative biasUpdated: November 1, 2014 23:00 IST
Gold prices likely to maintain negative bias
Ramnath Subbu
prices
The recent international developments saw gold lose Rs.1,000 per 10 grams over Thursday and Friday, and breach its 15-month low of Rs.26,500 in the domestic market. This was on the back of gold falling to a four-year low of $1,167 an ounce internationally during the week on strengthening of the dollar and better U.S. economic data as also news about Japan’s central bank deciding to accelerate the pace of quantitative easing. In Mumbai, gold moved up by Rs.70 on Saturday to close at Rs.26,380.
Commodity analysts felt that at $1,180 an ounce, gold had breached a significant technical support level. “Below this level, it is not lucrative for miners to produce gold, and they would, in all likelihood, curtail production,” said Vikas Vaid, Product Head, Commodity & Currency, Prabhudas Lilladher Group. At these levels, gold is ‘technically’ in a bearish trend and while bargain-buying could happen in spurts, there is clearly a negative bias to prices.
“Gold does not hold much fancy but for investors, there is no doubt an opportunity to buy gold as gold continues to retain its ‘safe haven’ status,” Mr. Vaid said.
In the Indian context, with Diwali buying having wound down, there is no reason for demand for physical gold to revive. A booming equity market, which rallied more than 30 per cent in the last year, is seeing investors exit gold in favour of equities.
Bhargav Vaidya, bullion analyst and director, India Bullion & Jewellers’ Association (IBJA), felt that the gold price was likely to remain weak and its price in India could decline further.
“It depends on the rupee-dollar rate and the rupee has been quite stable. We are unlikely to see any dramatic swing in price,” he said.

market and exchange
Gold prices declined by Rs 55 to Rs 26,395 per ten gram in the National Capital on Monday owing to slackened demand from jewellers and retailers at existing higher levels amid a weak global trend.
In line with gold, silver also traded lower by Rs 50 to Rs 35,500 per kg on lack of buying support from industrial units.
Gold in Singapore, which normally sets price trend on the domestic front, fell by 0.8 per cent to USD 1,168.48 an ounce, while silver dropped by 0.1 per cent to USD 15.77 an ounce.
In Delhi, gold of 99.9 and 99.5 per cent purity fell by Rs 55 each to Rs 26,395 and Rs 26,195 per ten gram respectively.
Sovereign, however, found some buying support from retailers and edged higher by Rs 100 to Rs 23,800 per piece of eight gram.
Silver ready also eased by Rs 50 to Rs 35,500 per kg, while weekly-based delivery strengthened by Rs 230 to Rs 35,025 per kg on speculative buying.
Silver coins spurted by Rs 2,000 to Rs 60,000 for buying and Rs 61,000 for selling of 100 pieces.

Oil India (OIL), the nation's second biggest state-owned explorer, on Wednesday reported a 33 per cent drop in its September quarter net profit as crude oil production fell and prices slumped.
Net profit in July-September at Rs 608.33 crore, or Rs 10.12 per share, was 32.68 per cent lower than Rs 903.64 crore, or Rs 15.03 per share, net profit in the same period last fiscal, the company said in a statement in the national capital.
"Due to lower international crude oil price , the gross crude oil price realisation for Q2 is lower by 6.54 per cent to $101.25 per barrel, as compared to $108.33 in Q2 FY2013-14. The net realisation is $45.25 per barrel as compared to $52.33," it said.
OIL, which along with other upstream oil producer ONGC makes good a portion of losses that fuel retailers incur on selling diesel and cooking fuel at government controlled rates, said its subsidy outgo in Q2 was marginally lower at Rs 3,394.16 crore as against Rs 3,486 crore a year ago.
Its crude oil production fell over 4 per cent to 0.879 million tons but natural gas output was 4.2 per cent higher at 0.694 billion cubic meters.
Sales fell 17.5 per cent to Rs 2.622.26 crore.
The company said it has received a notice of demand for Rs 1,324.79 crore from Assam Value Added Tax Authority claiming tax on the fuel subsidy paid to fuel retailers and on transportation charges on crude oil. "Company is contesting the demand and filed a writ petition before the High Court and considered it not a liability."
The subsidy payout dented its revenue by Rs 2,238.30 crore, OIL said.

Micromax: Nothing micro about this max sales storyDelhi cab rape case: Uber cab driver Shiv Kumar Yadav arrested in Mathura
India’s second largest and home-grown smartphone maker Micromax posted a staggering 130% year-on-year jump in turnover for FY14 to Rs 7,141.23 crore, according to the company’s 2013-14 balance sheet filed with the Registrar of Companies. Its net profit for the same period rose almost 50% to touch R284.10 crore.
Through a sustained marketing campaign (Hollywood actor Hugh Jackman is its brand ambassador) and by launching smartphones with the latest features at competitive price points, Micromax has managed to grow its business in a market that is crowded with global brands like Samsung, Apple, Lenovo and Sony; home-grown competitors like Karbonn and Lava; and Chinese entrants like Xiaomi and Huawei.
According to market intelligence firm IDC, Micromax shipped 2.58 crore handsets, including both smartphones and feature phones, during calendar year 2013, up from 2.19 crore handsets during 2012. The company’s market share increased to 10% from 6% during the same period.
The Gurgaon-based company grew its market share between January and June 2014 to 13%, by shipping 1.6 crore handsets.
Only Samsung sells more smartphones than Micromax in India and, according to IDC, the gap between the two is narrowing.
“Micromax’s handset volumes have grown significantly during calendar year 2013 from the previous calendar year, and we expect the July-September 2014 quarter performance of the company to be phenomenal,” said Karan Thakkar, a senior market analyst at IDC.
While Android-based smartphone makers like Micromax and Samsung are seeing a surge in demand, the same can’t be said of all handset manufactures, especially those operating on platforms other than Android.
India is one of the fastest growing markets for smartphones in the world with a slew of new offerings each year finding favour with the Indian consumers.
Apple, which sells premium products like the iPhone and iPad, saw its turnover touch Rs4,500 crore for fiscal 2014, a tenfold growth from 2010. Its net profit in the same period has grown three times to Rs 119.5 crore.
But not all companies have had a good run in the country. BlackBerry India, the Indian arm of the Canadian handset maker BlackBerry, saw its net profit decline sharply in fiscal 2014, by around 50% year-on-year to Rs 11.46 crore. The company’s revenues nearly halved to Rs 142.05 crore during the same period.
“Micromax’s handset volumes have grown significantly during 2013 from the previous year, and we expect the July-September 2014 quarter performance of the company to be phenomenal,” Karan Thakkar, a senior market analyst at IDC said.
The significant improvement in Micromax’s performance over the past two years can be attributed to the company’s ‘value for money’ proposition. Placing its products with specifications similar to that of foreign brands but at a significantly lower cost has also helped the company gain market share in the last couple of quarters.
“According to our research, most Indians replace their phones every one to two years and aren’t willing to spend Rs 40,000-50,000 on new smartphones,” Thakkar said. This gives a huge opportunity to Indian vendors like Micromax, Karbonn, Lava and Chinese vendors like Huawei and Xiaomi, which price their phones competitively while providing same specifications as other foreign brands.”
Thakkar also said that a lot of young Indians that were looking to buy smartphones with the latest specifications’ were more value conscious than brand conscious.
Commenting on the company’s performance, a Micromax spokesperson told FE, “We have always believed in bringing affordable innovation to Indian consumers, which is in sync with their interests and needs, and would continue to do so. We would continue to challenge the notion that great technology comes at a higher price by introducing innovative products that simplify needs of our consumers and wish to grow ahead of the market. Going forward, a large chunk of our efforts will be concentrated on coming up with products and services which act as solutions to the needs of the fast-evolving consumers.”
Ringing cash till:
Shipped 2.58 crore handsets during calendar year 2013, up from 2.19 crore handsets during 2012
Market share increased to 10% from 6% during the same period

India s gold demand surges 39 per cent to 225.1 tonnes in Q3: WGCGold futures price falls on global cues
India’s gold demand during July-September quarter this year shot up by 39 per cent to 225.1 tonnes against the overall third quarter demand in 2013 on rise in jewellery sales, says a World Gold Council report.
The overall third quarter demand in the country for 2013 stood at 161.6 tonnes, WGC Gold Demand Trends report showed.
Gold demand during the period in terms of value rose by 31 per cent to Rs 56,219.3 crore as compared to Rs 42,829.6 crore in the third quarter of 2013.
Similarly, the total jewellery demand was up by 60 per cent at 182.9 tonnes as against 114.5 tonnes in the same period last year.
The value of jewellery demand surged by 51 per cent to Rs 45,681.6 crore from Rs 30,346.5 crore in the third quarter of 2013.
“The rise in demand for gold jewellery during third quarter of 2014 reflects the unusual low base of third quarter of 2013 that was impacted by the introduction of a range of duty increases and restrictions.
“The third quarter can be viewed as normal for gold demand in spite of the unfulfilled expectations of a duty cut and policy relaxations from the new government,” WGC Managing Director (India) Somasundaram PR said here.
He further said that demand around Diwali reflected the general optimism seen in the country.
“It is now beyond debate that import restrictions have had little impact on demand for gold and yet have strengthened the unauthorised supply channels and seems at odds with the overall sentiment that defines the new government’s business approach,” he added.

Live Cricket Score  India vs Sri Lanka  4th ODI: India bat  make three changes against Sri LankaPrint
Rohit Sharma was the star of the day as the right-hander stormed into record books with his second ODI double hundred (Source: PTI)
By: Press Trust of India | Kolkata | Posted: November 13, 2014 12:08 pm | Updated: November 13, 2014 11:46 pm
Rohit Sharma created history by smashing the highest individual ODI score with a breathtaking knock of 264 as India thrashed Sri Lanka by 153 runs in the fourth cricket one-dayer to take a 4-0 lead in the five-match series in Kolkata on Thursday.
SCORECARD: India vs Sri Lanka 
Courtesy Rohit’s mayhem, India scored a mammoth 404 for five and then easily bowled out the islanders for 251 in 43.1 overs. Returning after a 10-week injury lay-off, Rohit had everything going his way after being let-off on individual score of four. (Social Storm: Rohit takes over Twitter, worldwide)
The Mumbaikar paced his innings to perfection as he first got set during the initial 50 runs before exploding against a clueless Lankan attack, as he scored his 264 off only 173 balls that had 33 fours and seven sixes.
In the process, Rohit also broke compatriot Virender Sehwag’s earlier world record of 219 runs, which he had set against West Indies in Indore, back in 2011.
Rohit is also the only batsman to register two double centuries in ODIs and also now holds the record for highest number of boundaries during his innings. (Stats: With 264, Rohit rises to top)
The epic milestone was reached when Rohit hit an elegant cover drive off Nuwan Kulasekara to become the first batsman with two double hundreds in ODIs. (First Reaction: ‘Once I got to 50, I had to convert it into a big score’)
Rohit did have ‘Lady Luck’ going his way as he was dropped twice after reaching his double hundred. The stylish right-hander was all set to carry his bat through before he was holed out in the long-off region off the final delivery of the Indian innings.
Fittingly, he received a ‘Guard of Honour’ from his teammates, who stood on both sides outside the dressing room with spectators also giving him a standing ovation.
It couldn’t have been a more memorable innings on the 150th anniversary of the hallowed ground which has seen many outstanding individual performances.
Rohit’s magnificent knock will rank among the very best played at this ground by the likes of VVS Laxman, Mohammed Azharuddin, Sachin Tendulkar to name a few.
The fifth and final match of the series will be played at Ranchi on November 16.
Stand-in captain Virat Kohli, the other day, termed Rohit as the ‘X-factor’ going into the World Cup and was vindicated after a knock which was a class act.
405 was never going to be easy after Lanka lost their first wicket for naught with pacer Umesh Yadav giving the breakthrough by claiming Perera (0) in the second ball.
Yadav next took the big scalp of Jayawardene cheaply as Lanka were 42/3 as the victory looked very near. Skipper Angelo Mathews was the top-scorer for the visitors with 75 from 68 balls (9×4, 1×6) and shared 118 runs with Lahiru Thirimanne (59) but it was too little looking at the monstrous target.
Yadav (2/38) once again was the pick of Indian bowlers even as Dhawal Kulkarni decimated the middle and lower order with best figures of 4/34. Stuart Binny and Axar Patel too chipped in with a couple of wickets each.
They say records are meant to be broken, and at Eden Gardens something similar was experienced. On any given day, and on any surface, 264 was once considered a fighting ODI target.
And as it turned out, Lankans could not even get past Rohit’s individual score and were bundled out for 251 in 43.1 overs to concede an embarrassing defeat.
The innings was not only a mix of elegance, class and timing but luck too played a big role with Sharma tumbling records after records making the Lankans look like school boys.
If the ground was ‘Very Very Special’ for VVS Laxman after his career-defining 281, Rohit, who had made his Ranji debut here too made this his second ‘home’ having scored hundred on Test debut.
Incidentally, the Mumbaikar, who scored 109 in the last IPL here, has hundreds in all the three formats, and Thursday he had the record score in his first ODI appearance at Eden Gardens.
The batsman used his wrists beautifully to the angling Eranga deliveries and cut anything when provided with a bit of width.
Thanks to wayward bowling by Lankans, Rohit was particularly ruthless in the ‘Batting Powerplay’ that fetched India 57 runs as he smacked the bowlers all around the park before taking a deft single to deep square leg to notch up his fifth ODI century, his first at this venue.
When Lankans batted, only time when they looked like putting up a fight was during the Mathews-Thirimanne partnership that yielded 118 runs.
It was young Axar, who showed good temperament to get the opposition captain out after being deposited into the deep mid-wicket stands off the previous delivery.
He bowled one that drifted in and Mathews who reached too close to the pitch of the delivery was beaten after the ball took an inside edge as Robin Uthappa whipped the bails in a flash.
Karn Sharma’s (0/64 in 9 overs) bowling performance was an aberration as he went for 23 in an over where Thisara Perera (29) literally launched into him.
The leggie seemed to have got the length wrong and was punished a lot for his half-trackers. With a huge total on the board, Karn’s poor show didn’t impact the overall performance much.
Credit should be given to Kulkarni, who also had an indifferent start going for a few runs but came back in the end to get the wickets of Thirimanne, Perera, Seekkuge Prasanna and Kulasekara.
It was Axar, who finished the match when Ajantha Mendis’s switch-hit turned out to be a mis-hit.

NRI banker becomes youngest partner at GoldmanCambridge University
(Shah was promoted to managing…)
NEW YORK: Kunal Shah , a 32-year old Indian- origin managing director at Goldman Sachs is among the 78 individuals to be promoted to the position of Partner, becoming the youngest to be inducted into the investment giant's most coveted club.
Shah is one of the five persons of Indian-origin to have made the cut in Goldman Sachs in 2014 class of Partners.
He was promoted to managing director at the investment banking giant at the age of 27. The Cambridge University math grad was also named in Forbes '30 under 30' Finance list in 2011.
He has been a rising star at Goldman since he joined the company in London in 2004, analysing interest rate products, before trading on the global macro desk, according to Forbes.
The other persons of Indian-origin named to the firm's elite group are Meena Lakdawala Flynn, Manikandan Natarajan, Umesh Subramanian and Rajesh Venkataramani.
Goldman Sachs Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein and President and Chief Operating Officer Gary Cohn personally called the 78 individuals to inform them of their elevation to the position of Partner, yesterday.
"These appointments recognise some of the firm's most senior professionals and acknowledge their embodiment of our culture and values, and their leadership of the firm's business and people," Blankfein said in a statement. "We look forward to their continued strong performance and leadership in the years ahead."
Goldman Sachs selects its partners every two years through an extremely secretive and rigorous month-long selection process.
The record for becoming the youngest Goldman Sachs Partner is held by Eric Mindich who was promoted in 1994 at the age of 27.
The 2014 class of Partners includes 11 women, 23 employees from investment banking, 25 from securities, 11 from investment management, four from merchant banking and three from research. They will become Partners of the firm starting January 1 next year.
Goldman now has 467 partners, an elite group that represents about 1.6 per cent of its 33,500-strong workforce.
The position of Partner brings with it some of the biggest Wall Street perks including a lucrative paycheck with salaries of about USD 900,000 and a portion of the bank's bonus pool which is divided up among only the partners.
The partners also have access to special investment opportunities that are not available to other employees.
Goldman had ceased to be a private partnership when it went public in 1999.
But the ritual of selecting partners still remains a core and among the most coveted part of the company's identity and culture.

The Lost Gospel  claims Jesus and Mary Magdalene were married and had children'The Lost Gospel' claims Jesus and Mary Magdalene were married and had children

A researcher who has attracted attention and criticism with his revisionist Biblical theories says he has found new evidence that Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene and that early Christians considered her a deity.
Canadian-Israeli documentary-maker Simcha Jacobovici says an ancient manuscript in the British Library offers a glimpse at an early version of Christianity radically different from the faith practiced today.
"This shows that Mary Magdalene really got ripped off" in mainstream Christian theology, Jacobovici said Wednesday at the launch of "The Lost Gospel," a book co-authored with York University religious studies Professor Barrie Wilson.
But many religious scholars are skeptical about the latest addition to the crowded field of Biblical conspiracy theories.
"The Lost Gospel" is built around a new interpretation of an ancient text, "The Story of Joseph and Aseneth." Jacobovici and Wilson studied a 1,500-year-old Syriac-language version of the story in the London library.
Most religious scholars think the text explains why the Hebrew patriarch Joseph came to marry a gentile, but Wilson and Jacobovici say it is a coded tale that actually relates the story of Jesus, his wife and their children.
Jacobovici said that in the document, Mary Magdalene is "not just Mrs. Jesus. She's a co-deity, a co-Redeemer."
But Greg Carey, professor of New Testament at Lancaster Theological Seminary, said the story was already well known to Bible scholars and "doesn't require any decoding."
"That's not to deny that some early Christians interpreted the story allegorically," he added. But he said there was no evidence for "the idea that it's about Jesus and his wife and their two children."
Jacobovici has a record of headline-grabbing but contested claims.
He co-wrote "The Jesus Family Tomb," which was strongly criticized by scholars and archeologists for alleging that a tomb found in a Jerusalem cave contained the remains of Jesus and possible family members.
Other researchers also have claimed to have found references in ancient texts to a married Jesus. Dan Brown used such theories as the basis for blockbuster thriller "The Da Vinci Code."

Prime Minister Narendra Modi met Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev on Thursday, calling for greater cooperation between their states and regions.
On day three of his visit to Myanmar, Modi met Medvedev ahead of next month's annual Indo-Russia summit. The Indian PM recalled his visit to Russia in 2001 and told the him "Am sure India-Russia ties will be strengthened", according to tweets posted by the Prime Minister's Office.

Modi's meeting with the Russian leader was his first diplomatic engagement on the third day of his 10-day three-nation tour of Myanmar, Australia and Fiji on the sidelines of the two back-to-back India-ASEAN and East Asia summits in  Nay Pyi Taw.
The Russian Prime Minister conveyed that India was a "close and valued partner for us" during the meeting at the Myanmar International Conference Centre. On the extent of Russia-India relations, Medvedev said: "There are many areas where we are cooperating".
In response, Modi said he was confident that the ties between the two countries will be strengthened.
During their conversation, Modi also spoke on the need for the federal units - states and regions of the two countries to cooperate more, a view which Medvedev endorsed.
 
Russian President Vladimir Putin is travelling to New Delhi next month for the 15th annual India-Russia summit.
 
Modi, during his first meeting with Putin on the sidelines of the BRICS summit in Brazil in July, favoured broadening India's strategic partnership with Russia in nuclear, defence and energy sectors.
 
He had also invited Putin to visit Kudankulam atomic power project during his trip for the annual summit.
 
A tweet posted by external affairs ministry spokesperson Syed Akbaruddin said, "Our federal units (states/regions) need to cooperate more - PM @narendramodi pitch reasonates with Russian PM Medvedev."
Modi later posed for photographs with world leaders at the East Asia Summit.
Modi was also seen laughing and chatting with Prime Minister Tony Abbott of Australia, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Tun Razak and President Benigno Aquino of the Philippines before they proceeded to attend the EAS here, an MEA tweet showed.
Modi, Abbott and New Zealand Prime Minister John Key posed for a photo together.
Modi keen on Malaysian model of performance assessment
As part of his endeavour to constantly evaluate the performance of his government, Modi is taking a cue from the Malaysian model, calling it an "excellent example".
 
During his meeting with his Malaysian counterpart Najib Razak Wednesday, Modi said he was greatly impressed by the performance assessment mechanism that is in place in the southeast Asian country.

Modi told Razak that he had had discussions on this subject with some Malaysian officials who had worked on it, ministry of external affairs spokesperson Syed Akbaruddin said.
 
The PM said that this was an excellent example of how monitoring of performance is done. But he said Malaysia is more than only governance reform.
 
While this was governance reform, Modi also felt that Malaysia has been open for economic reforms and he felt that both Malaysia and India could work together in areas like housing.
 
Modi said public housing was a major focus of the new Indian government which plans to go for large scale public housing by 2022. And he felt that Malaysian companies who had expertise in these would be welcome specifically in public housing projects.
 
To keep the government departments on their toes and deliver on the BJP's poll promise to bring "achchhe Din" (good days), the PM is understood to be keen on revamping the Performance Management and Evaluation System (PMES), currently run by a division at the Union government's cabinet secretariat.
 
Razak set up the Performance Management and Delivery Unit, commonly known as PEMANDU, in his office in September 2009, just a few months after taking over.
 
PEMANDU oversees implementation, assesses progress, facilitates and supports delivery and drives progress of the Government Transformation Programme and the Economic Transformation Programme launched by Razak, who heads the unit as its chairman.

OPEC expects lower oil demand in 2015 as oil prices slumpOPEC expects lower oil demand in 2015 as oil prices slump

Brent crude traded around $80 a barrel on Thursday, near its lowest since 2010, after Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) said demand for its oil would fall in 2015, while Saudi Arabia remained silent about a possible cut in production.
In 2015, global oil demand from OPEC will drop to 29.20 million barrels per day (bpd), almost 1 million bpd less than its current production, the cartel said in its monthly report.
Brent crude slumped below $80 a barrel for the first time since 2010 on Wednesday before settling lower by US $1.29 at US $80.38.
Brent crude for December delivery, which expires on Thursday, shed another 34 cents to $80.04 as of 10:54 am.
"There are not many bullish factors to lift the market now," said Avtar Sandu, senior manager for commodities at Phillip Futures in Singapore. "But it's not a one-way street down. Those who have been selling want to take profits around this area."
US crude for December delivery was down 10 cents at US $77.08 a barrel.
The spread between the two benchmarks has narrowed more than $3 in the past week. The recent sharp decline in oil prices may cut investment in U.S. shale oil by 10 percent next year, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said.
Brent's premium to US crude narrowed to US $2.96 on Thursday from as much as US $6.42 last week.
ALL EYES ON SAUDI
Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi broke months of silence on Wednesday to reaffirm the kingdom's long-standing policy of seeking stable global markets, dismissing talk of a price war.
However, al-Naimi offered no insight on the Arabic state's response to slumping oil prices, leaving investors guessing about the outcome of OPEC's next meeting on November 27.
The noticeable lack of comment from Saudi Arabia, whihc is the world's biggest oil exporter, during the recent slide in oil prices may signal an involuntary change in the Saudi policy, according to Energy Aspects analyst Amrita Sen.
"The silence from Saudi Arabia is very, very damaging because the market tends to interpret and lets its imagination go wild," Sen said.
US crude stocks fell by 1.5 million barrels last week to 373 million, compared with analysts' expectations of an increase of 800,000 barrels, data from industry group the American Petroleum Institute showed.

West Indies name squad for South Africa tour  ask players to sign new contract before Nov18Print
By: Agence-France Presse | St John's (antigua And Barbuda) | Posted: November 13, 2014 3:35 pm
West Indies has named a full-strength squad to tackle South Africa but gave players a November 18 deadline to sign contracts after the last tour of India was abandoned over a pay dispute.
The 16-man Test squad announced on Wednesday will be skippered by Denesh Ramdinn and is due to play three Tests in December and January before three Twenty20 internationals and five ODIs.
“All players selected have been notified of their selection and that their selection is contingent upon their signing of the match tour contract which was sent to each player selected on Tuesday, November 11,” said a West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) statement.
“The deadline for the return of signed match your contracts to the WICB is 5pm (ECT), Tuesday, November 18.”
The West Indies team quit India four matches into a five-game ODI series in October after a pay dispute between players and the board, with a Twenty20 international and three Tests to play.
As a result the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) are demanding USD 42 million in compensation and
damages.
“Of course at all times the Selection Panel aims to select the best and strongest team available. We look forward to this squad giving a good account of themselves for the three Tests in South Africa,” said West Indies chairman of
selectors Clive Lloyd.
“There is a significant amount of international cricket to be played over the next six months, including Test matches
against some of the higher ranked teams in world cricket and as such it would be critical for the squad to get off on a
positive note in South Africa.”
West Indies Test squad: Denesh Ramdin (capt), Sulieman Benn, Jermaine Blackwood, Kraigg Braithwaite, Darren Bravo, Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Sheldon Cottrell, Shannon Gabriel, Christopher Gayle, Jason Holder, Leon Johnson, Denesh Ramdin, Kemar Roach, Marlon Samuels, Jerome Taylor, Chadwick Walton.

English rock band Smokie to perform in Shillong nextmonthBy: Press Trust of India | Shillong | Posted: November 13, 2014 3:35 pm
Famous English rock band Smokie will perform live here early next month to help raise scholarship money for children whose parents died battling militants in the jungles of Garo Hills and for the September 24 flash flood victims.
The band, which will perform at the Hornbill Festival in Nagaland, will take the stage here on December 5 to help raise funds for the two causes, a spokesperson of the organiser Police Officers Wives association for Care (POWAC) told PTI.
The Art and Culture department would collaborate to help raise money for Chief Minister’s Relief Fund for the September 24 flash floods victims in Garo Hills region which claimed over 64 lives.
Meghalaya’s Garo Hills region is one of the conflict zones in the north east with militant outfits mushrooming and engaging themselves in gun fire with security forces almost on a daily basis.
Last year nine Meghalaya police personnel had died while on duty and their school going children need support, the official said.
Smokies’ performance in this north eastern state will be held six months after international metal band Dying Fetus performed at the Shillong Open Air Festival.

Petrol  diesel excise duty hiked by 1.50/ltrComments
The government on Thursday hiked excise duty on petrol and diesel prices by Rs. 1.50 a litre each to mop up an additional Rs. 13,000 crore in revenue, a move that may translate into similar increase in retail rates.
The fall in international oil prices had resulted in six consecutive reduction in petrol prices since August and two in diesel in the last one month and there was possibility of another round of cuts this weekend.
But the possible reduction has now been negated as the the government decided to raise excise duty to shore up its revenue.
Excise duty on normal or unbranded petrol was hiked from Rs. 1.20 per litre to Rs. 2.70 per litre and unbranded diesel from Rs. 1.46 a litre to Rs. 2.96, a government notification said.
The same on branded petrol was raised from Rs. 2.35 a litre to Rs. 3.85 and on branded diesel from Rs. 3.75 to Rs. 5.25 per litre. While the excise duty hike will result in an immediate increase in both petrol and diesel prices, the expected reduction would keep the retail rates at almost the same levels.
There is also a possibility of state-owned oil firms preponing the planned review of fuel prices due on Saturday to make the whole exercise price neutral for consumers.
Before the duty hike, petrol cost Rs. 64.25 a litre in Delhi and diesel Rs. 53.35 a litre. While the fall in global rates and the resultant cuts in retail prices had led to loss of revenue to the exchquer, particularly, for state governments, there wasnt any loss to the Central government on account of reduction in petrol and diesel prices as excise duty on the two fuel is fixed and not ad valorem.
Unbranded petrol currently attracts a basic excise duty of Rs. 1.20 per litre, a special additional excise duty of Rs. 6 a litre and a road cess of Rs. 2 per litre.
Unbranded diesel attracts a basis excise duty of Rs. 1.46 a litre and road cess of Rs. 2 per litre.
The total excise duty on unbranded petrol will rise from Rs. 9.20 to Rs. 10.70 per litre and than on unbranded diesel from Rs. 3.46 to Rs. 4.96 per litre.
Branded petrol currently attracts an excise duty of Rs. 10.35 per litre which would go up to Rs. 11.85 per litre and that on branded diesel from Rs. 5.75 to Rs. 7.25 per litre.

WTO impasse ends as India  US resolve food subsidy rowIndia, US settle row over food security
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, November 13, 2014
First Published: 11:24 IST(13/11/2014) | Last Updated: 08:26 IST(14/11/2014)

India and the United States scripted a compromise formula on food subsidies on Thursday, paving the way to remove a major irritant in the stalled World Trade Organization (WTO) deal on easing of customs rules.
As part of a revised proposal, India and the US have agreed for an indefinite “peace clause” on food security until a permanent solution is found, marking a major success for the Narendra Modi government in global trade talks withstanding mounting diplomatic pressure from developed countries.
A “peace clause” gives legal security to member countries and protects them from being challenged under other WTO agreements.
HT first reported on September 22 the possibility the of breakthrough during Prime Minister Modi’s visit to the US when he discussed the issue with President Barack Obama.
Developed nations have shown support for a “peace clause” that would agree to developing countries’ demands on food security for a period of four years.
India, however, was pressing for a guarantee for further exemption until a permanent solution is negotiated and to find a way to allow countries the right to provide higher levels of subsidies for their poor beyond these four years.

The latest move will likely help WTO members ratify the so-called trade facilitation agreement (TFA) to make trade easier, faster and cheaper by making systems transparent and reducing red tape.
In July, India had withstood mounting pressure from the developed countries including the US, which had blamed New Delhi’s hard bargain strategy for the eventual collapse of the talks putting the WTO’s future in “uncertain ground.”
India had made it clear that state-funded welfare schemes for the poor were non-negotiable even as it took the blame for blocking the TFA in July, as it did not come bundled with a roadmap for rules on food subsidies.
"The United States and India reached agreement today (Thursday) on a set of measures intended to break the impasse in the work of the World Trade Organization (WTO) to implement the agreements reached last December," said a US government statement.
The two countries agreed that India's food security programmes would not be challenged under WTO rules "until a permanent solution regarding this issue has been agreed and adopted," it said.
India's commerce minister Nirmala Sitharaman tweeted that India and the US had "successfully resolved their impasse over food security issues in #WTO".
"WTO General Council will receive India's proposal and US will support us," she said.
Even after Modi's talks with Obama in September, India, however, held the view that without a permanent solution on food subsidies, public stockholding programmes such as buffer stock of food-grains will be hampered.
Existing rules cap the value of food subsidies at 10% of the value of production. But, the way the support is calculated at prices of more nearly three decades earlier means many countries would find it difficult to stay within the limit potentially attracting strong penalties from the trade body.
This will affect India’s food security programme and food grain procurement through the minimum support prices (MSP).
Bali package
New Delhi's decision in July to hold up the TFA to reduce trade barriers came after the WTO's members agreed at a December, 2013, meeting in the Indonesian island of Bali to implement the pact.
At the time of the Bali accord, WTO members agreed on a four-year "peace clause" to protect India from being punished over subsidies and stockpiles until a "permanent" solution" was reached. The agreement was due to take effect in mid-2015.
But after the Bali pact, Indian officials complained there were nearly two dozen meetings on the trade facilitation pact and just a handful on subsidies.
Bali was the first multilateral agreement concluded by the WTO since its inception in 1995.
It also signalled the first concrete progress on the Doha Round of trade liberalisation talks, launched in 2001 and aimed at underpinning development in poorer nations.
It took nearly a decade to conclude the trade facilitation part of the talks, which began in 2004.
"The agreement announced today (Thursday) between the US and India paves the way for full implementation of the WTO's Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA)...The agreement also reflects shared understandings regarding the WTO's work on food security," US Trade Representative Michael Froman said in a statement.
   
"We now look forward to working with all WTO members and with Director-General Roberto Azevedo to reach a consensus that enables full implementation of all elements of the landmark Bali Package, including the TFA," he added.

Sterilisation deaths: Arrested doc pins blame on  sub-standard drugsComments
Chhattisgarh police on Thursday arrested the surgeon whose botched sterilisations claimed the lives of 13 women in Bilaspur earlier this week, and will produce him in a court later in the day.

Dr RK Gupta was on the run since the first deaths were reported and an FIR was lodged against him on Tuesday.
The 59-year old surgeon, who was honoured by the Chhattisgarh government on January 26 this year for accomplishing a massive target on mass sterilisation in the state-run campaign, was detained at Baloda Bazar, about 70 km from Bilaspur. 
"He has been arrested today (Thursday) after he was detained in Baloda Bazar district. He will be produced before the court soon," Bilaspur inspector general of police Pawan Deo told HT, adding more arrests are likely to follow. 
Following his arrest, the surgeon told reporters he has been made a scapegoat.
"I am innocent. The health of the women deteriorated owing to the sub-standard drugs prescribed to them following the sterilisation surgery," he claimed.
Gupta, who had operated upon 83 women in six hours last Saturday at the Sakri health camp in Bilaspur (which would mean that he spent just two minutes per tubectomy), was suspended on Tuesday by the state government.
While eight women died on Monday, three on Tuesday and one on Wednesday and at least two dozen others are being treated in various hospitals.
During the campaign even women of primitive tribes, whose sterilisation is banned by the government, were reportedly "coerced" to attend such camps.
Twenty-four-year old Chaiti Bai, a member of Baiga community, died late on Wednesday evening following the botched laparoscopic tubectomy in the camp at Guarela-Pendra in Bilaspur.
Bilaspur commissioner Sonmoni Borah confirmed to HT there were two Baiga women among the 16 who were rushed to Bilaspur from Guarela-Pendra for immediate medical treatment after they underwent sterilisation operation.
Amid reports that rusted equipment were used in the surgeries, a team of doctors from Delhi's premier AIIMS hospital is in Bilaspur to investigate into the incident.
The state government also banned the sale of four medicines which were given to the women after the sterilisation at different camps in Bilaspur on Wednesday. The drugs have been sent to a Kolkata laboratary for tests and analysis.
In the wake of the deaths and the subsequent protests, the Chhattisgarh government has decided to institute a judicial probe into it.
During his visit to Bilaspur to meet the ailing women patients, chief minister Dr Raman Singh declared that judicial commission will inquire into the botched-up sterilisation deaths.
“Instead of any departmental inquiry I have decided for a judicial probe that will thoroughly investigate into every aspect," he said. This was his second visit to Bilaspur after the reports on deaths emerged following the sterilisation in the state-run camp.

Upper castes are invaders; tribals  Dalits indigenous: Bihar CM ManjhiComments
As Janata Dal (United) leader Nitish Kumar embarked on his Sampark Yatra to reinvigorate party workers, chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi staked claim to the Dalit constituency on Wednesday, saying: “Upper castes were foreigners and descendants of Aryan invaders, while the true Indians were the Dalits and the indigenous people.”
Issuing a clear message to tribals and Dalits to close ranks and re-invent their political strength at Bettiah, 300km north-west of Patna, Manjhi asked them to work in tandem for their educational, social and political rights. He took on the mantle of a ‘social reformer’ too, asking the tribals to shun consumption of alcohol and tobacco and go attend school.
“Earlier, the number of tribals was only 1% of state’s population but the percentage has reached 16% after the Tharus were accorded the status of scheduled tribe (ST). The total number of tribals is about 16 lakh in Bihar. Keep away from alcohol and assert your political rights,” Manjhi advised.
After being elected the CM, Manjhi has been asserting his Dalit identity to counter the widespread impression that he was a stopgap chief minister. He has been working to carve out a niche for himself and come out of the shadow of Nitish Kumar. At his public meetings, especially while addressing Dalits and tribals who together number 24% of Bihar’s population, Manjhi has attempted to consolidate his constituency by trying to make them aware of their latent political strength, which could be used if they come together.
The first signs of his political ambition to continue as CM after 2015 assembly polls became evident when he told Dalits at his village Mahkar in Gaya district if 22% Dalits came together and became politically aware, no one could stop a Dalit from continuing as the chief minister.
“This time, I was made chief minister by others under different political circumstances. We constitute around 22% of the state population. If you become more politically aware, you can be in a position to choose a Dalit chief minister by your sheer strength,” Manjhi said.
Manjhi seems to have taken cue from his predecessor Nitish Kumar. While Kumar tried to carve out a vote bank among the Dalits by bracketing 21 out of 22 scheduled castes in Bihar as ‘Mahadalits’, leaving out the powerful Dusadhs (Paswans), Manjhi has gone a step further by calling upon Dalits and tribals to form one single bloc of voters. Manjhi has also tried to draw a bigger line than his predecessor by aiming to form a trans-Dalit constituency along with extremely backward castes (EBCs).
Watch: Bihar CM says upper caste people are foreigners
It became evident when he asked Dalit youth at a function in Patna to raise their numbers through “inter-caste marriages” inside and outside the Dalit community. Manjhi had stoked a controversy when he recalled an incident in which a temple was washed after his visit in course of his bypoll campaign in Madhubani.
He had also attacked other castes, saying that people who came to him for some work felt no qualms about falling at his feet. Many in his own party believe Manjhi is seriously pitching for Dalit consolidation of the kind seen in Uttar Pradesh, under the leadership of BSP leader Mayawati and lead a separate Dalit constituency Bihar has never had. Manjhi is the third Dalit leader to hold the post of chief minister.

Allegations of illegal detention  appointments and financial irregularities: Pondicherry University V-C induces fear psychosis oncampusPrint
Written by Arun Janardhanan | Chennai | Posted: November 13, 2014 4:08 pm | Updated: November 13, 2014 4:22 pm
If almost a dozen probe reports lying before the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) on Pondicherry University administration are to be believed, Vice Chancellor Chandra Krishnamurthy, who is facing a series of allegations, has had enough reasons to repatriate the registrar Rajeev Yaduvanshi, an IAS officer last week who fought V-C with tooth and nail. His repatriation order that came on October 24 had sparked major protests in the campus besides hunger strikes and gheroing the administration seeking the removal of V-C and reinstatement of Yaduvanshi.
Dissent and anger had been brewing in the campus ever since Krishnamurthy took charge as V-C in February 2013. There had been a number of petitions and official probe reports on violations and financial irregularities against the V-C, which are all now lying before the MHRD and Minister Smriti Irani with attached evidences of major statutory violations by her administration.
This is besides the point as her appointment as V-C itself was challenged before the Madras high court questioning her qualification. Petitions were sent to MHRD for flouted rules in her selection in November 2012 as she had no qualification required for the V-C post and the then HRD minister Pallam Raju had recommended her name on December 10, 2012 to the V-C post with the help of an under secretary instead of submitting a list of three candidates to the President. “But a group of ministry officials ran the show in UPA regime continue to take decisions in MHRD and they have buried almost all the evidences and probe reports submitted by Yaduvanshi,” said a senior ministry official.
A section of officials familiar with the state of affairs at the Pondicherry University, one of the earliest central universities in the country, feel that the academics and students had decided to express solidarity with the registrar Yaduvanshi, an IAS officer, with due reasons and protest against his repatriation. Protests against the V-C erupted first in April 2014 with a shocking incident of illegal detention of a post graduate student by a professor close to V-C aided by a security personnel for 27 hours. Charges against the student was that he entered the University girl’s hostel.
According to an internal probe report submitted before the then MHRD secretary Ashok Thakur in June 2014, the student S Radhakrishnan, a first year MA Tamil student, was detained under V-C’s order by S Hariharan, director of Academic Staff College, who is on deputation at the university. The student under illegal detention for more than 27 hours was tortured to confess and paraded before the girl’s hostel. But what had put the V-C in trouble later was not just the illegal detention, but a finding by the disciplinary committee probe that the student was not guilty as he was in the university library at the time when he was alleged to have entered the hostel.
Evidences including a probe report and CCTV footage are now before MHRD, and an order from National Human Rights Commission (NHRD) sought action against the V-C in this case last month. An FIR was also filed in the local police station against V-C and Hariharan for the illegal detention. But not only did the V-C refrain from taking any action against Hariharan till date, she had continued…

Congress attacks PM Narendra Modi of spreading poisonPrint

Congress president Sonia Gandhi and vice-president Rahul Gandhi on Thursday launched an offensive to isolate BJP and the Sangh parivar by drawing a secularism versus communalism battle line. Rahul first took a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi by calling Swachh Bharat Abhiyan a mere “photo opportunity”, and then said the foundation of social harmony in the country has been weakened with the spreading of “poison” of communalism.
Addressing party workers at a function on the eve of the 125th birth anniversary of Jawaharlal Nehru, Sonia said had Nehru been alive, he would have asked all Congressmen to fight “communal forces”, and become “valiant soldiers of secularism”. She said her party would fight “ideologies, institutions and individuals” who have been trying to demolish Nehru’s concept of “liberal India”.
Congress is hoping to use Nehru’s birth anniversary to rally secular forces and boost the morale of party workers. Sonia has written to leaders of all parties, barring BJP and its allies, inviting them to an international conference next week.

Both Sonia and Rahul admitted the party is passing through one of its most difficult periods. “In the 129 years of our existence, we have faced many difficulties and fought them…because we have learnt from our leaders how to face adversities,” Sonia said.
Rahul said India’s foundation was built on love and brotherhood. “But today, this foundation is being demolished. On one hand, roads are being cleaned. Everybody is getting a photo opportunity cleaning the roads, but on the other poison is being spread,” he said.
Rahul admitted Congress has committed some mistakes, but did not elaborate.
He said the government was being run by those who nurture anger and accused it of even trying to junk English. The pitch for English by Rahul has been seen as an attempt to reach out to the aspirational middle-class.

Ad campaigns are big part of actors life: RanbirKapoorRanbir Kapoor: An actor may have one or two movies releasing in a year, but the ad campaign runs throughout the year.
By: Indo-Asian News Service | Noida | Posted: November 13, 2014 3:46 pm
Ranbir Kapoor, who has been roped in as the ambassador of Swiss watch brand TAG Heuer, says advertisement campaigns play a significant role in an actor’s life.
“To be honest, advertisements are a big part of actor’s life and are equally important just like their movies,” said Ranbir at an event held here Tuesday.
“An actor may have one or two movies releasing in a year, but the ad campaign runs throughout the year,” the actor added.
The 32-year, who seem to be taking forward the legacy of Kapoor family, insists that advertisements carry higher recall value and have wider reach.
“When ‘Saawariya’ (his debut film) was released not many people saw it and I was doing an endorsement that time. Everyone got to know me through the advertisement… such is the reach of advertisements,” said Ranbir.
The actor has been the face of ‘Youngistaan’ campaign by Pepsi, has been irresistible for girls for an AXE ad, and is also seen as a guide in askme.com advertisement. The actor says he is associated with brands which he has faith in.
“It is very important to choose a brand which you believe in. Because if you don’t believe in it, then how will the consumer believe in it,” he said.

In the first cabinet expansion exercise of the Narendra Modi government, 21 ministers were inducted into the council of ministers on Sunday. Four ministers were allotted cabinet rank, whereas three took charge as Ministers of State (independent charge). The remaining 14 took oath as MoS.
The expansion takes the number of ministers in the Modi cabinet to 66.
Here is the list of newly sworn-in ministers and all that you need to know about them:
Cabinet ministers
Manohar Parrikar, 58: The former Goa chief minister took oath as a cabinet minister on Sunday. A metallurgical engineering graduate from IIT-Bombay, he has a reputation for honesty and simplicity. He was praised as the 'Common Man's CM' for flying without security or entourage and carrying his own briefcase. He is tipped to be the defence minister.
Suresh Prabhu, 61: He was the chemical and fertilizer minister in the first National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government. Prabhu, who later became the environment minister during NDA, is known as a performer. A former Shiv Sena member, he is part of international bodies on sustainable growth and climate change. A law degree holder with doctorate in climate change from Germany, Prabhu is a strong votary of a balance between economic development and environment protection. His website says he has “uncommon whiff of much needed fresh air” who introduced amendment to the Patents Act that gave fillip to the Indian generic medicine industry.
Jagat Prakash Nadda, 54: Brought up in Patna, Nadda was one of the youngest legislators to be elected to Himachal assembly. The veteran politician who earned recognition as a Himachal Pradesh leader, lost the race for BJP's presidency to Amit Shah after the Lok Sabha elections. His big leap into politics started during Emergency in 1977 as Akhil Bhartiya Vidyarthi Parishad secretary. Nadda is known to maintain a low profile and claims himself to be a disciplined solider of the RSS.
Birendra Singh, 68: A long-time Congress man, he joined the BJP before assembly elections in Haryana this August to protest against the grand old party not agreeing to sacking of then chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda. In his long political career, he had been Congress in-charge for many states such as Uttarakhand and Himachal, and was the chairperson of many parliamentary standing committees. He had joined the BJP apparently on the assurance that he would get a Union cabinet berth.
Ministers of State (independent charge)
Bandaru Dattatreya, 67: A minister in Atal Bihari Vajpayee government, he was president of the BJP in newly created state of Telangana. An RSS activist, he was the founding member of the party in residual Andhra Pradesh and was chairperson of several parliamentary standing committees. He had been elected to the Lower House for the first time from Secunderabad in the 10th Lok Sabha.
Rajiv Pratap Rudy, 52: At an age of 38, he was inducted as one of the youngest ministers in the Vajpayee government in 2000. He was a minister of state and elevated with independent charge three years later and given the important portfolio of civil aviation. Alumni of Punjab University and MP from Bihar, he was in-charge of the party in Maharashtra, where the BJP emerged as the largest single party in the recently concluded assembly elections.
Dr Mahesh Sharma, 55: A doctor by profession, Sharma is an MP from Gautam Budh Nagar, Noida. He runs several charitable hospitals and clinics in the National Capital Territory. Sharma has been a long associate of the RSS and is former Noida MLA from the BJP.
Ministers of State
Hansraj Ahir, 59: He is a member of Lok Sabha from Chandrapur in Maharashtra and was instrumental in exposing the coal scam. It was on his letter to the Central Vigilance Commission that led to a CBI inquiry into the coal scam. He was face of the BJP in exposing the coal scam during the UPA regime and obtained relevant documents to embarrass the Manmohan Singh led government. An active Parliamentarian, Ahir had introduced a large number of private member bills in over 15 years as an MP.
Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, 57: A vocal BJP spokesperson and former minister of state for information and broadcasting, Naqvi had been the Muslim face of the party for long. Born in 1957 in Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh, Naqvi contested his first election on now-defunct Janata Party ticket in 1980 and was one of the ministers in Vajpayee’s cabinet in 1998. Known for freely airing his views, he created a flutter by saying that now even Dawood Ibrahim can join the BJP on decision to induct Bihar Janata Dal (United) leader Shabbir Ali during 2014 Lok Sabha elections.
Giriraj Singh, 54: His emergence on the national political scene had been rather dramatic. During Lok Sabha polls, the Election Commission debarred him from campaigning after he asked all Modi detractors to go to Pakistan. And after the polls he was in the news for about Rs. 1.14 crore stolen from his house in Patna. A firebrand Bhumihar leader from Bihar was a minister in Nitish Kumar-led Janata Dal (United) and BJP alliance government, and influences vast pockets in southern Bihar, which goes to polls in 2015, and election-bound Jharkhand.
Ram Kripal Yadav, 57: A former Lalu Prasad supporter, he quit the party after being denied a ticket from Pataliputra. He contested on a BJP ticket and defeated Prasad’s daughter Misa Bharti. A former deputy mayor of Patna and a law graduate, Yadav is known for his rhetoric in both the houses of Parliament, where he had represented Prasad’s RJD. An aggressive campaigner with vote base among backwards in Bihar, his induction will strengthen the BJP’s campaign to form the next government in the state in 2015 assembly elections.
Babul Supriyo, 44: It was on a flight with Baba Ramdev as co-passenger that singer Babul Supriyo’s political baptism took place. Ramdev reportedly asked Supriyo if he was interested in politics and contesting an election. The stocky singer’s induction gives West Bengal representation in the Modi cabinet. Supriyo’s thumping victory from Asansol on a BJP ticket was a huge boost for the party. Born and raised in Uttarpara, he is the musical heir to a prestigious musical family of West Bengal and the grandson of the noted composer, Banikantha NC Baral.
 
Jayant Sinha 51: The 51-year-old Hazaribagh MP, Jayant Sinha, is a former corporate honcho with wide experience in corporate governance and strategy consulting. He will be an asset in an economic ministry. Son of former finance minister Yashwant Sinha, he spent 12 years with McKinsey & Company as a partner apart from serving as president of Internet Business Capital Corp and in consulting positions at Stone & Webster and Synergic Resources Corporation, US. Sinha is an MBA with distinction from the Harvard Business School; has an MS in Energy Management and Policy from the University of Pennsylvania; and a B.Tech in Chemical Engineering with distinction from the IIT, Delhi.
Sanwar Lal Jat, 59: Sanwar Lal Jat had defeated Congress heavyweight Sachin Pilot from the Ajmer seat. His elevation balances the Jat-Rajput equation in Rajasthan. Jat is a powerful leader in the area and had quit the Vasundhara Raje Cabinet to contest the elections.
 
Mohan Kundariya: He is an influential leader from Patel community and MP from Rajkot. Powerful politician with strong roots in the Saurashtra region, he had served as minister in the Modi cabinet in Gujarat.
Ram Shankar, 50: A second-time Lok Sabha member from Agra, Shankar is an academician by profession and had been part of the party’s anti-corruption campaign. He was also part of several parliamentary committees in the 15th Lok Sabha. He was sworn in as member of state.
Vijay Sampla, 53: It is a rag to riches story for him. A Dalit employed as plumber in Saudi Arabia after his matriculation, he returned to Punjab a few decades ago and joined politics. A successful businessman now, Sampla was elected to Lok Sabha from Hoshiarpur in Punjab and inducted into the cabinet for the first time.
YS Chowdhary, 53: It has been a meteoric rise for the TDP leader. A businessman from Hyderabad, he was unanimously elected to Rajya Sabha in 2010. His brief bio-data on the Rajya Sabha website says he is an engineer by profession but was hand-picked for the election to upper house by TDP chief Chandrababu Naidu.
Haribhai Parthibhai Chaudhary, 60: He is an MP from Banaskantha in Gujarat. He has been the BJP member since 1988, and had been the vice-president of Gujarat state unit from 2005 to 2010.
Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti, 47: The lone women induction in the Modi cabinet, Jyoti is an MP from Fatepur who defeated RLD’s Amar Singh. She was in news recently after a bid on her life and well-known RSS leanings.

Science and religion are partners: Dan Brownauthors and poets
Of course, Dan Brown’s Penguin Annual Lecture 2014 was bursting at the seams
Of course it was a full house. In the country to deliver Penguin’s Annual Lecture 2014 in New Delhi, controversial and bestselling author Dan Brown ensured the city turned up in large numbers.
Mr. Brown proved less than five minutes into the lecture that he speaks like he writes — each word gripping and intelligent.
Titled ‘Codes, Science and Religion’, Mr. Brown’s lecture began with an insight into the author’s childhood. Growing up with a deeply religious mother and a passionately scientific-minded father, Mr. Brown said, holding up the old number plates from his mother’s and his father’s cars (KYRIE and METRIC), the age old battle between science and religion was squaring off right in his garage.
Punctuating the lecture with anecdotes, Mr. Brown spoke on the differences, and ultimately similarities, between science and religion.
“Science and religion are partners. They are two different languages telling the same story... While science dwells on the answers, religion savours the questions.” The question, Mr. Brown added, was how to become modern, scientific-minded people without losing on religion.
With a promise to come back to India as soon as possible, Mr. Brown ended on a hopeful note, admitting that the hero of his series Robert Langdon is going to be “very much around” in his next book.

BJP wins trust vote in Maharashtra AssemblyUpdated: November 13, 2014 02:37 IST
BJP wins trust vote in Maharashtra Assembly
B. Muralidhar Reddy
The Hindu Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis crossed a major hurdle on Wednesday when his minority Government won the confidence motion on the floor of the State Assembly with a voice vote.

Sena's Eknath Shinde is Leader of the Opposition; NCP, INC did not participate in the voice vote
The first Bharatiya Janata Party-led minority government in Maharashtra began its innings in the Assembly on a stormy note on Wednesday, winning the trust motion through a controversial voice vote and having its way in the election of the Speaker.
Minutes after the newly elected Speaker Haribhau Bagde declared that the trust motion had been passed through a voice vote, Shiv Sena and Congress members accused him of having violated the rules by not commending the motion to vote.
Later in the day, they continued their protest during the address of Governor Ch. Vidyasagar Rao at the joint session of the Assembly and the Council. They said continuance of the Devendra Fadnavis government was “unconstitutional” as it had not obtained the trust of the House. Earlier, amid din, the Speaker announced, “The motion has been passed.” When Sena and Congress members protested, Mr. Bagde said that it was too late.
The Sena said the Speaker jumped to the trust vote by skipping recognition of the Leader of the Opposition.
The Speaker told presspersons that when the agenda was made, he was not in office and he took the call to put the trust motion to vote first as it made no sense to talk of a Leader of the Opposition without a government.
Shiv Sena still hoping for a deal
It is still not clear whether the Sena wants to completely sever its ties with the BJP.
To completely break free, the Sena would be required not only to withdraw its representative in the Narendra Modi government Anant Geete but also end its alliance with the BJP without whose support it would lose majority in the cash rich Mumbai municipal corporation and other municipalities it governs.
On Tuesday after writing to the Assembly Speaker that it wants its leader in the House to be recognised as the Leader of the Opposition, the Sena insisted that its talks with the BJP would continue. The party clarified that it has staked claim for the post of the Leader of the Opposition only to ensure that the Congress does not bag it.
Since the declaration of the election results on October 19, both the Sena and the BJP have repeatedly declared their intent to ally in government formation. However, the BJP has made it abundantly clear that it required the Sena to come on board without any conditions. The tug of war between the two parties is essentially over the number of ministerial berths at the Centre as well as the State. The Sena upped the ante against the BJP after the NCP declaration that it has offered unconditional support to the Fadnavis government. It insisted that unless the BJP clearly spelt out its position on the NCP support, it would sit in the Opposition benches.
“We are not going to change our stand. If the BJP wants to take support of an anti-Hindutva party like the NCP, then they are free to do so. We will contest for the Speaker’s post,” said Sena’s group leader Eknath Shinde had said on Tuesday.

Lessons in self-reliancefood and dining (general)
Cookery courses run by institutions in the city help Kudumbashree units enhance women’s skills
Delicious smells of vadas and bondas being fried welcome us to Nalini’s Academy on Chittoor Road. Women from various Kudumbashree units (each comprising five women) in and around the city are busy making these snacks. While one set fries vadas, the other mills around the gas stove straining to watch. In another corner, a group gets the cutlet mix ready, while the readied snacks are being arranged in an adjacent room. It is ‘graduation’ day for these women.
These women belong to various Kudumbashree units in Njarakkal, Mulavukad and Kanjoor. It is the culmination of a 15-day cookery course which, they say, has helped them immensely. Some run small catering or snack-making business from their homes and for them this course is ‘skills enhancement’. The subject of the course is ‘ethnic snacks’ – vada, cutlet, bonda, laddu, jalebi, chips, potato wafers, mixture, pakkavada and the like. And teaching them is Nalini Verma who has been, for the last 15 years, working with various NGOs including Kudumbashree in training women in cookery, catering, sewing etc.
Apart from her work with NGOs and self-help groups Nalini runs a cookery school, Cinnamon, from her home in Panampilly Nagar where she teaches not only Indian but also foreign tourists.
Vimalalayam at Kacheripady and Food and Craft Institute, Kalamasserry, are the two other institutions in the city that train Kudumbashree units, says Tanny Thomas, co-ordinator of Kudumbashree’s Ernakulam activities. Some of the other institutes are situated in Perumbavoor and Thrissur.
“The culinary skills of the women, who join cookery courses as part of this programme, need to be fine-tuned. They are not skilled enough to start a commercial project, this is where these institutes come in,” she says.
The numerous Kudumbashree cafés and canteens bear witness to the efficacy of these institutions. They have been chosen on the basis of certain criteria which include the course structure, the duration of the course and feasibility. An accreditation process is in place to vet these institutions; Kudumbashree pays the fees for these courses. The skill training courses are many, but cookery is among the sought after courses. The progress is monitored by micro enterprises consultants (MECs) appointed by Kudumbashree. Only on completion of the course will they be eligible for the subsidised loan which will help them set up businesses.
Jasmine Ali, an MEC, is at Nalini’s Academy to test the ‘students’ and assess them. Based on her report and Nalini’s feedback, the women will get certificates ‘qualifying’ them. Jasmine says, “Women can stay at home and they see it as something they already know and are comfortable with so it is basically an extension of what they already do,” she adds.
The course at Vimalalayam, usually, runs for 20 days. Snacks, pickles, biriyani, welcome drink, and even everyday dishes such as a thoran are taught. “We teach 45- 47 items. We teach the students how to work in the concept of a balanced diet when they plan menus,” says Sister Gracy Joseph, DHM Vimalalayam, and co-ordinator of the Home Science programme and of training Kudumbashree units.
Nalini says of her students, “They ‘know’ the recipes. But often they use too many ingredients raising production costs. I teach them how to be cost-effective and the proportion of ingredients. I find that they add garlic and ginger or onions or spices to recipes randomly.”
Sr. Gracy agrees. “The method of cooking, before the women undergo the course, is random. For instance, some women use shallots for thoran, which doesn’t need it. Low cost, tasty and healthy is our motto.”
The timings of the classes vary – at Nalini’s Academy it is a flexible 10.30 a.m. to 2.30 p.m. and at Vimalalayam the timings are ‘very flexible’, “sometimes we schedule classes at 11 a.m. or even 1 p.m. so that we can accommodate the students,” says Sr. Gracy.
The assessment, by an MEC, of newly acquired cookery skills has two parts - ‘theory’ and ‘practical’. Theory is the recipe and how well they have learnt the processes and the practical test is cooking.
Naseema Jamal from Kanjoor is at Nalini’s Academy for the course with four of her friends. She runs a snack business at Kanjoor but is looking to extend their menu. “I know neiappam, nice pathiri, kayapola and the like. But we wanted to learn more. Things like pakkavada, chips, cutlet…this course has helped us.”
Kudumbashree Mission invites these units to participate in trade fairs as a means of encouragement and confidence building, says Jasmine.
The training imparted, according to Sr. Gracy, empowers women making them confident to try out new things. “There is a group in Kadavanthara which started a snack vending business and they are doing very well. They were able to increase their monthly repayment of the loan from Rs. 10,000 to Rs. 16,000 on a loan of Rs. 3 lakh. It is such an impressive achievement for those women and so encouraging for us,” says Sr. Gracy with pride.

Suspended Congress MLAs deny  injuring  Maharashtra GovernorThe suspended Congress MLAs alleged that the entire episode was a "conspiracy" by the BJP government.
Mumbai | Posted: November 12, 2014 8:20 pm
All five suspended Congress members of Maharashtra Assembly denied causing injury to Maharashtra Governor C Vidyasagar Rao on Wednesday and alleged that the entire episode was a “conspiracy” by the BJP government.
Talking to reporters, Congress MLAs Rahul Bondre, Jaykumar Gore, Virendra Jagtap, Abdul Sattar and Amar Kale said they did not heckle the Governor.
“The BJP legislator Girish Mahajan’s account of the alleged incident was taken as an eye-witness account, while we were not given a chance to put forth our side of the story.
Mahajan’s presence at the place of protest itself is suspicious, since he is the Governor’s bodyguard. How was he present there?” they said.
The MLAs appealed to reporters asking them to examine the the facts, since they too were present at the venue.
“We are confident that we will be proved innocent after the probe. If the government keeps us out for two years, we will tour the entire state and go to the people to highlight wrongdoings of the BJP government,” they said.

Indias first net zero energy buildingNEW DELHI, November 12, 2014

India’s first net zero energy building

Tweet
The Indira Paryavaran Bhavan.
It’s India’s first net zero energy building that has been constructed with adoption of solar passive design and energy-efficient building materials.
Functional since a year, a tour of the Indira Paryavaran Bhavan, a building under the Central Government, was organised by The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) and the Association for Development and Research of Sustainable Habitats on Tuesday. It was aimed at reinforcing the need for more such buildings across the country.
Speaking about the energy efficiency of the building, TERI (Sustainable Habitat Division) director Mili Majumdar said: “The Indira Paryavaran Bhavan is one of the first buildings in India to have deployed energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies at a large scale. It is one of the exemplary projects to be rated under Green Rating for Integrated Habitat Assessment [GRIHA] and has set standards that can be emulated by upcoming buildings in the region.”
The building boasts an earthquake-resistant structure with a total plinth area of 31,488 sq. m. It covers only 30 per cent of the total area, while more than 50 per cent area outside the building is a soft area with plantation and grass. The building has a robotic parking system in the basement that can accommodate 330 cars. Thin-client networking system has been provided instead of conventional desktop computers to minimise energy consumption.
“Buildings have an enormous impact on environment, human health and economy. The energy used to heat and power our buildings leads to consumption of large amounts of energy, mainly from burning of fossil fuels, oil, natural gases and coal, which generate significant amounts of carbon dioxide, the most widespread greenhouse gas. The successful adoption of green building strategies can maximise both the economic and environmental performances of buildings,” added Ms. Majumdar.
The building has received GRIHA 5-star (provisional) rating for the following features:
The design allows for 75 per cent of natural daylight to be utilised to reduce energy consumption.
The entire building has an access friendly design for differently-abled persons.
With an installed capacity of 930 kW peak power, the building has the largest rooftop solar system among multi-storied buildings in India.
The building is fully compliant with requirements of the Energy Conservation Building Code of India (ECBC). Total energy savings of about 40 per cent have been achieved through the adoption of energy efficient chilled beam system of air-conditioning. As per this, air-conditioning is done by convection currents rather than airflow through air handling units, and chilled water is circulated right up to the diffuser points unlike the conventional systems.
Green materials like fly ash bricks, regional building materials, materials with high recyclable content, high reflectance terrace tiles and rock wool insulation of outer walls have been used.
Use of renewable bamboo jute composite material for doorframes and shutters.
UPVC windows with hermetically sealed double glass. Calcium Silicate ceiling tiles with high recyclable content and grass paver blocks on pavements and roads.
Reduction in water consumption has been achieved by use of low-discharge water fixtures, recycling of waste water through sewage treatment plant, use of plants with low water demand in landscaping, use of geothermal cooling for HVAC system, rainwater harvesting and use of curing compounds during construction.

BSE Sensex gains 89 pts in early trade on positive economic dataPrint
Brokers say buying activities have gathered momentum on positive economic data as India's industrial production grew at 2.5 per cent in Sept. (Reuters)
By: Press Trust of India | Mumbai | Posted: November 13, 2014 10:15 am | Updated: November 13, 2014 4:58 pm
Snapping its three-day rally, the benchmark BSE Sensex today retreated from record highs to end over 68 points lower at 27,940.64 as the shares of state-owned oil companies fell as much as 6 per cent after the government hiked excise duty on petrol and diesel.
The 30-share Sensex commenced on a strong note and soared to the day’s high of 28,098.74 on positive inflation and factory output data announced yesterday.
However, it succumbed to profit-booking and dipped below the 28,000-mark to hit the day’s low of 27,822.70 before recovering partially to settle at 27,940.64, down by 68.26 points or 0.24 per cent.
Yesterday, the benchmark index had ended at an all-time closing high of 28,008.90 and also hit intra-day high of 28,126.48 on sustained foreign funds inflows driven by economic reforms undertaken by the government recently.
The 50-scrip NSE Nifty ended 25.45 points, or 0.30 per cent, down at 8,357.85 after shuttling between 8,408.00 and 8,320.35.
The gauge yesterday concluded at record 8,383.30 after scaling a lifetime (intra-day) high of 8,415.05.
Meanwhile, country’s industrial production grew at 2.5 per cent in September and retail inflation eased to 5.52 per cent in October from 6.46 per cent in September, according to data released after market hours yesterday.
Besides profit-booking in blue-chip stocks, sentiments also dampened after the government hiked excise duty on petrol and diesel prices by Rs 1.50 a litre each to mop up an additional Rs 13,000 crore in revenue.
Stocks of state-run companies such as BPCL, HPCL and Indian Oil Corp came under selling pressure and ended up to 6.11 per cent lower.
ONGC was among the biggest Sensex losers, plunging by 2.03 per cent, while RIL fell by 0.53 per cent.
Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) bought shares worth a net Rs 459.47 crore yesterday, according to provisional data from the stock exchanges.
Brokers said the market was in an over-bought position and participants adopted a cautious stance and preferred to lighten some positions by booking profits at record levels.
Selling was more pronounced in realty, PSU, metal, infrastructure, banking, power and auto stocks, which dragged down the key indices – Sensex and Nifty – from record highs.
Sesa Sterlite down by 2.50 per cent, Tata Power shed 2.47 per cent, GAIL fell 1.58 per cent, Axis Bank down 1.49 per cent, Hero MotoCorp by 1.38 per cent and HDFC by 1.14 per cent.
Bucking the trend, Infosys surged 1.77 per cent, Dr Reddy by 1.01 per cent, Cipla 0.91 per cent, Wipro 0.69 per cent, Bharti airtel 0.68 and Bajaj Auto 0.54 per cent and averted any major fall in the Sensex.
Among Sensex components, 16 stocks ended in negative territory, while 14 closed higher.
Sectorwise, BSE Oil & Gas index suffered the most by falling continued…

Adani Enterprises is forging ahead with ambitious plans to build Australia's biggest coal mine in the next three years, defying a collapse in coal prices to five-and-a-half-year lows as it seeks to supply power plants at home.
Australia's federal and Queensland state governments are eager to see the mine go ahead following the loss of more than 4,000 coal jobs, and Queensland has said Adani may make an announcement tied to the project when Prime Minister Narendra Modi is in Australia next week.
However, analysts and project finance experts believe the home-grown conglomerate may have underestimated the difficulties of raising funds for the US $7 billion mine , rail and port project in the current market.
They see the 2017 target for opening a mine as "highly aggressive", with no debt funding lined up, no rise in coal prices in sight, and uncertainty over coal output in the domestic market and demand growth in the country and north Asia.
"On a standalone basis, the economics just don't stack up - I'm talking about costs and return on capital. You'd need a price of about $100-$110 a tonne for it to stack up," said Daniel Morgan, global commodities analyst at UBS.
The benchmark Newcastle price for thermal coal is just US $62.66 a tonne, down 27 per cent in 2014.
The Carmichael mine in the untapped Galilee Basin has been on hold since Adani bought it in 2010, faced with a drawn-out approvals and funding process.
The infrastructure and trading conglomerate said in October it planned to start construction work in early 2015, aiming for first production from a 60-million-tonnes-a-year mine in 2017. At peak production it would boost Australia's thermal coal output by nearly 25 per cent.
FUNDING CHALLENGES
To start work in the next six months, however, Adani would need to bring in a partner or pour in its own money, since it has yet to line up project debt at a time when a third of Australia's coal output is loss-making, the country's analysts said.
Saddled with a net debt of about US $13 billion, the company would need to raise around US $1 billion through a share sale, a sale of a stake in the Abbot Point port or both.
"I think Adani will move slower with Carmichael than they say," said an analyst with a broker in Mumbai, adding that there were many risks.
Adani, which has appointed Morgan Stanley to advise on selling a stake in Abbot Point, said in an emailed statement that work was "progressing well to meet the project's 2017 first coal guidance."
The home-grown infrastructure major, however, refrained from commenting on any plans surrounding the visit by PM Modi, who is close to the company's billionaire founder Gautam Adani.
Adani is also facing anti-coal campaigners who are fighting in courts to stop the mine and pressing banks not to lend for the port expansion, arguing that dredging and exports could harm the World Heritage-listed Great Barrier Reef.
In a counter attack, Adani has launched advertisements on Australian television on the economic benefits of the project.
The company is counting on lining up funding from South Korea, having named POSCO Engineering & Construction as the preferred contractor to build the 388 km rail line.
"We would note that our rail partner, POSCO E&C, has been advertising work opportunities and proposed work plans online and in trade publications for several months for early 2015," a spokesman for Adani said.
However both POSCO E&C and potential funding partner South Korea's Export-Import Bank said any agreements were at very early stages.
"It is hard to predict when a contract will be signed," said a POSCO E&C spokesman in Seoul.

BJP faces crisis; denies tickets to 7 of its sitting MLAsBJP
(In the past few days, two…)
SRINAGAR: Notwithstanding massive preparations to achieve its Mission Kashmir , the BJP is facing a crisis within. BJP has denied tickets to seven of its 10 members in the assembly, and some of them have now turned against the party. In the past few days, two of its sitting MLAs defected to other parties while another is contesting independently.
Basholi MLA Jagdish Raj Sapolia joined Congress after BJP named Choudhary Lal Singh its candidate for the seat. Singh, a former Congress minister and two-time MP, moved to the saffron party after Congress denied him a ticket this time. Sapolia's counterpart in Hira Nagar, Durga Dass, joined the Panthers Party. Master Lal Chand , who was representing Bani in the assembly, is contesting independently.
Reports from Jammu suggest that its Reasi representative Baldev Raj Sharma is seeking mandate from the People's Democratic Party . In case he fails to get a ticket, he might contest as independent. Girdhari Lal Baghat, who was initially tipped to be the BJP candidate from Ramban, was denied the ticket at the last moment. He joined the National Conference.
The BJP is facing crisis in Udhampur, Billawar, Khour and Akhnoor, too. In some constituencies, party cadres are against "thrusting" non-local candidates when local talent is available. The situation has led the party to send senior leaders to pacify the disgruntled lot. Some of them have been promised berths in the legislative council once the elections are over. They include Raipur Damana MLA Bharat Bushan.
A party insider however told ET the media was reading too much into the so-called dissidence.

South Africa can break World Cup jinx: Du PlessisWorld Cup Cricket
South Africa reached semifinals in 1992, 1999 and 2007 editions of World Cup.
South Africa batsman Faf du Plessis believes they have a team that can win the upcoming International Cricket Council (ICC) World Cup to be held in Australia and New Zealand February 14-March 29.
Talking about his team’s chances in the quadrennial One-Day International (ODI) tournament, du Plessis said, “It’s too hard to judge on past experience. For me, it’s the team you have and the results you have been getting. We have got a really good team at the moment and we’ve been winning a lot of games.”
South Africa reached semifinals in 1992, 1999 and 2007 editions of World Cup.
“In the past, we went to a World Cup where we probably weren’t the best side. People judge you on not winning the World Cup. This time I feel we’ve got a really good side and we’ve been winning, so everything is stacking up nicely for us now,” he was quoted as saying by Sydney Morning Herald on Wednesday.
South Africa, being coached by Gary Kirsten who coached India too in 2011 and helped them win the World Cup, are getting ready to face Australia in a five-match ODI series starting on Friday.
The 30-year-old Du Plessis said that the series is all about preparing for the World Cup.
“Winning is also important and this will be a very good challenge for us playing Australia in their home conditions, we’ll probably play them in a semifinal or something like that in the World Cup.”

Excise duty on petrol & diesel hiked by Rs 1.50/litre; to boost government finances

Crude Oil Prices
(Apart from boosting revenue…)
NEW DELHI: Government has raised excise duty on petrol and diesel hiked by Rs 1.50 per litre. The move comes in order to boost government revenues and contain budget borrowing that could put off a likely cut in the retail prices of the two fuels.
While the duty on branded petrol excise was hiked to Rs 3.85/litre from Rs 2.35/litre, that on unbranded petrol was hiked to Rs 2.70/litre from Rs 1.20/litre. Excise duty for branded diesel was raised to Rs 5.25/litre from Rs 3.75/litre and that of unbranded diesel was hiked to Rs 2.96/litre from Rs 1.46/litre.
Earlier this week, ET had reported that the government was likely to take this step in order to ensure that ensure the recent sharp decline in international oil prices, apart from benefiting consumers by cutting fuel bills at the pump, also benefits the exchequer by helping it improve its stressed finances.
The first round of discussions on this issue was held last week in the finance ministry, which is grappling with ways to make up the likely shortfall in indirect tax collections. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley took stock of collections of indirect taxes on Saturday.
Apart from boosting revenue collections in the short term, another consideration in increasing levies - customs and excise - is to create a buffer of sorts that can be tapped into when international oil prices start rising again.
The thinking is that if all the benefits of softer crude prices are passed on to consumers now, revising prices upwards will cause a lot of angst once international oil prices start rising.
International oil prices have fallen nearly 25% in the past five months, in step with a global commodities decline. The country's average crude import cost, as measured by the Indian crude basket (a weighted average of crude from three sources) has fallen to $80.87 per barrel (Rs 4,970) on November 7 from $108.05 per barrel (Rs 6,331) on May 26, the day the Narendra Modi government assumed office.
Much of this decline has been passed on to consumers. Petrol prices are down to Rs 64.24 a litre in Delhi now from a peak of over Rs 76 in September 2013. Diesel is down from Rs 58.97 per litre to Rs 53.35 in Delhi and the fall in prices has even allowed the government to take the politically tough decision to decontrol prices of this most widely used fuel.
Another round of price cuts is expected this week.

Swaraj Paul s group to set up mattress manufacturing plantSwaraj Paul's group to set up mattress manufacturing plant in Haryana
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: November 13, 2014  | 16:22 IST
PM Narendra Modi (Reuters)
Acting on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 'Make in India' campaign , Lord Swaraj Paul's Caparo group plans to set up a manufacturing facility in India to produce its range of luxury mattresses by end of next fiscal.
"We plan to set up a manufacturing facility for mattresses in Bawal in Haryana by end of year 2015. We want to build the plant that has the right scale and right skill," Caparo India Chairman Angad Paul told PTI.
Paul did not share details of investment the company will be making in the new plant.
At present, Caparo's luxury mattress range 'Dream Catcher' priced between Rs 1.5-20 lakh, is imported from UK.
The company, which has opened an exclusive showroom in Gurgaon, plans to open more showrooms in metros and mini metros in the coming months, the company said in a statement.
When asked if the company is looking at launching cheaper version of the mattresses, Paul said that it will not compromise with quality to sell a lower priced product.
Caparo, which has a business partnership with UK's Harrison Spinks to make mattresses, also plans to export made in India mattresses across the world.
Praising PM Modi, Paul said: "This government is following a path of being much more fair, which is what I consider important. It is, at least right now, looking at making a proper stab at corruption and patronage, which is essential for this country's progress."
Caparo Group designs and manufactures value-added steel and engineering products for the automotive, aerospace, transport, infrastructure and defence sectors.

India  Russia may decide to co-produce aircraft  helicopters during Putin s Delhi tripcivilian aircraft
(During Putin’s maiden…)
NEW DELHI: Eyeing joint-production of military and civilian items with a foreign partner, India and Russia could clinch deals on co-production of mid-range civilian aircraft as well as military helicopters during President Vladimir Putin's trip to Delhi on December 11-12.
During Putin's maiden visit to Delhi for the annual summit after Modi became the Prime Minister the two sides might agree on joint production of the MC-21 mid-range civilian aircraft, South Block officials said. This aircraft can carry 180 passengers and have a range of 5,000 km.
The first flight of this aircraft - currently being manufactured in Russia -- is scheduled for 2016, and the mass production will begin in 2017. Thereafter the aircraft could also be jointly produced in India, sources indicated. "The Russian project fits into Modi's agenda of Make in India which will not only create domestic jobs but also result in transfer of technology and self-sufficiency in the long run," an official remarked.
Similarly, the two countries are currently discussing the possibility of building production plants in India for the Sukhoi Superjet-100 - another civilian aircraft. Officials said that this will not only meet the needs of the Indian market but also enable joint-entry into the markets of other countries. Indonesia has already expressed interest to purchase Sukhoi Superjet -100. Sukhoi is no stranger to India as Indian Air Force has been using advanced Sukhoi fighter jets.
Putin's visit could also witness an agreement on joint production of KA-226 helicopters in India that can be utilised for both military and civilian purposes. The helicopter has performed well at high-altitude and would come handy for India's mountainous terrain, sources claimed. Indian Air Force and Army have been using Russian manufactured helicopters for disaster relief and rescue missions besides combat operations.
The Modi government has also expressed interest in collaboration in aircraft engine manufacturing projects and this was discussed at last week's Sushma Swaraj-Dmitry Rogozin meeting in Delhi, sources informed.
Joint initiatives in the field of space will be a key item on the agenda of Modi-Putin summit on . Ahead of the Summit both sides will hold different consultations on cooperation in space exploration. These will involve manned space missions and deployment of projects in India connected to the use of the Russian navigation system GLONASS, according to officials.
The two sides are also looking at the possibility of joint-production in India of GLONASS signal receiving modules and introduction of the ERA-GLONASS satellite monitoring system for transport vehicles, which are used for automatic notification of emergency services in case of accidents and other emergencies. Officials recalled that two countries have had old cooperation in the field of space including supply of cryogenic engines by Moscow when Delhi faced Western sanctions. Space instrument engineering could be a new area of partnership for future, officials hinted.
Meanwhile, officials said that the two sides are still working on the possibility of visit by Putin to Kudankulam Atomic Power Project site following Modi's invitation to the Russian leader when they met at Brazil. "Unlike Chinese President Xi Jinping Putin travels on short-business like visits and two city schedule in a host nation is often not on his cards. But the possibility of visit to Tamil Nadu to project site is being explored," an pointed out an official speaking on the condition of anonymity.

Top 5 British CocktailRecipesA still from the movie Cocktail
Written by Khyati Rajvanshi | Oxford | Posted: November 13, 2014 4:05 pm
One thing British people are good at is drinking. Their livers are no doubt made out of steel and even after spending a year in the United Kingdom; I still fail to understand how they manage to be alive the day after drinking so much. Their love of drinking inspired me to have a look at some of the British originated cocktails. We all know about American cocktails such as Bloody Mary, Margarita, and so on but do we really focus on cocktails from other continents?
This article will help you know them, how to make them and where to get them when you are in the UK.
1. Pornstar Martini
Pornstar Martini
My personal favorite! Pornstar Martini is for people like me who like to have a heavenly mix of sweet and sour cocktails. A man named Douglas Ankrah – who apparently is a legend in the bartending world, created this magical orgasmic cocktail. The fact that he founded the London Academy of Bartending basically says how much of a legend he is. Porstar Martini was at first dubbed the Maverick Martini after a shady club in Capetown, South Africa (I wonder why) but then later on renamed as the Pornstar Martini because of all the passion Ankhar would out into this drink.
And here is how you make it:
Ingredients:
25ml Passoa, Passion Fruit Liqueur
2 Teaspoons Vanilla Sugar
Splash of pressed apple (optional)
Shot of champers
Method:
Shake and strain all the ingredients together into a martini glass and serve the champers on the side. Half of a passion fruit shell floats as the garnish.
2. Pimm’s No. 1 Cup
Pimm’s No. 1 Cup
Pimm’s is the most English drink that you would ever find in the Brit world. It is a lovely drink to have during summer. The history of its origin is quite interesting – Once upon a time (about 1823), a farmer’s son named Pimm served a gin-based drink containing a secret mixture of herbs and liqueurs as an aid to digestion in an oyster bar owned by him in the City of London. He used to serve it in a tankard and called it the No. 1 Cup. Ever since then, Pimm’s began its large scale production in 1851 and produced about seven products. Pimm’s No. 1 Cup is more known and liked by the people, which is based on gin and can be served both on ice or in cocktails.

Uttarakhand murders: Delhi couple in wrong place at wrongtimePrint
Written by Sanjay Singh | Chakratala | Posted: November 13, 2014 4:00 pm | Updated: November 13, 2014 4:06 pm
The Delhi-based woman and her boyfriend, who were allegedly murdered by a taxi driver and his three accomplices in Uttarakhand, had taken a shared taxi to Tiger Falls probably because they could not afford to hire a car.
Anil Chandna, a shopkeeper at the Chakrata market, told Newsline that they had been asking around about the trekking route to the falls. “The man seemed reluctant to pay Rs 1,500 for a full taxi. He asked me about the trekking route to Tiger Falls, but I advised him against it. They booked two seats in a shared vehicle probably because of financial constraints,” Anil said on Wednesday.
Local residents said tourists rarely took shared vehicles to go to the Tiger Falls. “These (shared) vehicles are usually used by the local people or meant for transporting goods. It is very surprising that the woman and her friend decided to take a shared taxi,” Lebru Das who works in the local forest rest house, said. He added that shared vehicles usually charged Rs 50 per person for Tiger Falls.
Meanwhile, residents of Tungrauli village, where all four accused come from, were shocked to find out that Raju Das (the taxi driver), Bablu Das, Guddu Das and Kundan Das, were allegedly involved in the murder of the two tourists.
“He (Raju) was in the village in the first half of Diwali. But he could not be spotted in the village in the second half,” Keshar Singh from Tungrauli said. The village is located very close to the falls.
According to the residents of the village, Bablu, Guddu and Kundan live in houses adjacent to one another. Raju, they said, lived a few yards away. Raju, Bablu and Guddu are married, while Kundan is single.
Village residents said Raju had moved out Vikash Nagar. “But, he visits often. Bablu is his close friend,” Keshar Singh said.
The families of Bablu, Guddu and Kundan too were shocked to find out about their alleged involvement in the case. “I can’t believe that my husband is involved in this crime,” Bablu’s wife Babli said. Guddu’s wife Julu Devi refused to comment.
Kundan’s mother Nandi Devi, however, claimed that her son was present in the village on October 23 and 24. “He was in the field on both days,” she claimed.
According to police, the last location of the couple was traced to Tiger Falls on October 23 on the basis of calls made from their cellphones.
According to records maintained by Uttarayan hotel, where the two had put up, they checked in at 11.35 am on October 23.
“They wanted to stay in our hotel for three to four days. But, all rooms were booked on October 23. So, I requested him to check out on October 23,” caretaker Sultan Singh Chauihan said.
According to Sultan, they had paid Rs 600 for their one-day stay. He also claimed that saw them in Chakrata area later that day.

Uttarakhand murders: Body of Delhi womanrecoveredPrint
Written by Sanjay Singh | Dehradun | Posted: November 13, 2014 3:50 pm | Updated: November 13, 2014 4:04 pm
Uttarakhand Police claimed to have recovered the body of the Delhi woman, who was killed while touring with her boyfriend in Chakarata, on Thursday.
Earlier, a taxi driver Raju Das, who reportedly took the woman and her boyfriend to Tiger Falls near Chakarata, confessed that he had killed the Delhi couple . As per the police claim, one of the four accused persons also confessed that the woman was raped by him before being killed.
Her boyfriend’s body was recovered from an area under the Purola police station on October 30. However, the police had cremated the body after failing to identify it. Later, the police matched the body with the photographs of her boyfriend and confirmed that the recovered body was of the same person. The police have lodged a murder case in this connection.
“We have recovered the decomposed body of the Delhi woman from the Yamuna near Damda. The woman’s family members are on way to Purola police station to identify the body,” Uttarkashi SP J R Joshi told the Indian Express on phone.
According to SP Joshi, efforts were on to trace the body in the river Yamuna for the last two days. “On Thursday, we pressed Uttarakhand’s State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) into service to recover the body from the river,” Joshi further said.
The woman and her boy friend had reached Chakarata on October 22 and checked into a hotel there. On October 23, they checked out and went to Tiger Falls in a shared taxi driven by main accused Raju. After this the couple went missing  and the woman’s father lodged a complaint with the Delhi’s Saket police station area. While the woman used to teach in a private school, her boyfriend was a painter. They lived in a rented house in Delhi’s Lado Sarai area.
In the first week of November, a team of Delhi police arrived Dehradun in search of the driver Raju Das in connection with the mysterious disappearance case of the Delhi couple. Police sources said the Delhi police had suspected Raju’s role in the case after knowing that the cell-phone set, which belonged the Delhi couple, was in his (Raju) possession. “Raju had started using the cell-phone set by inserting a new SIM card into it,” a source in the Dehradun police said.
During interrogation, Raju confessed that he and accomplices Guddu, Bablu and Kundan had killed the couple on their return from Tiger Falls on December 23. Incidentally, all four accused are natives of the same Tungarauli village near Tiger Falls.
Police claimed the four accused first targeted the boyfriend and strangulated him to death. Later, one of the accused allegedly raped the Delhi woman before she was killed. While the body of her boy friend was pushed off a cliff, they took the woman’s body two km ahead from there and threw it into the Yamuna.

MUMBAI: India's largest drugmaker Sun Pharmaceuticals Industries posted a 15% rise in net profit at Rs 1,572 crore for the second quarter ended September 2015, staying in line with Street expectations. The company had recorded a profit Rs 1,362 crore in the same quarter previous year. Its net sales rose 13% atRs 4,750 crore, against Rs 4,192 crore in the year-ago period.
"Our Q2 performance was strong and we achieved a high level of profitable growth, in line with our expectations. We remain focused on strengthening our existing businesses and developing a differentiated and specialty product basket as well as planning for the Ranbaxy integration. We also continue to review opportunities to expand and strengthen our global footprint," said Dilip Shanghvi, managing director, Sun Pharma.
Consolidated R&D expense for Q2 FY15 was Rs 312 crore, or 6.6%, of its sales. The drugmaker said it had "comprehensive product offering in the US market with approved ANDAs for 354 products while filings for 130 products await US FDA approval, including 11 tentative approvals".
The total number of patent applications submitted stands at 576, with 346 patents granted so far. In March this year, Sun Pharma announced the acquisition of Ranbaxy in a stock transaction of $4 billion, making it the fourth largest generic drugmaker in the world. While the acquisition received approval from the stock exchanges and shareholders, Sun, however, clarified that it is yet to receive approval from competition authorities in the US and India.
For Sun Pharma, the US business which contributes more than half of the company's overall revenue, grew by 15% at $481 million, largely driven by strong numbers from its subsidiary Taro. The India business, where Sun ranks second, recorded a growth of 21% at Rs 1,152 crore, driven by neurology, cardiac and diabetic products.
Sun Pharma also gave an update of its agreement with the US drugmaker Merck for an exclusive worldwide licensing pact with Merck's investigational candidate, tildrakizumab, (MK-3222) for the treatment of chronic psoriasis, a skin ailment, which is currently in Phase 3 registration trials. Under the terms of the agreement, Sun Pharma will acquire worldwide rights to tildrakizumab for use in all human indications from Merck in exchange for an upfront payment of $80 million, milestone payments and tiered royalties.

Govt to review gold policy after surge in im...China
(Officials from the Indian…)
NEW DELHI/MUMBAI: India is considering curbs on gold imports by private trading firms after foreign purchases surged in the past two months, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.
October shipments into India, the world's No.2 gold consumer after China , jumped to about 150 tonnes, compared with under 25 tonnes a year earlier and 143 tonnes in September, a third source, a top finance ministry official, said on Thursday.
All three sources declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue.
Measures under discussion would restrict imports by private trading firms, which started importing gold around the middle of this year after being barred from doing so from July 2013, the first two sources said.
Officials from the Indian central bank and finance ministry are meeting on Thursday to discuss the policy, local media and Bloomberg have reported.
The October jump follows a 450 percent surge in September imports to $3.75 billion that weighed on the country's trade deficit, sparking fears that the government could tighten the screws again on gold.
Any new restrictions could increase local premiums to the global benchmark and hurt consumer demand.
Reduced Indian gold buying would also pressure global prices , already smarting from weakening demand in China.
Struggling with a high trade deficit, India last year raised its gold import duty to a record 10 percent and made it mandatory to export a fifth of all bullion imports.
The moves crimped supply, boosted local premiums and encouraged smuggling.
Earlier this year, India eased some of those rules by allowing private agencies to import gold. Imports have since been higher than last year's low levels.
India's gold imports are typically strong in the second half of the year as banks and retailers stock up for major festivals such as Dhanteras and Diwali, when it is considered auspicious to buy gold. The ongoing wedding season is also boosting consumer demand.
India's appetite for gold jumped by more than a third to 225.1 tonnes in the July-Sept quarter, in sharp contrast to the rest of the world, boosted by jewellery demand, the World Gold Council said on Thursday.
"Given the recent seasonality, it would be advisable to wait for another month or two of gold import data before re-imposing any restrictions," Nomura analysts said in a note on Thursday.
"There has been some increase in underlying gold demand as well, but we do not expect this to be sustained."

HYDERABAD: The Indian defence and aerospace industry will offer business opportunity in the range of $200 billion in the next 15 years, former Secretary, Department of Defence Research and Development V K Saraswat said today.
Out of this, $30 billion would be by way of offsets alone, he told reporters on the sidelines of 'Defence and Aerosupply India', a three-day industry conclave which began yesterday.
He stressed on developing technological prowess in the country rather than excessively depending on others.
Referring to the 'Make in India' endeavour of the government, Saraswat, also a former adviser to the Defence Minister, said it should be "Design and Make in India", suggesting that designing also be done in a big way in the country.
"We need to build critical technology in the country. Otherwise, the self-reliance index cannot grow," he said.
Saraswat lauded the role of PSUs and ordnance factories in building and developing products for the country's requirements over the years, but said PSUs need to function in a corporate manner to be more competitive.
On the occasion, Chief Secretary of Telangana Rajiv Sharma , an organiser of the event, said the state government is keen on promoting the aerospace and defence sector in the city.
The government would soon come up with an industrial policy that would be business-friendly and aimed at promoting industrial growth in a big way, he said.

In his autobiography Playing It My Way, Tendulkar has written that, despite being one of the finest all-rounders, he was disappointed with Kapil during his brief tenure as India coach in 1999-2000. “Everyone is entitled to their personal opinion and if that is his view, good luck to him in his endeavour. I feel bad when people do not have an opinion about me because that means I do not exist for them. That is really bad. Otherwise, good or bad, everyone should have an opinion,” Kapil said at the launch of SloPho.com, a new social platform.
Kapil also said it was normal for people, including media, to sensationalise everything to promote themselves but he was not bothered. Kapil, who along with Sunil Gavaskar has been invited to be part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s delegation to Australia later this month, was more forthcoming on the visit.
“I am honoured by the invite even though I have not yet been informed officially. But I am sure it will be great. I can’t say what my role would be on the tour but as cricketers, I am happy to be part of the Prime Minister’s cricketing diplomacy. It is up to him on how he uses us,” Kapil, who was also part of the famous inaugural bus ride to Lahore under Atal Bihari Vajpayee, said.
Kapil, who is co-owner of the new portal, said Modi’s “make in India” slogan was instrumental in the development of the SloPho.com.
The portal aims to be a “secure, social, gaming collaboration platform” that would allow users to win prizes through posting text and photos and playing games, contests, polls and quizzes. It would also allow registered corporates and professionals to put gamified promotions directly and engage users around their brand, with 50 corporates already on board, according to the company.

Fortis Healthcare on Thursday reported a consolidated net loss of Rs 58.12 crore for the quarter ended September.
The company had posted a net profit after taxes, minority interest and share of profit of associates at Rs 32.06 crore for the corresponding period of the previous fiscal, Fortis Healthcare said in a statement.
Consolidated total income of the company stood at Rs 1,031.20 crore for the quarter under consideration as against Rs 1,282.46 crore for the same period a year ago, it added.
"The reported results for Q2FY15 are not comparable to the corresponding previous period due to progressive divestments of the company's international businesses namely Fortis Hoan My, Vietnam and Quality Healthcare, Hong Kong during the course of FY14," Fortis Healthcare said.
In another filing to the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), the company said its board has accepted the resignation of Aditya Vij, chief executive officer of the company who would be leaving the firm by year-end and entrusted Shivinder Mohan Singh, Executive Vice Chairman with this additional responsibility in the interim.
Shares of Fortis Healthcare closed at Rs 116.40 per scrip on BSE on Thursday.

By: Press Trust of India | Srinagar | Posted: November 13, 2014 4:15 pm | Updated: November 13, 2014 4:56 pm
Political parties in Kashmir on Thursday welcomed the life sentence given to army personnel in the Machil fake encounter case even as they called for action in a similar incident in Pathribal.
“The army has handed out life sentences to seven inc(luding) the Commanding officer in the Machil fake encounter case of 2010. This is indeed a very welcome step,” Chief Minister Omar Abdullah posted on Twitter.
Pradesh Congress Committee also welcomed the the GCM verdict saying it is good that law has taken its course and justice has been done.
“We welcome the verdict. Law has taken its course as it  should have,” PCC vice president Ghulam Nabi Monga said.
He said the court martial proceedings in other cases like Pathribal should also be expedited.
State secretary of CPI (M) Mohammad Yousuf Tarigami also welcomed the decision saying “for the first time, army has acted in such a case in a firm manner.”
“It will send a strong message among the security forces that such criminal acts are not acceptable to the nation,” Tarigami said.
He said there were other cases like Pathribal fake encounter killings which are not covered yet.
“We hope that the other cases will also be taken to logical conclusion and dealt with firmly,” he added.
No one from the main opposition PDP was available for comment on the development.
In April, 2010, the army had said it had killed three infiltrators in Machil sector and claimed they were Pakistani militants.
The men were later identified as Shahzad Ahmad Khan,  Riyaz Ahmad Lone and Muhammad Shafi Lone, all residents of Baramulla district.

Virat Kohli named World Cup star ambassador alongwith fourothersBy: Press Trust of India | Dubai | Posted: November 13, 2014 4:15 pm
India’s Virat Kohli joins an elite list of star ambassadors to provide necessary support in the build-up to the ICC 2015 World Cup to be co-hosted by Australia and New Zealand between February and March.
Kohli, Australian pacer Mitchell Johnson, all-rounder Shane Watson, New Zealand skipper Brendon McCullum and Sri Lankan veteran Kumar Sangakkara have been appointed ambassadors for cricket’s most-anticipated event, which is now only 92 days away.
The ICC Ambassadors will add their support and considerable profile in the build-up to and during the showpiece event. The star players will also be involved in the ICC’s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programme and event promotions.
Kohli, a star for India in their victorious 2011 World Cup campaign, said: “It is a matter of pride to be selected as the ambassador of ICC. I thank ICC for bestowing this honour upon me. As a cricketer, I wish to spread the passion of cricket to grassroot levels and I look at this as an opportunity to unify global initiatives for cricket throughout the world.”
Aussie speedster and World Cup winner Johnson, was delighted to be part of the elite group that will be supporting the 50-over WOrld Cup.
“As Australia and New Zealand gear up to host ICC Cricket World Cup 2015, I am extremely proud and delighted to be associated with the competition as an ambassador. I look forward to helping promote what is set to be a fascinating tournament with some outstanding teams gearing up to claim cricket’s most coveted prize.
“I have been fortunate to participate in two World Cups to date and the Australia team is working hard to head into this tournament with some form and momentum. The tournament is going to really capture the imagination of the Australian and New Zealand public and there’s a real buzz about it. I’m sure all lovers of the game will relish it as much as the players,” said Johnson.
McCullum, who has featured in the past three World Cups, said: “With the World Cup just months away, no doubt all
countries will be actively plotting and planning their campaigns. In 1992 our sport captivated the nations of both New Zealand and Australia, and I have no doubt the 2015 edition will do just the same.
“I am confident the tournament will again inspire a generation of Kiwis and Aussies to fall in love with this great summer game. After representing NZ at three previous Cricket World Cups, It is very humbling to be presented the opportunity to be an ambassador of this edition of the tournament and also the ICC during World Cup year. May the
best team win!”
Sangakkara, who featured in the 2007 and 2011 finals in the West Indies and India, said: “I am honoured to have been appointed an ambassador for the forthcoming ICC World Cup in Australia next year alongside some great players.
“The ICC World Cup is the showpiece event in the global game for both players and fans – a festival continued…

Pondicherry University V-C under fire over alleged financialirregularitiesPrint
Written by Arun Janardhanan | Chennai | Posted: November 13, 2014 4:08 pm | Updated: November 13, 2014 4:22 pm
If almost a dozen probe reports lying before the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) on Pondicherry University administration are to be believed, Vice Chancellor Chandra Krishnamurthy, who is facing a series of allegations, has had enough reasons to repatriate the registrar Rajeev Yaduvanshi, an IAS officer last week who fought V-C with tooth and nail. His repatriation order that came on October 24 had sparked major protests in the campus besides hunger strikes and gheroing the administration seeking the removal of V-C and reinstatement of Yaduvanshi.
Dissent and anger had been brewing in the campus ever since Krishnamurthy took charge as V-C in February 2013. There had been a number of petitions and official probe reports on violations and financial irregularities against the V-C, which are all now lying before the MHRD and Minister Smriti Irani with attached evidences of major statutory violations by her administration.
This is besides the point as her appointment as V-C itself was challenged before the Madras high court questioning her qualification. Petitions were sent to MHRD for flouted rules in her selection in November 2012 as she had no qualification required for the V-C post and the then HRD minister Pallam Raju had recommended her name on December 10, 2012 to the V-C post with the help of an under secretary instead of submitting a list of three candidates to the President. “But a group of ministry officials ran the show in UPA regime continue to take decisions in MHRD and they have buried almost all the evidences and probe reports submitted by Yaduvanshi,” said a senior ministry official.
A section of officials familiar with the state of affairs at the Pondicherry University, one of the earliest central universities in the country, feel that the academics and students had decided to express solidarity with the registrar Yaduvanshi, an IAS officer, with due reasons and protest against his repatriation. Protests against the V-C erupted first in April 2014 with a shocking incident of illegal detention of a post graduate student by a professor close to V-C aided by a security personnel for 27 hours. Charges against the student was that he entered the University girl’s hostel.
According to an internal probe report submitted before the then MHRD secretary Ashok Thakur in June 2014, the student S Radhakrishnan, a first year MA Tamil student, was detained under V-C’s order by S Hariharan, director of Academic Staff College, who is on deputation at the university. The student under illegal detention for more than 27 hours was tortured to confess and paraded before the girl’s hostel. But what had put the V-C in trouble later was not just the illegal detention, but a finding by the disciplinary committee probe that the student was not guilty as he was in the university library at the time when he was alleged to have entered the hostel.
Evidences including a probe report and CCTV footage are now before MHRD, and an order from National Human Rights Commission (NHRD) sought action against the V-C in this case last month. An FIR was also filed in the local police station against V-C and Hariharan for the illegal detention. But not only did the V-C refrain from taking any action against Hariharan till date, she had continued…

Rahul Gandhi trashes Modis Swachh Bharat Campaign  says its a photoopPrint

Written by Manoj C G | New Delhi | Posted: November 14, 2014 12:05 am | Updated: November 14, 2014 1:25 am
Congress president Sonia Gandhi and vice-president Rahul Gandhi on Thursday launched an offensive to isolate BJP and the Sangh parivar by drawing a secularism versus communalism battle line. Rahul first took a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi by calling Swachh Bharat Abhiyan a mere “photo opportunity”, and then said the foundation of social harmony in the country has been weakened with the spreading of “poison” of communalism.
Addressing party workers at a function on the eve of the 125th birth anniversary of Jawaharlal Nehru, Sonia said had Nehru been alive, he would have asked all Congressmen to fight “communal forces”, and become “valiant soldiers of secularism”. She said her party would fight “ideologies, institutions and individuals” who have been trying to demolish Nehru’s concept of “liberal India”.
Congress is hoping to use Nehru’s birth anniversary to rally secular forces and boost the morale of party workers. Sonia has written to leaders of all parties, barring BJP and its allies, inviting them to an international conference next week.

Both Sonia and Rahul admitted the party is passing through one of its most difficult periods. “In the 129 years of our existence, we have faced many difficulties and fought them…because we have learnt from our leaders how to face adversities,” Sonia said.
Rahul said India’s foundation was built on love and brotherhood. “But today, this foundation is being demolished. On one hand, roads are being cleaned. Everybody is getting a photo opportunity cleaning the roads, but on the other poison is being spread,” he said.
Rahul admitted Congress has committed some mistakes, but did not elaborate.
He said the government was being run by those who nurture anger and accused it of even trying to junk English. The pitch for English by Rahul has been seen as an attempt to reach out to the aspirational middle-class.

COMAC: Chinese manufacturer may become conte...(China's large internal…)
By Christina Larson
ZHUHAI: In a private room at Airshow China set aside for discreet deal making, the Commercial Aviation Corp. of China has hung a picture of President Xi Jinping sitting in the cockpit of one of its new planes.
The glossy photo is more than just a celebrity endorsement: It represents the status of the company, known as COMAC, as the country's largest foray into commercial aviation. And COMAC has ambitions to push beyond the borders of China, facing off directly with Western heavyweights in a global market that by some estimates is expected to see more than $4 trillion in sales over the next 20 years.
At the air show here, COMAC's two biggest projects, the ARJ21 regional jet and the C919 jetliner, are front and center - although the C919 has yet to make its first flight. And even though COMAC has many obstacles to surmount, the competition is paying attention. Marwan Lahoud, the head of strategy and marketing for the European plane maker Airbus Group, said he expected to see COMAC going head-to-head with Airbus and its American rival Boeing for airline orders by the beginning of the next decade.
"They are not yet completely organized, but this will happen," Lahoud said. "If Air France or British Airways or Lufthansa were to launch a request for proposals for single-aisle aircraft somewhere in 2020, COMAC will bid. And COMAC will be a competitor."
On Tuesday, the first day of the air show, COMAC announced a deal to build 30 C919 jets, which can carry about 170 passengers, for the leasing arm of the state-owned China Merchants Bank. COMAC, founded in 2008 in Shanghai, is also state owned. Neither the total value of the deal nor the unit price was disclosed.
"Manufacturers love to announce big orders - they tend to do a lot of negotiations prior to an air show and save up the news to announce" before a global audience, said Ray Jaworowski, a senior aerospace analyst at Forecast International. At the Zhuhai show, he said, COMAC will "primarily focus on orders from Chinese clients," who face political pressure to buy domestically produced hardware.
Although the C919's development has hit delays, which are common in the industry, COMAC has outstanding orders from several Chinese carriers, including Shanghai Airlines, Xiamen Airlines and Henan Airlines, and one foreign carrier, Lao Airlines.
Both the C919 and the ARJ21 rely heavily on Western technology for engines and electronics, with suppliers including General Electric, Honeywell, Kidde and Rockwell Collins. Concerns about China's engine technology have also hampered military aerospace development in the country.
China's large internal market should ease COMAC's path in attracting early customers and establishing a track record.
"Given the investment that is being made in development of these indigenous aircraft, the Chinese government has an incentive to ensure that enough of a domestic market exists for these programs to achieve success," Jaworowski said. "This can take the form of the government nudging state-owned airlines and other institutions into buying these aircraft."
But even if the planes perform well in the domestic market, to sell them outside China, COMAC will face technical, regulatory and political challenges.
Certification by the Federal Aviation Administration in the United States "tends to be long and costly," Jaworowski said. "However, such certification, whether from the FAA or the European Aviation Safety Agency, is essential if the C919 or the ARJ21 are to garner sales in the large and lucrative Western markets."
Certification can involve compliance checks with hundreds, or even thousands, of regulations. Matters as varied as the design of the aircraft, the manufacturing facilities and the onboard systems must meet the agencies' standards. The process can take years: FAA employees logged more than 200,000 hours on technical certification for Boeing's 787 Dreamliner, plus more than 4,000 hours of flight testing.
In the short term, Jaworowski said, inertia will favor longstanding plane makers.
  "In North America and Europe, most airlines can be expected to stick with the established manufacturers," he said. "The main markets for the ARJ21 and the C919 will be China and other countries in Asia. Beyond Asia, these aircraft could also find customers among airlines in Latin America and Africa."
Advantages for Chinese planes, he said, will be lower prices and "also the fact that some countries do not require an FAA- or EASA-type certificate."
A new Boeing 737 costs $78 million to $113 million, depending on the model, while an Airbus A320 runs $88 million to $97 million. Both types are proven and in wide use around the world. Boeing estimates the global passenger and cargo aircraft market will be worth $5.2 trillion over the next 20 years; Airbus puts the number at $4.6 trillion.

Petrol  dieselexcise dutyhiked by 1.50/litreComments
The government on Thursday hiked excise duty on petrol and diesel prices by Rs. 1.50 a litre each to mop up an additional Rs. 13,000 crore in revenue, a move that may translate into similar increase in retail rates.
The fall in international oil prices had resulted in six consecutive reduction in petrol prices since August and two in diesel in the last one month and there was possibility of another round of cuts this weekend.
But the possible reduction has now been negated as the the government decided to raise excise duty to shore up its revenue.
Excise duty on normal or unbranded petrol was hiked from Rs. 1.20 per litre to Rs. 2.70 per litre and unbranded diesel from Rs. 1.46 a litre to Rs. 2.96, a government notification said.
The same on branded petrol was raised from Rs. 2.35 a litre to Rs. 3.85 and on branded diesel from Rs. 3.75 to Rs. 5.25 per litre. While the excise duty hike will result in an immediate increase in both petrol and diesel prices, the expected reduction would keep the retail rates at almost the same levels.
There is also a possibility of state-owned oil firms preponing the planned review of fuel prices due on Saturday to make the whole exercise price neutral for consumers.
Before the duty hike, petrol cost Rs. 64.25 a litre in Delhi and diesel Rs. 53.35 a litre. While the fall in global rates and the resultant cuts in retail prices had led to loss of revenue to the exchquer, particularly, for state governments, there wasnt any loss to the Central government on account of reduction in petrol and diesel prices as excise duty on the two fuel is fixed and not ad valorem.
Unbranded petrol currently attracts a basic excise duty of Rs. 1.20 per litre, a special additional excise duty of Rs. 6 a litre and a road cess of Rs. 2 per litre.
Unbranded diesel attracts a basis excise duty of Rs. 1.46 a litre and road cess of Rs. 2 per litre.
The total excise duty on unbranded petrol will rise from Rs. 9.20 to Rs. 10.70 per litre and than on unbranded diesel from Rs. 3.46 to Rs. 4.96 per litre.
Branded petrol currently attracts an excise duty of Rs. 10.35 per litre which would go up to Rs. 11.85 per litre and that on branded diesel from Rs. 5.75 to Rs. 7.25 per litre.

Sterilisation tragedy: Arrested doctor blames  sub-standard  drugs; judicial probe orderedComments
Chhattisgarh police on Thursday arrested the surgeon whose botched sterilisations claimed the lives of 13 women in Bilaspur earlier this week, and will produce him in a court later in the day.

Dr RK Gupta was on the run since the first deaths were reported and an FIR was lodged against him on Tuesday.
The 59-year old surgeon, who was honoured by the Chhattisgarh government on January 26 this year for accomplishing a massive target on mass sterilisation in the state-run campaign, was detained at Baloda Bazar, about 70 km from Bilaspur. 
"He has been arrested today (Thursday) after he was detained in Baloda Bazar district. He will be produced before the court soon," Bilaspur inspector general of police Pawan Deo told HT, adding more arrests are likely to follow. 
Following his arrest, the surgeon told reporters he has been made a scapegoat.
"I am innocent. The health of the women deteriorated owing to the sub-standard drugs prescribed to them following the sterilisation surgery," he claimed.
Gupta, who had operated upon 83 women in six hours last Saturday at the Sakri health camp in Bilaspur (which would mean that he spent just two minutes per tubectomy), was suspended on Tuesday by the state government.
While eight women died on Monday, three on Tuesday and one on Wednesday and at least two dozen others are being treated in various hospitals.
During the campaign even women of primitive tribes, whose sterilisation is banned by the government, were reportedly "coerced" to attend such camps.
Twenty-four-year old Chaiti Bai, a member of Baiga community, died late on Wednesday evening following the botched laparoscopic tubectomy in the camp at Guarela-Pendra in Bilaspur.
Bilaspur commissioner Sonmoni Borah confirmed to HT there were two Baiga women among the 16 who were rushed to Bilaspur from Guarela-Pendra for immediate medical treatment after they underwent sterilisation operation.
Amid reports that rusted equipment were used in the surgeries, a team of doctors from Delhi's premier AIIMS hospital is in Bilaspur to investigate into the incident.
The state government also banned the sale of four medicines which were given to the women after the sterilisation at different camps in Bilaspur on Wednesday. The drugs have been sent to a Kolkata laboratary for tests and analysis.
In the wake of the deaths and the subsequent protests, the Chhattisgarh government has decided to institute a judicial probe into it.
During his visit to Bilaspur to meet the ailing women patients, chief minister Dr Raman Singh declared that judicial commission will inquire into the botched-up sterilisation deaths.
“Instead of any departmental inquiry I have decided for a judicial probe that will thoroughly investigate into every aspect," he said. This was his second visit to Bilaspur after the reports on deaths emerged following the sterilisation in the state-run camp.

Upper castes are invaders; tribals  Dalits indigenous: Bihar CM ManjhiComments
As Janata Dal (United) leader Nitish Kumar embarked on his Sampark Yatra to reinvigorate party workers, chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi staked claim to the Dalit constituency on Wednesday, saying: “Upper castes were foreigners and descendants of Aryan invaders, while the true Indians were the Dalits and the indigenous people.”
Issuing a clear message to tribals and Dalits to close ranks and re-invent their political strength at Bettiah, 300km north-west of Patna, Manjhi asked them to work in tandem for their educational, social and political rights. He took on the mantle of a ‘social reformer’ too, asking the tribals to shun consumption of alcohol and tobacco and go attend school.
“Earlier, the number of tribals was only 1% of state’s population but the percentage has reached 16% after the Tharus were accorded the status of scheduled tribe (ST). The total number of tribals is about 16 lakh in Bihar. Keep away from alcohol and assert your political rights,” Manjhi advised.
After being elected the CM, Manjhi has been asserting his Dalit identity to counter the widespread impression that he was a stopgap chief minister. He has been working to carve out a niche for himself and come out of the shadow of Nitish Kumar. At his public meetings, especially while addressing Dalits and tribals who together number 24% of Bihar’s population, Manjhi has attempted to consolidate his constituency by trying to make them aware of their latent political strength, which could be used if they come together.
The first signs of his political ambition to continue as CM after 2015 assembly polls became evident when he told Dalits at his village Mahkar in Gaya district if 22% Dalits came together and became politically aware, no one could stop a Dalit from continuing as the chief minister.
“This time, I was made chief minister by others under different political circumstances. We constitute around 22% of the state population. If you become more politically aware, you can be in a position to choose a Dalit chief minister by your sheer strength,” Manjhi said.
Manjhi seems to have taken cue from his predecessor Nitish Kumar. While Kumar tried to carve out a vote bank among the Dalits by bracketing 21 out of 22 scheduled castes in Bihar as ‘Mahadalits’, leaving out the powerful Dusadhs (Paswans), Manjhi has gone a step further by calling upon Dalits and tribals to form one single bloc of voters. Manjhi has also tried to draw a bigger line than his predecessor by aiming to form a trans-Dalit constituency along with extremely backward castes (EBCs).
Watch: Bihar CM says upper caste people are foreigners
It became evident when he asked Dalit youth at a function in Patna to raise their numbers through “inter-caste marriages” inside and outside the Dalit community. Manjhi had stoked a controversy when he recalled an incident in which a temple was washed after his visit in course of his bypoll campaign in Madhubani.
He had also attacked other castes, saying that people who came to him for some work felt no qualms about falling at his feet. Many in his own party believe Manjhi is seriously pitching for Dalit consolidation of the kind seen in Uttar Pradesh, under the leadership of BSP leader Mayawati and lead a separate Dalit constituency Bihar has never had. Manjhi is the third Dalit leader to hold the post of chief minister.

Problem Solver: Wheelchair issues frustrate userThe couple would also like to have the wheelchair taken to a central location, where manufacturers of the major components can meet and give the chair a thorough checkup and fix anything that is broken.
The Problem Solver called National Seat and Mobility and was directed to branch manager David Vaughan.
Vaughan said he and others have worked tirelessly to make Skendzel happy and to ensure that the chair works, but bureaucratic red tape created by Medicare and insurance companies has slowed turnaround times.
"Nothing moves quickly when it comes to wheelchairs," Vaughan said. "I wish I could say it's different, but everything takes weeks."
Vaughan said he lives near Skendzel and has been to his house numerous times to ensure that the chair is working properly. In some cases, he said, the chair was damaged when family members tried to alter the machinery to make it work better.
"He's got a very complicated chair," Vaughan said. "He's got a very complicated diagnosis."
Vaughan insisted that Skendzel can use the chair but said there are some fixes that can be made to improve its functionality.
On Friday, a National Seat and Mobility representative visited Skendzel's house to replace a faulty switch. Vaughan said he would also like to add a piece of equipment that will help keep the wheelchair from veering to the right when moving forward, which he said is typical for the type of chair Skendzel has.
Before National Seat and Mobility can order that equipment, though, Skendzel must first get a letter of medical necessity from his doctor, Vaughan said. Without that documentation, insurance will not pay for the part, he said.
Vaughan said he would also schedule a time to bring the chair to a facility where representatives from National Seat and Mobility, Permobil and Stealth Products can look over the unit together to ensure that everything is working properly.
"If it makes him feel more comfortable with the chair, we're happy to do it," Vaughan said. "We're here to help them."
Gayle Skendzel said she and her husband are happy with Vaughan's response.
"It's definitely progress," she said.
She said there have been times when Vaughan has visited the couple's house and stayed late into the evening working on the chair and trying to make her husband comfortable in it. Still, the process has been slow and frustrating, she said.
"I do think (Vaughan's) heart is in the right place, and his hands are tied," Gayle Skendzel said. "But so are ours."
Thank you, and goodbye
After more than 1,400 columns spanning nine years, this is my last as the Problem Solver.
I cannot thank you enough for your support, and for your help in keeping businesses, agencies and organizations honest.
It has been an amazing ride.

G. Venu’s book, Ramayana Samksepam: An Attaprakram (Acting Manual) For Depicting The Story Of Ramayana Through Mudras In Koodiyattam Theatre, is a pioneering work that explains with sketches and photographs the mudras in Koodiyattam.
For nearly three decades G. Venu was an ‘inseparable companion’ of Guru Ammannur Madhava Chakyar, the undisputed master of Koodiyattam. Madhava Chakyar’s contribution to this ‘masterpiece of oral and intangible heritage of humanity’, apart from his matchless performances on stage, was safeguarding the acting techniques of Koodiyattam and propagating it.
Ramayana Samksepam: An Attaprakram (Acting Manual) For Depicting The Story Of Ramayana Through Mudras In Koodiyattam Theatre depicts the story of the Ramayana through hand gestures. It combines three plays: ‘Ashcharya Chudamani’, ‘Pratima’ and ‘Abhishekam’ and is narrated through gestures as shown in the attaprakaram or acting manual written in Malayalam. “The entire story of the Ramayana is narrated with the least possible use of words. The words of the text are arranged along with mudras in their exact sequence. As each word is spoken or perceived in thought, the mind manifests its essence and the hand gestures come alive. This acting manual brings together most of the mudras, a total of 260, used in Koodiyattam. The Ramayana Samksepam is an expression of storytelling that comes from the heart,” explains G. Venu.
Ramayana Samksepam… is a pioneering work by Venu that notates the gestures of Koodiyattam. It is an actor’s manual for expressing the story of the Ramayana through mudras. Venu has developed the notations with brilliant sketches, use of photographs and a DVD to make it a comprehensive documentation.
“I used to learn the Ramayana Samksepam from my guru every day for many years. I used to be ready after a bath, putting ghee around my eyes at around seven in the evening at my guru’s home in Irinjalakuda. He used to come with a lantern in his hand, after his customary, elaborate, oil-bath, still in his wet clothes, the bhasma (ash of dried cow-dung) smeared on his body. And then he would recite the Ramayana Samksepam, which he knew by rote. I would show him the mudras and, from time to time, he would stop reciting to give me instructions. This was quality time allotted only for me,” remembers Venu.
In Ramayana Samksepam, published by Natana Kairali, with support from the National Culture Fund, Ministry of Culture, Government of India, Venu develops an innovative notational system for the eyes, eyebrows, facial muscles, torso and hand gestures that form the elaborate vocabulary of Koodiyattam. “I had an earlier experience of notating the mudras for Kathakali. I had this habit of forgetting what I had learned, often invoking the anger of my guru. I needed to find a solution to that. That’s how I began sketching the mudras I was taught. My training under my father, a well-known artist of the Ravi Varma School, a disciplinarian, helped. I did a few sketches, which, surprisingly, he approved of. I now needed confirmation and so took them to KCS Panicker in Chennai. He was gracious enough to look at it and told me to follow my heart in whatever I did. These sketches were notated into 878 hand gestures that were later published in five editions. Also published are three editions of a volume on notations of mudras in Mohiniyattam, written by Nirmala Panikkar, my wife and Mohiniyattam exponent.”
Mudras in Koodiyattam are not regarded as a mere technique but as something that contains energy of the expression of the bhavas or emotions.
“Such a system of acting, one which incorporates the training to express emotions through the hands learned through the narration of a particular story, exists only in Koodiyattam. None of the acting manuals (attaprakaram) contains the names of any mudras. The word used is ‘kaikattal’, (the literal meaning of which is 'show by hands'), which means to express with the help of hands.”
While notating the mudras of Koodiyattam, Venu knew that he had to be more precise. “Natyasastra is a compilation of acting and theatre in general, formulated by studying the diverse schools of performance that existed in different parts of India and codifying them. Hastalakshanadipika has compiled most of the hand gestures used in the performing art forms of Kerala. The direct influence of Ramayana Samksepam can be found in this text. In fact, many people have misunderstood the Hastalakshnadipika to be the authentic text on the mudras used in Koodiyattam. This is wrong. I have seen the palm leaf manuscript of Hastalakshanadipika in the collection of texts in my Guru’s house. But I have never seen him refer to this. He, in fact, firmly believed that it was not helpful for the study of mudras in Koodiyattam.”
For Venu, this work of documentation was the toughest he had undertaken not just because it had to be precise but because it was an elaborate process.
“I had put away the rough sketches I had made as I got involved in so many other things. I thought about them when I got time out of my teaching schedules at the National School of Drama, New Delhi, and at the International Theatre Institute, Singapore. I took out the sketches I had made and began working on a reference manual for students that would help them understand the meaning of the mudras easily. I also decided it would be bi-lingual, in English and Malayalam. The work took me three years to complete.”
Complete documentation
The work in 12 chapters is a complete documentation. The acting manual is described in detail with one chapter on the notation of the mudras through sketches made by Venu, and another very special chapter that had demonstration of the mudras through photographs of Ammannur Madhava Chakyar, Venu and Kapila Venu, his daughter. Included with the volume is a three-hour-50 minute video documentation in which Kapila performs or demonstrates the story of the Ramayana through mudras.
And perhaps what makes the video a keepsake is a rare, informal demonstration of the Navarasas, one of the greatest contributions to the Indian theatre, by Ammannur Madhava Chakyar recorded in 1986.
The book (including the DVD) is priced at Rs. 1,000.

When it comes to luxury watches, the Indian consumer will experiment with material and movement
The Luxury Society said in April 2013 that BRIC economies were fuelling the demand for luxury timepieces. It highlighted results of the 2013 WorldWatchReport that studied over 60 luxury watch brands in 20 markets. According to the report, China was in the lead with interest in luxury watches there going up by 36% and in Brazil by 29.4%; in comparison, interest in India grew by 19.7% with Russia of ahead of that figure by around 10%.
Yet there’s not a brand in the premium or luxury space that will not name India as a priority market. Most international designer brands aren’t forthcoming with numbers, but they’ve all been around long enough to heat up the competition for each other. Panerai just as much as names like Tag Heuer, Omega, Cartier, Patek Philippe and Montblanc aims to catalyze the interest of consumers here. Notably, Panerai wants to make it by sticking to its masculine style and heritage even as it tries to get ahead in India where price matters.
MAKING A STATEMENT
An Italian brand that leans strictly on Swiss design, Panerai first tested itself in New Delhi and Mumbai more than a decade ago, before beefing up its retail presence in South India by wooing Hyderabad, Chennai and Bangalore.
Milvin George, Managing Director, Officine Panerai, Middle East, India and Turkey says, “India is the beginning of our adventure in South East Asia. We’re also considering opening in other countries like Sri Lanka and Pakistan, but in India there are markets within a market in this country. We have to address them all.”
The watchmaker’s retail partners like Ethos and Helvetica work with a quota system. They help the brand make headway among bankers, celebrities, businessmen and watch enthusiasts.
Panerai’s watches are distinctive for sure, considering its heritage of making timepieces for the Italian Navy. In India, the brand makes some 30-35 references available. The watches are made once orders come in from customers.
“In spite of our making gold watches and Indians having an affinity to gold as an investment, we’re selling watches made of ceramic with high end movement. The value can be anywhere between USD 70,000 to 80,000. We actually have a waiting list in India for our watches.”
Managing Director of Wazir Group, Harminder Sahni says, “A few years ago, no one would have heard of Panerai. In the last 4-5 years, they’ve been on top of their game in India. Their designs are graceful and their signature comes across as clean.”
RIDING SMARTER
Panerai intends to stay a masculine brand, especially after experiencing that women too don’t mind big watches. The average price of its watches in India starts at USD 10,000. While that undiluted stance helps it stand apart for its product, the watchmaker is also making the efforts to be seen at the right places. The brand had a presence in the recently released Bollywood movie Bang Bang. It also sponsors the India Art Fair.
George claims the brand did well in India even through the recession years. “We’re looking at double digit percentage growth in India, because even when other markets saw a slowdown we had increased sales year on year here.”
Luxury watch brands will be competing with the bridge-to-luxury segment, because price segmentation defines a lot in the Indian market. “The mindset of the customer in India has to be understood and product range customised as well as the experience for luxury brands to succeed in the country,” Kumar Rajagopalan, CEO, Retailers Association of India.
However Wazir Group’s Sahni’s view is that price segmentation is working well for both brands and consumers. “It will be a push from the bottom, it works like a ladder. Someone driving a Mercedes today will aim for a Porsche and then later a Ferrari, and it works like that for most luxury goods,” he says.
So Panerai and others in the fray should ideally engage with customers in India who may be ready to buy luxury watches in the next 2-3 years rather than plan their outreach based on their own perceptions about who is likely to buy their products.

Who owns the customerTweet
Still in the loop? Unless they are forced to make a different choice, consumers will not. PAUL NORONHA
Everyone is fighting for a piece of the Loop Mobile’s customer base. This is what an international marketing expert has to say
CASE ANALYSIS
<I>In our issue dated October 24th, cat.a.lyst carried a case on Loop Mobile focusing on customer retention when the business is up for sale. Mark Vandenbosch, associate dean, programs and the Kraft Professor in Marketing at the Ivey Business School does an analysis of the situation on the ground<I>
In the case of Loop Mobile, there are several issues that are going on here. From Loop Mobile’s viewpoint, it’s about what is the best way to get out of business. When I say the best way, it means the best way it will be more profitable and the simplest. You can also look at it from Airtel’s perspective in terms of what can be the best way to grow its customer base in areas where it is not strong – larger operators like Airtel have a predominant mix of prepaid mobile customers while Loop Mobile has a significantly higher share of post-paid or billing customers in its base. So for Airtel, attracting those customers will be valuable. You could even analyse it as what is the best strategy for Vodafone, as a rival player who can pocket a larger chunk of Loop Mobile’s subscriber base.
One of the things that come up in a marketing context often is, “Who owns the customer?” The reality is that if there are several players who have a say in the chain, they will all think they own the customer. For example, the brand owner thinks he owns the customer as they buy his brand. But the retailer also thinks he owns the customer as they shop at his store. The reality though is that in a low-switching cost environment, the ownership is not as important as, “how sticky are my customers”. In this case, if a significant part of those leaving the Loop network are going to Vodafone, this should have already been factored in by both Loop and Airtel in their negotiations. In a fair situation, no one would have expected 100 per cent of Loop’s subscriber base to migrate to Airtel.
The first thing to check during negotiations would have been how many of them are under contract. First of all, do not expect to retain them all. Second, one of the things will be to give them a strong enough reason to renew their contract with Airtel. From Airtel’s point of view, my expectation would be to give huge discounts to them to renew their contracts. Another way would be to have direct communication with customers and this will give you a good indication on how many customers will leave you. The reality is you will lose a bunch and you could look at what incentives to give them to retain them. The third is you could look at demonstrating your capability through various platforms to assure them that they are getting into good hands.
In Canada, in a similar situation a financial services company has offered a loyalty programme to customers who shift and they will be able to get the entire benefits if they stay longer in the programme. One of the leading credit card companies in Canada used to have an airlines loyalty scheme for those who used their credit card. But when its business was acquired by another player it was a question of whether customers had bought the credit card for the bank that was offering it, or for the airline loyalty scheme. In the end, 75 per cent of the customers stayed with the offer as the incumbent continued the airline loyalty programme. But it was an expensive acquisition. And in the interim, everybody in the industry was offering discounts.
In Canada, most telecom companies can do only a two year contract. In India, the story on Loop Mobile is not over yet. My guess is that most customers will stay with Airtel as in customer inertia is a big factor. We as consumers will continue doing things the same way, unless change is forced upon them – like in the situation of Loop Mobile. The thing with inertia is that a body that is in rest stays in rest and a body in motion stays in motion.
Finally, the biggest risk of change is after you have made the change. Maybe Airtel is keeping things quiet because they do not want people to recognise this change. Once customers start thinking of change then newer options start coming up and that’s when consumers are more likely to be less loyal.
(This is in reaction to a case study titled Caught in the Loop, published in these columns on October 24, as told to Prasad Sangameshwaran)

Cola tries a faceliftQ: There is a lot of action in FMCG space from ITC. What's the strategic take on this?
-Rahil N, Kolkata
A: Rahil, ITC is the classic Indian multi-national on the prowl. The company, over the last decade, has unleashed its FMCG and hospitality play with gusto in the Indian market. And literally every one of its calculated forays has met with success. Some with more, and some with less.
If I am to credit reason, the first would be its very focussed approach into categories. The second would be its belief in the advertising and marketing process by investing deep moneys into this space. The third is of course its firm handle on distribution. Distribution in many ways is the cutting edge differentiator for an FMCG play.
In many ways, the last decade has seen ITC coming out of the closet. ITC today has emerged out of the cigarette closet, and has entered into every meaningful FMCG category. And how. In many ways it is the ultimate accolade to the vision of Yogi Deveshwar.
The company has successfully attempted to widen the niche of premium biscuit offerings. In a nation that is just about waking up to the premium movement, ITC has positioned products that cater to this emerging want, need, desire and aspiration.
The noodles category has become generic. Generic to the brand name Maggi. When a category does become generic, the opportunity arises for other brands to get specific with brand offerings that will chip away at shares. ITCs success comes from this opportunity it is tapping at. Differentiated product offerings that create brands once again from the generic space of a brand's(Maggi's) making. Maggi is today to the noodles category what Dalda had become to Vanaspati.
Q: Our Cola majors are morphing. They are moving drink to drink in experimentation. Am I right?
-Sohini Malik, New Delhi
A: Sohini, yes and no. The Cola majors are insulating their portfolio with all these diverse forays. When the glass-ceiling hits you rather early in your brand life cycle, you need to escape into markets that are possibly nascent to the category. Teh rural market effort is one such. Rural markets provide an opportunity and everyone rushes in here. Rural markets are therefore early-escape markets for the category.
There is aggression in terms of price as well. The idea is to upgrade from other categories that compete with the category. When gulp-to-gulp, your cola costs no more than the nimboo-paani, you upgrade to the brand. The battle is for price-of-gulp. The competition is not between the colas, but between the Cola and the local thirst-quencher of yore. That's yet another competitor to battle.
In the packaged juice category, is still an impulse-buy item at the corner store or Cafe. We are yet to see the big move of the 1 liter or more packs gracing early-morning dining tables in India. This will take time. As that will take time, brand shares have to be built 180 ml at a time! That is the challenge. It is an even bigger challenge because there is a huge degree of flavor fatigue in this market, and stocking multiple flavors on shelves is a logistics nightmare. Every time the consumer comes to a store bitten by thirst, the choice f flavor varies, and moves across brand to brand. Today it is a Tropicana, tomorrow it is a Real, and day after tomorrow it may even be to a Gold Spot, which is not even a fruit juice.
Further, as Cola and carbonated water majors see health issues emerging as hurdles to their growth, they will veer themselves towards more healthy options. Milk, yoghurt, fruit juices and traditional beverage options such as Kokum, Jaljeera and more, will be their first stop. Expect a lot of MNC action in this space. Expect a fair number of acquisitions in this space as well. Imagine a Paper Boat within the house of Coca Cola Inc.? The future is going to be different. Very different in this space.

Fight clubs of VaranasiFight clubs of Varanasi
Nov 7, 2014
A millennia-old tradition still finds a place in the narrow alleys along the ghats of the Ganga
Faith and fitness have always found common ground in Varanasi. In its traditional ‘gymnasiums’ or kushti akharas along the ghats, wrestlers continue to practise millennia-old moves with single-minded devotion.
One of the oldest akharas in the city, the Tulsi akhara is believed to have been established over 5,000 years ago by poet Tulsidas. Encircled by a white boundary wall, its muddy rink still draws young men at the break of dawn to train under the tutelage of Siyaramji. But while the guru’s heart lies in this hallowed arena, he moonlights as an employee of an insurance company to make ends meet. Until he leaves for his job, however, it’s business as usual at the akhara.
The day starts with a prayer at the small Hanuman shrine, before warm-up begins in earnest with a range of kushti equipment. Young boys wear gar nals or stone rings that act as weights around their necks. Some finish a lap of cartwheels along the periphery. Yet others lift a mace (Hanuman’s gada), their eyebrows furrowed and temples glistening with beads of sweat. Before long everything dissolves into an impossible tangle of limbs on the soft mud, which reduces the impact of throws and manoeuvres perfected over the years. Hours later, the wrestlers disband, disappearing into the crowds and returning to the daily grind of life.

7 Famous Artworks That Are Supposed To Look Completely Differentreddit
Mona Lisa was once "rosy and tender." What did the "Rosy Age" of our civilization's "masterpieces" actually look like?
The ceiling of the Sistine Chapel at the Vatican was restored just before the turn of the millennium, which took Michelangelo's cracked, darkened work and returned some semblance of the original intent. One scene depicted by Michelangelo is the casting out of Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden. Their taking of the fruit allows them to see the truth while separating them from their maker, much like art restoration opens our eyes to what a painting is supposed to be while taking away the original strokes of the creator. Since the Sistine Chapel ceiling has been restored, the light surrounding Adam and Eve has shined much more brightly -- illuminating more clearly than in decades both the beauty and the loss.
Art restoration is a tricky game. Perhaps worthy to note is a quote often attributed to Leonardo da Vinci: "Art is never finished, only abandoned."
Whether the original version of a piece or the deteriorated, surviving piece is the "true" artwork is all opinion. Though, many of our civilization's "masterpieces" don't appear as they were originally supposed to look.
And now, a few more works that may require taking a fruit from a snake to see their intended beauty:
1. The colors of "The Night Watch" should actually represent a "Day Watch" and multiple sides of the painting were cut.
"Militia Company of District II under the Command of Captain Frans Banninck Cocq" was completed by Rembrandt van Rijn in 1642. The work was later called "The Night Watch," due to a decaying varnish that blackened the entire piece. After the varnish was removed, in the 1940s , it became clear that the painting was actually of a day watch , but the name had already stuck. Rembrandt had intended to use considerable darkness throughout the painting to highlight the bright colors of the militiamen's uniforms and the glow from the angel.
Rembrandt's work was considerably cropped in 1715, when the painting was moved to the Amsterdam town hall , presumably because the space allotted to his work was too small to fit the painting. This sort of cropping was common during the period. Most notably, about two feet were lost from the left side, cutting out multiple members of the militia. An arch at the top was also cropped.
The image is of a 17th century copy of Rembrandt's work that shows the lighter colors and what was removed in the crop.

2. The "Mona Lisa" is supposed to be far from brown and yellow and much of the ambiguity is just from deterioration.
Leonardo da Vinci completed the "Mona Lisa" in the 16th century. The Louvre has housed the painting in Paris since 1797 , but varnishes applied to the painting began to darken its look soon after the it was completed. Although the painting has been well-maintained -- it was immediately considered to be valuable -- the work has changed hands a number of times between the rich and the careful, even hanging in the bedroom of Napoleon Bonaparte .
A quote from Giorgio Vasari, who viewed the "Mona Lisa" mere decades after its completion gives insight into how significantly the colors have been distorted over the years: "The eyes had that luster and watery sheen always seen in life ... the nostrils, rosy and tender, seemed to be alive ... The opening of the mouth seemed to be not colored but living flesh."
The image at right is believed to have been painted by an apprentice of da Vinci at the same time he was working on his "Mona Lisa." It should be noted that these are probably not intended to be exact copies -- the smile and eyes are particularly different -- but the coloring gives decent insight into what da Vinci's work could have originally looked like.
The Art Newspaper has a picture of a digital cleaning of da Vinci's "Mona Lisa" that also shows brighter colors while maintaining the signature face.

3. Many details from "The Last Supper" have been lost, including Jesus' feet and Judas spilling salt.
"The Last Supper" was completed in the late 15th century, on a wall at the monastery of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan, Italy. The painting took Leonardo da Vinci a few years to complete, though the exact timeline is unknown. Legend has it that that da Vinci became enraged at a prior who expressed frustration with the number of years the painting had taken to complete, and so the painter threatened to use the prior's face as the model for Judas.
The painting's condition began to decline shortly after its completion. Italian painter Gian Paolo Lomazzo stated only midway through the 16th century that "the painting is all ruined.”
Besides deterioration over time, several notable destructions to the piece have occurred. In 1652 , a doorway was inserted into the mural which removed Jesus' feet. During World War II, the monastery was bombed , though, remarkably, the wall with "The Last Supper" remained intact.
The bottom image is a copy of da Vinci's painting by Giovanni Pietro Rizzoli, completed in the early 16th century. It has been used as the primary source for 20th century restoration.

4. "The Scream" is actually four different works.
Edvard Munch created "The Scream" series between 1893 and 1910 . The medium for two of the works is paint, one is pastel and the other is a lithograph. (A few dozen lithographs exist.) In 2012, the pastel, a lesser-known version of the painting, broke a record at Sotheby's as the "world’s most expensive work of art ever to sell at auction," for $119.9 million .
A departure from other works featured in this article, "The Scream," as the collective piece, hasn't been significantly altered over time -- it's barely been a century since the works were completed. The inclusion Munch's "'Mona Lisa' for our time" felt necessary as most people do not realize there are four separate works, each significantly different than the previous version.
The image at top left is the painted original, top right is the lithograph; bottom left is the pastel and bottom right is the other painted version.

5. The yellows of Van Gogh have faded considerably. "Bedroom in Arles" has become particularly distorted.
The first version of "Bedroom in Arles" was completed by Vincent Van Gogh in 1888, but he painted 3 in total. Each version has marked differences from the other, but since all three were made to be casual gifts at the time of completion, rather than works of intent by an "artist," the lesser-known second and third works are more like separate works rather than parts of a triptych.
The yellow pigment Van Gogh used has browned with age , a problem that has plagued many of his other paintings as well.
Van Gogh's signature yellow was made possible by the industrial revolution , which introduced new pigments including chrome yellow, a "toxic lead chromate and like many of the pigments of the period was chemically unstable."
The image shows the restoration process by the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam. For a representation of what the museum thinks the colors would have actually looked like, visit its blog .

6. "The Great Wave off Kanagawa" is a series of woodblock copies, and the versions major museums display are distorted.
Katsushika Hokusai completed a ukiyo-e woodblock print in the early 19th century. "The Great Wave" is part of the larger series, "Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji," which includes 46 prints in total, after the initial prints became popular.
Created with the malleable woodblock, thousands of copies were made, yet each is slightly different. Some have lost the originally intended details. So many variations of "The Great Wave" qualify if for inclusion in this article because it is difficult to say which is definitive. At the very least, details have certainly been lost from the original as the wave now looms before a sky of yellow in most versions.
The top image is of the copy held by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City; the bottom image is of a restored version.

7. "The Thinker" was originally conceived as part of a piece based on Dante's "Inferno." It was also called "The Poet."
Auguste Rodin worked on "The Poet" in the late 19th century as a singular figure in a larger piece, called "The Gates of Hell," that would surround a doorway. There were 180 separate figures in the doorway and, originally, the you can view just how "The Thinker" was originally intended to be much smaller in scale. Foundry workers apparently named the figure due to its similarity to a Michelangelo's "Il Penseroso," or "The Thinker."
After careful consideration, Rodin decided to make "The Thinker" an independent work. It was cast as a much larger statue, with dozens of copies eventually made.
The image shows a casting of "The Gates of Hell" at the Musée Rodin in Paris.

BONUS: You probably know "Venus de Milo" was supposed to have arms ...
The statue was created circa 100 B.C. , and, since it is of Greek origin, the depiction should probably be referenced to as Aphrodite, the goddess of love.
The image at right is German archaeologist and art historian Adolf Furtwängler's restoration proposal , based on fragments of the arm found with the statue upon discovery.

IFC sells Masala Re Bonds; raises Rs 1 000 cr for Axis BankKotak Mahindra Bank: Deal and after
The World Bank Group’s development finance body IFC today raised Rs 1,000 crore through a 10-year bond, which will be invested in private sector lender Axis Bank’s forthcoming infra bond issue.
Christened as ‘Masala Bonds’, the latest issuance is a part of the Corporation’s USD 2-billion offshore rupee bond programme and will be the first such offering to be listed on the London Stock Exchange, the Washington-based developmental body said in a statement issued here.
Proceeds from the latest issue will support a forthcoming infrastructure bond issuance by Axis Bank, the statement said.
It can be noted that the country’s third largest private sector lender Axis Bank is targeting to raise up to Rs 6,000 crore by March through the long term infra bond instrument issued by RBI in July.
“The IFC Masala Bonds set a triple-A benchmark for offshore rupee issuances and pave the way for more foreign investment to help meet the country’s private sector development needs,” said Tarun Bajaj, Joint Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance.
Among all the rupee denominated issues till now by IFC, the latest offering has the longest maturity at 10 years, keeping in mind the needs of the longer gestation infrastructure projects, it said, adding, the others have been in the 3, 5 and 7 year buckets.
“This bond issue demonstrates the powerful role that capital markets can play in linking international savings to infrastructure investment. The strong demand from investors signals continued momentum for the Indian economy,” IFC chief executive Jin-Yong Cai said.
The yield for the bonds has been set at 6.3 per cent, it said, adding that J P Morgan was the sole arranger for the issuance.
The rupee denominated bonds help deepen the process of internationalisation of the rupee and involve raising money in an international currency, which is brought onshore and converted into rupee in the domestic spot market.
The repayment will be as per the existing exchange rate of the rupee against the international currency.

Credit Card Companies Are Charging Less For Late PaymentsCredit Card Companies Are Charging Less For Late Payments

reddit
Punishment for the sin of being late on a credit card payment is getting slightly less onerous for users who fail to pay their bills on time, according to a report issued Monday by CreditCards.com.
Fewer card issuers are imposing rate penalties at all, according to the survey of 100 U.S. credit cards. For those that are, the average penalty rate for late payers fell to 28.45 percent in October of this year from a 28.6 average annual percentage rate (APR) in 2012, the study showed.
"About 90 percent of issuers in 2010 used penalty rates. This year it's just 60 percent," said Matt Schulz, a senior industry analyst at CreditCards.com, a consumer credit card marketplace.
More from CNBC:
-- Voters make it clear: Raise the minimum wage
The penalty APR typically kicks in when a credit card holder is at least 60 days late with a payment, or has exceeded the credit limit.
For example, CreditCards.com did the punishment math for a cardholder with a $4,000 balance with an 11.82 percent rate —the average rate for those carrying a balance, according to the Federal Reserve. If a 28.45 percent rate kicks in, the cardholder would have to pay an extra $665.20 in interest over the year.
However, experts say the best bet is to keep a tight rein on credit balances at all times.
"The first rule of having a credit card is pay as much as you can, on time, every time. Otherwise the math starts to work against you," Schulz said. "That math can start growing pretty fast."
Nationwide, 38.1 percent of American families had credit card debt in 2013, down slightly from 39.4 percent in 2010, according to the Fed's triennial Survey of Consumer Finances. The mean balance fell to $5,700 in 2013 from $7,600 in 2010, according to the report.

The penalty rate varies not just lender to lender, but card to card. Although there is no limit to what the penalty could be, the highest rate discovered in the survey was for the NFL Extra Points card from Barclays, which charges 30.24 percent as a penalty.
However, the CreditCards.com survey was conducted in October, and that NFL card no longer charges a penalty rate , said Nicole Dye-Anderson, the assistant vice president for media relations at Barclaycard US. At the end of October, the card also lowered its regular rates for new customers to 14.99 percent, 19.99 percent and 24.99 percent, she said.
The CreditCards.com survey found that of those with penalties, 32 stated they calculate a cardholder's penalty APR based on the customer's creditworthiness while 28 said the penalty APR is based on the prime rate plus a specified percent.

More than 40 cards in the survey had no penalty rate at all, including several Discover cards, Capital One cards and the WalMart Mastercard. Schulz said more cards may be moving in this direction because it positions them as more consumer-friendly.
But overall, the lower penalty APR is at least in part due to the implementation of the 2009 Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility and Disclosure Act, Schulz said. Earlier this year, U.S. Congresswoman Carolyn B. Maloney (D-New York,) the author of the 2009 Credit Card Act , said consumers had saved upwards of $63 billion since the passage of the law.
Among other benefits in the act, cardholders can get out from under the penalty after they make make six consecutive on-time payments.
The survey was conducted in October of the 100 U.S. credit cards that are also used by CreditCards.com to calculate its Weekly Rate Report. For cards with a range of penalty rates based on cardholder creditworthiness, the highest possible APR was used in the average rate calculation.

Tweet: Suresh Prabhu panel seeks to end the monopoly of discoms by breaking up the existing set-up into a “wire company” and multiple supply cos.
Call for action: A study by ratings agency CARE shines the light on the dismal state of affairs in discoms, particularly in states like UP and Tamil Nadu where losses have reached staggering levels, at R12,450 crore and R20,000 crore, respectively. The lessons that can be learnt from the best performing discoms in Gujarat include having separate feeder lines for agriculture customers.
Tweet: Rating agency CARE identifies UP & Tamil Nadu as having the worst Discoms with Gujarat the best. Discom reform more challenging than Fuels.
PPP models need to be made investor-friendly: India has emerged as one of the largest PPP markets in the world with nearly 900 projects under development. However, as the ultra mega power plant bidding process has shown, streamlining of PPP models is the need of the hour.
Tweet: Socialism via PPP: If you make PPP formats unviable for private sector (as in latest UMPP round) then only PSUs emerge as successful bidders.
Winds of change: The move to reintroduce accelerated depreciation (AD) in wind energy has been welcomed by stakeholders. The removal of AD had been a setback for the sector as investor interest had shifted to solar energy.
Tweet: Restoration of “Accelerated Depreciation” expected to bring back the zing in Wind Energy sector. It should never have been allowed to lapse.
Paving the way for easier land acquisition: The amendment to the Land Acquisition Act is one of the key bills to be taken up in the winter session of Parliament. It is proposed that PPP projects be exempt from the legal stipulation of obtaining consent from 70% of landowning families.
Tweet: Exemption of PPP projects from Land Acq Act’s social impact & consent clauses gathers traction. Can be aligned with Infra & Defence clauses.
The interest rate debate: RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan who has been under much pressure from industry, banks and finance ministry to lower interest rates has found an unlikely ally in CRISIL. The spate of recent actions, including EPC contracts in roads, defence orders and rail and metro projects are expected to kickstart the infrastructure investment cycle.
Tweet: We know! CRISIL Report says cut in interest rates unlikely to boost infra investments as slowdown is largely a consequence of govt policies.
Much-needed fillip For Mumbai’s infra projects: The new Maharashtra government has started its term in office with a bang. Among other projects that await the go-ahead are the inland water transport project, the Worli-Haji Ali Sea Link (WHSL) and the second phase of Metro. These should bring much needed relief to Mumbai’s harried commuters.
Tweet: Finally. Good to hear about MSRDC ready to float RFP for 14.8 km – R6,000 crore Bandra- Versova Sea Link next week.
Brand new coal policy but old habits die hard: While the new government has been keen to introduce fairness in allocation of the fuel and inspire investor confidence, it is at best a half measure as PSUs continue to get special treatment. Meanwhile, the PSU in the centre of all the action, Coal India, continues to function without a chairperson.
Tweets: With auction of natural resources as the stated policy, why are coal blocks still being reserved for ‘allocation’ to PSUs/statal entities?
Why does it take so many months to appoint a Chairman for India’s most critical PSU right now—Coal India?

Banks refer Rs 2 100-cr cases to CDR  okay Rs 3 000-cr loan recast inOctoberKotak Mahindra Bank: Deal and after
Lenders referred two cases worth Rs 2,100 crore to the corporate debt restructuring (CDR) cell in October and approved recast of three accounts worth Rs 3,000 crore, said sources.
The two accounts seeking loan recast were Punjab-based Kudos Chemie (Rs 1,900 crore) and Kolkata-based Shree Parasnath Re-rolling Mills (Rs 200 crore). For the first seven months in FY15, lenders have referred loans worth Rs 18,120 crore for recast. “Though their referrals have fallen in last six months, I believe it is going to increase in the January-March period because of the RBI restructuring forbearance deadline,” said RK Bansal, CDR Cell chairman. He added the referrals for the full fiscal are likely to be lower than Rs 1.32 lakh crore worth of accounts referred in FY14.
In October 2014, the cell approved restructuring of three cases worth Rs 3,000 crore. October saw approvals of cases like Surana Corporation (Rs 1,100 crore) and GKC Projects (Rs 1,600 crore). Lenders and CDR cell officials said that fall in referrals was a result of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) guidelines on early detection of stressed assets where it had directed banks in December last year to classify loans on the basis of the number of days interest payments are due.
The corporate debt restructuring (CDR) cell had approved Rs 40,050 crore of corporate loans in the first seven months of the current fiscal. In the April-September period of FY14, lenders had approved Rs 43,273 crore of restructurings. Bankers are confident that the pace of fresh referrals has definitely slowed down due to early action taken by the joint lenders’ forums and not all stressed accounts are going to CDR. They say the approvals are mostly pending cases from the previous year.
However, analysts say banks are likely to see an increase in referrals to CDR in the next four months as Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) forbearance on classification of restructured asset would end on March 31, 2015. From FY16, no fresh restructured accounts can be classified as standard. Due to the end of the forbearance, experts also believe banks will see their NPAs rising after the deadline.
According to a recent report by India Ratings and Research, non-performing assets (NPAs) in the banking system are set to increase in the range of Rs 60,000 crore to 1 lakh crore in the next five months.

On BSE  response mixed to RBImoveKotak Mahindra Bank: Deal and after
A day after RBI issued new norms on the NPA classification by the non-banking financial companies, performance of NBFC stocks were mixed on bourses. Analysts believe tougher norms laid down by Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will strengthen the sector structurally in the medium-term.
Shriram Transport Finance (4.93%), L&T Finance (3%), M&M Financial Services (1.14%) and HDFC (1.09%) ended in the green on Tuesday.
On other hand, SREI Infrastructure (-4.86%), Shriram City Union (-2.4%) and Religare Enterprises (-1.32%) closed in red.
Experts believe that clarity on the guidelines will reduce the downside risks to NBFCs’ current valuations. “With clarity on the regulatory stance on capital adequacy and asset quality, we see a limited downside risk to NBFC valuations,” said Kaitav Shah and Clyton Fernandes of Anand Rathi.
RBI had notified new guidelines on Monday that put restrictions on accessing public deposits.
The guidelines require NBFCs to treat a loan as NPA once payment is overdue beyond 150 days in 2015-2016. For 2016-17, this period must be brought down to 120 days and to 90 days by March 2018.
According to analysts, Shriram Transport Finance could see a negative impact due to the 90-day NPA norm, but it would be limited due to provisioning policy. “While the market may perceive the company to be impacted more given its aggressive NPA recognition policy (180-days), we believe its NPA provisioning policy is conservative (~79% NPA coverage) and should help reduce the potential impact. We reaffirm Buy on Shriram Transport,” Nomura said in a report.
Analysts say M&M Financial Services may see a smooth transition to the 90-day NPA recognition norm by 2018. “MMFS is already at 150-day NPA recognition and, hence, it will not impact the transition from 180 to 150 days in March 2016, but will affect transitions after that,” Nomura added.
For HDFC and LIC Housing Finance, the impact will be limited as they already follow the 90-day NPA recognition, according to analysts.

Analyst Corner: Motherson Sumi a good buy on growthdriversKotak Mahindra Bank: Deal and after
We reiterate ‘buy’ on Motherson Sumi (MSS) with a revised fair value of R498 per share (earlier R231) as we roll forward our valuation and change our valuation methodology to one year forward.
MSS reported consolidated ebitda growth in Q2FY15 of 1% y-o-y (2% lower than our estimates) as revenue growth (11% y-o-y, 3% above our estimates) was offset by a lower ebitda margin of 9.1% (down 90 bps y-o-y and below our forecast of 9.6%). The standalone entity registered robust revenue growth of 14% y-o-y to R1270 crore despite sluggish passenger vehicles volumes in Q2FY15.
This was primarily driven by MSS wining orders from the recently launched successful new models (from Honda and Maruti). An increase in content per car, market share gains; and product mix change towards higher-value assemblies.
Adjusted ebitda margin stood at 18% (up 110 bps q-o-q and down 270 bps y-o-y; higher base), a tad below our expectation of 19%. However a lower effective tax rate (26%) resulted in adjusted PAT coming broadly in line with our estimates. We expect the standalone entity to deliver EPS CAGR 20% of over FY14-17e, led by strong revenue momentum and margin expansion driven by positive operating leverage and a favourable product mix change.

Govt may stop thermal coal imports in 3 yearsKrishna N. Das, Tommy Wilkes     New Delhi   Last Updated: November 12, 2014  | 14:09 IST
Power and Coal Minister Piyush Goyal
India, the world's third-largest buyer of overseas coal, may be able to stop imports of power-generating thermal coal in the next three years as state-run Coal India (CIL) steps up production, Power and Coal Minister Piyush Goyal said on Wednesday.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has asked Coal India, the world's largest miner of the fuel, to more than double its output to 1 billion tonnes by 2019 to feed existing and upcoming power plants.
Modi has promised round-the-clock power to all Indians by 2022 and recently announced the nationalised coal industry would be opened up to allow private firms to compete with Coal India , which accounts for 80 percent of the country's output.
Declining shipments to country would drag on global coal markets grappling with oversupply as top consumer and importer China tries to shift towards cleaner fuels.
"I'm very confident of achieving these targets and am very confident that India's current account deficit (CAD) will not be burdened with the amount of money we lose for imports of coal," Goyal told a conference.
"Possibly in the next two or three years we should be able to stop imports of thermal coal."
Coal generates three-fifths of India's power, but a shortage of the fuel means millions still go without electricity and power cuts are common.
Around 60 of country's 103 power plants had enough coal for less than a week's usage as of November 2 due to lower supplies from Coal India.
Imports of coal have been surging as a result, equating to about 1 per cent of country's economy.
Shipments rose to 168.4 million tonnes last fiscal year, and the government estimated earlier this year that the domestic shortage would range between 185 and 265 million tonnes by 2016/17.
And some analysts were sceptical the country would be able to end imports soon.
"India's reliance on imports is not going away anytime soon," said Prakash Duvvuri, head of research at consultancy OreTeam.
"Obviously coal demand will continue to mean imports are needed in India."

Banks Hammered With $3.1B in Fines Over Rigging Scandal
Our mouth naturally fights dental cavities: StudyCircumcision advised for teenage boys
Salivary mucins – key components of mucus found in mouth – actively protect our teeth from the cavity-causing bacterium, a new study has found.
Bolstering native defences might be a better way to fight dental caries than relying on exogenous materials, such as sealants and fluoride treatment, said first author Erica Shapiro Frenkel, of Harvard University.
The bacteria Streptococcus mutans attaches to teeth using sticky polymers that it produces, eventually forming a bio-film, a protected surface-associated bacterial community that is encased in secreted materials, said Frenkel.
As S mutans grows in the biofilm, it produces organic acids as metabolic byproducts that dissolve tooth enamel, which is the direct cause of cavities.
“We focused on the effect of the salivary mucin, MUC5B on S mutans attachment and biofilm formation because these are two key steps necessary for cavities to form,” said Frenkel.
“We found that salivary mucins don’t alter S mutans’ growth or lead to bacterial killing over 24 hours,” said Frenkel.
“Instead, they limit biofilm formation by keeping S mutans suspended in the liquid medium. This is particularly significant for S mutans because it only causes cavities when it is attached, or in a biofilm on the tooth’s surface,” she said.
She adds that the oral microbiome is better preserved when naturally occurring species aren’t killed.
“The ideal situation is to simply attenuate bacterial virulence,” she said.
“Defects in mucin production have been linked to common diseases such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, and ulcerative colitis,” said Frenkel.
“There is increasing evidence that mucins aren’t just part of the mucus for structure or physical protection, but that they play an active role in protecting the host from pathogens and maintaining a healthy microbial environment,” Frenkel added.
The research was published in the journal Applied and Environmental Microbiology.

The Google Doodle team is already working on 2015 calendarPrint
Kristopher Hom has been animating doodles for over five years
Written by Nandagopal Rajan | New Delhi | Posted: November 12, 2014 5:49 pm | Updated: November 13, 2014 12:58 pm
The Google Doodle might be a momentary piece of art that brightens up your morning, but there is a lot of work that goes into creating these. In fact, the Google Doodle team is already working on the calendar of doodles for 2015.
“We get recommendations from Googlers across the world about what they think should be rendered as a doodle. We finally come up with a shortlist,” says Kristopher Hom, the Software Engineer who has been animating doodles for over five years. “Often we have two recommendations for a day. In such cases, we hold one of them for the next years,” says Hom, who started out in the search team, but soon started  working on animations and interaction to Google Doodles.
While he sees Doodles as a unique opportunity to showcase emerging browser technologies to the world, he remembers the time when he has to ask users for algorithms that could break the Google logo into as few dots as possible. “The browsers those days were not that good. Finally, someone came up with a suggestion that showed the logo in just 64 dots,” he says.
Hom likes doodles that help us remembers scientists who were not that famous but lets a big impact on our lives with their discoveries. His favourite doodle, however, is the 2012 Indian independence day doodle created by his friends.
The first Google Doodle in 1998, was just Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin’s way of indicating that they would be attending the Burning Man festival in the Nevada desert. The next doodle appeared in 2000 to mark Bastille Day and since then hundreds of Google have made the world smile, and think, before they clicked the search button.
While animating doodles, Hom says, he tries to make it as simple as possible. “My grandmother should be able to play and enjoy the doodle. That is very important,” says Hom, who is the first member of the Doodle team to visit India. With Google now putting multiple doodles across different countries on the same day, Hom says the team of around 20 illustrators and engineers end up making close to one doodle a day now. The team is open to suggestions sent on proposals@google.com and receives hundreds of requests every day.
Hom was in India to announce the winner of the 2014 Doodle4Google contest, which was won by Vaidehi Reddy of Pune . She won the contest, themed ‘A place in India I wish to visit’, with a doodle on Assam.

HTC Desire 816 G review: Consider this only if you want a big displayPrint
If you wish to buy a large screen phone with a good camera then you might consider the HTC Desire 816 G.
Written by Debashis Sarkar | New Delhi | Posted: November 12, 2014 5:16 pm | Updated: November 13, 2014 7:00 pm
Taiwanese smartphone maker HTC first launched its Desire 816 phablet in June at a price of Rs 24,450 in India. After three months, in September, it introduced the cheaper version in the form of Desire 816 G at a price of Rs 18,990. The only major difference is that the former houses a 1.6 GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 processor while the Desire 816 G has a 1.3 GHz quad-core MediaTek processor. There are not many phablets featuring a 5.5-inch screen in the sub Rs 20,000 range, so, is the Desire 816 G a good buy? We check out.
Quick specs: 5.5-inch 1280 x 720 HD display | 1.3 GHz quad-core MediaTek processor | Android 4.4.2 KitKat OS | 1 GB RAM | 8 GB internal memory expandable up to 32 GB | 13MP rear camera with auto-focus | 5 MP front camera | Dual Nano SIM (GSM + GSM) | 2600 mAh battery
Price: Rs 18,990
Design: It looks exactly similar to older Desire 816. The front of the phone houses two speakers vents and the 5 MP front camera. There are no capacitive buttons. The back is made out of glossy plastic and cannot be removed. The top right of the phone includes two nano SIM card slots along with a microSD card slot, covered by a plastic flap. The power/wake and volume buttons are on the left, which is frustrating sometimes specially while clicking pictures.
Despite the large 5.5-inch screen, the phone doesn’t compromise on one-handed operability or grip.The review unit was all-white, so, I easily managed to make it look dirty. The phone appears sleek and stylish but the glossy plastic back, makes it slippery.
The phone feels solid but the build quality is not strong. It’s a delicate smartphone which needs to be handled with care.
Display: The 1280 x 720 HD display is decent. HTC is not offering something unique in the display of this phablet. However, there is no Corning Gorilla glass or similar protection, which is very surprising! The display is good for watching movies, playing games and average users shouldn’t have any complains. The viewing angles are good and offer decent outdoor visibility as well.
Performance: In the age of octa-core processors, HTC is not offering anything tempting at least on paper. However, the quad-core MediaTek processor performs well. I did not witness any lags and again average users shouldn’t have any complains related to the performance. Overall, the experience is smooth.
Camera: The smartphone comes with a good camera. The images captured in low light also come with fair amount of detailing. Daylight images are even better with accurate colours. The 5 MP front camera also captures good quality selfies provided if you can hold a 5.5-inch phone with one hand. Overall, users will love the camera of this smartphone.
Connectivity: There are no issues with connectivity.
Battery: The 2600 mAh battery does a decent job. It can easily last an entire day for an average user.
Storage: The device offers 8GB of internal storage out of which around 4 GB is available. The memory can be further expanded up to 32 GB. So, investing in more storage is recommended.
Verdict: HTC has done a decent job by placing a 5.5-inch phone in Rs 18,000 segment. If you want to buy a large screen phone with a good camera then you can consider the HTC Desire 816 G. The Asus Zenfone 6 is another option at a price of Rs 16,999.
But if you are happy with a 5-inch display, then buying this phone makes little sense as you might find it difficult to fit (any) 5.5-inch screen phone inside your jeans pocket, especially while riding a bike. Also, there are several other 5-inch smartphones at a lower price.

Listing of REITs to Bring Transparency in Markets: SebiNikkei Share Average Opens 0.47% Higher
Mumbai: Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) will usher in a great deal of transparency in the sector and thus attract global funds, a senior executive from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has said.
In September, Sebi had notified the norms for listing of business trust structures, REITs and Infrastructure Investment Trust (InvIT) that would help attract more funds in a transparent manner into realty and infrastructure sectors.
Both the structures, norms of which were approved by the regulator in August, would get tax incentives.
"Tax incentives are key to the success of REITs and InvITs, as that would help attract more funds in a transparent manner into realty and infrastructure sectors. Additionally, compulsory listing of REITs will also usher in transparency in Indian markets," Sebi Executive Director Ananta Barua said at a real estate event organised by RICS here on Wednesday.
The board is in talks with the Finance Ministry to introduce tax incentives for REITs to make these instruments stage a successful take-off, he said.
Four stages of taxation are involved in the two trusts - first while structuring and transferring assets to REITs or InvITs, and second when they distribute income to their investors, third when they are traded and fourth time when there is an exit.
"These are heavy stages so tax issues have to be addressed."
As per the notification, for both trusts, the minimum initial offer size should be Rs 250 crore with a public float of at least 25 per cent, while the minimum asset base for these trusts to get listed is Rs 500 crore.
"With the twin objective of spurring growth back and infuse more liquidity in to the real estate market, the government's move to set up the REITs is laudable. While REITs will provide investors an investment avenue, which is comparatively less risky than investing in under-construction properties, implementation will also give them easier exit routes along with regular income in terms of returns," RICS Global managing director-emerging business Sachin Sandhir said.

Germany’s emphasis on free university education imparts key lessons to the rest of the world
November 12, 2014:  
In the past month, the German higher education system has been in the global spotlight as it bucked the international trend of privatisation and heaping university costs on students.
Lower Saxony became the last German State to announce it would be abolishing tuition fees for the university, (domestic and international students included). It joins other states in the west of Germany, including Hamburg, Bavaria and Hesse in abolishing them.
Fees have been in place on and off in West Germany over the years since the 1970s. A Federal Constitutional Court decision in 2005 went in favour of a group of universities that argued the federal government had overstepped the mark.
This ended up overturning a national ban on tuition fees as long as the fees were capped (at 500 euros a term) and were accompanied by affordable loan options for students.
Free education
While seven States in West Germany brought in tuition fees (none in the east of Germany did, however), the process swiftly went into reverse in the face of a strong protest campaign against fees and as regional governments changed hands from the Conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) of Chancellor Angela Merkel and its ally the Free Democratic Party (FDP) to the Social Democratic Party and Greens.
Last year, for example, Bavaria decided to phase out tuition fees after over a million people backed a public petition calling for fees to be scrapped (the petition passed the threshold needed for a referendum to be held, though the regional parliament chose to abolish tuition fees before it reached that stage).
After the election of the Social Democratic Party and the Greens in a coalition, it was only a matter of time that Lower Saxony scrapped fees too.
Germany joins other European states such as Denmark Sweden and Finland in providing free university education for domestic students.
New lessons
The developments in Germany raise important questions about higher education globally, including about the inevitability of privatisation and reduced government support as governments across the world have raked in their spending in the wake of the global financial and economic crisis.
There are a few caveats, however: firstly the U-turn in Germany wasn’t the result of a new, grand, national vision or a changed perspective of social justice.
The fee reversals were determined by strong opposition (unions, student groups and others joined forces to press the case) and political shifts as the composition of regional governments — the determiners of education budgets and policy — moved from right to left.
The short time period over which fees were introduced has also meant that there is limited evidence on whether fees created major barriers for less advantaged students.
While one study by three academics in Hamburg and Berlin found that there was a sharp drop in the aspirations of young people particularly from the poorest backgrounds to go to university as a result of fees (no matter how low) other studies found little difference in enrolment between states that had introduced tuition fees and those that hadn’t during the period that fees were introduced.
At the same time it would be wrong to argue there are no lessons for the rest of the world: after all, for one of the more-prudently run economies, with a not insubstantial student population (around 2.4 million across just under 380 institutions) to provide free education all the way up to post-graduate level is no mean feat.
And they have gradually been increasing their international standing: five German universities made it into the top 100 Times newspaper’s World University Rankings for 2014-2015, a list dominated by the US, Britain and Canada.
How does Germany afford it? For one thing participation rates are certainly lower than many parts of the developed world: for example, participation in tertiary education is lower in the country than the rest of Europe (29 per cent of 25-64-year olds against 40 per cent in Finland, 41 per cent in the UK and 32 per cent in Spain, according to a 2014 report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development).
Viable alternatives
While social class certainly plays a part (immigrant communities are also underrepresented at universities), it is partly the result of viable and respected alternatives.
Germany’s renowned apprenticeship system, while less popular than in the past, remains a popular option for young people — with its mix of classroom time and paid work over a three year period.
Of course there are challenges — universities have warned of a potential funding gap, arguing that the loss of funding from fees (these were automatically diverted to improving teaching standards) would lead to a drop in standards.
But the very fact that one of the world’s most reputed economies has gone back on tuition fees helps belie the view that the trudge towards ever higher student debts is inevitable.
It could also prove an economically canny move for the country — creating an even greater influx of talent from across the world to add to its aging workforce.

The writing on the wallTweet
Rate cut for growth required sooner rather than later
The numbers for consumer price inflation and factory output, on the face of it, tell a straightforward tale: growth is the bigger problem and inflation is on the wane. Only, one needs to delve a bit deeper. The CPI index has been trending downward since the average level of 10.4 per cent for the third quarter of 2013-14. The pace of decline has picked up after the first quarter of this year. It stands at just 5.5 per cent for October, against 7.8 per cent in August. Given the high levels of Q3 retail inflation last year, the steep decline may sustain itself till December. Therefore, there is some merit in the Reserve Bank of India’s argument that the ‘base effect’ is perhaps overstating the drop in inflation. This is particularly true in the case of consumer food prices (up 5.6 per cent in October), which soared to about 15 per cent in the same period last year. A reliable picture on whether inflation has been controlled will emerge in the first quarter of 2015, when the base effect is less pronounced. Meanwhile, there are straws in the wind that cannot be ignored. A 12 per cent deficient monsoon is expected to hit kharif output. There are signs of an upturn in food prices. Overall inflation risks also arise from the appreciation of the dollar, owing to a US recovery and the withdrawal of quantitative easing. This could lead to higher import costs, negating the fall in fuel prices. Therefore, the RBI may be content to watch bond sales pick up (and yields fall) on falling inflation numbers, rather than give a strong growth signal that may raise fears (even if unfounded) of the return of inflation and capital outflows.
But there is an equally convincing story to be told on the other side. Signs of a recovery in industrial output are feeble. A growth rate of 2.8 per cent in the first half of this year is no cause for cheer if one considers the low base of less than 1 per cent growth in the first half of 2013-14. Industrial growth has been sluggish since June 2011, save a brief spurt between August and October 2012. It has been negligible or negative after December 2012. This slump coincides with a period of high fuel, food prices and the transmission effect of high interest rates — a triple whammy.
The question is whether the RBI is keeping too tight a leash at a time when an investment revival is the need of the hour. Food inflation is poorly correlated to interest rate movements; it is industry that is impacted, leading to a drop in aggregate demand. The RBI must step in to lower rates when it is convinced that the threat of inflation has receded. A coordinated fiscal-monetary response by the RBI and the Centre is called for to deal with growth-inflation challenges.

Do away with harsh taxes and set the inverted import duty structure right
India’s manufacturing sector has long struggled to get its due. At the moment, manufacturing accounts for 15 per cent of India’s GDP while the service sector contributes 60 per cent.
If India has to accommodate over 10 million people joining the workforce every year, it needs to grow at a much faster pace. This can only happen if there is substantial growth in manufacturing, the only sector capable of employing most of the new workforce joining from the rural areas.
To begin with, India must increase its manufacturing competitiveness. For that to happen, the Government will need to bring in some tangible policy changes to attract investment. The manufacturing sector suffers from a host of problems, including stringent labour laws, poor infrastructure and a very poor supply chain.
Aggressive stand
Further, the tax department takes an extremely aggressive position vis-à-vis manufacturing — right from setting up the business to sourcing technology, hiring technical services and manufacturing and selling.
To add to problems, the import regime, thanks to WTO, has become extremely facilitative with the import licensing having been abolished and customs duty having fallen from dizzy levels of 150-300 per cent to as low as 10 per cent for coloured television sets and zero per cent for IT goods such as mobile phones and computers.
In the manufacturing sector the inverted duty structure continues on the customs front — import duties are higher on components than on finished goods. Direct tax incidence on imported manufacturing inputs has increased from 10 to 25 per cent (for soft costs such as royalties, software, technology fee, etc).
This is a complete disincentive for investment in the manufacturing sector. It is clearly time to not just provide a level playing field to manufacturing vis-à-vis imports but to incentivise manufacturing with a facilitative tax regime.
To do this, the Government must lay down some mandatory guiding principles. All direct and indirect tax legislation, policy, implementation and interpretation should be based on whether it would encourage manufacturing in India as against imports.
Take for example, the source rule of taxation which taxes import of soft inputs in manufacturing such as royalties for technology, technical services fee, software and so on without a taxable presence. This should be removed to encourage manufacturing.
Guiding principles
This rule was valid in the days of high import duties. Also, SEZs can become global manufacturing hubs provided the sale of goods allowed in the domestic tariff area is levied customs duty only on the duty foregone on imports into the SEZs and not on value added by way of labour or materials. The manufacture of cars by global companies in India is one such example.
The restructuring of businesses should not result in any form of taxation until cash profit is realised. For example, the new concepts of REIT(Real Estate Investment Trusts)/INVIT (Infrastructure Investment Trusts) being mooted to raise capital for infrastructure and real estate and free up bank loans for further expansion would fail in case MAT tax is levied on the contribution of assets to REIT /INVIT.
There needs to be a change in the mindset of the tax department so that it facilitates business instead of playing a restrictive role. Uncertainty on taxes needs to be removed by bringing about transparency and clarity by publishing position papers on a regular basis under an independent forum — to minimise disputes particularly on issues affecting a large number of taxpayers or involving large tax amounts.
Tax policies should encourage foreign direct investment into India. India subjects capital gains tax on profits made on FDI but does not levy capital gains tax on profits made by FIIs when they sell on the stock market — while it can be clearly said FDI is a superior investment. The US, UK, Singapore and other countries encourage FDI by not taxing capital gains on sale of shares. India should do the same.
Studies have also indicated that every job created in manufacturing can create two or three jobs in the service sector. Our future lies in how best we utilise our most powerful reserves: human resources.

Can t take all good work away just because we lost 3 gamesBy: Press Trust of India | Kolkata | Posted: November 12, 2014 6:35 pm
Sri Lanka might have surrendered the five-match ODI series against India in the third game itself but former captain Mahela Jayawardene  said that there was nothing to worry about their World Cup preparation as things are on track.
“When you go into a big tournament you have to have that hunger to win. In our camp we have that. Our guys tend to rise when it matters. As long as the focus and intent is there I think we’ll get very far,” Jayawardene told reporters on the eve of their penultimate ODI of the series at Eden Gardens.
“This is the build up, yes we would have few hiccups and not a concern. Things are right on track.”
“I think we have the knack of rising to the occasion in big tournaments and stand up to the pressure. Not just me if you see how Lasith (Malinga) and Nuwan Kulasekara bowled those last four five overs,” he said referring to their World T20 final win against India in Bangladesh.
The senior pro further recalled their successive runners-up finishes in the World Cup.
“No one gave us an opportunity to come out of that group in 2007 in the West Indies. In the end, India went out and we went all the way.
“Yes we’re one of the favourites in the last edition because of the home conditions but we handled the pressure and reached the final.”
Jayawardene further said they have been very successful this time and claimed their winning percentage was about 80 per cent.
“If you take this year leading up to the World Cup we have been pretty consistent home and away so we just need to build on that. We have got seven ODIs against England at home and then seven in New Zealand to give us much better preparation leading up to the World Cup.”
Jayawardene however said they would sit back and analyse things before they embark on the World Cup campaign.
“We have had a fantastic year so far. Our winning percentage was somewhere around 80 per cent. We won the Asia Cup and then the World T20. This is International cricket.”
“The only series we lost was to South Africa at home. You just can’t take all the good work done away just because we lost three games badly.
“We will analyse and see what went wrong. Obviously the performance has not been up to the mark in all the three departments. We need to sit down and rethink our strategy. Once we get all our players back I think we will play good cricket.”
Giving credit to India for a dominating performance, Jayawardene further said they should learn a few things from the hosts.
“You have to give credit to the Indians as well they have been playing well in all the three departments. We can learn a few things from them as well. How they gel together, the way they handle different situations, and especially the way they played in the continued…

Vijay Hazare: Gambhir  Sehwag back among runs as Delhi winGambhir (93) and Sehwag (80) stitched a 144-run third-wicket partnership to help the side achieve its target in 42.1 overs. (Express File)
Dharamsala | Posted: November 12, 2014 8:31 pm
Out-of-favour Indian batsmen Gautam Gambhir and Virender Sehwag struck big half-centuries to drive Delhi home by three wickets against Haryana in the Vijay Hazare one-day tournament, in Dharamsala on Wednesday.
Chasing 248 for a win, Delhi lost wickets at regular intervals but Gambhir (93) and Sehwag (80) stitched a 144-run third-wicket partnership to help the side achieve its target in 42.1 overs.
Sehwag, 36, who came in at the number three position in the previous game that Delhi lost to Himachal Pradesh at the same venue, was dropped down the order and the dasher struck 8 fours and 3 sixes in his 68-ball blitz.
Meanwhile Gambhir, 33, who last played for India against England in the Oval Test in April this year, is eyeing a World Cup place and impressed with 11 fours in his 97-ball stay.
The Gambhir-led side was looking comfortable at 218 for three when suddenly Haryana pace spearhead Joginder Sharma (4-27) alongwith Mohit Sharma and Kuldeep Hooda turned on the heat to pick four wickets in the space of 36 runs.
Mohit accounted for Gambhir to deny the southpaw his hundred, Hooda sent Sumit Narwal for 8 and then Punit Bisht (6) and Ashish Nehra (0) were scalped by Joginder to put Delhi in trouble at 244 for seven.
Top-order batsmen Unmukt Chand (3) and Milind Kumar (1) also disappointed to give Haryana the edge early on.
Middle-order batsman Mithun Manhas (31 not out) though kept his cool to take the team home with Rajat Bhatia’s (2) support.
Earlier put into bat, the Nitin Saini-led Harayna started well with a 65-run opening stand between Abhimanyu Khod (28) and Avi Barot (49) but lack of good partnerships hurt them in the end.
Sachin Rana top-scored with 71 runs while Delhi medium-pacer Vikas Tokas picked up four wickets.
Ashish Nehra and Parvinder Awana also bagged two wickets apiece to put Haryana on the backfoot.
Brief Scores: Haryana 247 all out in 50 overs (Avi Barot 49, Sachin Rana 71; Vikas Tokas 4-41) Delhi 251/7 in 42.1 overs (Gautam Gambhir 93, Virender Sehwag 80, Mithun Manhas 31 not out; Joginder Sharma 4-27).
Maharashtra down Mumbai
Maharashtra beat heavyweights Mumbai by six wickets in a west zone leg match of the Vijay Hazare Trophy.
Batting first, Mumbai were bowled out 211 in 44.2 overs with Wasim Jaffer top-scoring with 84 while pacer Dominic Joseph grabbed six for 25 in 8.2 overs. Akhil Herwadkar scored 44 and Suryakumar Yadav scored 40.
In reply, Maharashtra knocked off the runs in 48 overs with Ankit Bawne (78 no) anchoring the chase while Rohit Motwani (59) also contributed to the winning cause, Sangram Atitkar (32) also did his bit as Maharashtra didn’t have any porblems chasing the target losing only four wickets.
Brief Scores: Mumbai 211 in 44.2 overs (Wasim Jaffer 84, Dominic Joseph 6/25) Maharashtra 214/4 in 48 overs (Ankit Bawne 78 no, Rohit Motwani 59). Maharashtra won by 6 wickets.

U.S.-China Climate Deal Just Weakened The GOP s Favorite ArgumentRepublicans have so far been largely silent on President Barack Obama's surprise announcement of a climate deal between the United States and China .
In the past, many in the GOP have used China's apparent unwillingness to agree to such a deal as an excuse for America to stand pat as well. One clip posted on YouTube by Climate Desk shows Republican lawmakers repeatedly saying the U.S. can't act until other major emitters such as China do so.
Now that China has agreed to a deal, will anything change? Probably not: It's worth noting that these same lawmakers also name other major emitters such as India and Mexico as obstacles to changing emissions standards in the U.S.

Kerala Blasters flop at home  play out goalless drawBy: Press Trust of India | Kochi | Posted: November 12, 2014 10:51 pm
Kerala Blasters couldn’t cash in on home advantage as they were played out a goalless draw with Mumbai City FC in an Indian Super League home match in Kochi on Wednesday.
The result meant that Mumbai were on fourth spot with 12 points from eight games while Kerala remained at sixth position with nine points from eight encounters.
With support of home crowd, Blasters should have logged home full points but India’s premier goalkeeper Subrata Paul, who is one of the highest paid Indian players in league, came up with some good saves to help the Ranbeer Kapoor co-owned side leave with a point.
Paul, pulled off three saves for the ‘Blue Brigade’ including one in the eighth minute which was out of the top drawer.
The match was into its eighth minute, when Kerala’s Milagres Gonsalves, who got the ball on the wide left and essayed a cross for Nigerian Penn Orji. The former East Bengal playmaker headed it on bounce which Paul dived full length to block it. From the rebound, Cedric Hengbart made another attempt which was again parried away by Paul.
In the 65th minute, Sabeeth kept a measured centre from the left side of the penalty box and Paul showed great anticipation as he tipped it over an emerging Milagres.
Paul’s final save came during the dying moments of the match when he again dived full-stretched to deny Raphael Romey from heading it in after Stephen Pearson had delivered an accurate cross.
Nicholas Anelka was not in his element although he essayed defence splitting pass in the 50th minute but Kerala captain and custodian David James averted the danger with a clearance.
The closest Mumbai came to scoring was in the 77th minute when Anelka’s cross was cleared by left-back Saumik Dey outside the 6-yard box. Tiago’s first-time shot came off the right vertical.

Revival of interest in ULIPs seen: Edelweiss Tokio chiefinsurance
Plans to launch online insurance policies soon
Bullish outlook on equities and Indian stock market is reported to be attracting customers back towards ULIP (Unit Linked Insurance Plan) schemes, according to a top official of a private life insurer.
“According to initial data we have gathered, there have been increases in ULIP segment. We see traction for ULIPs across the industry. If market continues to perform well and economy shows improvement, we hope ULIPs will gain further momentum in the coming months,” said Deepak Mittal, Managing Director and CEO of Edelweiss Tokio Life Insurance Company Ltd., a joint venture between Edelweiss Financial Services and Japan’s Tokio Marine Holdings Inc.
The ULIPs are reported to be attracting customers due to twin benefits offered by them.
They offer life protection as well as a market-linked growth for the investment. However, in ULIPs risk cover is promised, but returns solely depends on the market performance. But traditional insurance products, which include whole-life, endowment and term policies, promise both risk cover and fixed returns.
Mr. Mittal said Edelweiss Tokio’s product offering was well-balanced between traditional and market-linked to meet the customer requirements.
The company was also planning to roll out a few online insurance policies soon, he said after announcing company’s expansion in southern region.
The company hopes to end the current fiscal with a total premium income of over Rs.100 crore when compared with Rs.65 crore in 2013-14. It is seeing traction for its ULIPs, health plans and retirement solutions.

What s Apple worth Stock hits new highsEMAIL
(AFP/Getty)
Apple (AAPL) shares are hitting another record high. And it seems like there’s nothing that can stop it — not even price targets.
Shares of the smartphone-maker keep blasting blast analysts’ price targets almost as fast as the analysts can raise them. Apple’s breathtaking rally this year — powered by strong uptake of the iPhone 6 smartphone — continues to mock analysts’ price targets rooted in fundamentals and valuations as emotion and speculation takes over.
Shares of Apple Wednesday closed up $1.55, or 1.4%, Wednesday to $111.25. That already tops the $108.10 18-month price target that analysts had just two months ago. Analysts have been scrambling to keep ahead of the soaring shares of Apple — but the stock seems to have no bounds. Perhaps the analysts saying Apple is the first “risk free” stock are on to something after all?
Apple at $110 a share is just below analysts’ current $116.69 18-month price target on the stock. And that average price target has been collectively raised 4.4% just over the past month.
Certainly, there are degrees of optimism, even among analysts. The highest 18-month price target on Apple is currently $143 a share. That might seem outlandishly high, especially since the stock is already trading at 17 times its earnings the past 12 months. But analysts have learned the hard way that you’re either bullish on Apple, or you’re wrong.
Earlier this week, UBS tech analyst Steven Milunovich took his price target up nearly 9% to $125 a share. He pointed to “strong buying intentions for the iPhone 6 … appreciation of the brand and ecosystem and interest in Apple Pay,” as drivers for the ever-rising stock price in a note to clients.
Computerized tools continue to be more guarded about the trajectory of Apple’s stock. Trefis , a tool that measures how much a company is worth by looking at the present value of expected cash flow, pegs the stock’s value at $110. But even that’s been raised more than 10% over the past few months.
How high can the stock go? Seems like it has a mind of its own — one that even the analysts can’t read.

Chicago Tribune managing editor leaves to pursue personal interests11
After graduating with a bachelor's degree in journalism from the University of Nebraska in December 1989, she joined the Chicago Tribune a few weeks later as an intern on the sports copy desk. When her internship ended, Hirt stayed on as a copy editor on the national/foreign news desk. She became copy desk chief in 1997 and was elevated to national/foreign news editor in 2000.
In 2002, Hirt was part of a team charged with the formidable task of getting more young people to read a newspaper. The result was RedEye, a free tabloid which she co-founded in 2002 and where she served as inaugural co-editor and editor through 2008.
Tribune Editor Gerould Kern named Hirt managing editor in August 2008 one month after he became editor.
"I admired Jane and her work for a long time. I saw what a great job she did at conceiving and launching RedEye, and then running it for six years," Kern said. "I wanted to bring some of that spirit of innovation to my team at the Chicago Tribune."
In December 2008, Tribune Co. plunged into bankruptcy, saddled with $13 billion in debt from real estate investor Sam Zell's heavily leveraged buyout one year earlier. The company would remain in bankruptcy for four years. But the Chicago Tribune didn't remain in stasis while waiting to emerge, a source of pride for Hirt.
"We accomplished so much and grew so much during that bankruptcy that when we emerged, we were stronger and changed for the better," Hirt said.
Framed front pages in Hirt's office mark the paper's challenges and successes during her tenure as managing editor. A front page from April 2012 celebrates Chicago Tribune columnist Mary Schmich winning the Pulitzer Prize for commentary.
"I'm proud of this newsroom and how it's flourished through the last six years — unbelievable journalists doing unbelievable work under unbelievable pressure," Hirt said.
She is equally proud of helping to change the newsroom culture, both in mission and mindset, as the newspaper began the ongoing process of evolving and adapting to the digital media landscape.
"I have seen this newsroom just change to be a more positive place with lots of possibilities, and I hope that I contributed to that," Hirt said.
Hirt said the new corporate structure of Tribune Publishing — which includes the Chicago Tribune, Los Angeles Times and eight other daily newspapers — did not play into her decision to leave, other than confirming that the newspaper was on solid ground, with or without her.
"I never wanted to leave during a crisis," Hirt said. "It's a resurgent time for the Tribune and so I thought this was a good time for a leader to leave."
Hirt said she is going to take an extended break from the daily grind of journalism, with relaxing, travel, volunteer work and perhaps learning a new language on her relatively short to-do list. She and her husband, musician Michael Lenzi, plan to remain in Chicago, at least for the near term.
Down the road, she is open to a return to journalism, or something completely different.
"I like to take risks, I like to change, I like to stretch toward things and figure things out," Hirt said. "It's a world of possibilities out there."
Kern, likewise, plans to take some time before naming a replacement as managing editor.
"I think it's a natural moment to hear what's on people's minds, how they view the future, and I'm going to take the opportunity to listen and talk to people before we make a new appointment," Kern said.
He emphasized that Hirt was an integral part of a newsroom leadership team that largely remains intact after nearly seven years. He said the woman who has been managing editor for the last six years leaves a unique and lasting legacy, calling Hirt "a great partner" and one of the best managing editors in the newspaper's history.
"Jane stood strong in some really dark days and she was instrumental in helping me and her colleagues make sure that the story of the Chicago Tribune continued to be a really, really good one going forward," Kern said.

All even: Anand draws Game 4 with Carlsen  scores tied 2-2By: Press Trust of India | Sochi | Posted: November 13, 2014 12:13 am
Five-time World Champion Viswanathan Anand played out an easy draw with black pieces against Magnus Carlsen in the fourth game of the ongoing World Chess Championship in Sochi on Wednesday.
After a crushing win over Carlsen in the third game which level scores, Anand gave nothing away and was a completely different player from the first two games in which he had looked quite vulnerable. The scores are now level at 2-2 after four rounds.
There was pressure from Carlsen yet again but Anand was hardly intimidated as tackled the Norwegian move for move.
Anand changed gears in the opening in the fourth game, shifting to the Sicilian defence, from the Berlin wherein he lost badly in the second game while playing with black pieces.
Carlsen, in his typical style, went for the closed set-up, livening things up at his own will when he wanted and put Anand under some pressure in the middle game.
Anand, this time however did not buckle under pressure, found out a resourceful defence and then the pieces got exchanged in a heap.
The Norwegian was playing against a slightly vulnerable pawn structure but things did not go in his favour thanks to some perfect counter-attack that Anand produced after trading all the pieces except queen.
Carlsen used up some of his time in the second time control after move 40 but decided that there was nothing to play for.
The game ended vide perpetual checks after 47 moves, giving Anand a small psychological advantage ahead of the rest day before the fifth game in the 12-games match that has 1 million Euros as prize money.
Carlsen did not appear quite happy with the result as he said,”I thought I played terribly, it was a draw so that’s ok.”
“It was a difficult game. There was a lot going on based on this weak pawn in the centre. Towards the end, I found this important queen move after which its fine,” Anand said in the post-game conference.
The tide seems to be turning in Anand’s favour if the last two games are any indication. The fifth game will be quite important for the Indian ace to continue in similar vein.
More pressure from Anand could result in a much needed victory as Carlsen does not look the same invincible player he was in Chennai last year.

The New World Series Of Poker Champ Is...Sweden's Martin Jacobson Wins $10 Million World Series Of Poker Prize

LAS VEGAS (AP) — The Swedish man who got his start playing online poker after late restaurant nights while he trained to be a chef is $10 million richer after winning the top World Series of Poker main event prize Tuesday night.
Martin Jacobson, 27, had three tens to beat Felix Stephensen of Norway and his pair of nines.
"There's no such thing as a 'perfect tournament,' but this was close to perfect, maybe," Jacobson said after the confetti blasts signaled his win had been cemented and friends and family ran to embrace him.
Jacobson would come home late from nights in a restaurant and none of his friends would be awake to chat or hang out, so he started playing online poker, said his mother, Eva.
He was the only player of the final nine to have earned more than $1 million in World Series of Poker career earnings at tournaments. But he had never won the top spot, coming in second in some cases, until Tuesday when he won the most watched contest in the tournament.
"It's his thing," Eva said during Tuesday's head-to-head gameplay.
Jacobson exhibited a calm stillness throughout the two days of poker playing.
He didn't wear sunglasses, a hoodie or a baseball cap like other players to hide tells. He often stared at his opponents across the table blinking through black-rimmed glasses.
This wasn't his first try at the big win. He traveled to Las Vegas, days after he turned 21, to enter the main event. But he busted out after a few hands, his mother said.
"I think that was good for him," she said in the lobby of the Penn & Teller Theater at the Rio while her son amassed more chips on stage inside. He learned it wasn't going to be an easy task, she said.
Stephensen, 24, took home a $5.1 million prize for second place.
"It's disappointing to be so close, but I got really lucky to get this far, and it was a tough final table," he said.
The two defeated Jorryt van Hoof, the leader throughout most of the game play, to go head-to-head.
Van Hoof, a poker pro originally from the Netherlands, had an icy stare and a formidable chip lead against two other European players going into Tuesday night's final table in the World Series of Poker.
All have been vying for the $10 million top prize and a coveted World Series of Poker gold bracelet.
But on Tuesday night, van Hoof donned a pair of sunglasses, lost his lead, couldn't regain it and finally lost after three hours of gameplay with a pair of fives to a pair of tens held by the man who took his early lead.
Van Hoof, 31, earned $3.8 million for third place.
The Dutch pro who has his own poker coaching business donned sunglasses for several hands Tuesday night; they hid his usual cold stare.
"I never wore glasses in my life, but it was really hot," he said of the bright studio lights. "I guess I'm not going to do that anymore," he said, chuckling.
Van Hoof also didn't just have a cheering section making creative use of his name ("Van Hoof, van Hoof, van Hoof is on fire," they chanted). He had an entire team of friends and coaches analyzing spreadsheets, the table play and the half-hour delayed ESPN live broadcast. All that information was given to a captain, of sorts, who would then filter it to van Hoof.
It was the first time in the World Series of Poker's history that the final three players in the no-limit Texas Hold 'em main event didn't include a single American.
All three players live in London.
"I enjoyed playing with these guys," van Hoof said. "We're going to meet up. And the winner will pay for my dinner."
They outlasted six other finalists during 12 hours of gameplay Monday night and into Tuesday morning and began playing no-limit Texas Hold 'em again Tuesday night.
Van Hoof had a third more chips than Jacobson and nearly double the total of Stephensen going into the final face-off.
The main event, culminating this week, is just one World Series of Poker event but certainly the most watched.
About 6,700 people paid the $10,000 entry fee to try their luck over the summer to be finalists in the Texas Hold 'em main event.

Services exports vital for economy: JaitleyThe Hindu Finance Minister Arun Jaitley with Commerce and Industry Minister Nirmala Sitharaman during the Services Conclave 2014 in New Delhi on Wednesday. Photo: R.V. Moorthy

Says they compensate for deficit in merchandise exports, create jobs
Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said here on Wednesday that more jobs should be created in the service sector, in addition to those in the manufacturing sector, so that large sections of the underemployed population in the agriculture sector could get “meaningful” employment.
Mr. Jaitley was delivering the inaugural address at the second edition of Services Conclave, 2014, jointly organised by the Commerce Ministry and the Confederation of Indian Industry.
He said research and development (R&D), tourism, education and healthcare services had the potential to lead exports growth in the service sector. Exports from the sector were important as they compensated for the deficit in merchandise exports created as India imported more goods than it exported.
The Minister said the government was making efforts to raise the share of the manufacturing sector in the Gross Domestic Product from 15 per cent to 25 per cent, a target set by the previous UPA government. The pharmaceutical sector had the potential of providing global quality healthcare in a cost-effective manner, the Minister said. There was an abundance of quality scientists and research professionals, and India could become an R&D hub.
Noting that the tourism sector needed to be given a push by providing quality hotels, faster domestic travel, easier visa, visa-on-arrival and e-visa facilities, cleaner trains and so on, he said it could be a driver of services exports.
Mr. Jaitley noted that in the entertainment sector, one-sixth of the global viewership was in India and hence there was immense scope for services export. He highlighted that India could become a regional hub for providing quality education.
Earlier, delivering the special address at the conclave, Minister of State for Commerce and Industry Nirmala Sitharaman said the immense untapped potential in the services sector should be harnessed for increasing the share of India’s exports in the global services arena. She said the sectors of entertainment, wellness, hospitality and professional services could provide a platform for services export from India.

Study: Having just one drink doubles your risk of going to the E.R.By Christopher Ingraham November 12 Follow @_cingraham
With three glasses of wine, your risk of hurting yourself and going to the E.R. increases by a factor of five.
You don't need a scientist to tell you that if you go out and get really, really drunk, there's a good chance that you'll do something stupid and hurt yourself. But exactly what are those chances? How drunk do you have to be to, say, quadruple your risk of injury? Do you put yourself at more risk of certain injury types than others? And is the relationship between drunkenness and injury risk different for some people than others?
To answer those questions you do need science, and lucky for us, science recently discovered the answers! For a forthcoming article in the journal Addiction , researchers analyzed surveys filled out by 13,000 people -- hailing from 18 countries -- who found themselves drunk and in the emergency room for injury. The research was supported by a grant from the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism .
In what should come as a shock to nobody, the more you drink, the more likely you are to hurt yourself. A person who has consumed 3 drinks in the past six hours is about 4.6 times as likely to end up in the E.R. as someone who hasn't drunk at all. Even a single drink roughly doubles your odds of going to the hospital.
"Patients were asked about the cause of injury bringing them to the emergency department (categorized as falls, traffic, violence, other), drinking within six hours prior to the injury event, and drinking during the same six-hour period the previous week," author Cheryl Cherpitel and her four co-authors explain. Cherpitel is a researcher Alcohol Research Group, a program of the Public Health Institute.
They converted alcohol consumption quantities to standard drinks of 16 ml ethanol. Some of the people in the study drank a lot. So the authors were able to plot the relationship between drinks and hospital visits all the way up to a mind-boggling 30 drinks. This may sound like a lot, but remember that there is a not insignificant number of people for whom 10 drinks a day is standard. After having those ten drinks, your odds of going to the E.R. have increased by a factor of 10.
Interestingly, the relationship tends to flatten out from there, which makes sense if you think about it. After 15 or 20 drinks, you're at a very high likelihood of passing out. And once you've passed out you're unable to hurt yourself. You're either going to wake up with an epic hangover the next day, or you will choke on your own vomit and die. Either way, you're not showing up in this data.
But the startling finding in these numbers is that after three drinks, womens' likelihood of getting injured increases far more rapidly than mens'. At ten drinks, the average man's risk of seriously injuring himself has risen tenfold. But a woman's risk after the same number of drinks is about 14 times greater. That gap only widens as the drinking intensifies.
Why the greater injury risk for women? Duke University's Philip Cook points out that "generally speaking the effects of ingesting X ounces of ethanol in 6 hours depends on weight but also gender (and other factors). Women tend to be more reactive to alcohol, achieving a higher BAC for given level of drinking and body weight." In other words, 10 drinks are likely to have a greater effect on the average woman than on the average man.
The study also found a significant difference in the types of injury reported by the drunken E.R. patients. Interpersonal-violence - in other words, hitting each other - had a significantly stronger relationship with increased drinking than either traffic accidents or falls. The increased likelihood of violent injury was apparent and statistically significant after even one drink. In short, a single drink nearly quadruples your chances of getting in a fight and going to the hospital.
From a policy standpoint, Cherpitel said that an important factor is the context of drinking. Different countries, and even different regions of a single country, have very different cultural attitudes about getting drunk. Cherpitel says that in the U.S., for instance, Californians exhibit drinking patterns similar to what you see in Mediterranean countries, where alcohol is consumed frequently, but in small quantities with meals. Binge drinking, on the other hand, is more of a staple of life in the South and upper Midwest.
From a policy standpoint, Cherpitel emphasizes that there's no one-size-fits-all approach to alcohol regulation. Different drinking cultures produce different drinking outcomes - including hospital visits. And the stark differences in injury risk for women and men suggest that some populations may be at greater risk for alcohol-related harm than others.

The gross things co-workers do in the bathroom stall next to you(Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)
Eat. Text. Not wash hands.
These are the activities that an unsettling percentage of people say they do in the bathroom at work, according to the 2014 Hygiene Matters Survey conducted for SCA, a Swedish-based global hygiene product company.
A business intelligence firm and research company did online polling of 13,000 people from 13 different countries, including a representative sample of 1,058 adults in the United States.
Their findings of American workplace bathroom habits  are a mixture of gross and sad:
10 percent said they only "sometimes" wash their hands after using the toilet, with 1 percent admitting they never do it. Please, for the love of all things, wash those hands!
25 percent said they have gone to the bathroom to text, while 23 percent said they did the same to talk on the phone. That's actually surprisingly low.
8 percent said they use their workplace bathrooms to eat. Um, eating literally anywhere else is less disgusting. Why would you do that to your food?
7 percent go to the bathroom to exercise. How big are these bathrooms?!
5 percent said they smoke in the bathroom, the same percentage that goes to their work bathrooms to sleep. Hopefully not at the same time.
Almost half of Americans don't ever wash their hands after arriving at work.
Globally, one in 10 adults said they've gone to their workplace bathrooms for "taking a break to cry" and 15 percent said they would actually tell co-workers that they had poor hygiene. (So any of you with running mental lists of people who don't wash their hands after using the toilet: Maybe it's time to call out those co-workers.)
As bad as Americans' habits may seem, people in other countries are way more unsatisfied with the state of their work toilets, especially in China and Italy. A majority of Russians also wish that their employers would pay more attention to bathrooms at work.
By comparison, Americans were the most satisfied with their work bathrooms — 87 percent said so.
And 13 percent of Americans said they actually preferred their work bathrooms to the ones they had a home. I'm certainly not one of those 13 percent; after seeing these numbers I'll stick to my bathroom at home, where people aren't eating and leaving with unwashed hands.

How Do Retail Stores Profit From Black Friday Salesreddit
What are the economics behind the Black Friday sales? : originally appeared on Quora : The best answer to any question. Ask a question, get a great answer. Learn from experts and access insider knowledge. You can follow Quora on Twitter , Facebook , and Google+ .
Answer by Eric Mayefsky , PhD in Economics, Stanford
I'll take a little more of an abstract take on this since I know some behavioral economics but am not a retail insider.
Question 1: How do the stores actually make money on this?
Loss leaders are a really fun economic concept Dan and Ross both covered well in their answers.  In short, the retailer can lose money on items being put on sale (either in the sense of a price below the cost of the item or in comparison to the price they might be able to get you to pay if they didn't put the item on sale) and come out ahead if they increase the probability of getting you to buy other things that day in the store or entering into a profitable future relationship with you (via brand affinity or things like warranties and replacement plans) by enough.  I've always heard that extended warranties are sucker bets, as one example--don't buy the extended warranty unless it's a purchase so large and important that you feel like you need to actually buy insurance on it the way you think about insurance on your house or car.
In-store sales, like coupons and other similar concepts, are a form of price discrimination which can allow a business to make substantially more money.  'Discrimination' here doesn't mean prejudice based on sex, race, etc. but just refers to this idea that different people are willing to pay different amounts of money for the same thing and the efforts that businesses make to charge more to people who are willing to pay more.  For example, say you're trying to sell a TV to two different people.  One has a part time job and doesn't make a ton of money, but he does like watching TV so he's willing to pay $500 for a new TV.  Another is an investment banker with a wife and two kids who makes a ton of money and would pay $2500 for the same TV but for whom the day after Thanksgiving constitutes about half of the free time he has to spend with his kids all year.  A retailer could offer an outrageously large Black Friday discount for the TV and the I-Banker is not going to fight the crowds at the mall.  So if your entire target market consisted of these two types of people, you could make the most money by having the TV sell for $2500 in general but be only $500 if you're at the store at 5am on Black Friday or something like that.  The obnoxiousness of claiming the discount is key here -- being able to price discriminate successfully requires either being able to formally filter people by status (e.g. senior discounts at the movies), filter them based on their time/taste preferences in the buying process (e.g. the above example, coupons, etc.), or by creating two different versions of the underlying product (iPhone 5s/5c, etc.).  All these types can reduce total economic surplus as the business has an incentive to make life more annoying for certain customers or make a lower-performing version of a product, even if there's no cost reduction to them when they do so.  (The most often cited example of this in academic economics is when Intel sold a budget version of an early processor by using the same creation process as their top of the line processor and then destroying/disabling the math coprocessor on the chip afterward.)
Question 2: If it makes money, why not have Black Friday more often?
I think the biggest reason is that retailers don't have ultimate control over cultural norms.  For example, there are really no other days in the US where a large portion of the population has the day off from work/school but the day itself has no other purpose or predetermined cultural significance.  Some stores do run major sales on other three day weekends but would probably face backlash if incredibly over-the-top efforts were made to commercialize Memorial Day, Martin Luther King Day, etc.  Additionally, retailers can't just create new needs for purchases from scratch, and the proximity to the winter holidays plays a major role in the purchasing frenzy that would not be present in a springtime Black Friday equivalent.  (Note that the retail industry definitely has _some_ control over how commercialized things get and there are many giving pastimes that seem to have been brought about by clever marketing rather than purely cultural grass roots, but that is done through advertising and gradual psychological influence over time, not by fiat.)
Even setting aside culture and seasonality in people's need to buy stuff, adding more Black Fridays would have very diminishing marginal returns for a few reasons: limits in total budgets of consumers, the psychological impact of the scarcity of discounts (if I don't buy this now, it may not be this cheap again for a whole year), and then the actual benefits of it being annoying/difficult to get the lower price (see the price discrimination discussion above).

Customer Experience Design: Strategy Beyond Theatricsreddit
Experiential marketing is all about engaging consumers in interactive and captivating brand experiences. But how can sociological design thinking help us understand how such experiences are created and sustained?
Many years ago, when I was still working in the music business, I was working for an established artist who was looking to take it to the next level. And so it was decided to hire a so-called experiential marketing consultant. The consultant came in and made a number of dramaturgical suggestions: from "write more engaging songs," "dim the lights," or "make sure the seats are comfortable" to "devise meet-and-greet events" or "bring fans on stage." Although the artist's marketing team enthusiastically implemented these tactics, nothing much happened and the campaign was regarded as a massive failure.
All of this is long ago but the experiential virus is more powerful than ever before. Everyday marketing professors hear from managers across the world asking things like "Can you help us make our consumers feel our brand?" or "How can we use live interaction to connect consumers with our product?" or "What does it take to make our brand experience theatrical?"
Underlying this idea is a fundamental misunderstanding: the idea that involving consumers in a theatrical experience, through touch, sense, and feel, product sampling, and emphasizing emotions will somehow make consumer-brand bonds more powerful and enduring. But this is not what customer experience design is all about.
Consider an epitome of experiential marketing success: Tesla. Think about all the different things that Elon Musk and his time have gathered to bring the Tesla experience to life. From the chassis of the car to its lithium batteries to touch screens, Elon Musk's visionary personality, and the material samples on the walls of the Tesla store. It does very much look like Tesla is so successful because it has really internalized Joe Pine and James Gilmore's call that "work is theater and every business a stage."
But managers need to know that there is an important difference between performance and performativity. Performance is traditional theatrics, putting on a show for or with a person. Performativity is about making a person do something for or with you in a natural way. It is about making behaviour move beyond the theatrical and extraordinary and into the realm of perfect taken-for-grantedness.
In Tesla's case, for instance, the real takeaway is not in the dramatic technology, an emotional brand message, or a captivating retail theater. Tesla's real accomplishment is to convince a growing number of consumers that the most logical, rational solution to global warming is not public transport or the bicycle but its battery driven car. Tesla has designed a new type of consumer, a person to whom the Tesla experience becomes indispensable to his project of being an ecologically responsible citizen.
Customer experience design is a sociological approach that reminds us that effective experiential campaigns are never only about designing the experience or transporting a particular emotion but also about designing the customer to whom such an experience and emotion becomes everything but dramatic and extraordinary. It teaches managers a lesson that artists have been practicing for hundreds of years: the ultimate goal is never to entertain people but to transform them into followers, to make them your own.
To immerse people is to re-design people, their imagination, their goals and aspirations, what they can or cannot do. And in the process, the theatrical disappears.

Five Cyber Security Takeaways From the Mid-Term electionsreddit
While not a much-discussed topic during campaign season, federal policy on cyber-security will likely see some material changes as a result of a Republican-controlled Senate. Just how significant those changes will be have yet to be determined, but here are some thoughts on probably outcomes:
1) Don't expect comprehensive cyber security legislation just yet: No matter what number of Senate seats wind up going Republican, one things is for sure - they will not reach a veto-proof majority. Without that, there is essentially no chance for a cyber security bill that will set a federal standard for security measures. Such legislation has been tried several times before, and the fundamental fact remains that the Senate is still divided between pro regulation and pro positive incentive factions. Given the rules of that Chamber, there is little chance that a bill establishing a baseline for security measures will pass anytime soon. Expect instead "small ball", whereby smaller bills with limited purpose and effect will be advanced, perhaps even passed into law.
2) The rhetoric against foreign governments conducting cyber-attacks will heat up: Members in the House and Senate have not historically been shy about pointing fingers at foreign countries that conduct cyber-attacks. However, the intensity of those attacks will likely rise in the new Congress. This is for a variety of reasons, starting with the fact that you now have a crop of younger, technologically sophisticated Congressional freshmen. There will be owners of cloud computing companies, military veterans, and former undercover officers in the Republican ranks now. They and others grasp the fact that other countries are plundering our national treasure through digital means, and more needs to be done to stop that behavior. Pointed floor speeches, demands to Cabinet Secretaries, and even punitive language tacked on to "must pass" legislation should be coming our way soon.
3) Executive policy will roll along, albeit with slightly more input from Congress: President Obama has made it clear that cyber security is a top priority in the Executive branch. His Executive Order 13636 resulted in the creation of a cyber "framework" as well as a reexamination of federal procurement policy. A more recent directive is pushing the Federal government to only use payment cards with "chip and pin" technology. This trend will not slow down at all. Numerous Federal agencies are increasing demands on their contractors to do more to protect their own systems as well as the ones they service on behalf of the government, and the consequences for failing to do so will be increasingly severe. Congress may push back at times if there is a sense of "overreach", but in reality the President will likely push ahead on increasing cyber security via policy decisions.
4) The privacy versus security debate will live on: The Senate in particular lost some very staunch privacy advocates, chief among them Colorado Senator Mark Udall. Despite these losses, there are many forceful privacy advocates remaining in both legislative chambers, and they will not go quietly into the night. Mr. Snowden is still roaming free, and more revelations from him should be expected in the coming years. The net result of that will be continued battles over whether the Federal government is infringing upon the privacy rights of Americans as it monitors electronic communications. Of course, lost in that debate will be the subtle but critical point that when we are talking about cyber security, monitoring for malware really doesn't raise privacy issues. That's a shame, because the government itself needs to do more to detect, deter, and defeat cyber-attacks. Right now it isn't doing enough, and for sure the private sector is outgunned and outmanned.
5) All bets are off if a serious attack happens: We have had about as many serious data breaches as one could imagine in the past few years. It seems as if a majority of the population has had its credit card or personal information stolen at some point. Yet this has been met with a collective yawn in terms of actual legislation out of Congress. Sure there have been hearings and the verbal flaying of executives, but there is nary a sign of a universal data breach legislation on the horizon. All bets are off, however, if the country suffers a real and serious cyber-attack, I'm talking about financial markets being knocked offline, utilities going out, or a major business (or businesses) going under as a result of a cyber-attack. Should that happen - lookout. Congress will respond fast, and fast is not necessarily a good thing. Hurried legislation is often riddled with holes, and I would not expect a cyber security bill expedited into law as a result of a massive cyber-attack to be any different.
At the end of the day, one thing is absolutely sure - the cyber problem will not go away. So it will always be on the Congressional agenda in some fashion, with the only question being how high it rises.

Why Diversity Is Much More Than Harmonyreddit
In talking about social diversity, it is hard to get away from its two unambitious cousins: harmony and tolerance. Both are good. But neither is good enough.
What we really need is literacy in how to conduct 'constructive conflict' and a bias towards proactively seeking out diversity.
When I sought to create a centre for "constructive conflict and diversity" earlier this year, I was asked the following questions: Is diversity just a race-and-gender thing? Isn't harmony better than diversity? Can conflict ever be constructive?
Is diversity just a race-and-gender thing?
Race, gender and other broad bucketing of humanity provide us with visual shorthands. The headcount of 'ethnic' parliamentarians or female senior executives in a company is a numerical measure for diversity. It is a quantitative proxy - often approached through quotas - that can be tracked over time to measure 'growth' in diversity.
However, proxies and shorthands should not obscure the real goal which is plurality of perspectives and abilities at the level of the individual.
If a member of the minority has to be 'homogenized' in order to enter a community, that community does not become any more diverse. Diversity is a virtue in any ecosystem - whether a team, company or country. Having lived most of my adult life 'as a minority', this is personal for me. Inclusion and a celebration of differences is something that I almost take for granted -  whether in my workplace or the immediate society that I live in.
Isn't harmony better than diversity?
Diversity is valuable in fortifying the resilience of a system only if there is true diversification of style, background and approach. If a state of harmony is achieved through the suppression of differences and with a polite, superficial tolerance of each other, it defeats the purpose. Not only that, it potentially masks a build up of tension that might boil over precisely when cohesion is required.
Can conflict ever be constructive?
In a world of differences and in a world with limited resources, conflict is inevitable. What is not inevitable however, is (a) for every conflict to degenerate into an absolute imposition of one view over another and (b) for differences about issues to degenerate into attacks on integrity or identity. As is evident from the comment section of internet posts, arguments become personal in two iterations or less!
If you disagree with me, I will question your motivations instead of trying to understand your reasoning. If you disagree with me on any one issue, I will make sweeping judgements about your loyalty. In fact, I will make it binary - you're either with me or against me. If you disagree with me on one issue, I will disagree with you on another issue, just to retaliate.
We find it difficult to compartmentalize topics of conflict or to isolate the topic from the person or her 'grouping'. This makes us susceptible to instigation - a fact exploited by politicians the world over.
The conduct of constructive conflict can be an acquired skill. It is possible to immunize ourselves from the most incendiary and viral forms of conflict. It is possible to train ourselves to seek opportunity in conflict and make ourselves more diversity-literate.
We need something like a centre for constructive conflict & diversity to help address the emergence of creeping intolerance in previously-tolerant communities. While actual perpetrators of violence are few and far between, it is the indifference of a silent majority that concerns me most. Our attempts at subtle justification, our choice of words, labels and generalizations - sometimes unwittingly - inflict cumulative harm.
So what can be done? Interventions can take the form of early childhood education, active community engagement, group affirmations, awareness campaigns using the arts and comedy, professional training in private and public sectors ... and much more.
All ideas welcome.

Following Jesus and Annoying the One Percentreddit
In the aftermath of the recent elections in which candidates running on a platform that offered a perfunctory hat tip as it hurtled passed the middle class on the way to performing an unctuous curtsey before big money, I was once again struck by how the heavily metered halo of religious light around social issues distracts attention from economic positions, which from a religious standpoint, remain largely indefensible.
After studying the Hebrew prophets or doing a casual reading of the Gospels, it takes exceptional intellectual and theological dexterity to come away thinking that our primary responsibility in civic life is to insulate the “job creators” from the pesky consciences of the weak minded, so they can continue on with their God-given responsibilities of making a crap-ton of money.
Oh, I know. I can hear it already, about how I'm constructing straw man arguments --that no Christian, no matter how conservative politically, would ever choose the rich over the poor. It's just that, you know, God loves rich people too, and they're the ones who insure our freedom by making sure all that nice money trickles down through the hands of the middle class to the poor folks at the bottom of the food chain.
But come on, it's hard to envision the prophet Amos surveying the current political and economic landscape -- with the top one percent owning over fifty percent of the world's wealth , while the bottom fifty percent own less than one percent -- and imagine him saying, “Yay! Just like we planned. God helps those who help themselves … to everybody else's stuff!”
I find it difficult to conceive of a scenario in which Jesus, when presented with the concerns of the uninsured, the underpaid, and those who rely on government services to eat and find shelter, would come away saying, “Yeah, but the Koch brothers clearly get me … you, know that whole first-shall-be-last-and-last-shall-be-first-unfolding-reign-of-God thing. So, suck it up freeloaders.”
(And it's liberals who rely on Scripture's plasticity to advance their agenda?)
Look, if you're in the middle class, and you're interested in giving voice to the concerns of people who do not occupy your socio-economic class, you've got two choices: You can advocate for the rich or for the poor. But if you happen to be Christian, it important to factor Jesus into your answer.
Because Jesus, when faced with the choice between toadying up to the powers that be and hanging out on the wrong side of town, regularly opted to spend time with the folks least likely to burnish his reputation as a serious religious or political player. Indeed, one of the reasons Jesus always seemed to find himself on the bad side of the big shots centered on his deplorable lack of ambition when it came to sucking up to the right people.
So, just because you talk about “Godly” this and “traditional” that, just because you think Christ himself invented phrases like “family values voter” and you play in a Christian Monopoly league, doesn't mean you've pitched your tent in the middle of Jesus-ville. In fact, I'd suggest that anyone who uses the Bible to underwrite a position that regularly, demonstrably, incontestably disadvantages the “least of these,” bears the burden of proof when it comes to operating on the side of the angels.
Here's a handy little guideline:
If you find yourself more worried that a woman on welfare has an iPhone than that a Wall Street hot shot regularly benefits from the system that helps keep her there, maybe the person highest up in your political and theological calculations isn't Jesus.

Why Can t I Get A Job"Why can't I get a job?"
It sounds like such a SIMPLE question! So we search for a simple answer.
• Write the perfect resume.
• "It's a numbers game. Just keep trying."
• Network.
• Get a different skill set.
And it's this simplistic approach to finding work that is at the heart of the problem. Because there IS no one simple answer. There is no lever to pull and the job pops out of the vending machine. Every single job search is different. You could follow every single piece of job search advice ever written or spoken and still not find a job.
Why?
Because job search is not a rational process. We pretend it is. In the name of efficiency and cost savings and sometimes plain old "just not getting it," we both coach and do our own job search as if it was a mathematical formula or a recipe for a nice, warm cup of soup.
Career Development operations--at schools or in business-- often hold tight to the dirty little secret that job search is NOT a rational process. Not letting anyone inside to see how the sausage--or the resumes--are made. Circling the wagons against any kind of new thinking. New thinking like: Now do I get INSIDE the company first, to make sure gatekeepers or gate keeping software doesn't stop me? How do I become part of a community? How do I become an insider?
Dawn got her job by standing in a Starbuck's line. Try finding that piece of advice on a Linked In blog or anywhere else. You won't. Every job search is different.
Dawn had an administrative job at one of the world's largest insurance companies. It took up about half her energy and thought on any given day. She was a go-getter. Wanted more. She had applied for jobs with human resources, but nothing had ever happened. So she started reading about her company. Not just the official stuff. She started reading about insurance. She started reading about "risk." Dawn is a low key, thoughtful young woman of 26. People might even call her shy. So if someone would have told her, "Just network!" she would have cringed, nodded politely and then done nothing.
But the idea, and she loved ideas, of managing risk, came to be something that fascinated her. The word "Geek" did occur to her. But she didn't advertise her interest. What she did was come to understand what an underwriter did. How underwriting really fueled the business. As she thought about risk one day, she told me that she came across a copy of Finding Work When There Are No Jobs because a friend had told her, 'this book is NOTHING like you think it will be.' Dawn opened the book to a random page and was struck by the 5th Principle, "Practicing Stewardship." That principle was all about understanding something larger that yourself. And that's when the bell in her mind started ringing. "Risk" was bigger than she was! Her interest in risk, a personal interest, was exactly what the book meant when it spoke about practicing stewardship.
Dawn told me that the story in Finding Work where the couple is walking to Dairy Queen one night drove her nuts because she couldn't scream at the characters, "Hey! Pay attention! You are MISSING all the people in your lives who can help you get a job!"
But Dawn was still very shy.
Till that one day when she did something totally different than she had ever done in her life. It happened in that Starbuck's line. Dawn had read the story in Finding Work titled "When The Women Took Charge." There was something in the description of that woman that said "Brave" to her. Dawn was in fact standing in that Starbuck's line, thinking about the story of the brave Welsh woman, when she realized that the SVP of Underwriting was standing right behind her.
So Dawn turned around and changed her question. She didn't ask about jobs. She introduced herself and said this, "How do I learn more about underwriting? I've been reading up on managing risk, and I find it interesting. Do you have any advice?"
Six months later, Dawn is finishing up a training program for underwriting. The SVP is her mentor. And in two weeks she will be starting her job as an underwriter.
Thinking differently about finding work. Finding your own path. Not the better resume. The better path.
Your path.
Because maybe "Why can't I get a job?" isn't the question that will help you. Maybe the question is:
"How do I think differently about finding work?"

The Mail Is About To Get SlowerUnions Fight Postal Service Plans To Shutter 82 Facilities, Lower Mail Standards

Letter carrier Sean Bailey moves boxes of mail to his van to begin delivery Monday, Dec. 5, 2011, at a post office in Seattle.

reddit
WASHINGTON -- With the U.S. Postal Service planning to shut down 82 more plants starting in January, postal worker unions and allies in Congress are pushing for a late-game moratorium on closures they say will weaken the agency and further slow down the mail.
The scheduled shutdowns are part of a consolidation plan the agency put in place in 2011 to help staunch its red ink, much of it the result of pre-funding mandates instituted by Congress. The closures go hand-in-hand with the postal service's plan to save money by reducing the service standards for certain mail categories, a strategy that's divided stakeholders in the postal reform debate .
According to the postal service, the plant consolidations would most affect first-class mail. Personal letters, bills and greeting cards that normally reach their destination overnight would take two days after the closures. Priority mail and packages won't be impacted, the agency said.
The upcoming consolidations are the next battleground in a larger debate over how to make the postal service viable in the future. With the agency facing a possible bankruptcy , the postmaster general, Patrick Donahoe, advocated for a number of cuts and reductions that postal unions found counterproductive.
The facility closures and lowered service standards, the unions argue, will ultimately hurt the agency rather than help it, leading to the proverbial "death spiral" as customers find the service slower and less reliable. The unions are gearing up for a round of protests on Friday , with nearly 150 demonstrations scheduled around the country.
"The mail has already been slowed down. We're trying to keep it from being slowed down even more," said Mark Dimondstein, president of the American Postal Workers Union, which represents 200,000 postal workers and retirees. "Two days will become three days and four days. It will be a slowing down of the mail throughout the country."
The postal service has said that it is responding to falling mail volumes -- particularly first-class, which has dropped by 53 percent over the last decade. The closures, it maintains, are necessary for the agency to regain its financial footing.
"The fact is that the US Mail is changing. There are now fewer letters and considerably more packages and the network must reflect that," Sue Brennan, an agency spokeswoman, said in an email. "With major volume decreases in First-Class Mail, the Postal Service has significant excess capacity in its network and cannot sit idly by and do nothing. The Postal Service firmly believes that the operational changes being implemented are necessary."
The postal service closed 141 processing facilities between 2012 and 2013 in the first phase of its consolidation plan. The second phase, originally slated for early 2014, was pushed back to this coming January. According to Brennan, all the consolidations together are expected to save $2.1 billion annually.
The consolidation of plants means that some facilities will lose jobs, while others gain them. An analysis by the publication Government Executive found that the postal service's plan will result in a net loss of 7,320 jobs .
The agency has said it needs to implement such cuts in order to contend with a long-term decline in first-class mail volume, the rising cost of wages and benefits for its workforce, and the funding mandates placed upon it by Congress. In a public letter to customers earlier this year, the postal service said the plant consolidations "will establish the low-cost, technology-centric delivery platform necessary to serve the mailing and shipping industry for decades to come."
Indeed, the agency has lost billions of dollars in recent quarters, and first-class mail has fallen off significantly in the Internet era. But most of the agency's financial losses stem from a requirement passed by Congress in 2006 that the postal service prefund retiree health benefits to the tune of more than $5 billion per year. The postal service is an independent agency that's funded through postage fees rather than taxpayer dollars, but Congress still oversees the agency and would have to legislate any major overhaul.
With mail rebounding during the economic recovery and package delivery growing with e-commerce, the postal service actually turned an operating profit recently when the retiree health costs are set aside. Unions have held up those financial improvements as evidence that service cuts would be damaging.
"With the Postal Service operating at a profit -- about $1.3 billion so far this fiscal year -- degrading service by closing processing plants and slowing the mail makes absolutely no sense," Fredric Rolando, president of the National Association of Letter Carriers, told HuffPost through a spokesman. "It would hurt Americans and their businesses, eliminate overnight mail, cost jobs -- and it would be destructive for USPS as well, because it would drive away mail and revenue."
There are a couple of ways the unions may win a reprieve on the facility closures.
The first would be if Congress includes a delay in a spending bill passed in the lame-duck session. In August, 51 senators sent a letter to leaders of the appropriations committee, urging them to insert such a moratorium into either an omnibus spending bill or a shorter-term continuing resolution. "As the postal network has been weakened, service delivery has suffered," they wrote.
Lawmakers did not put a moratorium into the continuing resolution passed in September, though they'll have to pass another funding bill by the time the current one expires in early December.
A moratorium has the support of most Senate Democrats. But it doesn't have backing from Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.), who chairs the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, which oversees the postal service, and who is one of the most influential voices in the postal reform debate. A Carper spokeswoman told HuffPost that the senator would only support a delay in facility closures as part of a larger postal reform bill -- something that's all but certain not to pass Congress by January.
Without a moratorium from lawmakers, the other hope for the unions is that the postal service itself will decide to postpone the closures like it did last year .
"Congress is not the only way this can be done ... it's also in the hands of postal management," APWU's Dimondstein said. "There's nothing that says the postmaster general has to move forward with any of this."

Tax rates are finally on the rise for the top 1 percent  CBO saysBy Lori Montgomery November 12 Follow @loriamontgomery
The rich are still getting richer, and income inequality is still on the rise. But President Obama appears to have achieved at least one of his goals for the nation's pocketbook: The very richest Americans are finally shelling out a bit more in federal taxes.
According to a new report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the top 1 percent of earners paid an average tax rate of about 33 percent last year -- up sharply from an average of 29 percent in 2011.
The report documents a turning point in federal tax policy -- and not just for wealthy Americans. After falling steadily since the late 1990s, federal tax rates are on the rise for people at all income levels, due primarily to changes in tax law made during the 2012 showdown over the so-called "fiscal cliff."
That deal cancelled much of the massive tax increase that would have occurred had tax cuts enacted under former president George W. Bush been allowed to expire in their entirety. But some taxes went up nonetheless. In the biggest change, the wealthiest households saw the top two rates on income rise from 33 percent and 35 percent to 36 percent and 39.6 percent. Households further down the income spectrum lost an array of smaller tax breaks. Even the very poorest households saw taxes go up: They lost a temporary reduction in the payroll tax enacted at Obama's request in 2010.
Before the fiscal cliff, in 2011, the CBO report says, "average federal tax rates were near their lowest levels since 1979 for households in most of the income groups." The one exception was the top 1 percent. "For that group, the average federal tax rate in 2011 was near its lowest level since the early 1990s."
After the fiscal cliff, in 2013, the CBO projects that the average federal tax rate was higher across the income spectrum. But while 2013 rates "would still be well below the average" paid over the past three and a half decades for the bottom 80 percent of American earners, the rate for the top 1 percent of households "would be well above the average rate over that period."
To calculate tax rates, the CBO looked at "market income" (regular earnings) plus "government transfers" (payments from the federal government, such as unemployment benefits, Social Security and Medicare) to produce a broad measure of household income. CBO then subtracted all forms of federal taxes, including income taxes, excise taxes and corporate taxes. The 2013 estimates were calculated by applying post-fiscal cliff tax laws to 2011 income and tax data.
Overall, the CBO found, average household income totalled $81,000 in 2011, with government transfers adding another $13,000, on average. Taxes subtracted an average of $17,000 per household, producing an average federal tax rate of 17.6 percent.
Neither income nor the tax burden was evenly distributed, however. The richest 20 percent of households received "a little more than half of total before-tax income and paid more than two-thirds of all federal taxes in 2011," the CBO said. "In contrast, households in the [poorest 20 percent of households] received approximately 5 percent of total before-tax income in 2011 and paid less than 1 percent of all federal taxes."
While both the federal tax system and federal transfer payments served to narrow the gap between rich and poor, the CBO found that the transfer payments made a bigger dent in income inequality than taxes did.

Currency trading scam: How it worked
John Waggoner , USA TODAY 6:48 p.m. EST November 12, 2014
Regulators' investigations into giant foreign exchange trading market found traders brazenly exploiting the market's weaknesses.

In the multitrillion-dollar currency market, just a fraction of a penny difference between two currencies can mean hundreds of thousands of dollars in profit — and bank currency traders were brazen exploiting the system's weaknesses.
The currency market trades about $5 trillion each day — more than 100 times more than the New York Stock exchange's $49 billion in daily trades. Inside this sprawling market, participants can make bets on the direction of one currency against another, and reap millions from relatively small fluctuations.
Banks and other investors need to value their currency holdings daily, and to do so, they rely on a daily fixing price. Many traders place their bets at the fixing price; for others, the fixing price determines their profit or loss.
Banks fined $4.3B in foreign exchange probe
One daily fixing price is the World Markets/Reuters fix, which measures the British pound against the dollar at 4 p.m. U.K. time. Another is the European Central Bank fix, which measures the euro against other currencies, typically at around 1:15 p.m. U.K. time. In both cases, the fixing price is determined by market action at the time of the fix.
According to the regulators' settlements with six banks Wednesday, traders would manipulate the fixing price, often seconds before the fix, by making large purchases or sales, pushing prices up or down. These massive buy and sell orders would help the companies lock in gains, often at the expense of their customers.
Forex traders plotted strategy in secret chats
Traders used online chat rooms, both to plan their moves and to gloat afterward.
Most people's exposure to the currency market is when they travel. The rogue traders' schemes would have a very small impact on what you get when you buy or sell currency at the airport.
But the vast majority of currency exchanges involve the U.S. dollar. Many pension plans and mutual funds use the currency market to reduce their exposure to foreign exchange effects. A fund manager might like the prospects for a German pharmaceutical company but use the currency market to hedge against the risk that the euro will fall against the dollar.
Similarly, a U.S. company could have a contract with an English client. To guard against the value of the pound falling, the company could use the forex market to hedge against currency risk.
"The setting of a benchmark rate is not simply another opportunity for banks to earn a profit," Aitan Goelman, the CFTC's Director of Enforcement, said in a statement. "Countless individuals and companies around the world rely on these rates to settle financial contracts, and this reliance is premised on faith in the fundamental integrity of these benchmarks. The market only works if people have confidence that the process of setting these benchmarks is fair, not corrupted by manipulation by some of the biggest banks in the world."

What would it look like if Yahoo and AOL mergedBy Hayley Tsukayama November 12 Follow @htsuka
A Yahoo! banner hangs above employees during a training class Photographer: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg
Two shareholders from Yahoo reportedly met with AOL chief executive Tim Armstrong to plead with him to explore a merger. AOL and Yahoo both declined to comment on the report, but it's hard not to wonder: what would a combined AOL and Yahoo actually look like?
It's easy to think of any such union as being merely a partnership between two formerly great tech companies on the decline. But there's been a lot of chatter in the past about the possibility of an AOL and Yahoo merger because -- at least on paper -- the companies look as if they have the complementing qualities to form an online advertising powerhouse.
The two have followed similar strategies, after all. Both have looked to the world of content production to woo people back to their sites and burnish their brands -- as a play to get higher ad revenue.
A key tentpole of Yahoo's gameplan has been to mix its advertising chops with the production of high-quality news content. Since chief executive Marissa Mayer took over, the company has hired the likes of  Katie Couric, David Isikoff and David Pogue to build stable of journalistic talent; it also acquired the blogging platform Tumblr for $1 billion. And AOL, of course, made the high-profile acquisition of the Huffington Post.
As big as those buys have been, however, both companies face a big challenge in making significant inroads in online advertising. Google and Facebook have been dominating the online ad business for years. Even with their combined powers, Yahoo and AOL would not get anywhere near the ad revenue generated by either leading tech firm.
If AOL and Yahoo merged, its digital ad business would still would still be smaller than Facebook's pic.twitter.com/cEpTLLhw05
— BI Intelligence (@BIIntelligence) September 26, 2014
Still, many analysts and investors have noted that a combined AOL and Yahoo would have enough of a presence to lock a third-place spot in the race for ad revenue. And both have the experience, as well as a demonstrated willingness to experiment. The result would be a massive online advertising network that analysts say could have a chance at chasing Facebook for the number-two spot -- if Yahoo and AOL could navigate the tricky process of merging two very established companies.
In a note sent to investors when merger calls flared up late last month, Pivotal Research Group analyst Brian Wieser said that there is "significant industrial logic" behind a merger, though it's unclear whether Armstrong or Mayer would be in charge of leading a new company.
"AOL is the one which made the right calls in terms of how to evolve a legacy portal/ad network business into one positioned to maintain relevance with the advertising community," he wrote. "However, Yahoo has had greater capital resources, limiting the potential for AOL to pursue anything directly, and Yahoo may have felt their approach to the business was more appropriate."
Wieser suggested that Yahoo could sell itself to AOL -- a proposition that activist investor group Starboard suggested in September -- would go a long way to solve both company's problems and plant the seeds of the ad behemoth investors want to see.

Today s Aboriginal Business Is More Than Just a Gas Stationreddit
Hundreds of enterprise-minded Indigenous people from all over the world recently converged in Guatemala City, Guatemala for the 5th Annual World Indigenous Business Forum (WIBF). The WIBF forum is an initiative of the Indigenous Leadership Development Institute Inc. in Winnipeg, Manitoba.
The non-profit organization was established to build leadership capacity in Indigenous people.  Run by Indigenous people and directed by a volunteer board reflecting the diversity of the Indigenous community the WIBF is a perfect catalyst to new partnership potentials and international relationship building.
Deals in resource industries world-wide signal a new and exciting chapter in Indigenous business potential. Aboriginal business is looking beyond Canada to the rest of the world as they look to Indigenous communities to develop business in the natural resource sector.  Chinese companies have been buying Canadian assets in partnership with First Nations opening the door to a larger conversation involving many levels of government at home and abroad.
Aboriginal people have largely been excluded from Canada's business community since the fur trade. So it's that much more incredible to see the re-birth of our peoples' entrepreneurial spirit in the past quarter century. Not only are our aboriginal businesses expected to contribute $13 Billion to Canada's GDP by 2016, but we see business looking beyond the Canadian borders to expand their growing business sphere.
Today indigenous business is more than just a local gas station. It is regional, national and international in scope. Indigenous peoples from around the world are organizing themselves to take advantage of growing global markets.
Our business acumen continues to grow and sharpen as can be depicted by recent international business partnerships. Direct foreign investment in our First Nation communities to develop Canada's natural resources are raising eyebrows among domestic companies and governments.
One such deal involved Frog Lake Energy Resources Corp. (FLERC) wholly owned by Frog Lake First Nation (FLFN) in Alberta. It is there intent to create wealth for their First Nation from resources both on the FLFN reserve and off the reserve. Their business vision opened the door of opportunity to a deal between  FLERC and the China's Sichuan Ruifeng Investment Management Co. Ltd., cementing a goal of turning about three million barrels of proved plus probable oil reserves on their First Nation into a 100,000 barrel per day (bpd) operation.
When looking to the resource sector it's not all about conventional resources that bring to mind oil and gas, forestry or mining. Aria Foods is a Maori cooperative in New Zealand where members work together to source, distribute, market and sell their products directly from the grower to the consumer emphasizing the opportunity that Indigenous resources present around the world.
Director Graeme Everton feels strongly that indigenous peoples must act with the integrity needed to preserve culture and tradition while taking the middle man out of the way on the path to their products connecting with foreign markets.
Two years ago he successfully inked a deal with Kitigan Zibi First Nation in Quebec to market their traditional Awazibi Pure Maple Syrup brand in New Zealand. Working directly with Kitigan Zibi Chief Whiteduck they successfully took a unique natural resource and opened a new market with world potential.
WIBF forum launched in 2010 is truly creating and promoting unique learning and networking experiences for global Indigenous business, corporations, leaders and youth. Having the opportunity for International speakers from various sectors of the economy share their thoughts on innovation, creativity and vision in Indigenous communities world-wide provided a valuable business platform that the mainstream business world takes for granted.
Canada's own Nick Jardine the Principal Owner of Urban Handyman a full-scale renovation/build company he formed in 2009 addressed the VIP evening reception at the forum on October 30.  Mr. Jardine was just one of the many voices who gathered to share their stories of business challenge and success.
The WIBF offered participants an opportunity to come together to share experiences and insights to raise the level of success for Indigenous global communities.
While some people may be born to leadership, most only acquire over time the experience, education, skills and qualities characteristic of strong community business leaders. As a traditional hunter and fisher I fully understand the importance of filling my freezer for the coming winter and that vital link to my culture through the lens of our own deeply personal business model for success. That said I am also living in the contemporary world as the CEO of the Canadian Council for Aboriginal Business (CCAB) where building bridges to new business models for our people has the potential to open an international business dialogue.
The World Indigenous Business forum is the direct result of the progress Aboriginal and Indigenous business has made in the last generation and truly embodies an optimism that will drive business certainty on the road to prosperity for Indigenous peoples world-wide.
The 2015 World Indigenous Business Forum takes place in O'ahu, Hawaii fittingly known as the gathering place.

Cooking oil imports hit a record in 2013-14Cooking oil imports hit a record in 2013-14
Reuters

NEW DELHI, Nov 13:  
India's cooking oil imports hit a record high in 2013-14 due to a surge in overseas purchases of soy and sunflower oils, a trade body said on Thursday, adding that low global prices could spur even higher imports in the current year.
Record imports by the world's top buyer could provide some support to global prices. Malaysian palm oil futures, the regional benchmark, have fallen nearly 17 per cent in 2014 because of high unsold stocks in Southeast Asian countries, including Indonesia, the world's top producer.
India mainly buys palm oil from Indonesia and Malaysia, plus smaller quantities of soyoil from Brazil and Argentina. The South Asian country also buys small amounts of sunflower oil from Ukraine and Russia.
Imports of all cooking oils rose to 11.62 million tonnes in the year that ended in October from 10.38 million a year earlier, the Solvent Extractors' Association (SEA) said on Thursday.
That 12 per cent increase was mainly due to a surge in imports of soy and sunflower oil at the expense of palm oil, imports of which fell for the first time in four years.
"India has imported the highest quantity of soybean and sunflower due to attractive prices," said B.V. Mehta, SEA executive director.
"We will have one more year of record imports if the current trend continues," Mehta said. "Low global prices with an increasing population promise record import levels."
Soyoil imports rose 79 per cent to around 2 million tonnes in 2013/14, while sunflower oil imports rose by more than half to 1.5 million tonnes.
Imports of palm oil fell to 7.96 million tonnes, down 4 per cent from the previous year.
TAX CLAMOUR
The rise in imports has led to calls by local producers for an increase in import taxes to stem the tide.
India's food minister has favoured raising taxes on cooking oils to help refiners and oilseed growers.
On Thursday, imported palm oil was quoted at $690-$715 a tonne on India's west coast, while soyoil and sunflower was quoted at $830 and $905 a tonne respectively.
Imported palm oil was cheaper by $150-$200 a tonne than a year ago, while soyoil was down $165-$175 and sunflower oil $100 a tonne, traders said.

Final norms on small banks by month-end: Raghuram RajanNorms for payment, small banks by month-end
Reuters
Idea is to facilitate lending to weaker sections, SMEs: Rajan
MUMBAI, Nov 13:  
Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan said it is not necessary that people open accounts only with banks, they can do so by tapping a variety of other avenues too.
He pointed out that the proposed guidelines for small finance banks and payments banks will offer such avenues.
“Account need not be only at the bank. In the weeks to come we will put out guidelines for new entities called payment banks, the basic intent of this exercise will be to offer accounts to the excluded,” Rajan added.
We visualise, Rajan said, mobile companies, firms with a large rural presence, and the postal department applying for payment bank licences.
Can take deposits
The RBI Governor also said that with the idea to facilitate small lending — to underserved people, micro, small and even medium enterprises — the RBI will come out with guidelines for small finance banks by the month-end.
Explaining the scope of small finance banks, Rajan said, such banks will be allowed to take deposits.
“This licence will also offer an avenue for successful microfinance institutions to migrate towards a banking licence without abandoning the core business of working with the small and the excluded.
“I am hopeful that we will issue the call for applications for both small finance banks and payments banks,” he added.
The guidelines are currently with the Government for comments.
Cash management
Rajan said the RBI is thinking of ways to modernise the existing cash management system.
The modernised system, he said, will also interact with the last mile usage of cash. He said while serving the bottom of the pyramid, entities must not look at more than reasonable profits.
He made this observation in the context of a few ideas which have propagated that there is “fortune” to be made by servicing those at the bottom of the pyramid.

BJP s claims of running clean government are false  alleges Shiv SenaOpposition making issue out of non-issue on Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti remarks: Minister
A day after the Devendra Fadnavis led government won the floor test by a voice vote, its former ally Shiv Sena today accused the Maharashtra government of violating constitutional provisions by proving its majority amid high chaos and strangulating age-old traditions of the state.
The Sena also said termed the BJP’s claim of running a clean government as “false”.
“The BJP had promised clean governance when they came to power. Forgetting all their promises made to the people, they (the BJP) have violated the constitutional provisions while seeking a trust vote. This has proved that all the claims of running a clean government were false,” Sena said in an editorial in its mouthpiece ‘Saamana’.
It added that by violating the norms of the House and ignoring the traditions, they have “cheated” the people of the state, for which they will not be forgiven.
“Will people henceforth trust a party that has violated all the norms and strangulated the age-old traditions of the state only to win a trust vote? You have broken the trust of people who gave you the largest mandate for which you will never be forgiven,” it said.
“If you were so confident of getting the majority, you could have ceded to the opposition parties demand of division of votes. You have to answer the people for running the government without winning the trust vote,” it said.
The Sena said that though the BJP has succeeded in winning the motion amid the chaos prevalent inside the house, but the opposition parties will not accept this majority, unless proven constitutionally on the floor of the house.
As soon as speaker Haribhau Bagde declared the one line motion by BJP’s Ashish Shelar seeking confidence as passed on the floor of the house, utter chaos broke out inside and outside the Assembly.
The Speaker suspended five Congress MLAs for two years, after accusing them of pushing and injuring Governor Rao.
Congress called the Speaker’s ruling “a murder of democracy”, while Sena termed the day as a “black day” for Maharashtra.

Vishal Sikka takes IT services industry to task over low-cost model  quick fixesDelhi cab rape case: Uber cab driver Shiv Kumar Yadav arrested in Mathura
Infosys CEO Vishal Sikka on Wednesday described the current state of the IT services industry — a business model of lower costs — as a “depressing reality” thought he felt this was also an opportunity to think of doing something new.
Delivering the keynote address through videoconferencing at the inaugural CeBIT India fair here on Wednesday, Sikka said, “As I speak to you, it is my 100th day as the CEO of Infosys. I was not deeply familiar with the services industry until recently. As I had thought about the opportunities in front of us and the current state of Infosys, I see a tale of two cities — on the one side, we have a great opportunity in front of us to help accelerate the reshaping of world with software. But at the same time, I also see the reality that we are currently in — that is a somewhat depressing reality.”
The Indian IT and BPO services industry has recorded exports of $86 billion for FY14, and this is projected to touch $100 billion in FY15. The dominant business model is the principle of being faster, cheaper and better.
Sikka, who is the first non-founder to head India’s second largest IT services exporter and comes with deep technology expertise, has been a strong votary of change in the current thought process.
“I find all of us in the industry on a downward spiral, it is like a treadmill of increasingly lower cost, hiring people faster and faster from more and more mediocre places, training people less and less, putting them into job faster and faster. I think that is a wrong direction. I think there is a better direction. I think we can do better than that,” he said.
Infosys has under Sikka started numerous initiatives to usher in a new business model that includes concepts such as design thinking, continuous learning, automation and artificial intelligence. The IT major is also aligning more closely with the start-up community and giving greater thrust to its product portfolio.
Sikka also called for greater alignment with clients to be strategically relevant for them. “We can work with our clients on the challenges that they face, not just on lowering costs. Labour arbitrage and staff augmentation are depressing ideas. We can be better partners on the basis of innovation, intelligence, automation and techniques.”

IIP surprises on the upside  CPI trajectory as expected: SBIFIPB role shrinks amid easier FDI flows
The growth in Index of Industrial Production (IIP) for September at 2.5% was a positive surprise (SBI at 0.3%), even as CPI numbers for Oct’14 at 5.52% was largely in consonance with market expectations (SBI at 5.45%). Read Full Report: SBI Ecowrap
The bad news is that the growth in IIP may not be sustained, while the good news is that disinflationary trends seem to be well-entrenched. Our analysis shows that since Jan’14, the decline in CPI has been broad-based with food and service contributing to 79% and the rest (21%) through the benefits of benign global commodity prices.
Additionally, real rural wages that are supposed to have a direct causation with food prices have declined in current fiscal. The IIP growth pangs seem to suggest that while the infrastructure sectors are showing incipient signs of revival, the export-intensive sectors are showing clear signals of losing stem.
Consumer durables continue to show a deceleration. Even though inflation numbers are supposed to be below 7% in Mar’15, we continue to maintain that RBI will prefer to adopt a wait and watch approach before cutting rates.
In a developing country like India, we believe that information frictions typically result in household expectations of the price level being more sensitive to inflationary news than disinflationary news.
The intuition is that households respond more strongly to bad news and hence this asymmetry exists in survey data of household inflation expectations. Furthermore, disinflationary signals take longer to be incorporated into household beliefs and therefore demand-driven recessions are longer-lived than demand-driven booms, as is being currently witnessed.
Given this fact, the clamor for rate cut chorus will get louder with each passing day we maintain that RBI may go for the jugular in a decisive manner (50 basis point or so), but only after it is convinced that CPI downward trajectory is sustained and inflationary expectations are anchored decisively lower.
This may happen materially only in FY16. However, in an inflation targeting framework, with the Government having the goal independence (and RBI: instrument independence) is likely to set a CPI target more than 4% and this may then hasten the RBI action.

Nawaz Sharif s daughter Maryam resigns from Rs 100 bn PM loan schemeIndian rupee to edge higher tracking Asian pairs; flows key
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s daughter Maryam Nawaz resigned from the post of chairperson of the multi-billion Prime Minister Youth Loan Programme on the order of a Pakistani court.
The Lahore High Court had instructed the federal government to replace Maryam as she has “no experience to the head Rs 100 billion programme”.
Maryam controlled the fund for giving soft business loans to the youth announced by Prime Minister Sharif.
“I had no pressure to resign. An able person should be appointed new chairperson of the Youth Loan Programme,” Maryam said in a statement after tendering resignation.
She said she had not done anything in violation of merit in the disbursement of the funds.
Petitioner, Zubair Niazi, a local leader of Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, argued in the court that the appointment of Maryam was a case of “sheer nepotism.”
He said the appointment had been made in violation of law and several judgments passed by the Supreme Court.
He said neither a public notice nor an advertisement was issued before the appointment. LHC Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah said the court was showing grace by giving a chance to the government to change the chairperson in a lawful and transparent manner.
During the hearing, deputy attorney general Amir Rehman presented academic credentials of Maryam, but withdrew them after failing to answer a query whether the Ph.D. degree was actual or honorary. “Perhaps it honorary”, Rehman said.
The judge adjourned the hearing till Friday and directed Rehman to come up with a lawful and transparent mechanism for the new appointment along with academic credentials of Maryam.
“Seeing the mood of the court the government has decided to remove her,” a senior PML-N leader said.
“The prime minister may not take chances to give her any other important slot,” he said.

Shell was warned that a pipelineShell 'warned Nigeria pipeline could leak before spills'
By Howard Mustoe Business reporter
Shell and the Bodo community disagree on the amount of damage from the spills
Threat of hunger in oil-rich Niger Delta
Oil firm Royal Dutch Shell was told a pipeline had reached the end of its life years before it spilled up to 500,000 barrels of oil, according to court documents seen by the BBC.
Two spills in 2008 affected about 35 sq miles (90 sq km) in southern Nigeria, according to a group suing Shell.
The area included sensitive mangroves.
Shell "dismisses the suggestion that it has knowingly continued to use a pipeline that is not safe to operate," it told the BBC.
The emails, letters and internal reports submitted to a court in London show that senior Shell employees were concerned before the spill that Shell's pipelines in the area had reached the end of their lives and needed replacing to avoid danger to lives, the environment and the economy.
Water
The spills took place in Bodo, a town in the Ogoniland region, where people interviewed for an Amnesty International report into the effects of the incident reported headaches and eyesight problems.
Following the spills, the price of fish, a local staple food, rose as much as tenfold, according to Amnesty. People who worked in fishing had to find jobs in other industries which proved more difficult to find.
Oil spills in the Ogoniland region have also contaminated local drinking water sources, seeping into groundwater, according to a report from the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). Toxins found by UNEP in the wider Ogoniland area's drinking water include benzene , which is thought to cause cancer.
The two spills came from the same pipe on the Trans Niger Pipeline, operated by Shell, which takes oil from its fields to the export terminal at Bonny on the coast. It carries about 180,000 barrels of oil per day. The firm disputes the size of the spills and says much of the oil was spilt as a result of thefts and sabotage.
In September 2006 - two years before the spills - a letter from Basil Omiyi, managing director of Shell's Nigeria business, SPDC, to the governor of Rivers State said that the pipeline was of "immediate and utmost concern".
Shell had not inspected the pipeline for several years due to difficulties in accessing it, he said.
"There is a risk and likelihood of rupture on this pipeline at any time, which if it happens, could have serious consequences for the safety of life, the environment and the nation's economy."
Shell in Nigeria
• Shell stopped drilling oil in Ogoniland, which includes Bodo, in 1993 after growing unrest in the area.
• In 2009 Shell paid $15.5m in an out-of-court settlement in a case accusing it of complicity in human rights abuses in Nigeria. It was brought by relatives of nine anti-oil campaigners, including author Ken Saro-Wiwa, who were hanged in 1995 by Nigeria's then military rulers. Shell denied any wrongdoing and said the payment was part of a "process of reconciliation"
• In 2013, Shell produced 265,000 barrels of oil per day from Nigeria, which is 8.3% of the 3.2m barrels of oil per day it had for sale from its drilling business.
• The area is also one of the most cost-effective for Shell. The cost of producing a barrel of oil in Africa last year was $14.43. Only Asia and Oceania were cheaper. In Europe and the USA, the cost was $17.66 and $21.57
• Shell told its investors in its 2013 annual report of the "disputes" in Nigeria, where it "believes that the outcomes of these matters will ultimately be resolved in a manner favourable to Shell" albeit with the caveat "no assurance can be provided"
A study conducted in 2000 by Shell's Nigeria business and Shell Global Solutions International, the oil giant's consulting business, found "the remaining life of most of the SPDC oil trunklines is more or less non-existent or short, while some sections contain major risk and hazard."
An internal Shell email in December 2009, after the spills, said the firm was "corporately exposed as the pipelines in Ogoniland have not been maintained properly or integrity assessed for over 15 years."
"The decision by Shell to continue pumping oil through pipelines which they knew were not fit for purpose is quite shocking," said Martyn Day, a senior partner at Leigh Day, the lawyers representing the community filing the claim.
"The result was an environmental catastrophe for the Bodo Community and the biggest loss of mangrove habitat in the history of oil spills.  The 40,000 residents of the Bodo Community primarily relied on fishing and their way of life and source of livelihoods has been destroyed for years to come," said Mr Day.
Compensation
Shell, in documents submitted in its defence, admits its pipeline failed due to a faulty weld, but disputes the volume of spilled oil. It says much of the damage caused to the area comes from other spills, including damage from sabotage and attempts at theft.
The Bodo community voted to reject a previous settlement offer from Shell
Shell will pay "just and reasonable" compensation to those affected, it says.
Shell told the BBC: "SPDC ceased operations in Ogoniland in 1993 following a rise in violence, threats to staff and attacks on facilities. Levels of violence and criminality have remained high over the following 21 years, constraining SPDC's ability to access the area.
"The condition of the pipeline is regularly assessed.
"Also, SPDC has always made use of the opportunity presented during sabotage [and] crude theft point leak repairs to carry out on-the-spot coating and internal checks to confirm the integrity of the pipeline and coating."
The claimants, who are suing for a clean-up plus damages, say the illegal refining only started in earnest after the spills, which killed the fish they rely on for food and their livelihoods.
The area's humidity corrodes pipelines and its many rivers and lowlands means fixing a leak often necessitates wading through swamps, carrying floating booms and other equipment, which is slow work, according to one former Shell employee with whom the BBC spoke.
International industry rules call for operators to consider tools to detect corrosion in pipelines, leak detection equipment and so-called cathodic protection in environments where corrosion is a risk. This is where a structure, such as a pipeline, is protected from corrosion by an electric current.
There are no leak detection systems or flow rate meters on the pipeline, say the members of the community - systems which are industry standard in the West.
Shell says amateur refiners are responsible for some of the damage
Shell was unable to use its other leak detection systems such as flow monitoring or acoustic sensors because they were sabotaged or stolen and it was "not reasonable to keep replacing such equipment," it said.
'Survival'
The claimants say the pipelines were not checked regularly for corrosion or failing welding by robots known in the industry as intelligent pipeline inspection gadgets, or PIGs . In the UK, pipelines would be inspected in this way every five years or so, according to industry experts.
Shell says it employed contractors to guard and monitor the pipeline and arranged for inspections from the air. The claimants say a lack of boats and too few people to adequately patrol made their job "inadequate".
The claimants say Shell didn't want to shut down the pipes that form the Trans Niger Pipeline because of the company's reliance on them, citing an internal Shell email which says "sustenance/stability via the TNP [pipeline] is key for our survival".
"From all we have seen in pursuing the Bodo claims, Shell has demonstrated a very worrying lack of care when it comes to the operation of their pipelines in the Niger Delta," said Mr Day, the community's lawyer.
Shell said: "We are in the process of preparing for a trial in May 2015 regarding the Bodo operational spills, at which time internal documents produced by SPDC relating to the Trans Niger Pipeline (TNP) will be set in their proper context for review by the court."

Unitech Shares Slump 7% on Q2 Loss
NDTV | Updated On: November 13, 2014 09:50 (IST)
Nikkei Share Average Opens 0.47% Higher
Unitech shares fell nearly 7 per cent on Thursday after the realty developer reported a loss of Rs 14.7 crore in the September quarter. In the year ago period, Unitech had reported a profit of Rs 25.6 crore, while its profit stood at Rs 5.6 crore in the June quarter.
Net sales also fell nearly 36 per cent year-on-year to Rs 384 crore as compared to Rs 596 crore as property sales slowed down.
India's realty sector is facing a massive slowdown as high interest rates have impacted demand. Developers have refused to cut prices, leading to rising inventory and debt.
Like many other realty companies, Gurgaon-based Unitech is struggling under high debt. Its net debt stood at Rs 5,900 crore as on June 30.
The company had earlier said it will sell non-core land parcels to reduce debt by 15-20 per cent and improve cash-flows for faster execution of ongoing projects. ( Read )
Earlier this month, the company said it has reached a deal to sell its stakes in six IT-Special Economic Zone (SEZ) projects in India to Canada's Brookfield Asset Management for 188.9 million pounds (about Rs. 1,850 crore). ( Read the full story here )
As of 09.40 a.m., Unitech traded 5.5 per cent lower at Rs 19.90 and underperformed the broader realty sub-index on the BSE. It was the most traded stock (volume wise) on the BSE 500 index.

Nikkei Share Average Opens 0.47% Higher
Shares in state-run oil marketing company Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL) fell over 3 per cent to a day low of Rs 740.15 on Thursday as its net profit for the July-September quarter fell 50 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y) to Rs 464 crore on account of lower refining margins and inventory loss due to falling international oil prices.
Total revenue of the company increased marginally to Rs 62,025 crore against Rs 61,785 crore y-o-y.
BPCL's gross refining margins (profit on turning every barrel of crude oil into product) fell to $2.36 a barrel against $4.38 a barrel reported in the same period last fiscal.
Gross profit (EBITDA) of the company declined 36 per cent y-o-y to Rs 1,070 crore.
BPCL's profit was also impacted by an inventory loss of Rs 270 crore in Q2 on account of falling international crude prices.
BPCL shares have jumped over 20 per cent in last three months against 7 per cent gain in Nifty on expectations of higher profit on account of falling international oil prices and diesel decontrol which will reduce its under-recoveries.
Global brokerage CLSA has downgraded the stock to underperform with a target price of Rs 800 per share after its Q2 results. CLSA says the stock is ignoring risk of upcoming competition. Oil marketing companies are no more a play on falling crude prices, adds CLSA.
BPCL shares ended 5.23 per cent lower Rs 725.30 apiece, underperforming the Nifty which closed with 0.3 per cent loss on Thursday .

Senate poised to vote on USA Freedom ActBy Ellen Nakashima November 12 Follow @nakashimae
The Senate is poised to vote as early as next week on the USA Freedom Act , legislation that would end the National Security Agency’s bulk collection of records about Americans’ phone calls.
If passed, it may be voted on by the House and signed into law by year’s end, fulfilling one of President Obama’s major asks of Congress: that it adopt such legislation.
Passage would also clear the decks for incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who has an ambitious legislative agenda, including trade, taxes and building the long-delayed Keystone XL pipeline.
The bill, after months of tense negotiations, won the support of the intelligence community and civil liberties organizations — a rare consensus by groups that are normally at odds with one another.
Introduced in July, it stalled for months as advocates, including Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), the Judiciary Committee chairman, sought to overcome concerns that the bill either hindered the intelligence community or did not provide adequate privacy protections.
If it becomes law, the bill would close a chapter in a vigorous, year-and-a-half-long debate over how far the government should go in gathering data on Americans to thwart terrorism and obtain foreign intelligence.
That debate began in June 2013, following a leak of a classified court order to The Guardian newspaper, which revealed that the NSA had been secretly collecting millions of Americans’ call detail records each day from U.S. phone companies for counterterrorism purposes. The agency gathers times, dates and durations of calls, but not their content.
The story was followed by a series of more disclosures about NSA surveillance activities, which were based on documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.
Snowden, who is living under temporary asylum in Moscow, said he shared the classified material with journalists, including at The Washington Post, to shine light on what he considered to be a system of mass surveillance that was growing unchecked.
“The American people are wondering whether Congress can get anything done,” Leahy said Wednesday, after Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) filed a procedural motion for the Senate to consider the bill. “The answer is yes. Congress can and should take up and pass the bipartisan USA Freedom Act, without delay.”
The bill requires the government to limit the scope of its data collection, and specifies that the government may not gather in bulk data relating to a particular phone or Internet company or to a broad geographic region, such as a city or an area designated by a zip code or area code.
It would end the current program in which the NSA gathers and stores the records of millions of Americans for five years. Instead the bill requires that the data be held by the phone companies.
It authorizes the use of Section 215 of the Patriot Act to obtain two “hops” of call detail records — or records of phone calls made by the people who were called by the target — as long as the government has reasonable, articulable suspicion that the target number belongs to a terrorist.
The bill also requires the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, in consultation with the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, to appoint a panel of special advocates to advance legal positions in support of privacy.

There s been a lot of dataChina's economy shows more signs of weakness
Government data on Thursday showed more signs of cooling in the world's second largest economy
China and S Korea to sign trade deal
A slew of economic data out of China, which came in below forecasts on Thursday, has highlighted the continuing downward pressure facing the Asian giant.
China's industrial output rose 7.7% in October from a year ago, while retail sales grew 11.5% in the same period.
Economists were expecting growth of 8% and 11.6% respectively.
Another important economic indicator - fixed asset investment - fell to 15.9% in October from 16.1% in September.
This, added to the fact that China's growth slowed to a more than five-year low in the third quarter from a year earlier, is building the case for more stimulus from the government to prevent a even sharper slowdown.
"Chinese core October data came in uniformly softer and below consensus. Industrial output slowed to 7.7% year-on-year, the second weakest pace since the Lehman crisis, likely on pre-Apec factory closures," said Dariusz Kowalczyk, economist at Credit Agricole.
"The data highlights downward pressure on the mainland economy. It will encourage further monetary easing."
While calls for more easing from the government have been around for some time, Beijing has yet to step in with major support measures.
Zhou Hao, economist at ANZ Bank said that while it was unlikely that the fourth quarter would pick up from the downward trend, it might also be too late for Beijing to introduce measures this late in the year.
"If the government really wants to turn around the growth profile, right now is a little bit too late to do that," he said.
Sluggish factory production in recent months and a weakening housing market has been putting the government's annual growth target of 7.5% at greater risk, but Louis Kuijis, an economist at RBS, agreed that response from policymakers would continue to be "restrained".
"We do not expect major new stimulus steps unless growth takes a major turn for the worse and/or the labour market gets hit more seriously," Mr Kujius said.
China's labour market has been holding up despite the drag on other sectors.
The official urban unemployment rate was 4.07% in September, barely changed from 4.08% three months earlier.

Why the Dutch tradition of blackface at Christmas wont go awayBy Ishaan Tharoor November 13 Follow @ishaantharoor
In this Nov. 16, 2013 file photo the Dutch version of Santa Claus, Sinterklaas, or Saint Nicholas, and his sidekicks known as "Zwarte Piet," or Black Pete, arrive by steamboat in Hoorn, northwestern Netherlands. (Peter Dejong/AP)
On the face of it, it's obvious why many outsiders find the Dutch Christmas-time figure of "Zwarte Piet" -- or Black Pete -- to be shockingly racist. Here's a tradition, after all, in which white people don minstrel-like clothes, wear frizzy wigs, paint their mouths a garish red and blacken their faces. It echoes all the worst iconography of America's troubled racial past.
But many in the Netherlands don't see it that way. Generations of Dutch children frolic and dress up in the days ahead of Dec. 5, which is the eve of the feast day of St. Nicholas. But the Dutch forerunner to Santa Claus doesn't show up with elves and reindeer in tow.
Sinterklaas, according to a popular 19th century Dutch story (and pictured above), is said to arrive on steamship accompanied by a pack of swarthy Piets, trickster figures who amuse crowds of children with candy and japes. Sinterklaas is due to officially "arrive"  this Saturday in the Dutch city of Gouda.
The racial overtones seem clear: the Netherlands was once an imperial power, a possessor of overseas colonies teeming with plantations, and one of the major early drivers of the African slave trade. The Zwarte Piets disembarking off a steamship can't just be mythical creatures of fancy.
On Wednesday, though, the highest administrative court in the Netherlands  overturned  the progressive opinion that a lower court laid down earlier this year. That ruling  had advised that permits for festivities involving Zwarte Piet in Amsterdam should be up for review because it led to "negative stereotyping of black people."
Jaap Polak, the president of the top court known as the Council of State, said Amsterdam's mayor didn't have the power to ban people from dressing up as Zwarte Piet. To the ire of those who back and oppose the tradition, Polak also side-stepped making a judgment on whether it was racist or not. The AP reports :
That ruling means that the Council of State "cannot and will not answer the question" of whether Black Pete breaches Dutch anti-discrimination law, Polak told a packed courtroom.
That leaves the matter still very much up to debate. And there's quite a lot to be discussed in a country that's in many other regards one of the most liberal societies in the West.
What's curious is the incredulity of many Dutch people when asked to confront the apparent racism of their beloved Christmas-time figure. Here's how a writer at Slate summed up the experience in 2011:
Trying to tell a Dutch person why this image disturbs you will often result in anger and frustration. Otherwise mature and liberal-minded adults may recoil from the topic and offer a rote list of reasons why Zwarte Piet should not offend anybody. "He is not even a black man," many will tell you. “He is just black because he came down the chimney.” Then, you may reply, why aren’t his clothes dirty?
This week, a Dutch radio station published a YouTube video of the reactions two Dutch filmmakers received when they dressed up as Zwarte Piet and walked in a London park. Many of the locals they encountered were outraged by the costume.
It doesn't help either that figures as polarizing as far-right nationalist politician Geert Wilders have come out in defense of the tradition. Wilders' anti-immigrant PVV party drew up legislation earlier this year aimed at preserving the black-face figure at Christmas celebrations. "We want to protect our culture," Wilders said in September, and suggested that making Zwarte Piet into a figure of racism was "too ridiculous for words." In 2013, he tweeted that he'd rather eliminate the U.N. than Zwarte Piet.
But the push-back against the tradition has been led by an increasingly vocal group of minorities, as my colleague Anthony Faiola reported last year when discussing Dutch attitudes toward Zwarte Piet.
“This is showing us the truth about racism in a place where some people had convinced themselves it didn’t exist,” said Quinsy Gario, a poet and radio commentator who was born in Curacao and is among the second- and third-generation Afro-Caribbean immigrants here who have largely pushed the opposition campaign. In 2011, he was detained by police for disturbing the peace at a holiday parade, where he held a sign and wore a shirt that said “Black Pete Is Racist.”
“They keep saying this is their tradition, but Black Pete is basically a Dutch Sambo,” he said.
In recent years, proponents of the tradition have tried to clean up the act -- advising, for example, the use of a variety of wigs rather than a mock Afro and dropping the Surinamese accent that used to accompany the antics of Zwarte Piets. Some ethnic minorities have even endorsed the tradition themselves.
But as the voices of dissent grow, it's going to become harder and harder for those patting their faces black every year to keep convincing themselves this is just a children's fantasy.

Infy in race to acquire Airbus unit CIMPA  to be first acquisition after Sikka took overInfosys in race to acquire Airbus unit CIMPA

(The deal will help Infosys…)
By Chandra R. Srikanth
Software major Infosys is in the race to acquire CIMPA, the engineering services unit of Airbus, people familiar with the development said, making it potentially the first acquisition after Vishal Sikka took charge as CEO over three months back.
The deal will help Infosys deepen its presence in the engineering services space, a segment that currently contributes to less than 5% of its revenues. Sources said Infosys could also get a revenue assurance from Airbus as part of the deal.
France-based CIMPA works in the area of product lifecycle management, has 940 employees and had sales of 100 million euros in 2012. Sources said the valuation for a captive unit is typically likely to be 0.7-0.8 times sales, although it could go up to 1 times sales depending on the profitability of the unit. So, the valuation for this unit could be in the range of $100-$136 million.
A French paper Les Echos reported in June that Airbus had put its engineering unit Cimpa on the block, as part of a plan to divest non-strategic assets. Airbus had not commented on the report then.
A person familiar closely involved with Infosys said the company was looking at assets in areas such as engineering services, geographics such as Nordics & Japan but declined to comment on whether its looking at CIMPA in particular. However, sources cited above said Infosys is keen to acquire this asset to boost its capabilities in the PLM space and is competing with the likes of HCL Tech and Tech Mahindra for this acquisition.
While an Infosys spokesperson said the company does not comment on speculation, HCL Tech said it does not respond to rumours. Tech Mahindra did not respond to e-mail queries.
Engineering services currently contributes to less than 5% of Infosys revenues, as per the latest quarter ended September 2014. But with the global manufacturing sector undergoing rapid changes, industry analysts believe engineering services and PLM will gain more traction going forward.
"China has dominated the manufacturing sector but now countries like US and Germany want to stage a comeback. PLM will play a crucial role," said a brokerage analyst tracking Infosys, who did not wish to be named.
Sikka himself in the last few months has been talking about the huge opportunity in the manufacturing sector, thanks to rapid changes in technology.

Rising Indian boxers L Devendro Singh (49kg) and Gaurav Bhiduri (52kg) will be seen in action in the professional-style World Series of Boxing’s upcoming season after grabbing two-year contracts with the franchises of Poland and Italy.
While Commonwealth Games and Asian Championships silver-medallist Devendro will turn up for Poland Hussars, Bhiduri has been lapped up by Italia Thunders for the season starting January 16.
The Italian franchise was the champion in the team event of the 2011-12 season albeit under a different name.
“I am glad that boxer Gaurav Bhiduri is about to join the Italia Thunder. I give him my warmest welcome and can’t wait to meet him. We are building a great team and we hope to qualify as many boxers as possible to the next Olympic Games in 2016,” said Paolo Cassera, Managing Director of Italia Thunder.
The two boxers have got the opportunity courtesy Anglian Medal Hunt -- a sports management group which has been supporting the duo.
“I am so excited about the prospect of competing in this tournament. It is a huge opportunity for me because I can also grab an Olympic berth if I do well,” Devendro told PTI.
“I don’t have words to describe how it feels. It is a huge opportunity for me because the Italian team features some big names like (Olympic and Word Championships medallist) Paddy Barnes,” said Bhiduri.
Last season too, the Indian boxers had competed in the WSB when Asian champion Shiva Thapa and Sumit Sangwan turned up for the USA franchise for a select number of bouts following a mid-season deal. However, this is the first time that Indian boxers have been offered full-fledged contracts.
“The financial details are still being worked out but this is the first time that Indian boxers have been offered full-time contracts in this league. They will get to train with the best during their stint and hopefully they will deliver in the ring,” said Anglian Medal Hunt CEO Maneesh Bahuguna.
“Their contracts are for season five and six, both of which will be held in 2015,” he added.
The WSB offers Olympic quota places for boxers through its individual championships.
“We are getting used to playing without head guards in the amateur competitions and we will train hard to ensure that we have the stamina to last five rounds in this event. It will definitely make us better boxers,” said Devendro.

A consortium led by Anil Ambani controlled Reliance Infrastructure (RInfra) and Maharashtra Government have mutually terminated the concession agreement for Mumbai Metro Line 2 connecting Charkop to Mankhud via Bandra.
RInfra said the termination was due to non-fulfilment of various obligations by the Maharashtra Government . The project, estimated at Rs.12,000 crore, was awarded to the Rinfra led consortium through an international competitive bidding in 2009. The termination comes a day after RInfra reported Rs.57 crore loss on account of Mumbai Metro One.
The project was to be implemented by Mumbai Metro Transport Private Ltd. (MMTPL) wherein RInfra holds 48 per cent of the equity. The concession agreement was executed on January 21, 2010, between the Maharashtra Government and the consortium.
“Due to non-fulfilment of various critical obligations by Government of Maharashtra/Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), the project could not take off. Even after four years, despite of the best efforts by the Government of Maharashtra, various project impediments could not be resolved,” RInfra said in a statement.
“The parties agreed to terminate the concession agreement at no cost or claim to either party with Government of Maharashtra agreeing to return the bank guarantee of Rs.160 crore to MMTPL. Accordingly, the agreement to this effect has been executed between MMTPL and Government of Maharashtra,” the statement added.
With the above said termination of the concession agreement, all commitments/liabilities of RInfra towards the project including the commitments towards funding the project have been annulled with immediate effect, the company said.

Hindalco Q2 net dips 78% on provisioning  finance costsHindalco Q2 net profit dips 78% on provisioning, finance costs
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: November 13, 2014  | 16:14 IST
Impacted by higher provisioning and increased finance costs, Hindalco Industries ' net profit fell 78 per cent to Rs 79 crore in the second quarter ended September 30, 2014-15.
The decline was despite a Rs 361 crore forex gain and 36 per cent rise in revenue. The Aditya Birla Group's flagship company which is into the manufacturing of aluminium and copper had reported Rs 357 crore net profit in the July-September quarter of last fiscal, it said in a statement on Friday.
The company has made provision for Rs 563 crore liability towards additional levy of Rs 295 per tonne on coal extracted at its Talabira-I mine in line with the recent Supreme Court order.
The mine started production in 2003-04. It has also kept aside Rs 258 crore towards diminution in carrying value of its investment in Aditya Birla Minerals, its Australia-based subsidiary, due to significant decline in value of the company's investment.
Hindalco, however, had a Rs 361 crore foreign exchange gain in connection with the receipt of Rs 1,394 crore from A V Minerals, Netherlands towards return of capital by reducing nominal value of shares.
There was a Rs 29-crore writeback of provision as well. Profit before tax and exceptional item was Rs 539 crore vis-a-vis Rs 440 crore attained in the sequential quarter as well as the in the corresponding quarter of the previous year, the statement said.
Revenue of the company rose 35.6 per cent during the quarter to Rs 8,554 crore from Rs 6,304.85 crore a year ago.
Buoyed by higher volume and realisation, revenue from the aluminium business grew to Rs 3,316 crore compared to Rs 2,343 crore a year earlier.
Revenue from the copper business increased to Rs 5,247 crore from Rs 3,974 crore a year ago. Aluminium production was up substantially to 1.87 lakh tonnes vs 1.4 lakh tonnes in Q2 FY'14, consequent to ongoing ramp up at Mahan smelter.
Copper production was higher at 96,000 tonnes as against 77,000 tonnes in Q2 FY'14, it said. The company attributed the Rs 203 crore rise in finance costs to Rs 386 crore on progressive capitalisation of the company's greenfield projects.

2018  2022 set go ahead in Russia  Qatar as planned:FIFAQatar has also been criticised over its treatment of migrant workers in the construction industry. (Source: AP file)
By: Reuters | London | Posted: November 13, 2014 6:06 pm | Updated: November 13, 2014 6:41 pm
The soccer World Cups of 2018 and 2022 are set go ahead in Russia and Qatar as planned after FIFA’s ethics committee said on Thursday it could find no grounds for reopening the controversial bidding process.
In a long-awaited report, the committee said that “the various incidents which might have occurred are not suited to compromise the integrity of the FIFA World Cup 2018/2022 bidding process as a whole”.
The report criticised England’s bid for the 2018 tournament for bowing to “inappropriate requests” from former CONCACAF president Jack Warner, a FIFA powerbroker at the time, in what it said was “an apparent violation of bidding rules”.
It also said that in Australia’s bid for 2022 “there are certain indications of potentially problematic conduct of specific individuals in the light of relevant FIFA Ethics rules.
“The occurrences at issue were… only of very limited scope,” it added.
“In particular, the effects of these occurrences on the bidding process as a whole were far from reaching any threshold that would require returning to the bidding process, let alone reopening it — a decision which anyway would not fall under the FIFA Ethics Committee’s competence.
“The assessment of the 2018/2022 FIFA World Cups bidding process is therefore closed for the FIFA Ethics Committee.”
However, the report said ethics investigator Michael Garcia intended to open formal investigations against individuals, who were not named.
FIFA and Qatar World Cup organisers have been fending off allegations of corruption ever since the Gulf state was awarded the 2022 tournament.
Qatar, which has repeatedly denied the allegations, has also been criticised over its treatment of migrant workers in the construction industry.
The 2018 tournament was awarded to Russia as part of the same bidding process which culminated in December 2010.
NOT CLEAR
FIFA said in a statement that it welcomed the report and looks forward to continuing the preparations for Russia 2018 and Qatar 2022, “which are already well underway”.
In the case of Qatar, the report said “there are certain indications of potentially problematic conduct of specific individuals in the light of relevant FIFA Ethics rules” which did not compromise the bidding process.
It said that the relationship between former Asian Football Confederation president Mohamed bin Hammam, banned for life by FIFA in 2011, and the Qatar bidding team was a “distant relative to the relationships of other FIFA Executive Committee members from bid nations”.
The report said that it could not find any evidence of misconduct connected to the Russian bid, although it added that not all records had been available to the investigation.
“The Russia 2018 Bid Committee made only a limited amount of documents available for review.”
“The computers used at the time by the Russia Bid Committee had been leased and then returned to their owner after the Bidding Process. The owner has confirmed continued…

Saif is incredibly hard on himself: IleanaDCruzActress Ileana D'Cruz, who is working with Saif Ali Khan for the first time in "Happy Ending", says the actor is incredibly hard on himself. (Source: Varinder Chawla)

Actress Ileana D’Cruz, who is working with Saif Ali Khan for the first time in “Happy Ending”, says the actor is incredibly hard on himself.
The 27-year-old actress has so far worked with younger actors including Varun Dhawan and Ranbir Kapoor in Bollywood but working with 44-year-old Saif was a different experience.
“I don’t get intimidated by anybody. For me, you are an actor and I’m just working with you. I want to do a film that offers me a significant role,” she said.
“I was looking forward to working with Saif because the role demanded the humour and I think he is brilliant in that… He is incredibly hard on himself,” she added.
Directed by Raj Nidimoru and Krishna DK, “Happy Ending” also features Govinda, Kalki Koechlin and Ranvir Shorey. The film will release Nov 21.
Ileana says that she was offered a film with Saif much before the release of her first Hindi film “Barfi!”
“For me, doing a film with Saif would be great but doing a film with Saif that has a significant role for me, has been the perfect combination. I was offered a film with Saif much before ‘Barfi!’ but I didn’t like the story. When I heard the story of ‘Happy Ending’, I was shocked because this is an amazing script.”
The actress says that her role in the film is as important as any other character.
“My role is very good, at par with him (Saif) and my character is as sassy as his. She is more of a guy than a girl. She is not emotional. My character is sort of dry and disinterested. She writes novels but doesn’t believe in them, or for that matter in love,” she added.

A college girl was stabbed to death by a local youth on the outskirts of Rajouri town in Jammu & Kashmir this afternoon.
The girl was reportedly going to her home at Kallar in a matador from Rajouri. The boy, Ashish Kumar of Muradpur, was also travelling in the same matador, sources said.
However, when the girl alighted from the matador at Kallar, the boy stabbed her with a sharp edged weapon. The girl died on the spot.
The murder led to protests with local people blocking the road by holding a sit-in along with the dead body. The police have arrested the accused, but the protestors were not willing to lift the blockade. Senior civil and police officers have rushed to the spot.

Rohit Sharma smashes record 264 runs against...Rohit Sharma smashes record 264 runs to become first batsman to score 2 double tons in ODIs
PTI Nov 13, 2014, 06.37PM IST
(harma also became the first…)
KOLKATA: Rohit Sharma today scripted history by notching up the highest-ever individual score in one-day internationals, scoring a breathtaking knock of 264 against Sri Lanka in the fourth cricket one-dayer here.
During his rollicking knock which came off just 173 balls, Rohit surpassed the previous record set by countryman Virender Sehwag, who smashed 219 in an ODI against West Indies at Indore, back in 2011.
Rohit also became the only player in world cricket to score two double hundreds in the 50-over format with his previous best of 209 coming against Australia at Bangalore in November last year.
Asked if he was tired after his epic knock, a smiling Rohit said, "Not really. I have had a break due to injury and I am not tired at all. I could have continued for another 50 overs."
Rohit also broke Shikhar Dhawan's List A record score of 248 scored against South Africa A in Pretoria last year.
In his 173 ball innings, Rohit hit 33 boundaries and nine sixes with his last 214 runs coming in only 101 balls.
His 33 boundaries were highest number struck by an individual in an ODI innings.
Rohit said that once he got to 50, he had to get a big one as he was set.
"Once I got to 50, I had to convert it into a big score. Normally, I have an idea of the team total as it helps you to build an innings. We know that under lights with dew factor into consideration, 350 is not a safe score anymore at the Eden Gardens."
EDen Gardens also holds an emotional place in Rohit's heart as he scored a big hundred (177) on debut at this very venue last year and has now got the highest-ever ODI score.
"It's been a great venue for me as I got my hundred on Test debut at this venue. The crowd were cheering me right through."
For the record, Rohit has also got a T20 hundred at this venue having scored one against Kolkata Knight Riders two seasons back.
Rohit, however was lucky, as he was dropped on individual score of four when he slashed hard at a Shaminda Eranaga delivery and the resultant dolly was dropped at third-man by Thisara Perera.
Following is the list of Top-10 individual scores in the history of One Day Internationals:
(In brackets: Number of balls played) 264 (173) Rohit Sharma (Ind) vs S Lanka (Kolkata) (2014) 219 (149) Virender Sehwag (Ind) vs WI (Indore) (2011) 209 (158) Rohit Sharma (Ind) vs Aus (Bangalore) (2013) 200 no (147) Sachin Tendulkar (Ind) vs SA (Gwalior) (2010) 194 no (156) Charles Coventry (Zimbabwe) vs Bangladesh (Bulawayo) (2009) 194 (146) Saeed Anwar (Pakistan) vs India (Chennai) (1997) 189 (170) Viv Richards (West Indies) vs England (Manchester) (1984) 189 no (155) Martin Guptill (NZ) vs England (Southampton) (2013) 189 (161) Sanath Jayasuriya (SL) vs India (Sharjah) (2000) 188 no (159) Gary Kirsten (SA) vs UAE (Rawalpindi) (1996).

Space agency releases first picture from cometSpace agency releases first picture from comet
By AP | 13 Nov, 2014, 05.06PM IST
Philae is stable, sitting on the nucleus and is producing data,'' Gerhard Schwehm, a scientist on the Rosetta mission, told The Associated Press. 
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
BERLIN: The European Space Agency on Thursday published the first image taken from the surface of a comet, and said that its Philae lander is still ``stable'' despite a failure to latch on properly to the rocky terrain.
The lander scored a historic first Wednesday, when it touched down on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko after a decade-long journey through space on its mother ship Rosetta.
Scientists' jubilation was slightly dampened because the harpoons which were meant to anchor the lander to the surface failed to deploy, causing it to bounce twice before it came to rest on the comet's body, or nucleus.
``Philae is stable, sitting on the nucleus and is producing data,'' Gerhard Schwehm , a scientist on the Rosetta mission , told The Associated Press. ``The lander is very healthy.''
The photos sent back to Earth show a rocky surface, with one of the lander's three feet in the corner of the frame.
Scientists are still analyzing what effect the two bounces had on the spacecraft and plan to release further details at a news briefing at 2 p.m. (1300 GMT; 8 a.m. EST).
Schwehm said it may still be possible to fire the harpoons, but that this would be done only if it doesn't imperil the lander.
A key question is whether Philae's drill can be used to extract samples from beneath the surface without pushing the lander into space. Gravity on the comet is 1/100,000th that of Earth, meaning the washing machine-sized lander weighs just 1 gram (0.04 ounces) there.
Philae and Rosetta will use 21 instruments to analyze the comet over the coming months. Scientists hope the ?1.3 billion project ($1.62 billion) will help them better understand comets and other celestial objects, as well as possibly answer questions about the origins of life on Earth.

Save precious time tracking your investments

In a technological feat that gives scientists their first opportunity to dig into a remnant of the early solar system, the European Space Agency's Rosetta mission successfully placed a small spacecraft on the surface of a speeding comet on Wednesday.
With this achievement, a comet is no longer a mysterious and sometimes frightening spray of light across the night sky, but another member of the solar system to be explored, like the moon and Mars. The technology of landing on a comet, with its wisps of gravity, could be applied to future efforts to mine asteroids.
The agency's director-general, Jean-Jacques Dordain, described the touchdown on Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, a 2.5-mile-wide ball of rock, ice and dust moving faster than 40,000 mph, as "a big step for human civilization."
"Our ambitious Rosetta mission has secured another place in the history books," Dordain said at a news conference. "Not only is it the first to rendezvous with and orbit a comet, but it is now also the first to deliver a probe to a comet's surface."
For scientists, one of the key mysteries that Rosetta will explore is whether Earth's oceans are filled with melted comets. Since the rocky bits that came together to form the planet were dry, water has to have come from somewhere else. One possibility is that comets slamming into the Earth early on seeded it with water.
News of the touchdown of the 220-pound lander, named Philae, arrived at the mission control center in Darmstadt, Germany, at 5:03 p.m. local time (11:03 a.m. Eastern time). Cheers erupted.
"We're there and Philae is talking to us," said Stephan Ulamec, the manager for the lander. "We are on the comet."
With that news, a procession of officials from nations and organizations, including NASA, that had collaborated on the $1.75 billion mission reveled in the accomplishment, capping a 10-year, 4-billion-mile trip.
"How audacious!" said James L. Green, the director of NASA's planetary sciences division. "How exciting! How unbelievable to be able to dare to land on a comet."
Within the hour, though, a worrisome caveat came to light.
"It's not only complicated to land there," Ulamec said in a later news conference. "It's also, as it appears, very complicated to understand what has happened."
Two harpoons that should have fired into the comet did not, and the lander may not be secured to the surface. Ulamec said fluctuations in the radio link and the generation of power by the solar panels suggested that Philae may have bounced off the surface before settling down again.
"Maybe today we didn't just land once, we even landed twice," Ulamec said.
As expected, the Rosetta orbiter moved out of the line of sight of Philae, breaking radio communications.
The orbiter is to re-establish the radio link in the next day, and mission managers hope then to better understand the stability of Philae's footing.
Nonetheless, the lander and its 10 instruments have begun 64 hours of scientific operations before its batteries drain. Solar panels will recharge the batteries, allowing intermittent operations over the coming months, about an hour every two days.
The landing culminated a tense day as Rosetta maneuvered to the correct position to let Philae go. Moments of celebration were interspersed with long, quiet stretches of waiting.
The operation proceeded despite a few small glitches and one potential showstopper problem: failure of a thruster that was to fire after touchdown to press the lander against the comet's surface. A pin was supposed to break a wax seal on the gas tank, but repeated attempts did not succeed.
Without the thruster, the washing machine-size Philae would have to rely on ice screws on its landing legs and the harpoons to anchor it to the comet. The thruster, which was to shoot a stream of nitrogen gas, was intended to counteract not just the possibility of Philae bouncing off the surface but also the upward kick from the firing of the harpoons.
Mission managers decided to proceed, because there was no way to repair it.
Philae detached on schedule, for a seven-hour descent.
There was some worrying a couple of hours later when the lander was about 10 minutes late in re-establishing communications with the orbiter.
Mission managers could not do anything; the readings they saw on their computer screens reflected what had occurred 28 minutes earlier - the time it took a radio signal to travel the 316 million miles from Rosetta to Earth.
But soon they received photos - a blurry image of Rosetta's solar array taken by Philae about 50 seconds after separation, and then a sharper image by Rosetta of the descending Philae.
"We see the lander going down on the right track," said Andrea Accomazzo, the flight director.
Then there was more waiting, with amusing updates via the Twitter accounts of Rosetta and Philae.
"Finally! I'm stretching my legs after more than 10 years. Landing gear deployed!" read a Twitter posting on Philae's account.
The Web comic XKCD also provided real-time updates, even mentioning the problem with the nitrogen thruster. In the comic, Rosetta told Philae that mission control was worried about the thruster, and the lander responded, "I really hope harpoons work on comets."
The harpoons turned out to be a valid concern.
"There are some indications that they might not have been fired, which could mean that we are sitting in soft material and we are not anchored," Ulamec said. "We have to analyze what is the actual situation."
The XKCD comic updated: "Do harpoons work on comets? Don't know."
For now, Philae is working and the instruments have already sent back some images and data. But if it is not anchored, Philae may not operate as long as hoped - the original goal was next March - as emissions of dust and gas grow as the comet moves nearer to the sun.
Even if the lander cannot complete the full mission, managers have said, Rosetta will still be a resounding success. Planetary scientists have never looked at a comet so close up for so long.
Comets are frozen leftovers from the formation of the solar system. Rosetta is named after the Rosetta Stone, the engraved block that was crucial in deciphering Egyptian hieroglyphics, and scientists hope the spacecraft's observations will offer important clues to how the solar system came together 4.5 billion years ago.
(Philae is an island where an obelisk provided clues to solving the Rosetta Stone.)
Previous spacecraft missions have zoomed by comets at high speeds, providing only brief examinations. By contrast, Rosetta will be a constant companion as Comet 67P approaches the sun, swings around and heads out again, its instruments potentially providing more than two years of data.

Buffett snaps up Duracell from P&GBuffett snaps up Duracell from P&G

Billionaire investor Warren Buffett is getting into the battery business. Buffett is also trimming his stock holdings, while adding to his growing holdings of operating businesses.
Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway ( BRK.A ; BRK.B ) announced Thursday that it will acquire the Duracell battery business from Procter & Gamble ( PG ). Berkshire will finance the transaction by forking over $4.7 billion in P&G shares it currently owns.
In a statement, Berkshire outlined the deal as follows: “In exchange for a recapitalized Duracell Company, which will include approximately $1.7 billion in cash at closing, P&G will receive shares of P&G’s common stock currently held by Berkshire Hathaway having a current value of approximately $4.7 billion.”
At the end of 2013, P&G was Berkshire’s seventh-biggest stock holding, according to Berkshire filings. Berkshire is the fifth biggest shareholder of P&G stock, with a 52.8 million share stake, according to Yahoo Finance data through June 30.
At Wednesday night’s closing price of $89.48 for P&G, Berkshire’s stake is an estimated $4.74 billion, which means Berkshire is basically trading all of its P&G shares for the operating  business of Duracell. By constructing the Duracell deal with the transfer of Berkshire-owned P&G shares back to P&G, Buffett’s Berkshire was able to minimize the tax hit had it liquidated its shares at a profit in the open market for cash.
“I have always been impressed by Duracell, as a consumer and as a long-term investor in P&G and Gillette,” said Buffett, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway. “Duracell is a leading global brand with top quality products, and it will fit well within Berkshire Hathaway.”
In early trading, Berkshire Hathaway A shares were up $884.06, or 0.4%, to $218,985.06. And shares of P&G were virtually unchanged, falling 2 cents to $89.46.
The transaction, which is subject to regulatory approvals, is expected to close in the second half of 2015. The deal allows Buffett to add another brand-name business to his portfolio and enables P&G to shed a non-core business.
Buffett’s use of stock to finance the deal, rather than cash, is an emerging trend, as is the shift to buying entire businesses rather than shares of stock, says Lawrence A. Cunningham, a professor at George Washington University and author of the book, Berkshire Beyond Buffett.
“The swap of $4.7 billion of stock in P&G for the Duracell assets continues the trend at Berkshire from a company whose value was mostly in stock picks Buffett made but Berkshire didn’t control — to wholly owned businesses over which Berkshire has total control. …  A similar example occurred late last year when Berkshire swapped stock in Phillips 66 (in exchange) for pipeline lubricant assets.”
Buffett, dubbed the Oracle of Omaha by Wall Street for his prescient market calls and investment acumen, is known for investing in brand-name stocks — and businesses — that are easy-to-understand, have sizable and enduring market shares and are run by solid management teams. Buffett’s major stock holdings via Berkshire Hathaway include well-known brands, such as Coca-Cola, IBM and Wal-Mart. Berkshire also owns businesses, such as ice cream seller Dairy Queen, auto insurer Geico and railroad transportation giant Burlington Northern Santa Fe.
In Berkshire’s recent third-quarter earnings filing, Buffett had this to say about the company’s acquisition strategy: “Our long-held acquisition strategy is to acquire businesses at sensible prices that have consistent earnings power, good returns on equity and able and honest management.”
And this deal, according to Buffett himself, meets that criterion.
Commenting on the deal to FOX Business Network this morning, Buffett, 84, said: “This is our kind of business. … Not very exciting but a good, solid business. I’m a Duracell guy. Always have been”
“We thank the Duracell employees for their many contributions to the business. They’ve made Duracell the global market leader in the battery category,” said A.G. Lafley, P&G’s CEO. “I’m confident this new ownership structure will provide strong support for Duracell’s future growth plans.”
The sale of Duracell is not a major surprise, as pressure has been growing on the P&G CEO to divest non-core businesses, which includes Duracell, the world’s No. 1 battery business, according to a Cincinnati Enquirer report back in June. P&G, the world’s largest consumer-products company, said last month that it would divest Duracell.
“(Duracell is) not a strategic fit for P&G – it doesn’t create any halo or synergy with their other brands,” Pete Sorrentino, a portfolio manager with Huntington Asset Advisors, told the Cincinnati Enquirer in June.
Divestitures are a proven tool for Lafley, according to the Enquirer. During his previous tenure as P&G’s CEO, he sold or spun off most of the company’s food business that included Jif peanut butter, Crisco shortening and Sunny Delight fruit drink. Duracell commands estimated annual sales of $2.6 billion.

Organic sales grew two       percent for the quarter. Reported net sales were $20.8 billion,       unchanged versus the prior year, including a negative two percentage       point impact from the combination of foreign exchange and minor       divestitures.
P&G generated operating cash flow of $3.6 billion and free cash flow of       $2.8 billion for the quarter. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was       96%. P&G returned $4.2 billion in cash to shareholders, including $1.8       billion in dividends and $2.4 billion of common stock repurchases.
“P&G’s first quarter results were in-line with our expectations, despite       a very difficult operating environment,” said Chairman, President, and       Chief Executive Officer A.G. Lafley. “This keeps us on-track to deliver       our fiscal year commitments.”
“We continue to accelerate and increase productivity savings, sharpen       our strategies and strengthen our portfolio by focusing on our biggest       opportunities. The pet care divestiture and exit of the battery business       will allow us to further focus these efforts.”
July – September Quarter Discussion
Net sales were unchanged versus year ago at $20.8 billion in the July –       September quarter, including a negative two percentage point impact from       the combination of foreign exchange and minor divestitures. Organic       sales grew two percent, in line or higher versus the prior year in all       reporting segments. Organic volume was unchanged versus the prior year       in both developed and developing regions. Pricing added one percentage       point to sales growth, and geographic and product mix was also positive.

*Other includes the sales mix impact of acquisitions/divestitures             and rounding impacts necessary to reconcile volume to net sales
 
Beauty, Hair, and Personal Care segment organic sales were unchanged         as pricing benefits from prior year increases across all business         units were offset by lower volume in Prestige.
Grooming segment organic sales were unchanged as higher pricing and         innovation on Blades & Razors and higher volume in Appliances from         innovation were offset by lower Blades & Razors volume in developed         regions.
Health Care segment organic sales increased six percent behind         innovation-driven volume growth in Oral Care and Personal Health Care         along with higher pricing in Oral Care.
Fabric Care and Home Care segment organic sales were unchanged as         increased Fabric Care volume behind initiatives was offset by a         decline in Personal Power due to high volume in the base period from         new distribution.
Baby, Feminine and Family Care segment organic sales increased four         percent behind pricing, primarily in Baby Care, and positive sales         mix, driven mainly by Feminine Care.
Core earnings per share were $1.07, an increase of two percent versus       the prior year. Foreign exchange reduced core earnings by $0.07 per       share, resulting in a nine percent increase in core earnings per share       on a currency-neutral basis. Diluted net earnings per share were $0.69,       including non-core items of $0.38 per share. Non-core items include a       $0.32 per share non-cash goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge       related to the battery business. For a full reconciliation of non-core       items, please see Exhibit #1: Non-GAAP Measures.
Core operating profit margin decreased 20 basis points as a 20 basis       point improvement in core gross margin was more than offset by a 30       basis point increase in core SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Reported       operating profit margin decreased 570 basis points primarily due to the       impairment charges. Reported gross margin was unchanged as manufacturing       savings of 140 basis points were offset by foreign exchange, higher       commodity costs, incremental restructuring charges and innovation and       capacity expansion investments. Reported SG&A as a percentage of sales       increased 90 basis points as productivity savings of 70 basis points       from overhead and 50 basis points of marketing efficiencies were more       than offset by foreign exchange impacts, including a non-core charge for       adjustments to remeasure certain balances in Venezuela. Total       productivity savings in cost of goods sold and SG&A were 260 basis       points.
Pet Care Divestiture
During the quarter, the Company completed plans to exit the Pet Care       business. P&G closed the divestiture of its pet business in the Americas       to Mars, Inc. in July. Mars then exercised their option to purchase       P&G’s pet business in Asia. In September, P&G signed an agreement to       divest its European pet business to Spectrum Brands. All remaining       elements of these transactions are expected to close in calendar year       2015, pending regulatory approvals.
Duracell Announcement
Consistent with its plans to focus and strengthen its brand and category       portfolio, P&G announced its intention today to exit the Duracell       personal power business by creating a stand-alone Duracell company. P&G       said its goals in the process of exiting this business are to maximize       value to P&G’s shareholders and minimize earnings per share dilution.
P&G said it is exiting the battery business in two steps. The first step       was finalizing an agreement to sell its interest in a China-based       battery joint venture, which it accomplished in late-August. Terms of       this transaction were not disclosed.
The second step is the exit of the Duracell business. Although no       decision has been made on the form of the exit, P&G’s current preference       is a split-off of the Duracell business into a stand-alone company.
In a split-off, P&G shareholders would be given the option of exchanging       some, none, or all of their P&G shares for shares in the newly formed       Duracell company. P&G’s outstanding share count would be reduced by the       number of P&G shares exchanged. The exact exchange ratio would be set       just prior to the completion of the transaction, which P&G expects would       occur in the second half of calendar year 2015.
P&G said it would notify its shareholders when a final decision is made       regarding the form of the business separation. The Company added that       any alternative exit scenario – including a spin-off, divestiture or       other offer – that generates equal or better value will be considered.
“We greatly appreciate the contributions of our Duracell employees.       Since we acquired the business in 2005 as part of Gillette, Duracell has       strengthened its position as the global market leader in the battery       category,” said Mr. Lafley. “It’s a business with attractive operating       profit margins and a history of strong cash generation. I’m confident       the business and its employees will continue to thrive as its own       company.”
The Company said it will continue to report results of the Duracell       business as continuing operations for the time being.
Goodwill and Intangible Impairment
During the quarter the Company took a non-cash charge of $932 million       after-tax, or $0.32 per share, to adjust the carrying values of goodwill       and indefinite-lived intangible assets in its Duracell battery business.       The Company said it is writing down the asset value of its battery       business to be more reflective of the value it will receive from the       recently announced sale of its interest in a China-based battery       joint-venture.
Fiscal Year 2015 Guidance
P&G reiterated its organic sales growth and core earnings per share       growth guidance ranges for fiscal year 2015. P&G added that the       quarterly profile of earnings will be heavily influenced by the       variation of foreign exchange impacts from period-to-period. The Company       expects significant negative sales and earnings impacts from foreign       exchange in the October-December 2014 quarter.
The Company continues to expect organic sales growth in the low-to-mid       single digit range. Net sales growth is now expected to be in-line to up       low single digits versus the prior fiscal year, including a negative two       point impact from foreign exchange.
P&G maintained its outlook for core earnings per share growth in the       range of mid-single digits. All-in GAAP diluted net earnings per share       are now expected to be down two percent to down five percent versus the       prior year, including approximately $0.55 per share of non-core charges,       primarily from $0.20 per share of non-core restructuring charges and       $0.32 of impairment charges.

The comments were made on a conference call to discuss 21st Century Fox's second quarter earnings, which were a better-than-expected $999m.
There was surprise on Tuesday when Fox abandoned its bid, given Mr Murdoch's tenacity when pursuing previous deals.
But Mr Murdoch said Fox's shares had become "severely undervalued" following the takeover offer.
He said that prompted the announcement of a major share buyback, which Mr Murdoch said would maximise value for shareholders.
"This is our resolute decision," Mr Murdoch said.
"While we remain opportunistic and nimble, we are a strategically complete company and have a clear sense of where we are going."
'X-Men impact'
Fox's latest results showed that revenue in the second quarter increased by 17% to $8.42bn.
Sales at the company's film division increased by 38%, driven by the strong global performance of X-Men: Days of Future Past, which took in an estimated $740m worldwide.
There were two other hits - the animated comedy Rio 2 and the teen drama The Fault in Our Stars.
"As we close the fiscal year, I continue to have confidence in our ability to execute our growth plan and drive value for our shareholders," said Mr Murdoch in a statement accompanying earnings.
'Mix and match'
Speaking about the abandoned bid for Time Warner, Mr Murdoch said the board of Time Warner had "refused to engage" with the takeover bid.
Also speaking on Wednesday's conference call was Chase Carey, chief operating officer at Fox.
He said that the bid for Time Warner had been one of "opportunity" rather than necessity or a sign of weakness.
He said that Time Warner had been attractive as "scale" was important in the global media industry.
Mr Carey believed Fox would have been able to "mix and match" assets in sports, news and other areas if the deal had gone through, which would have given opportunities to build the business.
Fox has no plans to pursue any other major takeovers according to Mr Carey.

About this document
This document outlines the results of Ofcom’s research into the performance of the retail 3G and 4G services offered by the UK’s four national mobile network operators (MNOs): EE, O2, Three and Vodafone.
Following the conclusion of the 4G spectrum auction in February 2013, Ofcom stated that it would conduct research into the performance of 3G and 4G networks, with the intention of helping consumers understand the performance benefits of 4G over 3G.
The research outlined in this report was conducted between March and June 2014 in five UK cities where 4G services were available from all operators. Our methodology involved using smartphones to measure four key metrics that determine data connection performance: download speed, upload speed, web browsing speed and latency (measured through ping tests).
To provide context to the results, this report also includes 4G coverage information for each of the operators and highlights recent consumer research that Ofcom has undertaken in relation to consumers’ use of smartphones and their attitudes towards, and use of, 4G services.
We note that network performance will only be one element in a customer's decision to upgrade to a 4G service, and this report is part of a wider programme of work by Ofcom into mobile quality of service, which also includes consumer experience of mobile phone calls.

explains why working out how much debt we re all inWhy are tax receipts unexpectedly low?
We've had two examples in the last week of why it's so hard to predict the deficit, which may end up knocking almost £2.8bn off the figure, writes Anthony Reuben.
The public sector deficit is the amount that the government spends minus the amount that it receives in taxes, after you've taken into account investment.
The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecast of whether the deficit will go up or down in the current financial year will be a big focus in the Autumn Statement on 3 December.
At the end of last week, it looked as if this year's deficit would be going up by £1.7bn as a result of a backdated bill for UK contributions to the EU Budget.
But then, as a result of Chancellor George Osborne's negotiations , it turned out that we would have nothing to add to this year's deficit and "only" £850m to add to next year's, which would be after the general election.
On Wednesday, the Treasury discovered it would be receiving an extra £1.1bn (minus costs) as a result of the fines imposed on banks by the Financial Conduct Authority for traders' attempted manipulation of foreign exchange rates.
Mr Osborne said that the fines would be used "for the wider public good", which could mean they go towards reducing the deficit. Alternatively, as was the case with the Libor fines, some of the money could go towards other good causes.
The point is, the deficit could go up or down by a billion pounds or so for unexpected reasons, which could make all the difference between a rising deficit and falling one.
In the first six months of the current financial year, the deficit excluding public sector banks was £45.7bn, up from £44.8bn in the first six months of last year, but down from £50.6bn in the same period the year before. £2.8bn would have reversed that rise.
We've also recently had a warning from the OBR that it expects to lower its forecast for the amount of tax the government will collect this year.
All this makes it likely that the OBR will predict that this year's deficit will end up higher than last year's, despite government cost-cutting and a growing economy.
And you have to feel the OBR's pain when it attempts to make these forecasts. It has been very wrong with some of its forecasting since it was created in 2010, although admittedly not much more wrong than other forecasters.
Even so, how are you supposed to make forecasts when you never know where an extra billion pounds or two could come from?

* Brent hits Sept 2010 low below $78, US crude below $75
* Cushing, gasoline stock builds overshadow US total crude draw   (Recasts and updates to market close, adds analyst views)
By Barani Krishnan
NEW YORK, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Oil prices slumped more than 3 percent to four-year lows on Thursday, with benchmark Brent crashing below $80 a barrel, after a stockpile surge at the delivery point for U.S. crude frayed nerves of traders already worried about an oil glut.
The decline compounded Wednesday's losses stemming from comments by Saudi Arabia's oil minister that showed little will by the kingdom to cut output when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries meets on Nov. 27.
Brent settled down $2.46, or 3.1 percent, at $77.92 a barrel, after plumbing a September 2010 low of $77.83.
U.S. crude finished down $2.97, or 3.9 percent, at $74.21. In post-settlement trade, it went as low as $74.07, also a trough from September 2010.
Futures of U.S. gasoline blendstock RBOB and heating oil fell to four-year lows too, with gasoline breaching the $2-per-gallon mark.
Crude prices, which have slumped some 30 percent since June on fears of an oversupplied market, plunged below support levels of $80 a barrel for Brent and $75 for U.S. crude.
Some market analysts think U.S. crude is on course to break below $70 a barrel.
"Certainly, $70 seems to be the next major target to take out," said Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates in Texas. "There is little in the way of market bears clawing toward that."
The losses came after the U.S. government's Energy Information Administration said stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub for U.S. crude futures rose 1.7 million barrels for the week ended Nov. 7. Gasoline stocks surged 1.8 million barrels.
Some thought the selloff was overdone as the market appeared to have overlooked an overall drop of 1.7 million barrels in crude inventories. There was also a 2.8 million-barrel draw in distillate stocks, which included heating oil, and a spike in refinery utilization.
"To me, the market's reaction confirms just how bearish sentiment is. Even with decent numbers like these, the market can't rally," said Kyle Cooper, managing director at energy consultancy IAF Advisors in Houston.
OPEC members meet in Vienna on Nov. 27, when they will consider how to respond to the price slump over the past five months. Some have said they want a cut in output.
Qatar expects to lower oil output to about 500,000 bpd by the end of November from 650,000 bpd at the end of October and from 800,000 a month before that, an industry source familiar with the matter said.
But top oil exporter and OPEC's most powerful member, Saudi Arabia, has refrained from backing a cut, prompting speculation that it is more concerned with keeping market share than supporting prices.
"We do not set the oil price. The market sets the prices," Saudi Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi said on Wednesday.   (Additional reporting by Christopher Johnson in London and Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen in Singapore; Editing by Marguerita Choy and Jessica Resnick-Ault)

Twitter promises new featuresTweet
Everything that happens in the world happens on Twitter, and we’re constantly working to make it easier to create, share, consume and connect to what’s happening right now – whenever and however it’s most convenient for you.
This morning, I had the opportunity to present our plan to deliver on that at our Analyst Day conference. I want to take a moment to share our vision with you and offer some insight into product improvements we’re bringing to Twitter in the coming months.
Earlier this year, we set out to make Tweets richer and more engaging, giving users more ways to Tweet beyond text. We brought videos, Vines and GIFs into the home timeline, and introduced features that let you post multiple photos, tag people in photos and express yourself using emojis . To showcase all of this media, we launched a new profile design . We also introduced a new way for partners to share premium video and audio on Twitter, so you can preview and play with just one tap.
But aside from just watching video more easily on Twitter, you should be able to record, edit and share your own videos natively on Twitter too. Alongside short looping Vine videos, we think you’ll have fun sharing what’s happening in your world through native video. You can expect to see this in the first half of next year.
Right now, what you see of the 500 million Tweets published every day is based entirely on who you follow, and that’s a great model for many people. But with that many Tweets every day, there’s no way even the most avid Twitter user will find everything that’s relevant to their interests in any particular moment. That’s why we’re exploring ways to surface relevant Tweets so the content that is interesting to you is easy to discover – whether you stay on Twitter all day or visit for a few minutes – while still preserving the real-time nature of the platform that makes Twitter special.
For instance, we’re experimenting with better ways to give you what you come to Twitter for: a snapshot of what’s happening. We can use information like who you follow and what you engage with to surface highlights of what you missed and show those to you as soon as you log back in or come back to the app.
We’re also working on ideas such as an instant, personalized timeline for new users who don’t want to spend time cultivating one on their own.
Ultimately, we believe there is something for everyone at any time on Twitter, and we want to make finding your niche simple from the start.
And we haven’t forgotten about Direct Messages. We have several updates coming that will make it easy to take a public conversation private. The first of these was announced today and will begin rolling out next week: the ability to share and discuss Tweets natively and privately via Direct Messages. Stay tuned!
These are just a few examples of projects and focus areas we’re working on. Over the coming months, we are picking up the pace of product changes and improvements. As ever, that will involve a lot of experimentation, and we’ll be listening to your feedback along the way to make sure we build a service you love.

but sales there have been hitSABMiller delivers top-line and earnings growth
13 November 2014
SABMiller plc, the world’s second largest brewing company and one of the largest bottlers of Coca-Cola drinks, reports its interim (unaudited) results for the six months to 30 September 2014.
Highlights
Resilient top line growth powered by our Africa and Latin America businesses, but impacted by weaker second quarter trading conditions in China and Australia
Organic, constant currency group net producer revenue (NPR) growth of 5%, with group NPR per hectolitre (hl) up 3% driven by pricing and premiumisation initiatives.  Reported NPR growth was 2%
Total beverage volumes grew by 1% on an organic basis, with lager volumes down 1%.  Organic soft drinks growth of 9% driven by Africa, Latin America and Europe
Organic, constant currency EBITA growth of 3% and constant currency adjusted earnings per share  growth of 5% were impacted by the depreciation of key currencies against the US dollar such that reported EBITA is in line with the prior period
Reported EBITA is in line with the prior period, impacted by the depreciation of key currencies against the US dollar. Adverse translational foreign exchange impact on EBITA in the period of US$71 million
EBITA margin¹ declined 30 bps to 23.4% on both reported and organic, constant currency bases reflecting an EBITA decline in Asia Pacific 
Strong cash flow performance with free cash flow up 6% on an underlying basis. Free cash flow excludes the receipt of the proceeds from the sale of the group’s hotel and gaming investment

2 As restated. Further details of the restatement are provided note 1.
Revenue excludes the group's share of associates' and joint ventures' revenue.
Group net producer revenue (NPR) comprises group revenue, including the group’s share of associates’ and joint ventures’ revenue, less excise and similar taxes, including the group’s share of associates’ and joint ventures’ excise and similar taxes.
Note 2 provides a reconciliation of operating profit to EBITA which is defined as operating profit before exceptional items and amortisation of intangible assets             (excluding computer software) and includes the group's share of associates' and joint ventures' operating profit, on a similar basis. EBITA is used throughout this interim announcement.
Adjusted profit before tax comprises EBITA less adjusted net finance costs of US$331 million (2013: US$345 million) and the group's share of associates'             and joint ventures' net finance costs of US$11 million (2013: US$54 million).
Profit before tax includes net exceptional charges of US$285 million (2013: charges of US$52 million). Exceptional items are explained in note 3.
A reconciliation of adjusted earnings to the statutory measure of profit attributable to owners of the parent is provided in note 5.
Chief Executive's review
Alan Clark, Chief Executive of SABMiller, said:
“We continued to grow earnings in the first half with challenging trading conditions mitigated by ongoing efficiencies. Group net producer revenue was driven by lager growth in Africa and Latin America and strong performance in our soft drinks businesses in Africa, Latin America and Europe. Lower lager sales in parts of Europe and Asia Pacific resulted in a small group EBITA margin decline during the half year.  We are well-placed to capture future top line growth opportunities in both emerging and developed markets and are making good initial progress on our plan to realise US$500 million from operational efficiencies and cost savings.”

Business review
The group delivered constant currency group NPR, EBITA and adjusted earnings growth in the half year, despite trading challenges in a number of markets. The depreciation of key currencies against the US dollar continues to have a negative impact on the translation of financial results in South Africa, Australia and Latin America, resulting in growth of 2% in reported group NPR and reported EBITA level with the prior half year.
Group NPR growth of 5% on an organic, constant currency basis for the first half of the year was driven by our developing market operations in Latin America and Africa through a combination of total beverage volume growth, selective pricing and improved brand mix. Lager volumes declined by 1% on an organic basis reflecting robust growth in Latin America and Africa that only partially offset declines in Asia Pacific and North America, with Europe level with the prior period, outperforming the market. Soft drinks volumes increased by 9%, driven by Africa, Latin America and Europe. 
On an organic, constant currency basis EBITA grew by 3%, while organic, constant currency EBITA margin declined by 30 bps reflecting reinvestment into key customer trading terms in Australia, together with the significant negative impact on profitability resulting from a decline in lager volumes in China and parts of Europe. Input cost increases were mitigated by procurement savings, resulting in a low single digit increase in raw material input costs compared with the prior half year (on a constant currency per hl basis), in line with guidance. Marketing investment increased to support category development such as capturing new occasions, the continuing renovation of our core brands and expansion of our brand portfolios through innovation such as flavoured beer offerings and cider. On a reported basis, EBITA margin also decreased by 30 bps, reflecting the inclusion of the acquisition of the Kingway brewery business in our Chinese associate’s results.
On a constant currency basis, adjusted EPS grew by 5% compared with the prior period, and by 3% on a reported basis reflecting the continuing impact of the depreciation of key currencies against the US dollar, principally the South African rand, Australian dollar, Peruvian nuevo sol, Czech koruna and Turkish lira. Net finance costs were lower than in the prior period, reflecting the repayment of some higher interest bonds which matured in the second half of the prior year.  The effective tax rate of 26.0% is in line with that for the prior year but below the 26.8% in the prior half year.  The reduction in rate primarily results from the resolution during the period of a number of uncertain tax positions.
Free cash flow for the half year was higher by US$591 million at US$1,485 million, positively impacted by some one-off items in the prior half year, such as funding for the Kingway acquisition and the phasing of payments to the Australian Tax Office.  On an underlying basis, free cash flow increased by 6% compared with the prior half year. Adjusted EBITDA was adversely impacted by the depreciation of key currencies against the US dollar in the half year but still grew by 3%.  Working capital registered a cash outflow in the period of US$82 million (compared with an outflow of US$67 million in the prior period). Capital expenditure at US$696 million was slightly ahead of the prior period, with continued investment in brewing capacity and capability, most notably in Africa and Latin America. Net interest paid was lower than in the prior period in line with the reduction in the net finance charge.  Tax paid was lower than the prior period reflecting the tax prepayment to the Australian Tax Office in the prior half year.
 
The group’s gearing ratio as at 30 September 2014 decreased to 46.5% from 52.0% at 31 March 2014. Net debt has reduced by US$1,621 million since 31 March 2014, ending at US$12,682 million, driven by the receipt of the proceeds from the sale of the group’s interest in its hotel and gaming associate in South Africa as well as strong operating cash flow. An interim dividend of 26.0 US cents per share is proposed, to be paid to shareholders on 5 December 2014, an increase of 4% over the prior year.
In Latin America, EBITA grew by 7% (8% on an organic, constant currency basis). Group NPR on an organic, constant currency basis grew by 7% driven by selective price increases and favourable brand mix, supported by our continued focus on market-facing activities and effective trade execution, and a return to lager volume growth in the second quarter, with strong soft drinks volume growth continuing. Reported EBITA margin improved by 70 bps through a combination of group NPR growth, softer commodity prices, cost efficiencies and asset disposals.
In Africa, now including the South Africa beverages business, EBITA grew by 3% (9% on an organic, constant currency basis) as a result of volume growth, pricing and a focus on cost productivity.  The group NPR growth of 3% (10% on an organic, constant currency basis) was driven by share gains, growth in the premium lager segment, strong soft drinks volume growth and pricing. Castle Lite led the robust premium performance and we also grew strongly in the affordable segment. Focus on production efficiencies helped contain variable cost increases as a result of currency weakness and deliver reported EBITA margin growth of 10 bps.  
In Asia Pacific, EBITA declined by 17% and group NPR was level with the prior half year on a reported basis as the inclusion of the Kingway results in China offset the depreciation of currencies against the US dollar at the top line.  On an organic, constant currency basis EBITA declined by 15% driven by Australia and China, with the organic volume decline having a significant impact on profitability. In Australia, NPR on a constant currency basis was 4% below the prior period as a result of increased trade investment activity and competitive price pressure. The integration programme is on track in terms of both synergy delivery and capability build. In China, organic, constant currency group NPR growth of 1% was impacted by a 3% lager volume decline driven by poor weather during the summer peak months in the central provinces offset by favourable mix from the continued focus on premiumisation. Reported EBITA in China declined as a result, diluted by investment in market-facing activities and the inclusion of Kingway. As a result, reported EBITA margin for the region decreased by 410 bps.
In Europe, EBITA was down by 2% and group NPR was up by 1%, both on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, group NPR was 3% higher than the prior half year, reflecting soft drinks volume growth in Anadolu Efes and lager volumes level with the prior period, with a challenging second quarter affected by poor weather across much of the region during the summer months.  Lager volume growth in Poland, the combined Czech Republic and Slovakia business and the UK was offset by declines in Romania, Italy and Anadolu Efes. Organic, constant currency EBITA was level with the prior period and reported EBITA margin declined by 60 bps, driven by lower volume in Italy and Romania, along with restructuring activities in Anadolu Efes.
In North America, EBITA increased by 7% as a result of increased profitability in MillerCoors. Group NPR was 2% higher than the prior period, with a decline in lager volumes offset by higher group NPR per hl, driven by firm pricing and positive sales mix resulting from the introduction and success of new higher margin products such as the Redd’s franchise, Miller Fortune and Smith & Forge Hard Cider. The growth in sales of higher margin products, along with continued cost saving initiatives and maintained marketing spend, helped drive a 100 bps improvement in EBITA margin.
The group completed the sale of its investment in Tsogo Sun Holdings Limited (Tsogo Sun), its hotels and gaming associate listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, in August 2014 through an institutional placing and share buyback. The group received net proceeds of US$971 million, and realised a post-tax profit of US$232 million which has been treated as an exceptional item.  Since August, the disposal of Tsogo Sun has reduced adjusted earnings by around US$10 million in the final two months of the first half of the year. Following the receipt of the net proceeds of this disposal, the group has recently announced that it is exercising its issuer call option to redeem in full its US$850 million 6.5% notes, due 2016.
The new business efficiency programme is on schedule and is expected to deliver operational efficiencies and savings of approximately US$500 million per annum by the financial year ending 31 March 2018. During the first half of this year we continued to expand the scope of our supply chain activities, including expanding the reach of our procurement organisation. Our global business services organisation, which will deliver standardised finance, HR, procurement and data analytics services to the group’s operations, enabled by the global template, from central locations and restructuring of the in-country back office teams, is at an early stage of development. The new programme incurred exceptional costs of US$39 million in the half year (excluding any costs relating to the further deployment of the global template and the running costs of the new global business services organisation, which are now embedded into business as usual costs). 
Outlook
We anticipate that trading conditions will remain challenging but we expect to continue to grow volume and NPR. As part of our strategy we will continue to drive efficiency across our business and invest in the front line so we can win in local markets. Raw material unit input costs are expected to increase by low single digits in constant currency terms with some markets continuing to be impacted by foreign exchange movements on imported raw materials.

Sensex Ends Lower; BPCL, HPCL Slump
NDTV | Updated On: November 13, 2014 16:04 (IST)
BSE Sensex and Nifty ended moderately lower today on profit-taking as investors pared some positions after the recent gains.
The Sensex ended 68 points lower at 27,940 while Nifty settled at 8,357, down 25 points.
Lancelot D'Cunha, CEO of ITI Wealth Management, said markets saw some profit-taking ahead of the weekend. "Markets could see some correction on profit-taking after the sharply rally in which it set new highs. But the undertone remains positive based on medium term trends and fund inflows," he said.
Strong selling pressure in oil retailing companies after BPCL and Indian Oil reported disappointing quarterly earnings. The increase in excise duty on petrol and diesel also weighed on the PSU oil retailers.
BPCL fell 4.5 per cent to be the biggest loser among Nifty companies. HPCL slumped over 6 per cent while Indian Oil fell over 4 per cent.
Oil and gas major ONGC fell nearly 2 per cent while RIL fell 0.5 per cent.
However, some buying in IT stocks helped cap the losses. Infosys, HCL Tech and Tech Mahindra rose between 1 per cent.

Brent Oil Hits Four-Year Low Below $80  Awaits OPECBrent Falls Below $69 as Price Rout Rolls On
London: Brent crude oil fell to a four-year low below $80 a barrel on Thursday after Chinese data showed a further slowdown in activity in the world's biggest energy consumer and Saudi Arabia remained silent about a possible cut in production.
China's economy lost momentum in October, with factory growth dipping and investment growth hitting a near 13-year low, reinforcing expectations of a slower increase in fuel demand from the major emerging nations.
Developing economies have been a major support for oil over the last decade, but their fuel demand is now failing to keep up with increasing supply from North American shale production, which is eating into the traditional market for Middle East oil.
Brent crude for December, which expires on Thursday, fell 83 cents to $79.55, its lowest since September 2010, before recovering slightly to around $79.85 by 0900 GMT.
US light crude was down 40 cents at $76.78 a barrel.
"There are not many bullish factors," said Avtar Sandu, senior manager for commodities at Phillip Futures.
Demand for OPEC oil will drop to 29.20 million barrels per day (bpd) next year, almost 1 million bpd less than it currently produces, the cartel said this week.
Ministers from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries meet in Vienna on Nov. 27 to decide on oil production policy and how to respond to a 30 per cent fall in oil prices over the last five months.
Some OPEC members have said they want the group to cut output. But OPEC's most powerful member, Saudi Arabia, has refrained from backing that view, prompting speculation it is more concerned with keeping market share than supporting prices.
In Mexico on Wednesday, Saudi Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi said the kingdom wanted stable oil prices but did not want to "politicise oil", which was "purely business":
"We do not set the oil price. The market sets the prices."
Carsten Fritsch, senior oil and commodities analyst at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, said some traders understood that comment to mean Saudi Arabia would let prices fall further.
"That is sort of benign neglect -- at least that is what the market thinks," Fritsch said, adding, "I think oil will test lower levels. A decisive fall below $80 for Brent is possible."
Energy Aspects analyst Amrita Sen said: "The silence from Saudi Arabia is very, very damaging because the market tends to interpret and lets its imagination go wild."
US crude stocks fell by 1.5 million barrels last week to 373 million, compared with analysts' expectations of an increase of 800,000 barrels, data from industry group the American Petroleum Institute showed.
Weekly data from the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) will be published at 11:00 a.m. EST (1600 GMT).

Indian Oil Defers Koyali Units  Shutdown to March-April: ReportBuying Iron Ore for First Time in History, Says Tata Steel
New Delhi: Indian Oil Corp has deferred a planned shutdown of key units at its Koyali refinery in Gujarat to March-April 2015 from around October this year to capitalize on sliding crude prices, two company sources said on Thursday.
IOC, the country's biggest refiner, had initially planned maintenance shutdowns of a cooling tower, the fluid catalytic cracker and other facilities at Koyali in September-October.
State-run IOC had already cut throughput at five refineries in September after heavy rains curbed demand for diesel in northern and eastern regions of the country.
It now wants to make up the shortfall and also step up production to benefit from falling crude prices, which will boost its refining margins, the sources, who had direct knowledge of IOC's production plans, said.
"You don't know when this declining trend in crude oil will stop, so we want to maximise our crude processing now and again if product prices go up," said one of the sources.
International oil benchmark Brent traded around $80 a barrel on Thursday, near its lowest since 2010. Crude has slumped more than 30 per cent since June on worries about ample supply and weakening demand.
IOC's head of refineries Sanjiv Singh could not be reached immediately for comments.
The maintenance shutdown in March-April means most of the five crude units at Koyali, which has a refining capacity of 274,000 barrels per day (bpd), will not operate for 10-30 days.

Tough times ahead for basic apparel: Expert
Why Gaza is not remotely occupied (I)By Eugene Kontorovich November 13
The Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court last week found no jurisdiction over Israel’s naval interdiction of vessels seeking to break the Gaza blockade. But she did issue a long obiter pronouncement – albeit non-binding, tentative, and discounted with multiple disclaimers – that it would be “reasonable” to conclude Israel occupies Gaza.
Normally such a tentative statement would not warrant further examination. But even with all the qualifications, the prosecutor’s argument is not reasonable. It is absurd and unprecedented. It embodies principles that have never and can never be applied to other situations. This post will discuss the doctrinal and judicial flaws with the OTP’s analysis. A subsequent post will examine state practice, the insignificance of the alleged powers the OTP claims Israel exercises.
An occupation is traditionally defined as a power exercising “effective control” over the territory in a way that displaces the prior government. The occupying power is expected to provide law and order, essential services, and all the basic functions of government – and is thus required to have the kind of control that allows for that. As the ICJ has put it, occupation requires a territory to be “actually placed under the authority of the hostile army.” There has never been a finding of a such “remote” occupation, lasting nine years after the end of physical occupation and in the presence of a distinct and hostile local government. Indeed, even puppet governments are not considered occupation by the puppet master.
The Prosecutor’s argument lack support in, and contrary to, state practice or judicial precedent. Its sole legal basis is a throw-away dicta in a n opinion by the International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia. That dicta itself was supported by a reference to a not very supportive statement in U.S. Army Field Manuals, that an occupying power need not have actual garrisons in occupied territory, but can merely send troops in. Even if that is true – and it is not the majority view – the occupying power still needs to exercise general governmental control over the territory. As the same field manual says, occupation involves “taking firm possession of enemy territory for the purpose of holding it.”
Indeed, the same ICTY case says that even if troops are not physically present the prior government “must have been rendered incapable of functioning publicly” and the occupying authorities must have “established a temporary administration over the territory.” None of this remotely resembles Gaza. In short, the basic condition of occupation is the substitution of the authority of the occupying power for that of the local authority. But there is no suggestion that Gazan authorities have been “substituted.” Whatever lack of control they may have given Israel’s military and geographic superiority, they maintain daily authority on the ground.
Amazingly, the Prosecutor’s decision directly contradicts recent precedent from the International Court of Justice. In the case of Armed activities on the territory of the Congo ( Uganda v. Congo ) (2005), the Court considered the extent of Uganda’s occupation of the Congo. While Uganda troops ran one province, they put an allied militia in charge of another province. While they supported that militia, and their troops could enter the province, the Court concluded that without the soldiers actually there, it did not amount to an occupation. The Ugandan situation involved far greater control than with Gaza. There, the territory was held by an co-belligerent. In Gaza, it is held by an openly hostile one. Uganda controlled local elections, and removed local officials. Ugandan troops controlled the airport. And even that, in the view of the ICJ – the leading decision on what constitutes occupation – was not enough.
Most oddly, the Prosecutor did not distinguish or discuss Uganda v. Congo at all. That is a glaring omission. On the other hand, the prosecutor astonishingly relies on the view of “the international community” that Gaza is occupied. This view is derived from two U.N. General Assembly resolutions that call Gaza part of “Occupied Palestinian Territories” without explaining how this comports with customary international law definitions of occupation.
This is perhaps the most surprising part of the Prosecutor’s memo. The G.A. is an explicitly political body. Occupation is a legal status with a legal definition established by treaty and custom. Deferring to a political body to determine a legal question effectively turns the ICC into an adjunct of world opinion – a political popularity contest rather than an arbiter of impartial and general norms.

The ICC Prosecutor did not decide Gaza is occupied (or anything else of substance)By Eugene Kontorovich November 13
The Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court announced last week that she would not be proceeding with an investigation of  Israel regarding the Gaza Flotilla incident (Mari Marvara) in 2010. The basis for the dismissal was jurisdictional – the case did not meet the Court’s statutory requirement of gravity. In other words, the crimes alleged, even if true, did not rise to the necessary level of badness to warrant the attention of a court designed to deal with mass atrocities.
The dismissal was easy and predictable. The entire matter was a nuisance suit from the beginning, and no one thought it had any chance of getting off the ground. It could have just as easily been thrown out on complementarity grounds: the ICC can only act when nations with jurisdiction over the crimes are “unable or unwilling” to investigate. Israel has already investigate (and found no wrongdoing), while Turkey is prosecuting the Israeli personnel involved, and proceedings that certainly not designed to shield Israel from immunity.
Oddly, the Prosecutor’s memo said nothing about this other major problem with admissibility. It did, however, entertain a long and detailed discussion of some more merits-sounding issues, in particular, whether Gaza is occupied. The prosecutor said that it would consider – for purposes of determining jurisdiction – that Gaza is occupied. Given the disposition of the case, it seems odd that the prosecutor spent 40 pages of a 60-page report on it (unusually long as far as these things go). It is reminiscent of Marbury v. Madison, and not in a good way: recall that Justice Marshall elaborated at length on the government’s naughtiness before admitting he is actually not seized of the matter at all.
It is worth noting what the ICC did NOT rule: it did not rule anything. That is because the decision in question was not a ruling by the Court, but rather preliminary determination by the prosecutor that the matter is not admissible, and thus cannot proceed. The memo explaining this is not a judicial ruling, and it is not precedential.
The discussion of Gaza is dicta within dicta within dicta. The OTP report itself is not a judicial document; there were multiple other grounds to drop the investigation; even for the jurisdictional issue it was relevant to, the question of occupation was not in the prosecutor’s own admission “not necessary,” and the entire issue was determined not merely on the pleadings, but pre-pleadings – before any factual investigation or the participation of Israel.
Not surprisingly, the conclusions regarding Gaza were explicitly tentative. Thus the OTP memo explained that the characterization of Gaza as occupied is not “conclusive,” is made only for a “limited purpose,” and involves a “case of doubt.” That is enough qualifications and limitations to put if far out of the realm of even the OTP “ruling” that Gaza is occupied.
Even with those disclaimers the discussion was entirely gratuitous. The frolic seems, at best, like a rhetorical sop to those who would otherwise be angered by the ultimate result.
A subsequent post will examine in greater depth the Prosecutor’s dictum about Gaza being occupied on its own merits.

Serial: A podcast unlike any otherBy Stephanie Merry November 13 Follow @stephmerry
Rabia Chaudry had never listened to a podcast until “Serial.” Now, every Thursday morning, the first thing she does before getting out of bed is pick up her phone and start streaming the latest episode.
It’s not what Chaudry envisioned when she contacted Sarah Koenig last year in the hopes that the journalist would revisit a 15-year-old murder case. Chaudry had stumbled upon Koenig’s long-ago reporting for the Baltimore Sun, and thought some new coverage — or “something like ‘Dateline’” — might help free her younger brother’s friend, Adnan Syed, who is serving a life sentence plus 30 years for murdering his ex-girlfriend, Hae Min Lee.
Koenig, who had since gone to work for public radio, was intrigued, and the seeds for “Serial” were planted. But Chaudry had second thoughts. “I didn’t listen to podcasts and I didn’t know how big they were,” she recalled. “I actually thought: Should I really go with a radio story? I wonder if this is the right thing to do; maybe this won’t have such a big impact. Who’s going to listen to this?”

The answer turned out to be: a lot of people. Chaudry isn’t the only one with a first-thing-Thursday appointment with the multi-part true-crime investigation. “Serial,” produced by “This American Life” and WBEZ Chicago, has reigned supreme on iTunes’ top podcast list since it launched Oct. 3, each episode downloaded or streamed at least 1.2 million times — though that could include multiple listens by some avid followers. Unusual for both a podcast and a work of journalism, it has blossomed into a minor watercooler event, spawning the kind of multimedia chatter and analysis that often surrounds a prestigious HBO drama.
The crime dates back to Jan. 13, 1999, when Lee, a Woodlawn High School senior, disappeared. Her body was found less than a month later in Baltimore’s infamous Leakin Park; she had been strangled. Koenig introduces the story in the first episode as “a Shakespearean mash-up”: Lee’s parents emigrated from South Korea, Syed came from a devout Muslim family with Pakistani roots, and the teens kept their eight-month relationship a secret from their parents. Classmates in a magnet program, they remained on good terms after their breakup — a sticking point for those who doubt Syed’s guilt. The prosecution painted Syed as a jealous, scorned lover and relied heavily on testimony from one of his drug-dealing friends.
Each week, Koenig zeroes in on one element of the case — the prosecution’s alleged motive, Syed’s alibi, the man who found Lee’s body — and tries to untangle a mess of details and characters, many of whom have only foggy memories of what they were up to on a particular day 15 years ago. So far, we’ve learned, among other tidbits, that the man who found Lee’s body had a history of flashing; Syed was dating another girl by the time Lee was murdered; a potentially damning phone call was made from Syed’s phone the day of Lee’s disappearance, at a time he claims he was at track practice; and the crusading Innocence Project has become involved in Syed’s case.
As Koenig uncovers evidence, she also lets listeners in on the process of investigative journalism. She has conversations with herself as she weighs new evidence, all of which sounds familiar to Baltimore Sun crime reporter Justin George. He helped Koenig with a bit of reporting (he shows up in episode three) and wrote a story last month about how Syed’s family has been affected by his incarceration .
“The things that she’s saying on the radio are the things maybe a print reporter would be saying in the newsroom — this kind of talking out loud: This is what I think. Does this make sense? But that doesn’t end up in the finished product,” George said. “As she’s discovering new things, the listeners are discovering new things.”
Koenig is an amiable narrator, not to mention a phenomenal detective. She has broken down a complicated tragedy and distilled it into a coherent narrative while injecting humor and emotion into her storytelling. She’s also honest, apologizing for bad quality on some recordings and admitting to certain biases. Sometimes it seems like she wants Syed to be innocent, other times she wonders aloud if he’s a sociopath, but she doesn’t have the evidence to prove either.
And that’s because, for all of the work she’s done over the past year, each installment gets us no closer to a definitive truth, at least thus far. That helps to explain the fanaticism. Everyone is desperate to know: Did Syed do it?
Koenig still isn’t sure. And what’s more, she isn’t certain she’ll ever find out. While she spent about a year doing research for the series, she’s still producing episodes only about a week ahead of broadcast — which is one reason she declined to be interviewed. So as episode eight comes out, she’s working on episode nine. That sounds like a lot of pressure, but it’s what the four-woman team (plus Ira Glass, who serves as editorial adviser) knows best.
“We all come from the ‘This American Life’ side where we are used to deadlines,” said Emily Condon, the show’s production manager. “We are weekly or biweekly broadcasters so that is how we work. A lot of it was just to bake deadlines into the production cycle.”
The investigation is still ongoing as Koenig continues to report out the story. And while the team behind “Serial” thinks there will be 12 episodes in season one, it’s hard to say for sure.
“At any point that could change, if we come across something big that we haven’t anticipated for instance,” Condon said.
So in the meantime, we just wait for Thursday. But as with other habit-forming series, we don’t have to wait alone. For the first time, a podcast has elicited the same cottage industry of recappers and analysts that have sprung up around TV shows like “Game of Thrones” and “True Detective.” There’s a podcast in response to the podcast, on Slate, not to mention quizzes and parodies. Meanwhile, a “Serial” subreddit has become a destination where listeners with a heightened sense of familiarity — they call Koenig SK for short — debate the tiniest details, hoping for the eureka moment that reveals whether Syed actually belongs in North Branch Correctional Institution in Western Maryland.
But as a pop culture obsession, “Serial” is an outlier, not because it’s a podcast, but because it’s a true story. And that raises a host of questions, including: How are we supposed to talk about this? Fans use the language of popular television; they talk of bingeing and addiction and fear of spoilers. Yet Hae Min Lee is not Laura Palmer. She was an actual teenager. That gets to Chaudry sometimes. The immigration lawyer has been invested in this very real case for years.
“There’s so much, ‘oh my gosh, I’m hooked, I’m addicted’ that at some point you feel yourself cringing a bit,” she said. “But at the same time, I can’t be thankful enough for the amount of attention.”
Chaudry admits that, if it wasn’t for the entertainment value of the show, people wouldn’t find it as compelling. So is “Serial” entertainment or journalism?
George has seen both sides — Koenig’s reporting, which he said was dogged, and also the blog posts and stories that have followed, some accusing the show of sensationalizing a real murder.
“But I would ask, how is this different from a lengthy New Yorker piece, just in segments?” George said. “Is it journalism? Absolutely. But are you trying to draw the reader or listener in? Sure.”

It’s working, and that’s why George and Chaudry have found themselves responding to curious fans. That’s another difference with “Serial.” When people wanted to clarify a plot point from “Breaking Bad,” they couldn’t just direct-message Walter White. Listeners pose questions to Chaudry on Reddit and Twitter, and she tends to respond or jump in on threads when she wants to clarify something. She’s in awe of the ways Redditors have helped with the case — drawing maps and tracking down information about where a payphone might have been. One user even typed up a transcript of the show to send to Syed, who isn’t able to listen to the podcast in prison. (He also doesn’t know the extent of the popularity, although according to Chaudry, one of his fellow inmates showed him an article about the show from Rolling Stone .)
It’s possible even that Koenig and her team are getting leads from Reddit or other listeners, although Condon couldn’t comment on that since the investigation is still ongoing.
But at the same time, the threads can be disheartening for Chaudry, who admits she’s looking at all of the evidence through a lens of Syed’s innocence. Some listeners hear the podcast and believe Syed is exactly where he belongs.
“After the first week, I realized it was kind of unhealthy for me to be up in it,” she said. “I needed to kind of step out.”
George, meanwhile, is receiving emails from listeners who want scoops, including more information about a character named Jay, the person who implicated Syed back in 1999. The gist of one email was: I know Koenig is going to talk about it in the next episode, but I can’t wait.
“I didn’t respond,” George said with a laugh. “I don’t have an answer to that.”
That’s what happens when you become a character in a popular story, real or fictional.
“I almost feel kind of hurt because I have more Facebook posts about me being on ‘Serial’ than some of the better stories that I’ve written,” George said. “I think I had about five sentences in episode three.”
That’s to say nothing of the characters who might prefer to remain anonymous. So far in the series, Koenig hasn’t mentioned talking to Lee’s family; George, who helped with the search, isn’t aware that anyone has been able to find them. In the comments section of a Vulture story about the podcast, a reader posted a link to the Facebook page of Jay . One of the threads on Reddit has a list of all the characters, some with links to photos. You start to wonder if the interest in “Serial” may go the way of the witch hunt that wrongly identified the Boston Marathon bomber .
Chaudry has tried to exert control on the conversation by writing about the show on her blog, Split the Moon . After each episode, she adds her own information and also responds to other coverage of the show. She recently wrote a post about Slate’s podcast — “ Serial Spoiler Special ” — which she felt was too flip in its reaction to the latest episode. That installment of “Serial” dealt less with digging for information than with the news that the Innocence Project — the national litigation non-profit that seeks to exonerate the wrongly-convicted — would be looking into Syed’s case. Slate’s writers expressed disappointment in the episode for veering from the more thrilling detective work. This infuriated Chaudry. On her blog, she fired back: “Basically everyone is really disturbed that their precious time was wasted with the irrelevant detail of THE INNOCENCE PROJECT TAKING THE CASE.”
“I hope I wasn’t too harsh in my response,” Chaudry said. “I just want people to be respectful of the fact that it’s not like the latest episode of ‘True Detective.’ And dismissing it as, ‘I was kind of bored?’ You have to elevate the conversation a bit more.”
But even Chaudry is caught up in the cultural implications of being part of a hit show. For example, she knew that the Innocence Project was circling Syed’s case and could have blogged about that, but she chose not to. Although she doesn’t put it in quite these words, she admits that she doesn’t want to be responsible for spoilers.
“I’m trying to honor their work,” she said. “It’s not like I have an agreement with them, but I appreciate what they’ve done and what they’ve created and the incredible amount of work they’ve put in.”
Whatever happens with this season is a big question mark, but the success of “Serial” likely means more seasons to come. Its title is meant to refer to the nature of the show and not murder ( Koenig says that future seasons could have nothing to do with crime ), so it will be interesting to see whether a new topic can keep listeners hooked. In the meantime though, the producers behind “Serial” have created a show that encourages rabid appointment listening and sustained curiosity.

4 Ways to Find More Time for Sales in Your Small Businessreddit
If your sales in your small business aren't hitting your monthly goals, think about devoting more time to developing sales. When you're a 1 person business, it's on you to wear all the hats in your business - including marketing, operations, human resources, and sales, etc. Since cloning is not an option at this point, you must make the best use of the time you spend in your business, with sales at the top of the list. Here are 4 ways to help you find more time for sales in your small business.
1. Make It a Priority
Every element of your business screams for your attention, but few have nearly the impact that sales do. To that end, make sure it's priority for you and move things around so you can focus on increasing sales.
2. Find Extra Time
Before you laugh at the idea of finding an extra second in your overstuffed schedule, hear me out. So many of us waste part of our days on the wrong activities, and it's not even obvious until we really pay attention.
For one week, write everything you do in a calendar, including how much time you spend on each activity. So Monday might look like:
• 8-8:30 am: checked emails and responded to them
• 8:30-8:45 am: coffee break
• 8:45-10 am: wrote blog posts
• 10-10:30 am: aimlessly surfed Facebook [time waster!]
• 10:30-11 am: spoke to client
You get my drift. The goal here is to find those spots of time when you're not doing things that will contribute to the growth of your company. This exercise will also help you assess what tasks you could hand off to others. In this example, you could hire a freelance writer to take over the blogging and free yourself up tremendously.
3.  Set Your Sales Goals
Simply being dissatisfied with your current sales isn't enough. You have to clearly define what it is you actually want. How much do you want to increase them? Which products do you want to sell more of? By setting your intention, you can go a long way to dedicating more energy toward your sales and actually helping them increase.
4.  Set Up Strategy Sessions
If sales don't cross your mind until you see each quarter's low numbers, move it to the front of your mind by putting it on your calendar. Whether you schedule a sales strategy session with co-workers or just yourself, this time should be spent assessing current efforts and coming up with ideas to boost sales. If you have a marketing department, rope them in so the conversation can really dig in to how both sales and marketing can work together toward common goals.

We have just gone through a prolonged period of hyper inflationary state. We saw very steep inflation in food prices, labour, rental, Land Prices (across the towns, cities and villages). It is too early to think of rate cuts. More over month on month INR is loosing against the dollar. Very soon it will cost 67 against the $. Whatever we save on softening of the crude oil prices is given away by INR depreciation. The argument that industrial production will pick up only when the rates are cut is wrong. The is already an over supply in many front - over supply of homes and apartments, excess capacity in cement industries  too many two and four wheeler manufacturers, too many mobile phones manufactures and too many garment manufactures. We are short in agriculture infra and water management and need to stop corruption in bureaucracy, stop pilferage & wastage, Police and labour reforms are also essential. The govt should try to keep their house in order and should not blame RBI governor for sluggishness in growth

I think they were very prompt in spreading the negative news and results.negative results they have disclosed at 11.00 am  during previous quarter. also other negative news be it CFO resignation or invoking of pledged shares etc etc. but they have never tried to restore the investor confidence by giving some clarification or sharing their plan of action or future steps likely to be taken or future guidance etc. I think this time they are having some positive news so seems to be reluctant in disclosing the same.

Government-owned India Post official on Thursday expressed its desire to become a universal bank, at a time when RBI has suggested it to apply for a payments bank.
“The RBI needs to see whether it wants to give a full service bank or a payments bank licence. The Department wants a full fledged bank,” said Pradipta Kumar Bisoi, Chief Postmaster General, Department of Post.
The RBI said it is due to release final guidelines on payment and small banks by this month end. India Post (also known as Department of Post) is one of the front runners in applying for the licence.
Speaking on the sidelines of an event, Bisoi said, “We are already doing (what) a payment bank (does)…So, we don’t know the difference between what the department is doing right now and what the payment bank is.
According to him, a high-powered committee has been formed three months back including former cabinet secretary TR Subramaniyam and Mohandas Pai among others to give recommendations by the end of this month. Hence, the application of the licence will depend on the committee and the Government.
Bisoi also told reporters that the Department has stopped the deployment of ATMs, which it had started earlier this year, due to some technical issues.
To become a universal bank, Bisoi said the Department will have to do some work around upgradation in terms of technology and employees. “It is for the government to decide what and when to apply,” he added.
In its attempt to become a bank, the government entity is also growing its electronic money order and mobile money transfer from the physical one, post office saving deposits, postal life insurance, offering services to book railways tickets and tying up with e-commerce firms among other services to “make post offices a one-stop solution”.
Recently, Communication and IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had said India Post, with the world's largest postal network and its unparalleled rural reach, was best suited to offer delivery services to e-commerce firms.
The government is investing Rs 5,000 crore for the IT modernisation of India Post. “We have about 800 offices across the country already under core banking services and 25,000 of the total 155,000 will come under core-banking and the rest will be linked by the end of next year,” Bisoi said.
We are also looking at giving hand-held devices to over 150,000 post offices in the rural areas,” he added.
Currently, India Post has a total deposit base of about Rs 6 lakh crore.

New Delhi, Nov 13:  
The four state gas companies of Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India have established a company that will build, own and operate the planned 1,800-km Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) natural gas pipeline.
In a statement ADB issued on Thursday, the transaction advisor for the TAPI gas pipeline, said that State concerns Turkmengas, Afghan Gas Enterprise, Inter State Gas Systems (Private) Limited, and GAIL (India) Limited will own equal shares of the company.
Klaus Gerhaeusser, Director General of ADB’s Central and West Asia Department, said that this is a key step towards development of the pipeline network.
November 2013, ADB was appointed the transaction advisor for the TAPI gas pipeline project. Establishment of the TAPI pipeline company is an integral part of the larger goal of identifying and selecting a commercial consortium leader to spearhead the construction and operation of the pipeline.
“When selected, the commercial consortium leader will take a substantial stake in the company,” the statement said.
The TAPI pipeline will export up to 33 billion cubic metres of natural gas annually from Turkmenistan to Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India over 30 years.
Turkmenistan has the world’s fourth-largest proven gas reserves, and the pipeline will allow the landlocked country to diversify its gas export markets to the southeast.

Honda reports new exploding airbag deathMercedes Benz inaugurates Chandigarh's largest dealership
An explosion involving a defective airbag killed a woman in Malaysia, bringing to five the number of deaths believed to be linked to a flaw in parts made by embattled Japanese firm Takata, Honda said today.
The previous four cases happened in the United States, but Honda said one woman died in a July crash after an abnormal rupture of a Takata-made airbag.
“An airbag on one of our vehicles exploded abnormally and a Malaysian woman was killed,” said a Tokyo-based Honda spokesman.
The news came as the car giant announced an additional recall of more than 170,000 vehicles worldwide due to the risk that an explosion could send metal shards from the airbag’s inflator hurtling at drivers.
Takata is facing the biggest test in its 80-year history with lawsuits, a possible criminal probe, and accusations of “deception and obfuscation” over the defect.
Millions of vehicles produced by some of the world’s biggest automakers, including Honda, Toyota and General Motors, are being recalled over the problem.
Honda has been named in a US lawsuit as a defendant, which alleges it conspired with Takata to hide the flaw for years.
The New York Times has quoted former Takata employees as saying secret tests were conducted a decade ago to investigate the defect, but executives ordered the destruction of data that exposed design flaws.
At least three out of the five deaths “were caused by an abnormal explosion of the airbag, including the latest case in Malaysia”, but the other two cases had yet to be confirmed, Honda said.
“We don’t know yet if those deaths were caused by the airbag explosion or by other factors involved in the accidents,” a company spokeswoman said.
Takata’s Tokyo-listed shares have lost about half their value since an investigation was opened in June.
Attention has focused on a Takata plant in Mexico, with suspicions the defect may be linked to a chemical propellant used to inflate the airbags which can more easily rupture in areas with high humidity.
Police reportedly investigated at least one driver death in the US as a murder due to woman’s grisly injuries, until their focus switched to the vehicle’s airbag.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the US auto safety regulator, has expanded its “urgent” warning to owners of cars with affected airbags to take them to dealers to fix the problem.

China violations not serious  says IndiaBomb threat delays Jammu-Delhi Rajdhani by over four hours
Union Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar today said reported incursions by China into Arunachal Pradesh were “not serious” and being effectively tackled by Army on day-to-day basis even as he underlined the need to set up infrastructural back up to handle “these kind of problems”.
“Chinese intrusion is not a serious issue. It is a serious issue for media. The incidents of incursions by China are a small issue that is being tackled by Army chief or the concerned commander in that area,” Parrikar told reporters at a press conference here on his first visit to his home state after taking charge as Defence minister.
Parrikar said there are large tracts of land along the imaginary border and many a times the forces cross it.
“The issue should be considered as serious when they (China) set up their camps in our territory,” he said.
Parrikar said the incursions like the one reported in Arunachal Pradesh “happen many a times in many sectors and are tackled within a day or couple of days.”
“It is not correct to call them as major intrusions. They are breach of LAC,” he added.
Launching a scathing attack on Congress, Parrikar said most of the defence deals executed during the erstwhile Congress-led regime got “stuck up” due to lobbying, vested interest and kickbacks involved.
Underlining the need to remove procedural bottlenecks, Parrikar said if not done it would affect the procurement process.
“The issue of procurement for armed forces has been taken on priority. This is very crucial to built the capability of the armed forces,” the defence minister said.
Interestingly, Union Minister of State for Home Affairs Kiren Rijiju had last month denied any incursion by China’s People’s Liberation Army in Taksing area of Arunachal Pradesh in recent times.
“It is a natural phenomenon as troops from both the sides usually trespass into each other’s territory by mistake as there is no definite demarcation of the border,” he had said.

Delhi Metro  Yamuna expressway  4 other Indian infra projects figure in KPMG world markets reportFIPB role shrinks amid easier FDI flows
Delhi Metro, Yamuna expressway and Tata Power’s Mundra ultra mega power project in Gujarat are among the six ventures that have figured in the list of world’s most innovative, impactful infrastructure projects prepared by international accounting firm KPMG.
The other three projects in the KPMG’s Infrastructure 100: World Markets report are Gujarat International Finance Tec-City (GIFT), Interceptor Sewage System and Narmada Canal Solar project.
These projects were evaluated on the basis of their scale, feasibility, complexity, innovation and impact on society, KPMG said.
“Each country has its own approach to developing and funding infrastructure, yet all share the universal challenge of creating the right conditions to attract investment so desperately needed,” James Stewart, KPMG’s Chairman of Global Infrastructure said.
Opened in 2012, the 165-kilometer, six-lane Yamuna Expressway is India’s longest motorway, connecting the capital New Delhi with Agra and creating a corridor for economic growth, the report said.
By dramatically reducing the travel time between these two historic cities, the USD 1.9 billion project will have a lasting impact on villagers, tourists, traders and working professionals and should expand trade.
The expressway also has symbolic value by showcasing the country’s ability to develop world-class infrastructure.
Ten years after its first line opened, the USD 2.3 billion Delhi Metro continues to expand, setting a shining example of how to carry out an effective public works programme.
Taking heed of the problems experienced by the Kolkata Metro – which was badly delayed and 12 times over budget – the development team utilised innovative procurement and strong project and contract management techniques, it said.
The USD 4.4 billion Mundra Ultra Mega Power Project is a major, coal-fired thermal power plant serving the states of Gujarat, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Haryana and Punjab.
A 25-year concession has led what is a landmark PPP for the Indian energy sector, the report said.
Narmada canal solar another innovative initiative in the state of Gujarat conserves water and generates energy.
The USD 17.9 million Narmada Canal Solar project will place a solar photovoltaic grid over the top of a 5.5 km section of the canal, preventing water from evaporating and producing renewable power, the KPMG report said.
In a form of PPP, Megha Engineering and Infrastructure Limited will build the plant and maintain it for 25 years, it said.
Traditional financial services and IT centres may soon be looking over their shoulders at the Gujarat International Finance Tec City (GIFT) in India.
The USD 20 billion mega-project combines connectivity, infrastructure and transportation with sustainable and environmentally sensitive growth.
India’s USD 323 million Interceptor Sewage System is designed to divert sewage to treatment plants, enabling the river’s water to be used for horticulture and cleaning purposes, the report said.
Stewart, in the report, also said that private capital continues to play a critical role, but investors need economic and political stability before committing.
Consistency and sustainability are key in setting policy, the right regulatory environment and establishing a steady deal flow through project pipelines.
“India’s infrastructure has been a roller coaster ride. While in the past few years have seen a decline in interest around the infrastructure sector, the new government is taking a number of measures to revive investment.
“We believe this could lead to a re-rating of Indian infrastructure,” Arvind Mahajan, Head Government and Infrastructure, KPMG in India said.
The report looks at infrastructure based on the dynamics of four key markets: mature international markets like Canada, Australia, UK, economic powerhouses including the US and BRIC countries, smaller established markets like Chile, Sweden, New Zealand, Korea and emerging markets.
The panel of independent industry experts evaluated over 400 diverse and compelling projects to ultimately select the final 100.

HBSC sees India s RBI holding onto high rates till monsoonFIPB role shrinks amid easier FDI flows
Even though the inflation ebbed to 5.52 per cent in October, foreign brokerage HSBC said the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will adopt a cautious stance on interest rates and a reduction is possible only after the monsoon next year.
It said a rate cut may result in the quality of growth suffering and also heighten the chance of RBI missing its inflation targets.
“The RBI will, therefore, remain cautious about changing its policy stance pre-maturely. At the least, expect a pause till the rains set in next year,” it said in a report released before the October inflation data was announced.
In September, retail inflation stood at 6.47 per cent.
The consumer price inflation, which has been the key factor governing RBI’s rate stance, came in at 5.52 per cent in October, increasing hopes among many quarters of a rate cut to boost economic growth.
After two fiscals of sub-5 per cent growth, the country notched up a 5.7 per cent GDP expansion in the June quarter, which is expected to fall to 5 per cent level due to a slowdown in industrial production.
The RBI wants to get the inflation to 8 per cent by January 2015 and down to 6 per cent by January 2016.
It can be noted that at the last policy announcement, RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan said the inflation will trend lower till the end of the year on a base effect. He has been consistently saying the RBI wants to fight the battle against inflation decisively and ensure the high price rise problem does not arise repeatedly.
Hinting at the upcoming changes in the monetary policy setting system, HSBC said the present rate cut cycle, whenever it starts, will be unique because from now on the RBI may have an explicit inflation target and added that this will put pressure on the RBI.
“Ideally, the nominal policy rate should decline gradually (up to 200bps even) if Prime Minister Modi’s reforms boost productivity in the economy. If this does not happen, the rate cut cycle will be relatively shallow given low tolerance for inflation now,” it added.

Beware of  Pension Predators  Promising Quick CashWatch out for ‘pension predators’ promising quick cash
Herb Weisbaum, TODAY contributor
Email
A pension, for those lucky enough to have one, offers a guaranteed check every month for the rest of your life upon retirement. But a number of companies are now offering an alternative: a pension advance, typically made in one lump sum payment. 
Their pitch, aimed at military and government retirees with generous pension benefits and those with bad credit, is mighty appealing: cash now to pay today’s bills.
Of course, to get tomorrow’s money today, you have to sign over your future pension payments for a specified number of years.   
KAREN BLEIER / AFP/Getty Images
Beware of 'pension predators' promising quick cash in return for signing over your future benefit payments.
“It’s just a lousy deal,” said John Wasik, a personal finance columnist and author of "Keynes’ Way to Wealth." “I wouldn’t recommend this for anyone under any circumstances because the fees are so high.”
Another costly gotcha: You may be required to buy a life insurance policy that names the pension advance company as beneficiary, to protect them if you die.
Mark Corbett runs the website Buy Your Pension , which helps facilitate pension sales. He told TODAY that a pension advance is not for everyone, but he believes it can be beneficial for some people.
“You should not sell your pension unless it saves you money,” he said. “For example, you are using it to pay off bills.”
Four years ago, Corbett got an advance on his private pension — selling a $237,000 nest egg for $89,000 — to pay off his mounting bills. He called it “a godsend” that reduced his stress and probably added years to his life.
Hold on, not so fast
A number of consumer protection agencies, however, including the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) recently issued warnings about the downsides of pension advances.
“There are serious financial consequences down the road for taking the money in a lump sum now,” said Gerri Walsh, FINRA’s senior vice president of investor education. “You are getting less money than if you waited and got those monthly pension payments.”
Unlike a traditional loan, you can’t get out of the deal early. If you signed up for a six-year payout, the company gets your pension for a full six years.
“A pension advance is unlike any other type of financing, because you’re required to sign over part of your future income stream,” said Leah Frazier, an attorney for the FTC. “You could find yourself in a situation down the road where you need money for your basic expenses, but you don’t have it because you took it as an advance.”
And remember: Getting a lump sum pension payment is likely to have some serious tax implications.
“It could push you into a higher tax bracket,” said Lisa Greene-Lewis, lead CPA at TurboTax . “I could see people doing this and getting shocked by the additional taxes they now have to pay.”
Banned in Missouri
Companies are no longer allowed to sell pension advances to public employees in Missouri. Last month, it became the first and only state to ban them.
“Not only did we protect our police officers, firefighters, teachers and veterans, but we sent a message that we don’t want these predatory businesses in Missouri,” said state Treasurer Clint Zweifel . He calls a pension advance “a payday loan” without a cap on the interest rate.
Federal regulators have warned about these companies, but they haven’t done much to regulate the industry. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) recently recommended that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Federal Trade Commission study the marketplace and “exercise oversight or enforcement” as appropriate.
GAO investigators who did undercover shopping at 38 web-based pension advance companies found a range of “questionable business practices.” In a report released last month, GAO concluded that the offers it received “did not compare favorably with other financial products or offerings, such as loans and lump-sum options through pension plans.”
Are there other options?
Financial experts advise people who need cash in a hurry to try some other way to get the money first. Talk to your pension administrator to find out if you can get an advance. Maybe you could borrow from a family member or take out a home equity loan. You’d probably be better off in the long-run, they say.
If you find yourself tempted to use a pension advance service, stop and talk to your financial adviser. You need to find the true costs and overall implications of such a transaction. Experts say the effective annual percentage rate for these loans can be 100 percent or more.
“A pension advance is a very expensive way to go,” said Doug Shadel with AARP’s Fraud Watch Network . “Remember, most of these companies are interested in making money, not your long-term financial well-being.”
A recent AARP bulletin warns people to Beware of the Pension Predators .

Scores of Americans Have Goose Egg for Nest Egg
Millionaires Loath to Give up the Daily GrindMillionaires really are different; they don't want to retire!
Robert Frank CNBC
Email
David Goldman / AP
CNN founder Ted Turner, 75, like many wealthy people, has not retired. He simply   "works" at other things now, including being an environmentalist, humanitarian, philanthropist, restaurateur and bison rancher.
The leisure class is getting far less leisurely—especially in retirement.
Millionaires are twice as likely to keep working in retirement than the broader population, according to a new survey from Merrill Lynch and Age Wave. 
A third of the people polled with $1 million to $5 million in investible assets are currently working in retirement. That compares with just 15 percent of those retirees with less than $250,000 who are still working.
What's the point of working if you're rich enough to retire? Because they enjoy it. Nearly all of the affluent retirees surveyed said they keep working because "they want to," according to the study.
Today's boomer retirees are climbers and strivers, and sitting on a beach or playing shuffleboard can only satisfy their soul for so long. Everyone needs a game to play—even when you've already won. 
Wealthy retirees cite "staying mentally active" as the top specific reason they continue to work, according to the study. They cited that response six times more than "for the money." They also said their work in retirement keeps them more youthful, fit and mentally sharp.
But there are other reasons the rich keep working. More than half of affluent retirees work for themselves and own their own businesses. Being able to set your own hours, your own pay, your own office and your own direction is a lot more enjoyable than bagging groceries or reporting to a cubicle every morning.
Their definition of "work" is also a bit more flexible. About half of wealthy retirees took a break from work when they first retired. The study calls this a "career intermission." It's a chance to recharge, relax and find a new career.
That new career may not be as demanding as their last. Half of wealthy retirees have transitioned to new lines of work that give them more "flexibility," "fun" and "fulfillment." A former real estate developer, for instance, may turn to buying and restoring old homes for profit. A CEO may turn to career training or mentoring. And an entrepreneur may become an angel investor.
So yes, the wealthy work more in retirement. But their "work" is much more fun.

How to Donate to a Cause and Benefit on TaxesJon Sweeney / NBC News
Charitable giving may be tax deductible, what you should know.
Nothing is more rewarding than making a donation to a  worthy cause — except, perhaps, donating to a worthy cause and getting a  tax deduction for it.
While most donations stem from a desire to make a  positive impact, there's no denying that tax deductions are a big  incentive—especially among the wealthy.
In a study of high-net-worth philanthropy by Bank of  America, about 33 percent of those surveyed said tax benefits were  their motivation for giving, and nearly half said they would decrease  their charitable giving if tax deductions were eliminated.  
However, because there are so many rules and requirements  surrounding charitable giving, donors often miss out on the tax benefits  they deserve.  So before you make another donation, be sure you are up  to date on the dos and don'ts of charitable giving to ensure your good  intentions are paying off in every way.
Do make sure the organization is tax-exempt. One of the biggest mistakes people make is not making sure they're  giving to a qualified organization, said certified financial planner  Stephen Aucamp, senior adviser and executive director of the Ultra-High  Net Worth Group at Convergent Wealth Advisors.
"I had a situation last year where a client gave  several hundred thousand dollars to an organization that she thought was  a charitable organization supporting a museum," he said.
Unfortunately, "the person she was donating to  hadn't gone through the proper steps to become a qualified charity, so  she lost the deduction," he explained.
The Internal Revenue Service has a complete list and searchable database of tax-exempt charities on its website. 
Do have your paperwork in order. If you're planning  to deduct a donation, you need proof, such as a receipt, canceled check  or acknowledgment letter from the charity. For text-message donations,  you'll need the phone bill with the organization's name, contribution  amount and date; for donations deducted from your paycheck, you'll need  your pay stub and donor pledge card showing proof of your gift.
If you are donating an item worth more than  $5,000, you'll also need a letter from a qualified appraiser valuing the  property.
For all deductions, you must file a Form 40 with  the IRS and itemize your deductions on Schedule A. If your non-cash  donations exceed $500, or if you're donating items worth more than  $5,000, you'll need to include IRS Form 8283, as well.  
Do understand what counts as a donation. You're only making a donation if you're not getting anything of equal  value in return. This is particularly relevant when it comes to charity  dinners and auctions.
In the case of charity dinners, you can only  deduct the difference between what you paid for the meal and its fair  market value, according to Carol Kroch, managing director for wealth and  philanthropic planning with Wilmington Trust.
If you paid $100 and the meal is valued at $100, you haven't actually made a donation.
The same is true with charitable auction items, she  said. If you buy a $500 painting that's valued by the charity at $500,  there is nothing to deduct. However, if the painting is valued at $300  and you pay $500, then you've made a $200 deductible gift. Raffle  tickets are never tax-deductible. 
Do run the numbers. "Before you make a  contribution of something large, you want to have a plan," said Kroch,  adding that your yearly tax savings will depend on a combination of  factors, including your adjusted gross income, the type and value of  your donations, whether you're subject to the alternative minimum tax  and the type of charity to which you're donating.
Additionally, she said, a phase-out of itemized  deductions was reinstated in 2013 for taxpayers with higher adjusted  gross income. Depending on your income and other deductions, your  charitable deductions may be reduced, which is why you need to have a  plan that will allow you to optimize your deductions.  
Don't assume cash is best. While donating cash is easy, it's not always the most tax-advantageous way of giving.
"People often get an idea to donate but don't  clearly think through a plan of what's the best asset to donate," said  Donald Tharp, certified financial planner and president of Hudson  Financial Advisors.
One common mistake, he said, is selling low  cost-basis stocks and then donating the cash. When you sell the  security, you have to pay capital gains taxes of 20 percent and the new  3.8 percent Medicare surtax on net investment income—depending on your  adjusted gross income. After taxes, you're left with a smaller donation  and a smaller deduction.
It's often better to donate the security, let the  charity sell it tax-free, and get your full deduction. You can do this  as long as you have held the security for at least one year.
If you have a piece of appreciated real estate,  it's often advantageous to donate it rather than selling it and donating  the cash. 
Don't assume all property is treated equally. Tax laws are incredibly complicated, particularly when it comes to  giving big gifts. The rules differ, depending on what you're donating:  There are special rules for clothing and household items, used motor  vehicles, artwork and even taxidermy.
That's why it's important to know exactly what you're doing before attempting to make a donation.
Artwork, for instance, is particularly tricky.  According to Aucamp, it's possible to benefit tax-wise by donating art,  "but the regulations have gotten stricter and are pretty complex."
"You have to dot your i's and cross your t's or  you'll lose your deduction," he added. "Often, clients will not get the  outcome that they want unless they are willing to spend a lot of money  to do it right. … So you really need a good adviser who can navigate the  complexities."

College Costs Conundrum: Parents Fret About RetirementParents worry that high college costs will hurt their retirement, survey shows

Parents worry that they won't have enough to retire as a result of their kids' college tuition costs.
As families struggle to pay the skyrocketing costs of higher education, a growing number of parents are concerned that the money they borrow for their child’s tuition will hurt their retirement.
In a recent survey, a majority (54 percent) of the parents said they’re worried that their retirement will be jeopardized by student loan debt. That survey was done for Citizens Financial Group which operates Citizens Bank and Charter One Bank.
“Households are feeling the pinch of higher tuition costs and it’s starting to impact other big things in their lives,” said Brendan Coughlin, president of auto and education finance at Citizens Financial Group. “Getting a college degree is still very much a part of the American dream.
"Parents are very aware and supportive of this, but they’re also very worried about the cost and how to pay for it.”
It’s not surprising that most parents (94 percent) said they feel an increased financial burden from their child’s college debt, according to this survey. What’s alarming is the fact that nearly half (45 percent) said they don’t have a plan to pay for that debt.
“People who have a financial plan for any sort of major expense are more likely to succeed,” said Robert Brokamp, editor of the Motley Fool Rule Your Retirement newsletter. “If you don’t have a plan for how you are going to pay off those loans, you’re just flying blind. It will take much longer and you’ll wind up paying more.”
Brokamp, a former financial adviser, thinks college financial planning should start well before your child is a junior or senior in high school and before you apply for financial aid or take out any loans.
“When it comes time to take out loans, look at who applies for them,” Brokamp said. “Kids will often be eligible for lower-rate loans and loans where the interest is tax deductable.”
Of course, free money is the best. Exhaust all sources of grants and scholarships before you start applying for loans.
“Parents who borrow to help their children pay for college should not borrow more than they can afford to repay in 10 years or whenever they retire, whichever comes first,” advised Mark Kantrowitz, senior vice president and publisher of Edvisors.com, a website that provides free information to families about financial aid and dealing with college costs.
Kantrowitz urges parents to save as much as possible before their child enrolls in college, because it’s so much cheaper to save than borrow. “When you save, you’re earning the interest; when you borrow, you’re paying the interest,” he said. “Every dollar you borrow will cost about two dollars by the time you pay back that debt.”
Keep in mind: Most financial experts advise parents to focus on their retirement first and their children’s college education second. “It may not be easy to do, but you have to pay yourself first and too many people get that backwards,” said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com.
“The kids can borrow to go to college, you can’t borrow to retire.”

Rule  Britannia! Welcome to the World s Priciest City
Seattle Mansion Boasts Amazing View -- For a Price1919 NW Blue Ridge Dr, Seattle, WA
For sale: $3,695,000
During the Great Depression, airplane tycoon William Boeing cleared 200 acres of timber from a scenic piece of Seattle and built brick mansions intended for his executives.

The new neighborhood, dubbed Blue Ridge, was initially unpopular and remote.  Rumor has it that the first road through the neighborhood was built to give bootleggers smuggling booze in by boat a path through to the city.

As the Great Depression waned, some Boeing executives began building  homes in the neighborhood . Among the first was Donald "D.R." Drew, Boeing's financial secretary. Drew and his elegant wife built several homes, eventually settling in this modern down a gated drive. Originally, it had an indoor pool.

The couple was well-known in the close-knit neighborhood, especially because of a famous, frequent visitor. Bob Hope used to spend time at the house, sleeping there when he was in town and attending parties.
The  Blue Ridge neighborhood is still an enclave for the very wealthy, with a clubhouse and private pool. Since Boeing built the neighborhood, it has filled in to include about 450 homes along winding streets, many with beautiful views of the Puget Sound and Olympic Mountains.

The home faces the water, with walls of windows offering a 180-degree view. Inside, the bright white home has mid-century lines, but a decidedly contemporary feel.

Study: Online Payday Lenders Often  FraudulentEmail
Going online to apply for a payday loan is convenient and confidential – but it’s also risky, according to a report released Thursday by the Pew Charitable Trusts .
This first-ever national survey of payday loan borrowers found that a number of fraudulent, abusive and even illegal practices were often associated with these Internet lenders. The key findings:
32 percent of online customers report having an unauthorized withdrawal from their bank account
46 percent said the lender made a withdrawal that overdrew their checking account – twice the rate of those who borrowed from a payday loan store
30 percent said they were “threatened” in some way by the lender or a debt collector
39 percent discovered that their personal or financial information was sold to another company without their knowledge

Going online to apply for a payday loan is convenient and confidential – but it’s also risky, according to a new report by the Pew Charitable Trusts.
“Our report makes clear that abusive practices in the online payday loan market not only exist but are widespread,” said Nick Bourke, director of Pew’s small-dollar loans project.
Online payday loan companies have advertised aggressively in the last few years and it has paid off. Since 2006, revenue generated from these short-term loans tripled, topping $4 billion last year, the report noted.
As the industry has grown, so have the complaints.
Pew estimates about 90 percent of the payday loan complaints to the Better Business Bureau are for online lenders, even though just 30 percent of payday loans originate online. Most of these complaints deal with billing or collection issues and most are against online lenders that are not licensed in every state where they do business.
Pew points out that many of the problems it uncovered violate the guidelines of the industry’s own trade group, the Online Lenders Alliance (OLA).
“While there are bad actors out there that should be identified and driven out of business, OLA and its members are working to ensure consumers are treated fairly and use the lending products responsibly, including providing assistance, such as a repayment plan, when consumers are unable to repay their loans,” Lisa McGreevy, OLA’s president and CEO, said in a statement.
Ads can mislead
Payday loans are advertised as short-term loans – typically a two-week, flat-fee cash advance. But all too often, that’s not the case.
Pew researchers concluded that many online payday loans are designed to promote “long-term indebtedness” because they automatically renew at the end of the pay period – which results in an additional fee.
Nearly a third of the online borrowers interviewed by Pew said they discovered that the lenders only withdrew the fee and not the principal on the due date. As a result, they could make payments forever and never pay off the loan.
Keep in mind: Online payday loans are not a bargain. The typical fee for borrowing $100 for two weeks is $15 at a storefront and $25 online.
Online payday lending is different
In most cases, online lenders get their customers from lead generators, which are independent companies that place the ads and collect the personal information from the borrower. Lead generators sell completed applications, which often include checking account and Social Security numbers, to potential lenders.  
Even after a lender buys that lead, it can still be available for others to buy.
This exposes the borrower to unauthorized withdrawals and the potential for identity theft.  As the report noted, “This practice of reselling leads creates opportunities for fake debt collectors and others to buy the information and attempt to collect money using aggressive tactics.”
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is drawing up proposed rules to regulate the online payday loan industry. Pew said it would like to see safeguards that protect small-dollar borrowers from unscrupulous lenders, and apply rules that prohibit lending to customers who are unable to repay the loan.
The bottom line
Consumer advocates have long advised against payday loans because of the steep fees and the lump-sum repayment requirement. Pew’s research shows that the average person who takes out one of these two-week loans is actually in debt for five months of the year.
This new report makes it clear that the potential for problems is much greater when the transaction takes place online rather than at a store. And if something does go wrong, it’s often a lot harder to deal with it.
If you have a problem with an online payday lender, file a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

Think Twice Before Paying Tuition With a Credit CardPaying college tuition with a credit card can be costly
Herb Weisbaum NBC News contributor
Oct. 6, 2014 at 9:56 AM ET
Many families are forced to get creative to pay the staggering cost of college. About 3 percent of parents and 3 percent of students now use a credit card to cover some of the tuition bill, according to Sallie Mae.
"Convenience fees" make that a bad idea for many people.

A new survey shows that many colleges and universities that accept credit cards for tuition payments also charge a "convenience fee," which can end up being costly.
“It doesn’t make sense to pay your tuition with a credit card, if you’re charged a convenience fee,” said Matt Schulz, a senior analyst at CreditCards.com.  A new survey of the 100 largest public, private and community colleges by the website shows the average convenience fee for paying tuition with a credit card is 2.62 percent. That would be a $262 fee for every $10,000 charged.  The highest fee was 2.99 percent. “Even if you avoid interest by paying the bill promptly, the convenience fees outweigh the potential benefits of almost all credit card rewards programs,” Schulz said.
CreditCards.com found that 87 percent of the 300 colleges and universities surveyed accept credit cards for tuition payments for some students. Of those, 12 percent of community colleges charge  a convenience fee. That climbs to 90 percent of public universities and 69 percent of the private institutions that accept credit card payments.

Decades of Debt: Loan-Strapped Grads Delay Marriage
When Is It Okay To Borrow From Your 401(k)Email
When times are tight, that money sitting in your 401(k) can look very tempting. If it's the difference between paying hospital bills, getting out of crushing debt or fixing a hole in the roof, it can be hard not to dip in. But is it always a smart idea? That's just one of the several most frequently asked questions about 401(k)s. Here's the answer to that and other common 401(k) questions.
Q: Can I borrow from my 401(k)?
A: You can, but it’s not generally a good idea for several reasons.  If you leave a company, you typically have to repay the loan within 60 days.  If you don’t have the money because you’ve used it for something else, it will be treated like a withdrawal – meaning you’ll pay income taxes and penalties.  That can cost 30 to 40 cents on the dollar.  Ouch.  The other reason, though, is that when your money is not in your 401(k) it’s no longer growing tax deferred.  The S&P 500 is up more than 90 percent over the last 5 years.  That’s a lot of growth to have missed.  
Video: TODAY’s financial editor Jean Chatzky offers advice on how to handle your 401(k), including how much you should contribute, and explains the difference between a Roth 401(k) and a regular 401(k).
Q: If my employer isn’t matching my contributions should I still put money into a 401(k)?
A: Generally, yes.  401(k)s work because they get around the human factor.  They swipe your money out of your paycheck before you have a chance to see it or touch it. If you do want to tap it before you hit retirement age you face nasty taxes and penalties, so you’re more inclined to keep your hands off.  We need that automation working in our favor. You can also put much more money into a 401(k) than you can into an IRA or Roth.  
Q: I’m leaving my job, what should I do with my 401(k)?
A: Generally, you have four choices: You can cash out and pay income taxes as well as a 10 percent penalty if you’re not 59 ½.  Let’s take that bad option off the table.  That leaves you with three more.  You can leave the money in your former employer’s plan, roll it into your new employer’s plan, or roll it into an IRA.
Many people will tell you that an IRA is absolutely the way to go – but it isn’t always.  Although you have a wider variety of investments with an IRA, the cost may be higher.  IRA’s frequently charge an annual, not-too-high maintenance fee, but the expenses associated with buying the individual mutual funds you’re likely to invest in may be much higher.  When you’ve got the money in a 401(k), it’s like being in a group health insurance plan – you have the purchasing power of a an entire plan behind you.  You’re not operating on your own. The thing to do is compare both the costs of your old plan, new plan and an IRA and the costs of the investments you’re interested in.  And if you DO roll your money into either an IRA or your new plan, make sure the transfer happens directly.  You do NOT want a check being cut to you.
Jean also answered viewers 401(k) questions in a live Twitter chat using #getaplan.
Q: I’m now being offered both a Roth 401(k) and a regular one – which is best?
A:  You’re not alone.  Roth 401(k)s have only been around since 2006, but more than half of employers now offer them.   A quick reminder of the difference between Roth and Regular – it works the same way with 401(k)s as it does with IRAs.  With a Roth, you pay taxes on the money before you it goes into the account.  But you don’t have to pay taxes upon withdrawal.  With a traditional or regular 401(k) you put in pretax money -- and get a tax deduction for doing so -- and you pay taxes when you pull the money out in retirement at whatever your tax rate is then.  So, if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement (or if you expect tax rates to go up) putting some money in a Roth is a good idea.  Similarly, if you’re young and have decades for the money to grow tax-free, Roths work in your favor.  (When you’re young, your likely not at your peak earning potential, which means you don’t lose as much on the tax deduction.)  One thing to keep in mind: It’s not bad to split the difference.  At retirement, it helps to have some money you’ve already paid taxes on and other money that is tax-deferred.  If you’ve already got a Roth IRA, using a traditional 401(k) as a supplement is a good way to go.  If you make too much money ($129,000 for singles, $191,000 for married couples) to qualify for a Roth IRA, a Roth 401(k) is nice work-around.
Q: How much should I be putting into my 401(k)?
A: More employers are “defaulting” their employees into their 401(k) plans.  The problem is, they put them in at a contribution level – typically – of just 3 percent.  That is not going to give you enough money to retire.   Instead, if you earn less than $50,000 you should try to save between 9 percent and 12 percent of your income including what your company matches.  If you earn between $50,000 and $100,000 you should be saving 12 percent to 15 percent including what your company matches.  And if you earn more than $100,000 you want to be saving at least 15 percent (more if you can) including what your company matches.   Don’t try to do this all at once.  Research has shown that we can save 2 percent more than we are saving now and not notice it.  So nudge your contribution up by 2 percent now and then do that again every six months to a year until you get where you need to be.

4 Tips For Cheap Thanksgiving FlightsEmail
If you’re thinking of flying over the Thanksgiving holiday, you should probably think like a comedian: Timing is everything and if you get it wrong, it won’t be pretty. Here are four tips that can turn that frown upside down:
When to fly: Wednesday-Sunday itineraries are always popular and pricey but this year a little flexibility can net surprisingly big savings. Switching to a Monday-Friday itinerary, for example, could save you $297 on holiday flights between New York and Los Angeles, $262 between Chicago and Miami, and $183 between Denver and Dallas, according to a search on CheapAir.com last week.
“The day you return makes a bigger difference than the day you depart,” said CEO Jeff Klee, “so it’s more important than ever to avoid that Sunday.”
CJ GUNTHER / EPA
Travelers check the status of flights at Boston's Logan International Airport on Nov. 27, 2013.
How to fly: If you truly want the lowest fare, you’ll probably have better luck looking at connecting flights simply because there are more ways to connect city pairs if you add a stop. You’ll save money but, rest assured, the airline will still get its pound of flesh. “The lowest fare may be a terrible option; it might have a really long layover,” said Klee.
When to book: That old saw about Tuesday being the best day to book just doesn’t cut it anymore, and fare prediction remains an inexact science at best. According to data compiled by Kayak.com, average fares actually dropped between mid-October and early November last year, but counting on a repeat is not for the faint of heart or thin of wallet.
“If you think some amazing deal on that non-stop is going to show up on Nov. 5, it isn’t going to happen,” said Rick Seaney, CEO of FareCompare.com. “And once it’s inside 14 days, business fares start kicking in. If you buy in mid-November, you’re going to be treated as if your boss is paying for your ticket.”
How to keep things in perspective: Barring another recession or a sudden rash of Ebola-on-a-plane incidents, flying will remain an expensive proposition, especially during the high-demand holiday season. But it could be worse.
“Fares are basically pacing inflation,” said Seaney. “The good news is that they’re only a couple of percentage points higher than last year. The bad news is that last year was the highest we’ve seen during this timeframe.
“If you’re willing to accept a less-convenient flight, you may be able to find a better bad deal.”

The Secret to Getting a Cheap Thanksgiving FlightIn fact, since airline fares are notoriously difficult to understand , often the better question to ask is what not to do when you’re booking Thanksgiving flights.
Here are a few tips that travel search engines all agree on:
Don’t book a departure flight on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving (Nov. 26), or a return flight on the Sunday after Thanksgiving (Nov. 30).
Airfares increase as flights get fuller, and the Wednesday and Sunday flanking the Thanksgiving holiday are when the most people are traveling. A simple airfare search shows just how much more expensive it is to book travel on one of these days. In some cases, fares are up to twice as high.
If you have to book for Wednesday or Sunday, then book your tickets as early as possible.
If you’re locked into a Wednesday departure flight, aim for a Friday or Tuesday return flight, which is around 25% cheaper than returning on Saturday, Sunday or Monday, according to an analysis by Cheapair.
Booking a return flight on Sunday results in the most dramatic airfare spike, and there’s not really much you can do to save money other than to book your departure flight on Thanksgiving Day. But the tradeoff of sacrificing a chunk of your holiday is a discount of only about 10%, so it may make more sense to pick a different day—even if it’s Wednesday. In general, having a Sunday return flight means you’re stuck with a sky-high ticket price.
Consider booking a departure flight or return flight on Thanksgiving Day—or both.
If you depart and return on Thanksgiving Day, your fare may be up to 30% cheaper than the average price, according to Kayak . And even if you only depart (and not return) on Thanksgiving, those savings are particularly meaningful when applied to longer, more expensive flights. For example, flying the JFK-LAX route departing on Thanksgiving instead of the day before can save you nearly $100.
Don’t book flights in groups.
If you’re booking as a family and there are only a few flights left in the lowest fare category, it’s possible the airline will bump the entire party up to the next fare category, according to Cheapair . That doesn’t mean you can’t travel as a family, though: you just might have to book each person’s ticket individually.
Check other smaller airports nearby.
There’s often regional and even international airports near the ORDs, JFKs and LAXs of major U.S. cities. If you’re in Chicago, for example, consider Chicago Midway Airport instead of O’Hare; if you’re in Los Angeles, consider Long Beach Airport instead of LAX. Both are cheaper airports than their neighboring giants, according to Cheapflights.com, which ranked the nation’s 101 most affordable airports.
Check smaller airlines.
The five biggest U.S. airlines—American, United, Delta, Southwest and JetBlue—all increased their base fares slightly despite lower fuel prices and a worldwide fear of Ebola. While the effect on consumers is not yet clear, it’s also worth checking out smaller airlines like Spirit, Frontier and Virgin.

End-of-Year Tune-up Tips for Savvy TravelersEmail
Joe Raedle / Getty Images
Even the savviest traveler can use a few new tricks each year, whether on the road for business or leisure.
Flying frugally
Before the end of the year, take inventory of your frequent flier miles. Claim credit for any missing miles and decide if you can top off—with an extra flight, hotel stay or mile-generating purchase—accounts where you are close to getting elite status perks for the following year.
When shopping for new flight reservations, sign up for fare alerts, enlist helpers such as Kayak's  price forecasting tool and remember the " 24-hour reservation requirement " put into effect in January 2012 by the U.S. Department of Transportation. The rule requires carriers to hold a flight reservation for 24 hours without payment, or allow a reservation to be canceled within 24 hours without penalty if the reservation is made one week or more ahead of the flight's departure date.
"If you see an airfare you're comfortable with, book it," said Kayak spokeswoman Maria Katime. You can continue your research and, if you find something better, go back and cancel.
Reasonable rental cars
When it comes to cars, reserve once you know your dates and have done some shopping, but recheck prices closer to the time of travel. "Prices can drop last-minute, depending on the actual availability of cars versus what the companies anticipate," said travel expert  Carol Pucci , who saved more than $100 with this method on the Big Island of Hawaii. Just make sure you don't pre-pay, she said.
To make sure a rental car company doesn't charge you for scrapes, scratches or dings already on the car you're issued, "take pictures of the car before you drive it away and when you return it," said Joe Brancatelli, publisher of the business travel website  Joe Sent Me .
"Rental firms are getting extremely aggressive about these charges and since the cars in the fleet are older these days than they used to be, there's more of a chance you'll be given a car with a ding and/or scratches," he said.
Honing in on hotel deals
Sign up for the frequent stay program of any hotel you visit to take advantage of free perks that can include complimentary breakfast, free Wi-Fi and welcome amenities such as cheese plates and bottles of wine for even the first-time guest.
Research room rates and hotel property reviews online, but as a final step, call the hotel you've chosen. "Once I narrow down my hotel choice, I call the hotel to see if they have any better offers then what I see online," said Rob Connors, assistant vice president of marketing for National Car Rental. "Your membership in a club or association might get you an added discount, and many times hotels offer special rates for suppliers calling on nearby companies."
Boarding the bus
"Bus travelers typically save 50 to 55 percent versus the train and 55 to 73 percent versus flying," said Joe Schwieterman, a professor at DePaul University in Chicago who studies transportation.
"The 'sweet spot' for bus travel involves trips between 125 and 300 miles. Driving can be tedious, but air travel is often not cost effective," he said.
And for the best deals, you book 30-45 days in advance, said Megabus spokesman Mike Alvich.
Smarter destination choices
You may not have much choice where business trips take you, but you can save money on leisure trips and avoid crowds by heading for South Africa, Shanghai, Uruguay, Portugal or some of the other "best-value" destinations on  Lonely Planet's Best Travel 2015 list. 
Choosing "almost-as-good" alternatives to classic experiences in more expensive cities can also save cash.
"European cities are stuffed full of amazing historic buildings and churches that can be seen and explored for free without the crowds of big-name things," said Lonely Planet's editorial director, Tom Hall. "Gorilla trekking might be an unforgettable experience in East Africa, but looking out for chimpanzees and smaller primates can be much more fun and is certainly easier on the wallet."

We Are Wearables meetup expands to Chicago  features Moto 360 watch1
“I feel it’s really important to actually play with the stuff, in order to see its potential value in your life,” said Emrich, a Glass Explorer who wore Google Glass throughout the event.
Emrich started the Toronto group in January. That group’s meetup.com membership has more than 1,800 members, and about 350 people attend monthly events, he said.
Meetup.com shows about 300 We Are Wearables members in Chicago.
Emrich said he doesn’t make money running the groups. He does it “to help push the wearable-tech boulder up the hill perhaps a little faster than if I wasn’t around.”
He said he’s looking for someone to run the Chicago group and that several people approached him after Monday’s event.
Motorola Mobility’s Dickon Isaacs provided one of Monday’s highlights, walking through the Moto 360 design process. Isaacs, Motorola’s design director for wearables, said the key moment in the process came when the team scrapped various prototypes and decided to “design with conviction.”
“Instead of designing around what could be done with the current technology,” he said, “we decided we would design for what it (the Moto 360) should be.”
That quickly led them to choose the watch-like design, which he said people find more comfortable, partly because it’s what they are used to. He also said they made it fashionable, with options such as leather or metal for the band.
Isaacs did not discuss sales figures for the watch, released in September. But called the launch a success and said further iterations are planned.

Wal-Mart Is Making Black Friday a 5-Day MarathonEmail
Thanksgiving and Black Friday just weren't enough.
With a string of retailers pushing their sales ever earlier on Thanksgiving  Day, Wal-Mart is shifting gears  this year by extending its Black Friday discounts through the entire weekend.
Brandon Wade / AP
With a string of retailers pushing their sales ever earlier on Thanksgiving Day, Wal-Mart is shifting gears this year by extending its Black Friday discounts through the entire weekend.
Still, that's not to say the retailer will miss out on the Thanksgiving buzz.  Wal-Mart will once again kick off its Black Friday deals at 6 p.m. Thursday, in  line with competitors such as Target and Sears , and one hour later  than Best Buy , Toys R Us and J.C. Penney . 
"Black Friday is no longer about waking up at the crack of dawn to stand in  long lines," said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising officer at Walmart  U.S. "It's become a family shopping tradition where everyone shops at some point  throughout the weekend." 
Video: A new study reveals that your best bet for shopping for gifts is the Monday before Thanksgiving, not Black Friday.
On Thursday, Wal-Mart will kick off its sales event with discounts across a  number of categories, including toys, DVD and Blu-ray movie, and kitchen  appliances. Sample deals from this group include an Elsa doll from "Frozen,"  which will sell for $28.88 and 800 DVD and Blu-ray movie titles that will sell  for between $1.96 and $9.96. Two hours later, it will offer markdowns across  electronics such as a Beats by Dr. Dre portable speakers, for $99.95, or a $100  savings.
Wal-Mart will then give shoppers 30 percent off on entire categories from 6  a.m. to noon Friday through Sunday, and hold additional sales on categories such  as mobile phones and diamonds also on those days.
The retailer will also hold online sales throughout the weekend, kicking off  at midnight Thursday, and will offer free shipping on its top 100 gifts. Target  last month announced that it will offer free shipping on all online purchases  through Dec. 20. 
Some retailers, including Wal-Mart, Amazon and Target, have  already kicked off Black Friday sales in some capacity. Like Wal-Mart, Target  will also extend certain Black Friday deals through Saturday. Some retailers, however, have declined to open on Thanksgiving Day .
"You've seen a number of retailers pull forward their events … and you're  seeing a lot of activity, which tells me [this holiday is] going to be very  competitive," Mac Naughton said.
Wal-Mart is trying to stabilize its U.S. business, which has posted a string  of disappointing same-store sales figures. Last holiday, its same-store sales  fell 0.4 percent.
For 2014, Wal-Mart spokeswoman Deisha Barnett said the retailer has increased  its Black Friday inventory in every category.

Five Ways to Always Get a Good Deal On a BedFive ways to always get a good deal on a bed
Ben Popken TODAY
Email
"Powercoil." "Foam density." "Fabric technology." Are we buying a mattress or fixing Matthew McConaughey's space ship in Interstellar?
These layers of confusing  jargon do little to comfort stressed-out consumers looking for a new mattress. To help cut through the clutter, we contacted a retired industry insider known as "The Old Bed Guy." The 85-year old former bed maker and seller now runs a popular mattress consumer information site where he gives out his (somewhat cranky) advice.
“Mattresses have no real value,” said 'Marshall Coyle,' a pseudonym he uses to avoid blowback from the tight-knit mattress community to which he used to belong.
That statement is a rude awakening to anyone who's peeped at the price tags after taking a stroll through a mattress showroom lately. With prices running into the thousands, dreams of better "zzz's" are quickly zapped by sticker shock.
Tanya Constantine/Blend Images / AP
The Old Bed Guy is talking about the markup versus the actual value of the steel, foam, and wool that goes inside a bed. For example, he said, it might cost a factory $600 to make a mattress that they sell to a big department store for $1,300. That store might then slap a price of $2,999 on it, then give it a big discount during one of the never-ending sales, he said.
"The money goes for something other than what you're sleeping on," said Coyle.
While every business is entitled to try to make a profit, every maker also has its own special lingo. That makes true comparison shopping difficult. Some of the differences are real. Some are just marketing vapor. 
Rather than try to explain it all and risk being as bewildering as the confusion we're supposed to be relieving, here are 5 tips from the perspective of The Old Bed Guy that always get you a better deal on a mattress, no matter what store or manufacturer you're dealing with.
Look for stores that have their own factories
A few smaller regional stores make their own mattresses in their own factories. That cuts out the middleman. "I don't know of a better way as far as value," said Coyle.
Stores in this category include Charles P. Rogers, McRoskey, Original Mattress Factory, and Verlo. Their stores aren't everywhere, but the savings and quality difference is enough that this reporter nearly considered a 10-hour road trip just to get a bed.
Buy based on weight
If you're a fan of strong, long-lasting steel coils, a heavier mattresses usually mean there's more quality materials inside. "They have 12-15 inches to fill," said The Old Bed Guy. "You can stretch your coils and make them tall and thin."
Typical mass-produced beds weigh about 90 lbs while higher grade beds can weigh around 120 lbs, he said. But you won't find this info online, you'll have to buttonhole the sales agent or bed maker to get the details.
Buy at the end of the year
"If anything is for real," said Coyle of the mattress business, "the periods when people don't buy mattresses see the best deals." 
Few buy before Christmas, saving room on the credit card for the holiday shopping spree. The last 2 weeks of December are a prime time as stores try to unload inventory before the new year. Good savings can also be had the first two weeks of January.
Be careful with Internet-only stores
Some online outfits say they pass on the savings of not having any retail outlets. But it's not that hard to set up a shop and outsource manufacturing and shipping to China. That can create an accountability gap that leaves consumers in a lurch if their bed starts giving them lumps. "If they won't give you their street address, don't give them your credit card," said Coyle.
What about latex?
"Latex costs more and is worth more, period," said Coyle.

Floods and Flooding Energy Saving
What's useful and what's wasteful when it comes to embracing the Internet of Things in the office?
Last February, Benjamin's Desk, an event space in Philadelphia, hosted a presentation for a tax attorney. Her signature color is shocking pink — and, for the duration of her event, so were the lighting accents in Benjamin's Desk's new superconnected “smart space.” Co-founder Michael Maher pulled off that design magic by spending $1,800 on 30 Philips Hue smart light bulbs. At $60 each, the lights used smartphone photos uploaded into an app and calibrated to match the shade of the client's outfit.
That investment quickly paid off: Maher's bookings have gone up 30 percent, and he's now able to charge more per event thanks to the “wow factor,” he says.
8
So how much should you spend seeking that wow factor? Maher has invested in several other smart devices to improve office security, save energy, and add pizzazz, connecting them all with a Staples Connect hub ($50) and software designed by startup Zonoff. But it can be hard to tell what's useful versus what's wasteful when it comes to embracing the Internet of Things in the  office . Our guide can help you get started.
SMART BUYS?
0
Pro: These networked cameras can send streaming video straight to your mobile device, allowing you to see who's approaching and leaving your front door — or other sensitive spaces, like your server room. Gabriel Weinberg, CEO of search-engine startup DuckDuckGo, says he was “uneasy” about his employees working at odd hours without a receptionist. But now, the company's smart cameras “give us peace of mind.”
• Locks
Kwikset Z-Wave smart door lock: $200
Yale Real Living push button deadbolt: $200
Schlage Z-Wave home keypad lever: $200
Pro: Never worry about losing your keys or rushing to change your locks when an employee leaves abruptly. Instead, just update your key codes on your smartphone.
• Climate control
Honeywell Z-Wave enabled programmable thermostat: $150
Pro: Program your office's thermostats for the nights and weekends, so you're not air-conditioning or heating empty cubicles. Maher of Benjamin's Desk estimates that his five smart thermostats, which cost about $1,000 total, save him up to $2,400 in yearly energy bills.
Maybe:
• Doorbell
DoorBot: $199
Pro: See and talk to delivery drivers or other visitors via your smartphone — even if you're not at the office.
Con: The “glitchy” device needs better video quality, per online reviews.
• Everyday lighting
Lutron Caseta wireless dimmer kit:$60
Leviton Vizia RF + light switch: $85
Pro: Dim and control lighting from your smartphone, or program the lights to turn off automatically at a designated time. If you've got a smart lock, you can link the lights so they turn on when the door opens.
Con: It's hard to beat the simplicity of the basic light switch.
• Water gauges
Aotec water sensor: $35
Pro: Check the water levels on your fish tank — or get notified of leaks and floods in your office. Those flood alerts can be crucial, and they make this sensor one of the most popular smart-office gadgets sold by Staples.
Con: Location matters: It senses floods only if it actually touches the water.
• Window shades
Lutron Serena shades: $399 to $1,533, depending on type and window size
Pro: Reduce energy costs by programming your shades to move with the sun.
Con: It's not that hard to lower the blinds.
• Motion sensors
Ecolink wireless motion detector: $50
Pro: Program your lights to turn on and off when people enter and leave, and have the system alert you when someone's entered the office.
Con: Good for security and saving energy, but may be overkill for convenience.
Luxury:
Parrot Flower Power wireless indoor/outdoor Bluetooth smart plant sensor: $60
PlantLink (one station and one link): $79
Pro: Wireless monitors text your smartphone when your plants need water, fertilizer, or sunlight.
Con: You still have to do the watering.
• Snazzy lighting
Philips Hue three-bulb starter kit: $200
Con: That's one pricey light bulb set. Unless you host a lot of events, this should probably stay on the wish list for now.
• Conference room reservations
Robin's presence-sensing software:Averages about $25 per room plus Bluetooth beacon ($5 to $30)
Pro: Robin, a startup that specializes in smart-office software, seeks to automate conference room reservations. As soon as you walk into a meeting room, Robin's software will recognize your phone and book the room on the spot. CEO Sam Dunn says the program will soon also be able to tee up your PowerPoint presentation on a projector the moment you enter.
Con: Do you really need an app to book the room you're already in?

Mendis’s inclusion should bolster Sri Lanka’s bowling
Having sealed the five-match Micromax Cup series with three comprehensive victories, India can afford to experiment with the playing XI in the next two ODIs keeping in mind the need to check on various combinations and individuals before the World Cup squad is finalised.
The national selectors and the team management could opt for a completely new opening pair with Rohit Sharma, returning after almost two months lay-off owing to shoulder strain and finger injury, partnering Ajinkya Rahane while the other very successful opener Robin Uthappa, replacing gloveman Wriddhiman Saha, but coming lower down.
The decision to try out Uthappa as a wicket-keeper is primarily to have a cover for skipper M.S. Dhoni during the World Cup. This move is being seen as a great injustice to the Bengal wicket-keeper, whose batting prowess has improved in leaps and bounds in recent times.
While Saha is in the Test team’s scheme of things, he is very keen to provide evidence to the selectors of his ability to excel as a batsman in the limited-overs format as well.
Both Uthappa and Saha are outstanding individuals. They have done extremely well in various competitions to showcase their talent and are looking to graduate to the higher echelons of the game. It is most unfortunate to club the two in the same category. Both deserved to be seen as different individuals and provided right opportunities to prove their worth.
Of the five changes India made to the squad that won the series, three are certain to play. Apart from Sharma and Uthappa, R. Vinay Kumar could also a get a chance to partner Umesh Yadav and Dhawal Kulkarni. With Ravindra Jadeja rested, Axar Patel is likely to partner R. Ashwin in the spin department. That leaves leg-spinner Karn Sharma out of the playing XI.
The Sri Lankans too made four changes to the original squad. While it has to be seen how much the four will change the fortune of the team, the fact remains that the team suffered mainly owing to its failure to build partnerships, so vital in putting up a challenging total.
Need to fire
Both Tillakaratne Dilshan and Mahela Jayawardene have to fire in unison to lift the sagging spirits of the Lankans. The inclusion of spinner Ajantha Mendis will surely add sting to the bowling department but the pace attack needs to be more disciplined and penetrative.
Fielding has been the Lankan’s problem and the team is really concentrating to improve in this area. By replacing Kumar Sangakkara, who dropped some regulation catches in the earlier games, the wicket-keeping will be taken care of by his replacement Niroshan Dickwella.
The three massive defeats will have an adverse effect on the team’s psyche. How well the team recovers to pose a big challenge will only be seen on the ground. With absolutely nothing at stake, the team has pride to play for. Losing a series 2-3 instead of 0-5 also makes a lot of difference.
India will be looking to win 5-0 and emerge as the No. 1 team in ODI ranking of the ICC. The pitch is expected to assist the batsmen with even bounce and good carry.
With the dew factor coming into play later in the game, the team that wins the toss will prefer to bowl first.

Written by Deepu Sebastian Edmond | Nemra | Posted: November 13, 2014 12:51 am
When the National Rural Health Mission’s mobile medical unit, siren blaring, rolls into this hamlet in Ramgarh district’s Gola block, nearly everyone crowds around it. Those not around the vehicle are in lying in the shade, feverish.
The unit, which usually comes on the sixth of each month, was at the village for the second time in three days last week. Its logs indicate 22 people were tested on November 5; 20 were positive for malaria — scarcely believable in a hamlet without a mention of which no tale of Jharkhand is complete.
The exclusively Santhal hamlet of about 105 households is where Shibu Soren and current CM Hemant Soren were born. His father Sobran’s murder on November 27, 1957, near the village by moneylenders turned Shibu, the second of five brothers, into an activist. Shibu was, however, active in Santhal Pargana region.
“This is a Kurmi-majority region. When I contested, I did so twice from Bermo and once from Gomia,” says Lalu Soren, the fourth of Sobran Soren’s five sons.
Lalu, who lost all three contests, is on exile for joining the TMC ahead of the Lok Sabha elections. “I regret it and I have since left, but they won’t talk to me. They were looking for ways to throw me out,” he says while giving this correspondent a tour of the family’s home, the largest in Nemra.
Lalu has turned a fierce critic of the JMM. Except for the election symbol of the party welded to the gates, the house has no markings of being associated with the JMM. “In the village, the people have begun supporting AJSU party,” says Lalu. Chandra Prakash Choudhary, an AJSU leader and a Kurmi, is Ramgarh MLA; villagers attribute the few developmental efforts to him. “Should we support the man who is available at all times or people we don’t see at all?” says Kailash Kisko.
“Hemant came and opened a [health] subcentre here, but gave no beds. There is a proposal for a 30-bed hospital nearby, but his government could not get it done,” said Lalu Soren.
Villagers say Hemant visited the village once once after becoming CM: on the martyrdom day of his grandfather last year. He promised a residential school for adivasi children, a stadium and a memorial for his grandfather at the site of his death. Lalu claims not even tenders have been issued since.
Despite the malaria outbreak, the health subcentre Hemant inaugurated was locked the day this newspaper visited Nemra. “The doctor comes rarely. It has been closed for about six days now. It would not matter if it were open. They have medicines only for small cuts,” said villager Kisko. When contacted, district civil surgeon P K Pandey blamed the district malaria officer. “The DMO did not go to the village even once. I have scolded him.”
The anganwadi in the hamlet was not functioning either. Babita Devi, the sevika, said her continued…

9-room house in Park Ridge for sale after foreclosure.
The five-bedroom, 4,000-square-foot house in Park Ridge that former Chicago Blackhawks defenseman and head coach Trent Yawney owned until losing it to foreclosure several months ago has been listed for $899,000.
0
Yawney paid $1.3 million in late 2005 for the nine-room, custom-built Colonial-style house from its builder. The house has five full baths, an open family room with a fireplace, a rec room with a custom wet bar, a two-car brick garage, and a large master suite with a walk-in closet, a steam shower and a Jacuzzi tub.
In October 2013, Yawney's lender, JPMorgan Chase, filed a foreclosure action. A Cook County judge issued a judgment of foreclosure in January, and the house sold at a sheriff's sale in June to a private investor for $623,000. That investor then listed the house last month.
"(Yawney) left it in perfect condition," said listing agent Robert Lulkiewicz, of American International Realty. "People don't do this. I was surprised. Everything was perfect in the house."

The U.S. agency that operates the National Weather Service said on Wednesday four of its websites were hacked in recent weeks, becoming the latest federal agency to fall victim to a cyber attack.
"In recent weeks, four NOAA websites were compromised by an Internet-sourced attack," said Scott Smullen, a spokesman for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
NOAA staff detected the attacks and responded immediately, performing maintenance on the sites, which were restored to full service, Smullen said in an email.

He did not identify the websites that were compromised or elaborate on the attacks but said they did not prevent the agency from delivering forecasts to the public.
The breach follows a string of attacks on government agencies including the White House, Office of Personnel Management and one of its main contractors, USIS, which performs background checks on U.S. government employees.
Most recently, the U.S. Postal Service said on Monday it was the victim of an intrusion that may have compromised the personal information of more than 800,000 employees, as well as data on customers who contacted its call center during the first eight months of this year.
The Washington Post reported that Chinese hackers were behind the NOAA attack, citing unidentified officials. The report said NOAA was forced to seal off data on disaster planning, aviation, shipping and scores of other uses.
Smullen would not comment on the source of the breach.
NOAA had a data breach last month when an agency employee in Ohio was charged with stealing sensitive information from a federal database for the nation's dams and lying about the breach to federal agents.
Xiafen "Sherry" Chen, 59, was arrested on Oct. 20 at the NOAA office in Wilmington, Ohio, about 50 miles (80 km) northeast of Cincinnati, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Ohio said.

Much has been written and speculated about the guest list of Salman Khan’s sister Arpita’s grand wedding, which happens to be on November 18 in Hyderabad.
From Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Salman’s arch rival Shah Rukh Khan, the list of the expected attendees keeps getting more and more affluent and elite.

However, the sources from the Bharatiya Janta Party dismiss any such conjectures. “As of now the Prime Minister has to look at his schedule. Also there is the very urgent security issue. How can the Prime Minister attend a wedding which is likely to have innumerable gate crashers because of the superstar Salman’s presence?” says the source.
While former actor and BJP politician Shatrughan Sinha confirms his own presence at the wedding, he refuses to divulge any details about Modi’s presence. “Firstly I am not a spokesperson for either the Prime Minister or the party. Having said that, I’d like to add that it would be nice to see Mr. Modi take some time off for this wedding as Salman and his family seem very fond of him,” replies he.
Though, Shah Rukh Khan and the Bachchans have not yet confirmed their presence, SRK is expected to be attending the wedding reception on November 21. “Inshallah… She’s like my sister. I have seen her from childhood… So, most certainly. There’s no question about that,” said the actor.

On being asked about the wedding, Shah Rukh Khan further added, “I do not know whether I have got the invite or not. Haven’t gone home but Rishta aisa hai ki mujhe invite ki zaroorat nahin hai.”
The confirmed guests at Arpita’s wedding include the likes of Katrina Kaif, Aamir Khan and Kiran Rao, Karan Johar, Sajid Nadiadwala and family, David Dhawan, wife and sons Varun and Rohit Dhawan, Hema Malini and Dharmendra. From Hyderabad, Chiranjeevi and son Ramcharan will attend the wedding.

Govt hikes petrol  diesel prices by Rs 1.50 a litreFIPB role shrinks amid easier FDI flows
The government has increased excise duty on petrol and diesel by Rs 1.50 a litre but retail prices will not go up as oil companies offset the hike against an expected reduction on account of falling global oil rates.
The duty hike, which was notified late last evening, will boost government revenue by about Rs 13,000 crore on an annual basis and help contain budget deficit.
Indian Oil Corp (IOC), the nation’s largest fuel retailer, said the excise duty hike will not be passed on to consumers and will be adjusted against reduction in rates that was likely by this weekend.
The fall in international oil prices had resulted in six consecutive reduction in petrol prices since August and two in diesel in the last one month. There was a possibility of another round of cut this weekend.
Excise duty on normal or unbranded petrol was hiked from Rs 1.20 per litre to Rs 2.70 per litre and unbranded diesel from Rs 1.46 a litre to Rs 2.96, a government notification said.
The same on branded petrol was raised from Rs 2.35 a litre to Rs 3.85 and on branded diesel from Rs 3.75 to Rs 5.25 per litre.
“For the moment, we are not passing on the increase in excise duty. It is being absorbed by companies and will be adjusted against review in rates which was due on Saturday,” IOC Chairman B Ashok said.
Revision in rates will be considered at the next fortnight (end of November), he said. “As and when we look at price revision, whenever it is due, we will look at the situation and decide on revising rates then.”
Before the duty hike, petrol cost Rs 64.25 a litre in Delhi and diesel Rs 53.35 a litre. They will continue to be priced at the same rate.
“There is no increase in retail prices,” he said.
While the fall in global rates and the resultant cuts in retail prices have led to loss of revenue to the exchequer, particularly of state governments, there wasn’t any loss to the central government on account of reduction in petrol and diesel prices as excise duty on the two fuel is fixed and not ad valorem.
Unbranded petrol at present attracts a basic excise duty of Rs 1.20 per litre, a special additional excise duty of Rs 6 a litre and a road cess of Rs 2 per litre.
Unbranded diesel attracts a basis excise duty of Rs 1.46 a litre and road cess of Rs 2 per litre.
The total excise duty on unbranded petrol will rise from Rs 9.20 to Rs 10.70 per litre and that on unbranded diesel from Rs 3.46 to Rs 4.96 per litre.
Branded petrol attracts an excise duty of Rs 10.35 per litre which would go up to Rs 11.85 per litre and excise duty on branded diesel will go up from Rs 5.75 to Rs 7.25 a litre.
State-owned fuel retailers Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corp (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp (HPCL), following the fortnightly review practice, were due to revise retail rates of petrol and diesel on Saturday.
Going by the trend in international market, retail rates should come down.
Petrol price was last cut by Rs 2.41 a litre on November 1. On the same day, diesel rates were reduced by Rs 2.25 per litre.
Petrol price has been cumulatively cut by Rs 9.36 per litre since August.
Diesel price was cut for the first time in more than five years on October 19 by Rs 3.37 a litre when the government decided to deregulate the fuel. This was followed by another reduction on November 1.
Sources said oil firms revise rates of petrol, which was deregulated in June 2010, and diesel on 1st and 16th of every month based on average international oil price and rupee-US dollar exchange rate.
Brent crude fell to a four-year low of USD 79.86 per barrel amid signs that OPEC remains unwilling to reduce output to ease concern of a global supply glut.
Brent has lost almost 30 per cent since its June peak amid speculation that global supply is outpacing demand.

Machil fake encounter: 7 armymen including 2 officers get life termComments
A military court sentenced five soldiers, including two officers, to life imprisonment on Thursday for the staged killing of three Kashmiri civilians and passing it off as an anti-militancy operation in Jammu and Kashmir's Machil sector in 2010.
It is a rare case of soldiers being punished in Kashmir where the army is an object of hate and the target of frequent protests because of the controversial Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA), which gives it sweeping powers to search, arrest and shoot people.
The verdict, hailed by political parties in Kashmir but dismissed by some separatists as a political move with an eye on assembly elections, comes at a time when the army is under fire in the Valley for killing two Kashmiri boys mistaken for terrorists.
The men were allegedly lured by a former special police officer and his accomplices to Machil on the pretext of offering a job. They were later handed over to the army for Rs. 50,000 each and shot dead by troops in a staged encounter near the border with Pakistan on April 29, 2010. The army described them as Pakistani militants trying to sneak in from the Machil sector along the Line of Control. Their bodies were exhumed on May 28, 2010.
The controversial Machil killings triggered widespread protests and bloodshed in the Kashmir Valley in which 113 people were killed. They also led to calls for scrapping the contentious AFSPA, which the army says is necessary for battling militancy in the state.
Chief minister Omar Abdullah welcomed the sentencing and called it a "watershed moment" in Kashmir's history.
"This is a watershed moment. No one in Kashmir ever believed that justice would be done in such cases. Faith in institutions disappeared. I hope that we never see such #Machil fake encounter type of incidents ever again and let this serve as a warning to those tempted to try," Abdullah tweeted.
The soldiers found guilty and recommended for life term are the commanding officer of 4 Rajput Regiment, the unit involved in the encounter, Colonel Dinesh Pathania, Captain Upendra, Havildar Devinder and Lance Naiks Arun Kumar and Lakhmi. All services benefits of the soldiers have also been suspended.
"The process is still not completed as the confirmation of the sentence is yet to be done by appropriate authority (Northern Army commander)," said an army officer in Delhi.
Court martial proceedings were ordered against six soldiers in December 2013; they ended in September this year. One of them was not found guilty. HT reported on December 26, 2013 that if convicted, the accused could get life imprisonment.
Kashmiri separatists said the verdict was a good beginning if it is followed by justice in similar rights abuse cases.
"It's very positive. We welcome it but the real test lies if justice is done in other cases like Gaw Kadal and Hawal massacres that left more than 100 dead. It's good to make troops accountable," moderate Hurriyat leader Mirwaiz Umar Farooq told HT.
But some Kashmiri separatists said the sentence was a political move aimed at assembly elections in the state as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is hoping to expand its support to the Muslim-dominated Valley where it has no base.
"The elections are round the corner. There is political design in the sudden army magnanimity. India was never serious in delivering justice in Kashmir. Then it should do justice in hundreds of other such cases. The biggest justice is granting the right of self-determination to people," said Hurriyat chairman Syed Ali Geelani.

Watch: Victims' families satisfied with verdict 
Timeline of the case:
April 29, 2010: Relatives of three civilians, all residents of Nadihal village in north Kashmir, file a missing persons report
April 30, 2010: Army claims it has killed three infiltrators at Machil near the Line of Control
May 28, 2010: Bodies are exhumed after relatives identify the clothes of the victims in a police station.
June 2010: Chief judicial magistrate records statements of a senior police officer and three constables from north Kashmir’s Kalaroos police station. The army also starts Court of Inquiry against the accused soldiers.
December 2011: The army invokes the Army Act to seek transfer of Machil fake encounter case from criminal court to court martial on grounds that accused army personnel were on active duty
December 2013: The army announces court martial of six accused soldiers.

United Breweries, the home-grown liquor firm, on Wednesday reported a net profit of Rs 42.62 crore for the second quarter ended September 30, 2014.
The company had posted a net loss of Rs 18.57 crore during the corresponding period of previous financial year.
Net sales of UB Group stood at Rs 959.86 crore during the Q2, up 27.60 per cent as against Rs 752.2 crore in the same period of 2014 fiscal, the company said in a Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) filing.
"The just concluded quarter saw the company achieving better gross profit margins on account of selective price increase in some markets and lower input costs primarily due to usage of a higher percentage of recycled bottles," United Breweries said in a statement.
"Double digit industry growth was widespread across regions, growth spurred primarily on account of strong beer... Mild beer too witnessed promising growth," the liquor firm added.
United Breweries said its plan for setting up a greenfield brewery in Bihar is on track and it is likely to commence operations during the last quarter of the 2014-15 financial year.

IT veteran N R Narayana Murthy on Thursday advocated higher autonomy and less governmental interference in the functioning of educational institutions.
"I think, my own personal view is there should be higher and higher levels of autonomy, government should not interfere in setting up colleges, in running colleges. The market, the society will decide which is a good university, which is not a good university, rather than government mandating," Murthy said.
Speaking on the sidelines of an event organised to announce Infosys Prize 2014 in Bengaluru, he said, "That's where I think the role of AICT and UGC must be reduced and we should provide full autonomy to professors, researchers and administrators of university. Then I think things will improve a lot like it happens in advanced countries."
The Infosys Science Foundation on Wednesday announced the winners of the Infosys Prize 2014 across six categories like Engineering and Computer Science, Humanities, Life Sciences, Mathematical Sciences, Physical Sciences and Social Sciences.
Asked whether he thinks that with the mushrooming of schools and colleges there would be no quality control, and how this can be curbed, Murthy said, "All over the world these things have happened. But it is the market that will determine who is a success and who is not. I don't think government control is what is going to improve this."
"So my view is that instead of trying to curb things, in the beginning there will be certain percentage of people who will take advantage of this freedom. But that's ok. A small percentage of people will suffer. But in the end, we will come out with a system of education, with a system of university, with a system of colleges that are of a better quality than what it is," he said.

Lahore HC dismisses petition to stop screening of HaiderBy: Press Trust of India | Lahore | Posted: November 13, 2014 5:59 pm
A Pakistani court has dismissed a petition challenging the exhibition of Vishal Bhardwaj’s ‘ Haider ‘ in Pakistani cinemas.
Lahore High Court Justice Shams Mahmood Mirza yesterday dismissed the petition filed by Iftikhar Ahmad. “This is not the right forum. The petitioner should better approach the censor board,” the judge observed.
Ahmad pleaded that the exhibition of film ‘ Haider ‘ was illegal. He said it was against the ideology of Pakistan and the two-nation theory. It was also aimed at defaming the Pakistani army, he argued.
A law officer argued that the petitioner should better first contact the relevant body, the central censor board, before moving the court.
‘ Haider ‘ starring Shahid Kapoor, Shraddha Kapoor, Tabu, Kay Kay Menon and Irrfan, is a modern-day adaptation of
William Shakespeare’s tragedy Hamlet, set amidst the insurgency-hit Kashmir conflicts of 1995 and civilian disappearances. The film released in India on October 2.

People think Modi is Gods gift to the country will bring heaven to earth: VenkaiahNaiduPrint

Having changed the image of Gujarat during his decade-long rule in the state, Narendra Modi, now prime minister of the country, is “changing the face of the country”, said Union Minister for Urban Development, Housing and Povery Allevation, Venkaiah Naidu. The minister while addressing an event in Gujarat’s capital Gandhinagar on Thursday went on to say that people thought of Modi as “God’s Messiah” who would transform the country.
Taking a pot-shot at the United States for not granting visa to Narendra Modi in the past, Naidu said, “Earlier, the United States did not give him a visa. But now wherever Modi goes, he gets a huge reception. India is being respected and recognised because of his leadership. The leadership is very important… You have all seen the Madison Square (event)…”
The minister while addressing the inaugural session of the 12th International Conference & Exhibition on Emerging Trends in Sustainable Habitat & Integrated Cities (Municipalika 2014), also cited the receptions Modi received during his recent visits to Myanmar and United States of America.
“He changed the face of Gujarat and now he is bent on changing the face of India. People think of him as God’s messiah; God’s gift to the country… who will transform the country,” said Naidu while showering praises on Modi at the event in Gujarat.
“The aspirations of the people are high. They think that Modi has come (to power), and now he will bring heaven to earth,” the minister said adding that the NDA government was launching “programme-after-programme which are important for every section and segment of the society”.
Naidu went on to stress how under the Modi-regime, the GDP and the industrial growth has risen, Rupee has grown stronger, while petrol prices and inflation has come down. “People are now ready to invest in India. Earlier, people used to have confidence in Gujarat. Today, this confidence has come to India,” Naidu said while addressing over 1,000 delegates from 200 cities of India and abroad, comprising of secretaries to state governments, Mayors, Municipal Commissioners, City Managers, Town Planners, Architects, Engineers, Urban Transport Specialists, E-Governance Experts, Urban Utility Managers and the Private Sector.
Naidu also spoke about how the NDA government is planning to launch the “Sardar Patel National Urban Housing Mission” for EWS (Economically Weaker Sections) and LIG (Low-Income Group) segments of the society. “We will also launch a new urban mission that will replace JNNURM Misson,” he added.
“Nowadays, smart city has become a buzzword and everybody wants a smart city, but the fact remains that to build a smart city, the local administration should take bold decisions rather than depending upon the government for funding, the resources should be mobilized through an efficient and transparent revenue model. If good amenities and infrastructure are created and taxes are levied, people will pay it willingly,” Naidu said.
He also announced that the central government is in the process of frame a guidelines for urban development project, wherein financial assistance from central government will be extended to those cities & states only, which are ready for continued…

London Olympic bronze medallist Saina Nehwal and top Indian male shuttlers Parupalli Kashyap and K Srikanth entered the quarterfinals of the China Open Super Series Premier after posting contrasting wins in their respective second round matches in Fuzhou on Thursday.
World No. 5 Saina got the better of Qin Jinping of China 21-18 21-18 in a 43-minute contest in the women’s singles match at the Haixia Olympic Sport Centre.
In men’s singles second round, Commonwealth Games gold medallist Kashyap fought back from a game down to topple China’s Xue Song 11-21 21-11 21-13 in 54 minutes, while Srikanth also faced a tough challenge from another Chinese, Gao Huan, before prevailing 21-17 19-21 21-14 in a marathon encounter that lasted an hour and 18 minutes.
Sixth seeded Saina was made to work hard by the Chinese qualifier before the Indian used all her experience to wrap up the issue in her favour and advance to the next stage.
Saina will now take on another Di Suo of China in the quarterfinals.
Both the Indian men in the fray on Thursday -- Kashyap and Srikanth -- were stretched to three games before they managed to hold on to their nerves to emerge victorious.
Kashyap will next face the winner of the match between world no. 2 Chen Long and Marc Zwiebler while Srikanth will be up against the winner of another second round tie between Zhengming Wang and Kento Momota.

Government to Review Gold Policy After Surge in Imports: ReportGovernment May Make PAN Must for Registering Charitable Trusts
New Delhi/Mumbai: Government is considering curbs on gold imports by private trading firms after foreign purchases surged in the past two months, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.
October shipments into India, the world's No.2 gold consumer after China, jumped to about 150 tonnes, compared with under 25 tonnes a year earlier and 143 tonnes in September, a third source, a top finance ministry official, said on Thursday.
All three sources declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue.
Measures under discussion would restrict imports by private trading firms, which started importing gold around the middle of this year after being barred from doing so from July 2013, the first two sources said.
Officials from the Indian central bank and finance ministry are meeting on Thursday to discuss the policy, local media and Bloomberg have reported.
The October jump follows a 450 per cent surge in September imports to $3.75 billion that weighed on the country's trade deficit, sparking fears that the government could tighten the screws again on gold.
Any new restrictions could increase local premiums to the global benchmark and hurt consumer demand.
Reduced Indian gold buying would also pressure global prices, already smarting from weakening demand in China.
Struggling with a high trade deficit, India last year raised its gold import duty to a record 10 percent and made it mandatory to export a fifth of all bullion imports.
The moves crimped supply, boosted local premiums and encouraged smuggling.
Earlier this year, India eased some of those rules by allowing private agencies to import gold. Imports have since been higher than last year's low levels.
India's gold imports are typically strong in the second half of the year as banks and retailers stock up for major festivals such as Dhanteras and Diwali, when it is considered auspicious to buy gold. The ongoing wedding season is also boosting consumer demand.
India's appetite for gold jumped by more than a third to 225.1 tonnes in the July-Sept quarter, in sharp contrast to the rest of the world, boosted by jewellery demand, the World Gold Council said on Thursday.
"Given the recent seasonality, it would be advisable to wait for another month or two of gold import data before re-imposing any restrictions," Nomura analysts said in a note on Thursday.
"There has been some increase in underlying gold demand as well, but we do not expect this to be sustained."

Air Bag Maker Takata Subject of Criminal Probe
Throwback Thursday: The first commissioner of baseballBy Chelsea Janes November 13 Follow @chelsea_janes
This week 94 years ago, Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis was featured prominently in the Post after being named the first commissioner of baseball.
A few weeks from now, Rob Manfred will become the 10th commissioner of Major League Baseball. He’ll inherit a game healthy financially and competitively, one so awash in parity that the Kansas City Royals — the ROYALS — didn’t lose their first playoff game until the World Series, one in which the Yankees and Red Sox found themselves middling at best, in which behemoth payrolls don’t equate to wins the way they once did.
Manfred will face challenges, too. Alex Rodriguez will be back next season. And recent suspensions and Biogenesis findings show the performance-enhancing drugs problems, mopped up in part, will continue to ooze from the game’s pores for the foreseeable future. International player development needs reform, the game is losing its hold in African-American communities, and younger audiences are frustrated by the pace of a game for which slow and steady were once positives, but which for many, are no longer part of the game’s appeal.
But for all those challenges, Manfred’s charge will be nothing compared to what Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis inherited when he became baseball’s first commissioner 94 years ago this week. Landis was appointed commissioner at a time when baseball was embroiled in scandal, when bickering owners threatened its health. Then, time of game and replay reformation were hardly pressing concerns, though perhaps that’s just a question of relativity: if you think replay took a long time this season, just imagine what it would’ve been like with one of those moving-picture flip books…
Regardless, it was this week in 1920 that baseball’s owners met and adopted the Lasker Plan, the brainchild of  part-owner of the Chicago Cubs, Albert Lasker. Lasker was a Chicago businessman who advised Warren Harding as completed one of the most convincing wins in the history of the presidential race in 1920.
Lasker’s plan called for control of baseball to be handed over to three non-baseball figures, men who could run the game without taking a financial interest in it. His call for impartial leaders came in the wake of the Black Sox Scandal, which broke — and broke hearts — during the 1920 pennant race.
By now, the Black Sox story hardly needs retelling: World War I had ended months before the 1919 World Series, which was therefore highly anticipated. The Chicago White Sox, one of the game’s most star-studded rosters, faced off with the Cincinnati Reds, falling in a best-of-nine series by the tally of five games to three.It was a surprising disappointment that was eventually shown to have been no surprise at all to the White Sox players, who supposedly threw the series.
Details of that scandal broke earlier in September of 1920, and White Sox owner Charles Comiskey had suspended the players in question — a move that effectively handed Cleveland the American League pennant. The scandal was the most prominent embodiment of what everyone in baseball knew: gambling was rampant, fixes were on, and because so much money was at stake for all parties, no one in the game could stop it.
And so entered Lasker and his plan to take the game out of the control of those invested in it. At that time, a three-person committee led by American League President Ban Johnson, oversaw the game. Johnson had five of the eight American League clubs firmly under his thumb. The others, eager to slide out from under it, threatened to move to the National League if compromise was not reached. It was, when owners of all 16 American and National League teams met in Chicago — absent Johnson and lawyers — to approve Lasker’s plan and hand the game over to outside authorities. Though names like William Howard Taft and Senator Hiram Johnson were bandied about as potential additions to a three-man governing board, the owners eventually decided Landis was all they needed.
The brief but informative headline in the Post on Nov. 13, 1920 read (…if you have a few minutes):
BASEBALL WAR ENDS: Rival Major League Factions Agree to Lasker Plan. JUDGE LANDIS IN CONTROL Accepts $42,500 Yearly Position as Dictator of National Pastime. Johnson and “Loyal Five,” Including Washington, Forced to Accept Terms as Laid Down by Reorganization Suggestion That Caused Three Clubs to Desert A. L.–Call Peace Pact Lasting. Both Make Concessions. Combine Two Plans. Headquarters in Chicago. How They Will Vote. JUDGE LANDIS IS NAMED ADMINISTRATOR OF LEAGUES Favors One-Man Rule. For New National Agreement.
It’s interesting to note that Landis’s initial salary offer was $50,000, but while he was still a judge, he opted for $42,500 to mirror that salary. As for serving in both positions at once, Landis was quoted in the Post then as follows:
“When baseball matters come up, the participants will come here to Chicago to plead their cases. I have nothing to do on Saturday and Sundays, and Federal Court is also closed during much of the baseball season. I’ll handle the two jobs without any trouble.”
Landis served as the game’s first commissioner for the next 24 years. He cracked down on gambling, upholding bans of the eight White Sox players in question despite their acquittal in court. He helped define relations between the major and minor leagues, and established other policies now seemingly inherent to the professional game. But Landis was not without his critics, some of whom believe — especially those who’ve seen the movie “Eight Men Out” — that he was too hard on Black Sox peripherals Shoeless Joe Jackson and Buck Weaver. Even more controversially, others blame Landis for delaying the integration of baseball.
Whatever his legacy, Landis’s appointment was a landmark moment for baseball, and his name still towers over the office today (because with a name like Kenesaw Mountain how could it not…?)
 

What cornstarch and water can do for concussionsBy Matt McFarland November 13 Follow @mattmcfarland
Researcher Eric Wetzel is developing straps that keep a player’s helmet in place+ to prevent head injuries. (Courtesy Army Research Lab)
If you ever want to walk on water, just add cornstarch. Here’s a cool science trick: Mix the two substances in a pool and suddenly you’ll be able to sprint across it , and jump rope on the surface. Provided you can maintain your momentum, it’s even possible to bike across it .
The science behind these tricks can make for more than viral YouTube videos . Researchers at the Army Research Lab are investigating a way to use straps containing a shear thickening fluid (cornstarch and water is a popular example) to reduce the likelihood of football players suffering concussions.
The National Football League, Under Armour and GE awarded the team at the Aberdeen Proving Ground $500,000 to spend a year researching the technology as part of their Head Health Challenge II. The group was one of seven winners announced Thursday .
A shear thickening fluid provides a lot of resistance when acted on at high speeds, but very little at low speeds. That’s why it’s possible to safely sprint across the pool of cornstarch and water, but slow to a crawl and you’ll sink . That same principle could be useful for preventing concussions, as the injuries are thought to result from blows to the skull in which one’s head suddenly accelerates. By using straps that keep the helmet in place, the head doesn’t accelerate and absorb a punishing force.
Here we see a RAT strap pulled quickly. The fluid in the tether behaves like a solid, resisting elongation. (Courtesy Army Research Lab)
In theory, football helmets could just be attached to the rest of a player’s body, but then players wouldn’t be able to look from side to side or up and down. Because these straps offer only weak resistance at low speeds, it would be possible to look around the field. But when a wide receiver is tackled by a sprinting opponent, the straps will tighten and offer protection.
“I’m confident we can reduce head motion during some of these events,” said Eric Wetzel, the technical area manager for Materials for Soldier Protection at the Army Research Laboratory. “I’m confident the person will still be able to look around and run and jump and catch a football. Will it be as unencumbered as with no straps on? Probably not. I can’t make these straps perfectly mechanically invisible.”
Wetzel is working with a core team of about half a dozen people to perfect the design of the straps, which they call RAT straps, as in rate-actuated tethers.
Wetzel holds up a prototype of a RAT strap. (Courtesy Army Research Lab)
To start, he’s using a crash-test dummy to simulate a player being knocked on his back, and then having the dummy’s head smack the ground. The researchers will try different substances in the strap, including glycols, silicone oil, mineral oil, silica, clay and precipitated calcium carbonate to find the formula that does the job best. The team also will figure out what the straps will attach to. A player’s shoulder pads are an option, but Wetzel has other options up his sleeve, which he’s not ready to reveal yet.
The raw materials are all inexpensive, so costs seem unlikely to be a barrier from a wide implementation of the technology.
And why is an Army researcher working to help football players? Wetzel says the findings can be applied to reduce concussions among soldiers on the battlefield or in training. By working with football players, he suddenly has the benefit of a real-world laboratory to study concussions.
“If I can use this as a platform to evaluate things we’re working on, that’s an invaluable opportunity. Otherwise I’d be working with crash-test dummies and not knowing if I’m having a positive effect,” Wetzel said.
Wetzel’s group was selected from nearly 500 proposals in 19 countries. Up to five of the winning teams will receive an addition $1 million in 2015 to continue their research. See the complete list of winners here .

Small business owners more confident about economy  survey saysWorries about health care costs not killing optimism among Chicago-area small business owners
Local small business owners feeling confident about economy
A greater percentage of Chicago-area small business owners are planning to grow their businesses in the next five years, according to a new report from Bank of America.
Two-thirds of Chicago small business owners plan to expand their companies by 2019, up from 59 percent surveyed six months ago, according to the fall 2014 Small Business Owner Report, released Thursday.
More than half of Chicago-area respondents plan to target new industries and customers; 25 percent plan to open new locations; and 23 percent will be looking for investment partners.
  Open link
Overall, the survey found that small business owners are confident about their companies' overall health, with 71 percent expecting to hit their revenue goals this year. Sixty-one percent expect more revenue this year and 48 percent plan to beef-up hiring. More than half of local business owners surveyed also said they planned to award salary bonuses to employees.
Optimism about the national economy is up, too, according to the survey. Forty-eight percent of local respondents reported that they believe the national economy will improve in 2015, compared with 34 percent last year.

2002 Gujarat riots: Supreme Court for winding up proceedings within threemonthsPrint
By: Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: November 13, 2014 6:42 pm
The Supreme Court on Thursday asked a trial court in Ahmedabad to wind up within three months the proceedings in Gulberg Society massacre case of 2002 Gujarat riots in which former Congress MP Ehsan Jafri and 67 others were killed.
Expressing concern over the accused languishing in jail due to delay in trial, a special bench headed by Chief Justice H L Dattu asked the Special Investigating Team (SIT), which probed the nine riot cases, to expeditiously proceed in the case.
The bench, however, said that judgement should not be pronounced by the trial court without its permission. Former CBI Director R K Raghvan, who is heading the SIT, said that it would be difficult to wind up the proceedings within three months.
The bench, thereafter, asked him to proceed expeditiously and allowed him to approach the court in case it is not completed within three months.
The bench in its earlier hearing had said it was considering to pass some order as letters have also been received from some of the accused that they are in jail for almost 10 years.
During the hearing on April 3, the court had expressed satisfaction over the progress of nine cases of post-Godhra riots in Gujarat probed by Special Investigation Team (SIT) which had given a clean chit to then Chief Minister Narendra Modi.
“There has been a lot of progress and out of nine cases, six are over and three are almost at final stage,” the bench had observed after perusing the progress report filed in a sealed cover.
The apex court has been monitoring nine sensitive cases after the National Human Rights Commission and various NGOs termed the investigation into these to be shoddy and unreliable.
Those cases were about the riots in Gulberg Society, Ode, Sardarpura, Narodao Gaon, Naroda Patya, Machipith, Tarsali, Pandarwada and Raghavapura.
An estimated 2,000 people were killed in post-Godhra riots in 2002.
The SIT had submitted its final report in the apex court in March, 2012 regarding Ahmedabad’s Gulberg Society riot case giving a clean chit to Modi and others in the 2002 riot cases.

Omar attacks Congress for taking credit of administrativeunitsPrint
By: Press Trust of India | Gool (j&k) | Posted: November 13, 2014 6:41 pm
Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah on Thursday charged that Congress was trying to take credit for the creation of new administrative units by his government when the party had actually wanted to put the issue on backburner.
“Congress was not at all interested in the creation of new administrative units and their leaders told me personally and directly that this was not their priority and the issue could be put on backburner,” Omar said while addressing an election rally here today.
“I do not want to indulge in divulging their (Congress’s) shortcomings, but their attitude compels me to speak in public to set the records straight,” he said.
Omar said he had to put his chair at “stake” for bridging the gap between the government and people by creating new administrative units through the state.
“Now, when these administrative units have already been set up, Congress is being boastful about the decision and wants to take all credit for it and other important measures taken by National Conference-led government,” he said.
Targeting the Opposition PDP, Omar said, “Parties like PDP have made politics a trade to obtain personal profits out of it.”

Having scored a world record 264 in India’s 153 run win against Sri Lanka, Rohit Sharma feels he has a lot more to achieve in the game and an odd failure will not stop his progress.
(Also Read: Rohit Sharma takes over Twitter )
“Not relieved I would say. I still have a lot more to do. When I was young and wanted to play International cricket, I never thought this would happen,” said Rohit when asked about his breathtaking innings in the post-match presser.
(Photos: Rohit Sharma: His bat didn’t just talk, it screamed its lungs out against Sri Lanka )
“All the records happen along the way. I probably need to work harder and from here on the expectation would be more. I feel I have a lot of responsibilities on my shoulders,” said the Indian, who also became the first man to score two ODI double hundreds.
(Stats: Rohit Sharma’s 264 takes him to the top of individual scores in ODIs)
Rohit, who played his first international game on Thursday after an injury lay-off, had struggled against pace bowling in South Africa. He said couple of failures cannot stop his progress.
“You have to accept the failure and success and you keep moving on. That’s what I’ve done. A couple of overseas failures will not stop my cricket. My cricket and my hard work will still remain on the track. I will keep working hard as ever.”
Rohit started his record-breaking innings slowly as he conceded a maiden to Angelo Mathews before stepping on the gas. The Indian opener gave credit to his partner Ajinkya Rahane for his quickfire 24-ball 28 that took pressure off him.
Admitting that he was struggling in the beginning, Rohit said: “Playing after two months from an injury layoff, I was feeling little out of place, I should accept that. The strikebreaking was not happening as naturally as it used to be. I wanted to get stuck in the middle that required a lot of dedication and determination. I had to build the innings. Initial 10-15 overs was not easy.
“I kept telling myself, no matter what, I need to stay there. Luckily the quickfire innings by Rahane really helped me settle down. I needed to stay there because I knew I can make up any time. I just wanted to make it count. I wanted to make this game special one for me and the team. Getting two double hundreds was really special.”
He also gave credit to BCCI physio Vaibhav Daga for working overtime with him.
“I am sure he will be a really happy man today. It was A very difficult two months. I would like to thank the BCCI physio Mr Vaibhav Daga. For both of us it was a big challenge, he really worked hard with me.”
Asked whether he had Sehwag’s record 219 in mind when he completed the double ton, Rohit said: “The last continued…

Looking forward to PM Modis visit to Beijing: ChinesePremierPrint

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday had his first meeting with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, who said that China is looking forward to the Indian leader’s maiden visit to Beijing.
Modi met Li at the Myanmar International Convention Centre on the sidelines of the back-to-back India-ASEAN and East Asia summits in Myanmar’s capital.
Li was among the first leaders to have greeted Modi over phone after the latter was sworn in as Prime Minister in May this year. He had pledged then to build a “robust” relationship with Modi’s government.
During the meeting, Modi recalled the visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping to India in September, saying it would be remembered as a memorable visit.
Responding to Modi’s comment, Li said President Xi’s visit was a “high-success”.
Li also said that China was looking forward to welcoming Modi.
“Keen to have you visit China. Look forward to seeing you in Beijing,” Li was quoted as saying by Ministry of External Affairs spokesman Syed Akbaruddin.
The Prime Minister met Li on a day when he had several bilateral meetings for the third day today during the course of his ten-day three-nation tour that will also take him to Australia and Fiji.
Modi met Russian Premier Dmitry Medvedev and Philippines President Benigno Aquino among other world leaders today.
The External Affairs Ministry spokesperson had told reporters in Delhi on Monday there will be a “structured” meeting and delegation-level talks between the Prime Minister and the Chinese Premier in Myanmar.
Li is second-ranked in the Communist Party of China (CPC) after President Xi.
Modi will also have an opportunity to interact with President Xi during an informal meet of the leaders of the five-nation BRICS bloc on the fringes of the G-20 summit in Brisbane.
Modi and Xi are likely to enhance their rapport struck during their meetings at the BRICS summit in July in Brazil and during the President’s visit to India in September.
Although Xi’s India visit was, in some sense, overshadowed by the stand-off in Chumar along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), Indian and Chinese officials are apparently keen to focus on the positives, such as the USD 20 billion investment pledge from China, and to take concrete steps to move forward agreements such as the setting up of China-dedicated industrial parks in India.
National Security Advisor Ajit Doval also attended the meeting.

Botched sterilisation surgeries: CM Raman Singh orders judicialprobeBy: Press Trust of India | Bilaspur | Posted: November 13, 2014 6:16 pm
Under attack over botched sterilisation surgeries at government-run medical camps which  have so far claimed lives of 13 young women in Chhattisgarh, Chief Minister Raman Singh on Thursday announced a judicial probe into the incidents.
The surgeon who performed tubectomy procedures on 83 women at a camp at Pendari village in a matter of few hours, has been arrested and the state’s Food and Drug Administration authorities have sealed a manufacturing unit which allegedly supplied sub-standard medicines administered to the victims.
“A judicial inquiry will be conducted into the incidents and those found guilty will not be spared. Whether it is the medicine manufacturer, distributor or doctors, Strict action will be taken,” he told reporters at Chhattisgarh Institute of Medical Science (CIMS).
Singh, who visited various hospitals where the afflicted women have been admitted, said 138 women on whom tubectomy procedure was performed at camps in Pendari and Pendra areas are undergoing treatment at Bilaspur.
“Of the 52 women admitted to Apollo Hospital, 2 are on ventilator, 3 are undergoing dialysis and 5 on non-invasive ventilator (NIV) system, while others are normal. Besides, rest of the women admitted to CIMS and district hospital are normal,” he added.
Over allegations of sub-standard medicines having been administered to the victims, he said the samples were being sent to Central Drug Testing Laboratory in Kolkata and a conclusion could be drawn only after reports have been received.
A 16-member team of doctors from Apollo Hospital, Hyderabad, arrived here today and examined the patients.
The team will stay put in Bilaspur till the time those afflicted recovered, the Chief Minister said.
The drug controlling authority sealed a unit of Mahawar Pharma which manufactures Ciprocin 500 mg tablets used at the camps where surgeries had been performed.
“A raid was conducted at the drug manufacturing unit of Mahawar Pharma this morning and after collecting samples of medicines from there it was sealed,” Controller, FDA, Ravi Prakash Gupta told PTI.
“We have suspended sale and supply of products of the company across the state and directives have been issued to chemists and drug suppliers in this connection,” Gupta said.
During the raid, a significant quantity of drugs were found burnt at the premises and a detailed report will be submitted to higher authorities in this regard, sources in the drugs control department said.
Chhattisgarh government has already suspended the sale of Ibrufen-400 and Ciprocin-500 tablets, Lignocaine and Lignocaine HCL injections and Zielone lotion. All these brands had been used in the operations.
Meanwhile, Dr R K Gupta, the surgeon who had performed tubectomy procedures on 83 women at Pendari village, 12 of whom died, has been arrested from a relative’s house in neighbouring Balodabazar district.
The laparoscopic surgeon, who is claimed to have performed over 50,000 sterilisation surgeries in his career, claimed that sub-standard medicines supplied by the government caused post-operative complications resulting in the deaths.
“The condition of the women deteriorated after they were given pain killer Brufen and antibiotic Ciproxin following the surgery. Women started vomiting after consuming those medicines,” he said.
“We cannot predict the quality of medicines just continued…

The soccer World Cups of 2018 and 2022 are set go ahead in Russia and Qatar as planned after FIFA’s ethics committee said on Thursday it could find no grounds for reopening the controversial bidding process.
In a long-awaited report, the committee said that “the various incidents which might have occurred are not suited to compromise the integrity of the FIFA World Cup 2018/2022 bidding process as a whole”.
The report criticised England’s bid for the 2018 tournament for bowing to “inappropriate requests” from former CONCACAF president Jack Warner, a FIFA powerbroker at the time, in what it said was “an apparent violation of bidding rules”.
It also said that in Australia’s bid for 2022 “there are certain indications of potentially problematic conduct of specific individuals in the light of relevant FIFA Ethics rules.
“The occurrences at issue were… only of very limited scope,” it added.
“In particular, the effects of these occurrences on the bidding process as a whole were far from reaching any threshold that would require returning to the bidding process, let alone reopening it — a decision which anyway would not fall under the FIFA Ethics Committee’s competence.
“The assessment of the 2018/2022 FIFA World Cups bidding process is therefore closed for the FIFA Ethics Committee.”
However, the report said ethics investigator Michael Garcia intended to open formal investigations against individuals, who were not named.
FIFA and Qatar World Cup organisers have been fending off allegations of corruption ever since the Gulf state was awarded the 2022 tournament.
Qatar, which has repeatedly denied the allegations, has also been criticised over its treatment of migrant workers in the construction industry.
The 2018 tournament was awarded to Russia as part of the same bidding process which culminated in December 2010.
NOT CLEAR
FIFA said in a statement that it welcomed the report and looks forward to continuing the preparations for Russia 2018 and Qatar 2022, “which are already well underway”.
In the case of Qatar, the report said “there are certain indications of potentially problematic conduct of specific individuals in the light of relevant FIFA Ethics rules” which did not compromise the bidding process.
It said that the relationship between former Asian Football Confederation president Mohamed bin Hammam, banned for life by FIFA in 2011, and the Qatar bidding team was a “distant relative to the relationships of other FIFA Executive Committee members from bid nations”.
The report said that it could not find any evidence of misconduct connected to the Russian bid, although it added that not all records had been available to the investigation.
“The Russia 2018 Bid Committee made only a limited amount of documents available for review.”
“The computers used at the time by the Russia Bid Committee had been leased and then returned to their owner after the Bidding Process. The owner has confirmed continued…

Looking forward to Modis visit to Beijing: Chinese PremierPrime Minister Narendra Modi shakes hands with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang during a meeting at Nay Pyi Taw in Myanmar on Thursday. Photo: PTI

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday had his first meeting with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, who said that China is looking forward to the Indian leader’s maiden visit to Beijing.
Modi met Li at the Myanmar International Convention Centre on the sidelines of the back-to-back India-ASEAN and East Asia summits in Myanmar’s capital.
Li was among the first leaders to have greeted Modi over phone after the latter was sworn in as Prime Minister in May, 2014. He had pledged then to build a “robust” relationship with Modi’s government.
During the meeting, Modi recalled the visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping to India in September, saying it would be remembered as a memorable visit.
Responding to Modi’s comment, Li said President Xi’s visit was a “high-success“.
Li also said that China was looking forward to welcoming Modi.
“Keen to have you visit China. Look forward to seeing you in Beijing,” Li was quoted as saying by Ministry of External Affairs spokesman Syed Akbaruddin.
The Prime Minister met Li on a day when he had several bilateral meetings for the third day on Thursday during the course of his ten-day three-nation tour that will also take him to Australia and Fiji.
Modi met Russian Premier Dmitry Medvedev and Philippines President Benigno Aquino among other world leaders on Thursday.
The External Affairs Ministry spokesperson had told reporters in Delhi on Monday there will be a “structured” meeting and delegation-level talks between the Prime Minister and the Chinese Premier in Myanmar.
Li is second-ranked in the Communist Party of China (CPC) after President Xi.
Modi will also have an opportunity to interact with President Xi during an informal meet of the leaders of the five-nation BRICS bloc on the fringes of the G-20 summit in Brisbane.
Modi and Xi are likely to enhance their rapport struck during their meetings at the BRICS summit in July in Brazil and during the President’s visit to India in September.
Although Xi’s India visit was, in some sense, overshadowed by the stand-off in Chumar along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), Indian and Chinese officials are apparently keen to focus on the positives, such as the USD 20 billion investment pledge from China, and to take concrete steps to move forward agreements such as the setting up of China-dedicated industrial parks in India.
National Security Advisor Ajit Doval also attended the meeting.

Quirky products for your smart home
Why do people cry tears of joy and pinch babies cheeks According to science  it may help you calm down.Ever see a puppy so cute that you have no idea what to do with yourself? Like, what sort of response am I supposed to have when seeing something like this ?
As a test, take a look at this baby:
(iStock)
Do you want to pinch its cheeks? That's kind of a curious reaction, if you really stop to think about it. I mean, it's a positive emotion that you're feeling; but that response, on its surface, is objectively negative and aggressive.
Same with tears of joy (which many musicians have documented in song ), or whatever it is that happens while watching videos of soldiers reuniting with their families: It's a happy, ecstatic moment, and yet we (specifically, me) are reduced to a puddle of tears.
Negative and aggressive responses to positive emotions is something Yale psychologist Oriana Aragon realized that science hadn't really taken the time to explain. She became inspired to examine such "dimorphous expressions" of positive emotions, as she describes it, after hearing actress Leslie Bibb describe this impulse to Conan O'Brien, which you can watch in the clip below. Essentially, you have two incongruous responses stemming from the very same emotion.
So Aragon and other researchers studied these emotions and responses, the results of which are to be published in a forthcoming issue of Psychological Science.
Initially, the researches asked 143 participants questions including whether they cry when seeing loved ones reunited or while watching the happiest moments of movies, and whether when holding an "extremely cute baby, I have the urge to squeeze his or her little fat legs."
They found that those people who express "negative" or aggressive responses in one scenario were likely to do it in another; for instance, those who cry at their kid's graduation were more likely to want to also want to pinch a baby's cheeks. And no, not everyone has such reactions, which take place "when people are overwhelmed with emotions," Aragon said.
"It took me a long time, a lot of experiments and a lot of work, to say: yes, people are actually feeling positive [emotions] but expressing negative [responses], and do so across a variety of situations," Aragon said.
Then, nearly 300 participants were shown pictures of babies, which altered to make them look more or less cute. The cuter babies were viewed more positively and elicited responses such as "I want to pinch those cheeks!" or telling the baby, through gritted teeth, "I want to eat you up!"
Researchers measured people's feelings immediately after viewing those photos and then five minutes later. They found that people who had aggressive or negative reactions to positive emotions actually recovered better from their emotional highs and got closer to an emotional equilibrium than people who had no interest in, say, pinching cheeks.
In other words, Aragon said, those inherently negative reactions -- tears of joy, for instance -- may help people calm down from their emotional highs.
"We really want emotional homeostasis," Aragon said. "We want a happy, middle spot. Extreme is not good. It's hard on our bodies."
That may be one reason why some humans exhibit this behavior. There could be others -- but, yes, such uncontrollable feelings can be trying on the body. Just watch this video of Kristen Bell's emotional meltdown when her husband surprised her with a sloth for her birthday:
 
And this concept is likely more universal rather than strictly cultural. Aragon asked a series of language professors if different cultures had expressions or words for such reactions to babies, along the lines of "you're so cute, I want to eat you up with a spoon!" And indeed, there were countless examples. In Tagalog, "gigil" refers to "gritting of teeth and the urge to pinch or squeeze," the researchers write.
And here's one more: in Farsi, it's not uncommon to hear an adult tell a cute baby: "I want to eat your liver!" While that may sound aggressive, it probably helps me calm down.

Payrolls rose by 321,000 in November, way above the 230,000 estimated, while the unemployment rate held steady at 5.8 percent, a six-year low.
The report blew past forecasts, but also raised expectations that a rate hike from the Federal Reserve may materialize sooner than previously thought.
Ronald Sanchez, chief investment officer of Fiduciary Trust Company International in New York, said the number was "unambiguously strong," though it "could mean some changes to policy recommendations with the Fed. June 2015 is back on the table for when rates could rise."
Financials <.SPSY> rose 1 percent as higher interest rates would prop up earnings in the sector. Bank of America  rose 2.7 percent to $17.68 while Goldman Sachs  was up 1.8 percent to $195.45, boosting the Dow.
Utilities <.SPLRCU>, a dividend play, fell 0.8 percent as Treasuries yields rose. Energy <.SPNY> fell 1.2 percent alongside a 1.7 percent drop in crude  prices. Most sectors ended well off their highs of the session.
"The day's market action has to be seen in the context of the recovery we've had year-to-date. Payrolls confirm the strength of the economy, but that strength is reflected in stock prices," said Sanchez, who helps oversee $16 billion in assets.
Separate data showed new orders for U.S. factory goods fell for a third straight month in October, pointing to a slowdown in manufacturing activity.
The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> rose 58.69 points, or 0.33 percent, to 17,958.79, the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 3.45 points, or 0.17 percent, to 2,075.37 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 11.32 points, or 0.24 percent, to 4,780.76.
For the week, the Dow rose 0.7 percent and the S&P rose 0.4 percent. It was the seventh straight weekly gain, a streak not seen in a year for both. The Nasdaq fell 0.2 percent on the week.
American Eagle Outfitters  fell 13.8 percent to $11.91 after the teen apparel retailer forecast a current-quarter profit below analysts' estimates and reported its fifth straight drop in quarterly income.
About 5.81 billion shares traded on all U.S. platforms, according to BATS exchange data.
NYSE advancers outnumbered decliners 1,614 to 1,480, for a 1.09-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,809 issues rose and 927 fell, for a 1.95-to-1 ratio favoring advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 98 new 52-week highs and 10 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 168 new highs and 93 new lows.

The drama club of PSG CAS won laurels for their performance at a national level festival held at NIT Trichy
The bell rings and students of PSG CAS pour out of the examination hall to grab a cup of chai from the college canteen. Amongst them is a bunch animatedly discussing theatre.
That is because they are members of the college’s five-year-old Drama Club who, not too long ago, returned victorious from Festember, a national level inter-college cultural fest held at NIT Trichy. The club’s street play, a critique on the education system, bagged the third prize. In Tamil, the students had used a couplet from Thirukkural and made it contemporary by using instances from their own lives. In addition their full-length English play made it to the final round from 180 other scripts.
There were very few dialogues and the costume too was minimal for the Tamil street play, says Saravana Kumar.K, who was the narrator. “We had to use our body for everything, including props. And, as we
were told at a street-play workshop that a good street play must have a social message, we decided to go with the education theme.”
The English play was an adaptation of David Belke’s That Darn Plot, in which a playwright and the characters he creates are constantly at logger heads. “The play starts to have a life of its own, ” says Tanvi P.S. “We made the playwright a female. And then, a world of possibilities opened up.”
The Drama Club means many things to many people. For Sushmita Ayyagari, a B.Com student, it is a break from a world otherwise filled with figures and calculations. “I have a flair for language, poetry and arts. And this is a great platform for me to explore that creative side. ” For Tanvi, “This space helps me to express myself. Stage is a great liberation for me.”
The students also took part in screen play workshop of Madhumita Sundararaman, a film director and script writer who taught them about writing an edgy, gripping script. “We were asked to look at popular movies with fresh eyes and find what makes them good entertainers,” says Tanvi.
The idea to form a drama club in the college was that of English professor, Kalpana Karthi in 2009. “I found those students extremely creative and brimming with ideas. So I thought they needed a platform to showcase that ,” she recalls. The club that started off with around 40 students now has a membership of over 200. Members organise screenplay workshops, street theatre festivals, and proscenium productions in their campus. Theatre is strongly linked to their daily time table. The alumni of the club still visit the present members and give them tips, says Kalpana. “There has been a big shift in how theatre is received in the campus. In the beginning, we did not get enough audience. Now there is an enthusiastic audience. And I think it has to do a lot of with the changing trends in the placement sector. The job providers not just look for a good academic performance but also confidence level, leadership qualities and public speaking. Just what theatre provides.”

Rosetta Comet LandingRosetta Spacecraft's Philae Probe Pulls Off Comet Landing

The Rosetta spacecraft's Philae lander successfully touched down on a speeding comet today after a 10-year journey through the solar system.
The European Space Agency's Rosetta already had gone where no other spacecraft has ever attempted to go before, becoming the first to rendezvous with a comet -- in this case one that can move at more than 80,000 miles per hour.
"It's a great day, not only for ESA but for the world. We landed and Philae survived the landing and we have landed at the right place. It's the right comet, don't worry," Jean-Jacques Dordain, the ESA's director general, said to laughs.
Rosetta Spacecraft Reaches Comet After 10-Year Chase
While the landing was smooth, it didn't go perfectly according to plan, Stephan Ulamec, the Philae Lander Manager, said at a news briefing.
"The not so good news is that the anchoring harpoons did not file so the lander is not anchored to the surface," Ulamec said.
The ESA said its team is exploring its options for refiring Philae's harpoon rockets, which allow it to remain anchored to the low-gravity comet.
"What we know is that we touched down," Ulamec said. "We had a very clear signal there and we also received data from the lander."
ESA officials speculated that it was possible Philae landed in a soft sandbox-like area. However, the agency said it was not immediately clear what allowed the lander to remain on the comet.
Some of the data also indicates the lander may have lifted off again and bounced, meaning Philae may have landed twice today on the comet.

The spacecraft's Philae lander began the final leg of its journey this morning when it separated from its mother ship and made a seven-hour journey to land on 67P shortly after 11 a.m. ET. The rubber duck shaped comet is less than three miles wide, making the landing an even more impressive feat.
The Rosetta Lander Imaging System, a camera attached to Philae, took a breathtaking photo of the comet less than two miles away from its surface, providing an incredible close-up look.
Scientists at the ESA will now spend the coming days and months analyzing data they receive from Philae's instruments.
For some perspective on how long communications can take: When Rosetta phoned home today to the ESA's mission control in Darmstadt, Germany, during the final stretch of the journey, it took 28 minutes for the signal to reach Earth, traveling more than 317 million miles.

How giving workers the day off for Thanksgiving became a retailer promotional schemeBy Drew Harwell November 12 Follow @drewharwell

Not so long ago, the practice of a store staying closed on Thanksgiving was simply a given: one more holiday in which workers assumed they’d get some time off. Then, amid the corporate tug-of-war over Black Friday crowds, retailers began eyeing the juicy hours of Turkey Day as the best time to kick off their crucial holiday shopping seasons.
The move drew both sales and backlash from shoppers, who worried the sacred day was being plowed beneath the tough work schedules of Black Friday creep. Now, a core crew of retailers is pushing back, loudly proclaiming it will stay closed on Thanksgiving – and hoping the moral high ground will pay off even more.
Costco, GameStop, Nordstrom and at least two dozen other chains have sworn off opening on “Black Thursday,” putting themselves in the unique position of advertising that they’re closed. And though they’ll lose out on a day of bargain-hunting, they’re winning a type of publicity money can’t buy: One Today Show  segment  highlighting them is headlined, “Family trumps profits at these stores.”
Storefronts that long competed on door-busters and discounts are now fighting over a new distinction, analysts said: Who’s better to their employees? It is morality as a marketing scheme, and it’s adding a new tension to how retailers will compete during some of the busiest shopping days of the year.
“Thanksgiving openings are not one size fits all,” said Kathy Grannis, a spokesperson for the National Retail Federation. “If a company chooses to stay closed, one of the reasons is definitely that they don’t feel their customers would find it of value. And for the others, they may have already had tremendous success and feel their shoppers will be lined up once again this year.”
Corporate promotions of Thanksgiving closures have hammered home the point that they’re ditching a day of sales-grabbing for holiday cheer. GameStop said it would close on the holiday “out of respect for our store associates and their families and friends.” A spokesperson for the parent company of Marshalls and T.J. Maxx said, “We consider ourselves an Associate-friendly Company.”
Some have been more timid about their decision-making, with Costco saying in a statement, “Our employees work especially hard during the holiday season and we simply believe that they deserve the opportunity to spend Thanksgiving with their families. Nothing more complicated than that.” Others have been much more vocal: To announce last year they’d close for Turkey Day, Menards, a home-improvement chain,  bought  a full-page newspaper ad.
“Some things are sacred, including spending time with family and loved ones on Thanksgiving and other holidays,”  said  Jim von Maur, president of Von Maur, a Midwest department store chain, in an announcement last year. “We profitably run our business during the remaining 358 days of the year, so we don’t have to sacrifice tradition for the sake of sales.”
Companies don’t make the decision to swear off selling stuff on the holiday lightly. A  survey  by consulting firm Accenture found that 45 percent of Americans planned to shop on Turkey Day, up from 38 percent last year. And most shoppers had few qualms about leaving the holiday dinner table: 32 percent of shoppers said they would avoid brick-and-mortar stores on Thanksgiving because it would interfere with family time, down from 41 percent last year.
For the country’s biggest retailers, Black Thursday business has proven too attractive to avoid. Walmart, the country’s biggest private employer, will be open all day, with the best deals starting right around dinner time. J.C. Penney, Best Buy and Toys ‘R’ Us will open at 5 p.m., and Kohl’s, Macy’s, Sears and Target will open at 6, for those unable to wait to save $20.99 on a Little Tykes Trampoline .
Some of the stores will stay open all night and marathon into Black Friday: Kmart will let shoppers in at 6 a.m. on Thanksgiving and stay open for 42 hours straight. And several could use all the buying help they could get. Target, which will open two hours earlier than it did last Thanksgiving, has been seeing fewer customers and has resorted to closing some of its big-box stores.
That Thanksgiving tension is perhaps best encapsulated with RadioShack, the struggling electronics store, which said it would open more than 3,000 stores from 8 a.m. to midnight on Thanksgiving for the first time ever. Then the retailer changed its mind, confirming on Wednesday it would close that day from noon to 5 p.m. to give workers a break. In a corporate memo obtained  by Bloomberg, chief executive Joe Magnacca brought up the holiday’s “issues with personal scheduling” and said the midday break would “eliminate that concern and still capture the opportunity in the marketplace.” The company declined to comment.
The stores refusing to open on the holiday, however, may feel the moral capital they gain from looking like the good guys could mean more for their brand in the long run. A study last month by retail site RichRelevance found more than 60 percent of Americans said they disliked that stores opened on Thanksgiving, and only 12 percent said they liked the trend. The movement is gaining steam: A “ Boycott Black Thursday ” Facebook page has more than 79,000 “likes.”
Some of the stores, analysts added, may feel like opening on Thanksgiving isn’t worth the trouble, or the paid overtime. There is also the potential for martyrdom: In a mall outside Buffalo, New York, store managers  told TV news crews  they were worried they would be fined if they didn’t open with the rest of the mall Thanksgiving evening.
But perhaps the cherry on top for most of the stores staying closed on the holiday (including American Girl, Barnes & Noble, Bed, Bath and Beyond, BJ’s Wholesale Club, Burlington Coat Factory, Costco, Crate and Barrel, Dillard’s, DSW, GameStop, Hobby Lobby, HomeGoods, Home Depot, Jo Ann Fabrics, Lowe’s, Marshalls, Nordstrom, Patagonia, Petco, Pier 1, Publix, REI, Sam’s Club, Sur La Table, Talbots and T.J. Maxx)? Consumer research from Deloitte  found  that 70 percent of holiday shopping would take place after Thanksgiving anyway.

Trotz  Caps looking to build line around KuznetsovBy Alex Prewitt November 12 Follow @alex_prewitt

As Evgeny Kuznetsov’s ice time dipped below the 10-minute mark over the past two games , for the first time since the Washington Capitals’ season opener against Montreal, Coach Barry Trotz began formulating possibilities for a more dynamic group featuring the Russian rookie.
“I’m trying to build four lines,” Trotz said Tuesday. “As the season wears on, you’re going to need to be a four-line team.”
Both Trotz and Kuznetsov have preached patience with the forward’s development, which has yo-yoed him onto three of Washington’s four lines this season, all at center. But Trotz recognized that shooing Kuznetsov into the current fourth line , beside more “grinding types” such as Liam O’Brien and Michael Latta, might not be the best use of his talents.
Citing recent injuries to Brooks Laich (shoulder) and Tom Wilson (lower body), Trotz said once both return – Wilson possibly this weekend, Laich somewhere beyond that, it would seem – he could finally deploy a more offensive-minded group for Kuznetsov to center.
“Kuzy’s more a pretty good distributor of the puck,” Trotz said. “He’s not I wouldn’t say a high cycle guy. He’s not a guy that [Joel Ward] and [Jason Chimera] play with a lot, because that’s not really his game. He’s probably more with [Andre] Burakovsky and [Marcus] Johansson and [Troy] Brouwer-type of line, where they’ve got speed and give-and-go. We don’t really have that, because of the injuries to Wilson and Laich.”
Speaking to Mike Vogel on a video posted to the team’s Web site , General Manager Brian MacLellan called Wilson an “ideal linemate” for Kuznetsov, given his forechecking ability, strength and skill at moving the puck into the middle. Theoretically, that would fill the right wing hole beside Kuznetsov. And on the left?
“You’d want a finisher, someone that can shoot the puck, finish some of the plays and get to the net for him,” MacLellan said. “I think those would be the ideal characteristics for his linemates.”
So who might fit that mold? The Johansson-Burakovsky-Brouwer line has excelled in three games together, all Capitals victories, so Trotz would hesitate to break them up. Once Laich returns, would he center the Chimera-Ward line, as Eric Fehr did against Carolina and Columbus, or could he provide an offensive boost to Burakovsky?
Thanks to his limited minutes, either on the fourth line or beside Chimera and Jay Beagle on the de facto third group, only a small sample size exists to gauge Kuznetsov’s success with different teammates. His even-strength Corsi-for, a measurement of shot differential, with Fehr grades high at 81.2 percent according to stats.hockeyanalysis.com , but they’ve skated together for just 12 minutes, 25 seconds. Wilson and Laich, furthermore, have each spent less than three minutes with Kuznetsov at even strength this season.
Trotz also didn’t rule out returning to the “grinding” style of fourth line, where O’Brien, Latta and Beagle stood tall in a recent loss against Calgary, if the situation demanded it. But it’s clear that, as Wilson and Laich regain their strength, among the top priorities will be finding greater chances for Kuznetsov.
“Once we get healthy, I think we have that,” Trotz said. “We just haven’t had a healthy Brooks Laich, and Willie hasn’t been healthy. Once we do that, I think we can get more of that into Kuzy’s game. Then we’ve got to balance it out.
“Some games we’ll be playing teams … if we’re playing the L.A. Kings, they’re going to grind you and cycle you all night. That might be more of a Latta, O’Brien and Beagle night. Everybody’s a little different. I think Kuzy’s best assets are his abilities to skate and distribute pucks. I don’t see him as a wall guy. You saw that today in practice. That’s not really his strength. He’s best when he’s in the middle of the ice. He’s got great vision and hands.”

Author of The News Sorority says she doesnt regret the TMIBy Helena Andrews November 12 Follow @helena_andrews

It happens to the best of biographies. Despite delving deeply into its subject matter with well-placed sources, plenty of research and nuanced writing, there’s always that one juicy detail just screaming for a headline. Hence, the pull quote.
In author Sheila Weller’s month-old book, “The News Sorority,” chronicling the careers of Katie Couric, Diane Sawyer and Christiane Amanpour in what The Washington Post called a “ dishy, bitchy biography ,” she got the biggest pushback from 10 words.
Couric in the heat of the morning news competition after being scooped by Diane Sawyer. “I wonder who she blew this time to get it,” mused Couric aloud and in front of “Today” show colleagues, a moment captured in Weller’s book that sparked the headline “Hate-y Couric.”
“There was some really negative stuff about Katie that was cherry picked and blown up in a very negative way,” said Weller when we caught up with her before a scheduled book signing at Kramerbooks in Dupont Circle. “I cannot say that her publicist was happy with that.”
So does she regret it?
“I thought it was funny,” said Weller. “It was true to someone who was as snarky and funny as Katie Couric.” Still there were some details the author purposefully left in her notebook, specifically the angry ranting of one particularly miffed producer.
“There was one source that I thought was a little too bitter, so I used about a third of what she said,” Weller said. Now, let’s all take turns guessing who that mad producer was.

The federal government hasnt legalized marijuana and it owns more than half the land in states where it is legalBy Hunter Schwarz November 12 Follow @hunterschwarz

Although the federal government hasn’t legalized marijuana, it owns millions of acres of land in places that have.
The federal government controls approximately 640 million acres of land throughout the country, much of it in the West where the four states that have legalized it — Alaska, Colorado, Oregon and Washington — are. It also operates 21.6 percent of Washington, D.C., which voted to legalize marijuana last week.
Overall, the federal government controls a combined 54.96 percent of all land in places that have legalized recreational marijuana.
That means people who possess legal amounts of marijuana in one part of the state could get into trouble if they cross into federal territory. It happened to Karen Strand in 2013 when she went hiking in Olympic National Park in Washington state. She was pulled over by a ranger for a broken taillight. He could smell marijuana in the vehicle and she was ticketed.
“It is exceptionally confusing,” she said .
In Washington, D.C., Congress gets to review the voter-approved measure legalizing pot.  Members were divided. Sen. Rand Paul (R) said he was “against the federal government telling [Washington, D.C.] they can’t,” while Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.)  told The Washington Post  that he would “consider using all resources available to a member of Congress to stop this action.”
Much of the land the federal government administers is operated by the Bureau of Land Management, the Forest Service, the Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Park Service. The remaining areas are operated by the Department of Defense and other agencies, according to a 2012 Congressional Research Service study .
A January Washington Post-ABC News poll found that Americans were split on marijuana legalization. According to the poll, 49 percent of respondents said they supported it while 48 percent said they were opposed.

Obama: The climate-change presidentBy Stephen Stromberg November 12 Follow @strombergsteve
In his first term, President Obama put his political muscle behind passing health-care reform and financial regulations instead of a global warming bill, missing the best opportunity ever to establish a comprehensive national climate program. Then he hardly mentioned global warming.
But despite these lousy beginnings, Obama’s accumulating accomplishments on climate change might define his legacy.
Wednesday saw a major breakthrough. In Beijing, Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping struck a serious, medium-term, joint greenhouse emissions deal , a landmark agreement of the sort that critics argued would never happen. The pact does not merely commit the countries to trajectories they are already taking. It will require both nations to push harder toward cleaner energy.

This sweeps away years of anxiety about whether China and the United States — responsible together for nearly half of global greenhouse gas output — would ever cooperate on climate, rather than each perpetually waiting for the other to act. It will always be tough to get many nations to move together, and keep moving together, in the same direction. But two dominant — and historically reluctant — players now are.
Obama could pull this off because of several things his administration has done since his initial failure on climate legislation. The decades-old Clean Air Act gives the executive branch various powers to restrict air pollution — including, the Supreme Court confirmed, carbon dioxide. Obama’s Environmental Protection Agency has used these powers. The EPA struck a bargain with automakers to drastically increase the fuel efficiency of cars and trucks sold in the United States. Then it set greenhouse emissions standards on new and significantly rebuilt power plants, and after that on existing power plants, the most significant anti-carbon measure in the country’s history. Add in a variety of smaller initiatives that affect the country’s carbon footprint, and the result is Obama’s increasingly ambitious Climate Action Plan.
Meanwhile, the Affordable Care Act, Obama’s other major policy accomplishment, is once again in serious legal peril. The Supreme Court last week announced it would hear a challenge to a crucial piece of the policy’s design — the subsidies that enable low- and middle-income Americans to buy coverage. The argument against the law is shaky. But the justices might nevertheless unravel the policy, just as it was beginning to succeed.
A future Republican president, of course, might also try to do the same with Obama’s carbon dioxide initiatives, and courts will have to pass judgment on how the EPA implements its anti-carbon programs. Obama’s legacy could end up being one of tragic policy frustration. But there’s still a good chance he will be remembered best as the president who finally started the country down a responsible path on greenhouse emissions.

New York Times editor on China visa problem: Were a little bit hostagesBy Erik Wemple November 12 Follow @ErikWemple

The troubles of the New York Times in getting China visas for its personnel flashed on the international stage during a Wednesday joint news conference with President Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping. When asked whether the Chinese government might process a backlog of visa applications, Xi placed the blame with the journalists: “The party which has created the problem, should be the one to help solve it,” he said.
The translation here is that the New York Times reporters with pending visa applications for China should keep their bags in the closet. There are about six such folks, including Philip Pan , Chris Buckley , Austin Ramzy, Javier Hernandez, plus a photographer and a videographer. The newspaper reports no progress in the visa applications for those staffers.
The result is quite a bind.
The New York Times has a number of correspondents now working in China, including Edward Wong , Jane Perlez , Andrew Jacobs , David Barboza (based in Shanghai ) and others. The visa backlog places each of these correspondents in an unenviable professional position: Should they leave their posts, they can be pretty sure at this point that their editor won’t be able to replace them. So several are hanging on past the New York Times’s standard four-to-five year foreign correspondent term, according to New York Times international editor Joe Kahn. “We’re a little bit hostages,” Kahn tells the Erik Wemple Blog, referring to the professional pickle of his people (and not using “hostage” in any literal sense). “Some of our correspondents are okay with staying longer, others are willing to stay for a little longer but are also thinking about other assignments.”
The newspaper these days finds itself doing precisely one of the U.S.-China activities it’s seeking to report on — diplomacy, that is. Following the Obama-Xi news conference, the Times issued an official statement from Kahn seizing on the one relatively optimistic note struck by Xi in addressing the journalist-visa issue:
“President Xi said today, ‘We need to step down and see what the problem is.’ We are willing to work closely with the Chinese authorities to resolve the issues that have created a backlog of unprocessed journalist visa applications for our correspondents. China is an important country and a big part of our international report. We are enormously proud of our coverage of the country. Allowing us to have a full complement of correspondents there will enhance our ability to tell China’s story fully and fairly.”
Times leaders turned into small-scale envoys in late 2012, following a big investigative piece by Barboza on the billions of dollars in “hidden riches” commanded by the family of then-Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao . Flanking the story was a handy graphic — “ The Wen Family Empire ” — detailing the mess of financial beneficiaries in the Wen group, just the sort of enterprise journalism that despots despise. It’s no secret that Beijing didn’t like the story, which required people like Kahn and his bosses to soften its landing a bit.
“There was a lot of misunderstanding about the story that needed to be cleared up,” says Kahn about an effort to assure Beijing that the story was merely journalism and not an attempt to topple the regime.
Even as the Times hopes for a loosening of visa processing, it has stayed focused on hard-edged stuff, including more on the super-rich and an expose of the regime’s effectiveness in censoring Bloomberg . It also reported that Chinese hackers had attacked its computer systems , an offensive that coincided with Barboza’s story on the Wen family.
A breakthrough on China access was absent from a new visa deal announced this week by the United States and China; it’ll extend to short-term business travelers, tourists and students . Fox News anchor Greta Van Susteren criticized the administration for failing to score a victory for U.S. media outlets . “What we have [is] a lopsided deal that favors the Chinese,” argued Van Susteren.
A fine point — perhaps the White House and the State Department should have pushed more forcefully on behalf of the New York Times and other news outlets seeking fuller access to China. Not that an organization like the New York Times specializes in pressuring the government for such considerations: “We’re not kidding when we say we’re not arms of the government,” says Kahn, referring to their message to Chinese authorities. “We have an arm’s length relationship with our own government. For us to go to them hat in hand and say, ‘You have to help us solve this problem’ is domestically a little bit delicate.”

An Egyptian army spokesman says eight sailors are missing after an assault by “terrorist elements” on a navy patrol boat off one of the country’s Mediterranean ports.
Brig. Gen. Mohammed Samir said in a statement on his official Facebook page early on Thursday that four assault boats were destroyed and that 32 attackers were arrested.
Five troops were also wounded in the attack.
Earlier, the official MENA news agency said gunmen from three boats fired at the naval patrol Wednesday north of the port of Damietta, prompting an exchange of fire.
No further details were available.
Human smuggling is common in the Mediterranean. Egyptian troops have increasingly come under attack from militants since the ouster of Islamist President Mohammed Morsi last year, though attacks at sea are extremely rare.

'Anegan' stars actor Dhanush in four different roles. The film was originally offered to actor Vijay, who, while turning it down due to lack of time, suggested Dhanush’s name. Director K. V. Anand recently said, “I agreed with Vijay’s suggestion right away. After Kamal Haasan, I believe nobody has convincingly portrayed romance on screen apart from Dhanush. He has all the makings of a great actor: he can pan his eyes over the lens of the camera without ever being conscious of it. I have seen only Mohanlal do that.”

Apple (AAPL) shares are hitting another record high. And it seems like there’s nothing that can stop it — not even price targets.
Shares of the smartphone-maker keep blasting blast analysts’ price targets almost as fast as the analysts can raise them. Apple’s breathtaking rally this year — powered by strong uptake of the iPhone 6 smartphone — continues to mock analysts’ price targets rooted in fundamentals and valuations as emotion and speculation takes over.
Shares of Apple Wednesday closed up $1.55, or 1.4%, Wednesday to $111.25. That already tops the $108.10 18-month price target that analysts had just two months ago. Analysts have been scrambling to keep ahead of the soaring shares of Apple — but the stock seems to have no bounds. Perhaps the analysts saying Apple is the first “risk free” stock are on to something after all?
Apple at $110 a share is just below analysts’ current $116.69 18-month price target on the stock. And that average price target has been collectively raised 4.4% just over the past month.
Certainly, there are degrees of optimism, even among analysts. The highest 18-month price target on Apple is currently $143 a share. That might seem outlandishly high, especially since the stock is already trading at 17 times its earnings the past 12 months. But analysts have learned the hard way that you’re either bullish on Apple, or you’re wrong.
Earlier this week, UBS tech analyst Steven Milunovich took his price target up nearly 9% to $125 a share. He pointed to “strong buying intentions for the iPhone 6 … appreciation of the brand and ecosystem and interest in Apple Pay,” as drivers for the ever-rising stock price in a note to clients.
Computerized tools continue to be more guarded about the trajectory of Apple’s stock. Trefis , a tool that measures how much a company is worth by looking at the present value of expected cash flow, pegs the stock’s value at $110. But even that’s been raised more than 10% over the past few months.
How high can the stock go? Seems like it has a mind of its own — one that even the analysts can’t read.

Govt resolves impasse with US over WTO pactIndia, US resolve impasse over food security issues at WTO

Paving the way for implementation of trade facilitation pacts at WTO , India and US have resolved an impasse over food security related issues while safeguarding interest of Indian farmers.
With the US agreeing to support India's proposal on public stockpiling of food, it would now go for ratification by the WTO General Council to facilitate signing of Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) that has been stalled for months.
Announcing the breakthrough, Commerce and Industry Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that India and the US have successfully resolved their differences on the public stockholding issue for food security purposes in WTO.
This will "pave the way for spurring the WTO to more such success," she said, while expressing confidence that members would "take the matter forward in WTO in a constructive spirit".
The Minister further said that many nations saw merit in India's stand at WTO and that the US has also "appreciated and now openly supported our concerns on public stockholding."
"India has never obstructed trade facilitation. We were only trying to safeguard our farmer's interests," she added.
"WTO General Council will receive India's proposal and US will support us," Sitharaman said, while adding that there was a greater understanding of India's position after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's  visit to the US.
India is a strong supporter of the multilateral trading system and we are committed to strengthen it. Bali agreement was not perfect. We had raised these issues for a course correction. We have raised our issues. We are happy to say our differences have been resolved," she said in a series of tweets.

After six consecutive cuts in petrol prices and two in diesel, the government on Thursday hiked the excise duty on petrol and diesel by Rs.1.50 per litre each.
But, the hike is not expected to burden consumers as oil companies plan to adjust the excise hike with a reduction in retail rates that was due this weekend.
“As of now oil companies will be absorbing the hikes...we won’t be passing these on to the consumers,” Indian Oil Corporation spokesperson Siddharth Mukherjee told The Hindu.
The government hiked the excise duty on unbranded petrol from Rs.1.20 per litre to Rs.2.70 per litre, while that on unbranded diesel was hiked from Rs.1.46 a litre to Rs.2.96.

Reliance Infra terminates Mumbai Metro Line II contractReliance Infra terminates Mumbai Metro Line II contract

Reliance Infrastructure said on Thursday it has terminated the agreement for the Rs 12,000 crore Mumbai Metro Line II project due to, what it said was, a failure by the Government of Maharashtra to fulfill its obligations.
The company has also asked for the return of Rs 160 crore bank guarantee.
In a statement, Reliance Infra said the various obligations listed under the concession agreement were not fulfilled by the state government for the project to connect Charkop in north Mumbai with Bandra in the west and Mankhurd in the east.
"The Government of Maharashtra and the concessionaire signed the termination agreement at no cost and no claims to either party," Reliance Infra said, adding that the bank guarantee of Rs.160 crore was to be returned to it.
Releasing its results for the second quarter of this financial year, Reliance Infra had Wednesday said its actual net profit of Rs.431 crore would have been higher by some 13 percentage points, but for the loss of Rs.57 crore on the Mumbai metro project.
Mumbai Metro One, also called the Line I project, is already being operated by a joint venture between Reliance Infra Veolia Transport of France and the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority.
Awarded in 2007 after an international competitive bidding process, this was country's first mass rapid transport project envisaged on a public-private partnership platform. Reliance Infra with 66 percent is the majority shareholder, as per its website.

The benchmark BSE Sensex on Thursday fell from all-time level to settle the day 68 points lower at 27,940.64 as investors became cautious after excise duty on petrol and diesel was hiked even as inflation cooled off and factory output grew in signs of economic recovery.
The Sensex rose in early trade on hopes of rate cut after inflation softened to 5.52 per cent in October.
Three-month high industrial production growth of 2.5 per cent in September also boosted the sentiment, brokers said.
But soon profit-booking emerged after the government hiked excise duty on petrol and diesel prices by Rs 1.50 a litre each to mop up an additional Rs 13,000 crore in revenue.
Some investors fear this may weaken the fight against inflation, a broker said.
After a highly volatile trade, the bellwether index finally settled the day at 27,940.64, showing a loss of 68.26 points or 0.24 per cent from its yesterday's close, snapping three days of rise.
The 50-share Nifty also lost by 25.45 points or 0.30 per cent to 8,357.85.
On Wednesday, the benchmark index had ended at an all-time closing high of 28,008.90 and also hit intra-day high of 28,126.48 on sustained foreign funds inflows driven by economic reforms undertaken by the government recently.
Meanwhile, foreign institutional investors bought shares net of Rs 459.47 crs on Wednesday as per the provisional figures issued by stock exchanges.
The 30-share index in the previous three days had gained by 140.27 points or 0.50 per cent in the last three days.
"Indian equity markets cheered CPI and IIP with benchmark indices opening higher. But profit-taking was seen at higher levels.
"OMC (oil marketing companies) stocks witnessed profit booking, most banking shares were also weak on the index while IT and pharma stocks lifted the index," said Kiran Kumar Kavikondala, Director & CEO, WealthRays Securities.
Stocks of state-run BPCL, HPCL and Indian Oil Corp ended up to 6.11 per cent lower. ONGC was among the biggest Sensex losers, plunging by 2.03 per cent, while RIL fell by 0.53 per cent.
Major Sensex losers were SSLT (2.56 per cent), Tata Power (2.47 per cent), ONGC (2.03 per cent), Gail (1.58 per cent), Axis Bank (1.49 per cent), Hero Motocorp (1.38 per cent), HDFC (1.14 per cent), SBI (0.84 per cent) and ICICI Bank (0.83 per cent).
Infosys rose by 1.77 per cent, followed Dr Reddy's Lab 1.01 per cent, Cipla 0.91 per cent.
Among the sectoral indices, Oil&Gas fell by 1.63 per cent, followed by Realty 1.44 per cent, Metal 0.76 per cent, Bankex 0.71 per cent and Auto 0.39 per cent, while IT rose by 0.99 per cent and Teck 0.74 per cent.
The total market breadth turned negative as 1,733 stocks finished in the red, while 1,314 stocks closed in green. The total turnover dropped to Rs 3,529.31 crore from Rs 3,649.38 crore on Wednesday.
"The benchmarks were seen upholding sideways bias on Thursday as well, after the better than expected macro-economic data failed to trigger the directional move. In line with the key index, the sectoral indices too traded mixed whereas profit taking in the cash segment pushed the market breadth in the red," said Jayant Manglik, President, Retail Distribution, Religare Securities.
Sixteen scrips out of the 30-share Sensex pack ended lower while 14 others closed higher.
Asian markets were trading mixed.
Key indices in Hong Kong, Japan, Taiwan, and Singapore ended higher by 0.34-1.14 per cent, while indices in China and South Korea finished lower by 0.34-0.36 per cent.

Special Arrangement A still from the restored film Garm Hava
The Hindu DELICATE SUBJECT: M. S. Sathyu says the atmosphere in India is more communal and fundamental now. Photo: K. Bhagya Prakash
TOPICS
Hindi cinema
Bangalore was the first Indian city to watch M.S. Sathyu’s film Garm Hava in 1974. Forty years later, the film, recognised for its most heart-wrenching portrayal of the Muslim identity conundrum post-Partition, releases in a digitally restored avatar
What place do you call home? What do you do when your heart points in one direction and the world beckons you to another home? For most of us who’ve lead peaceful comfortable lives, issues of fragmented identities and scattered homes may seem remote and cut off. But not for those who’ve survived it. And not for those people in most part of the world who still struggle with it.
And a grim reminder of such an existence are films like the classic Garm Hava, directed by M.S. Sathyu in 1973. The questions raised in the film are still relevant 40 years after it was made. Sathyu and his friend decided the world needs to see the film again. And so, in 2010 efforts began to restore the film, to release it as a DVD. It took on a larger framework when Indikino Edutainment stepped in to restore it, and after three years of being worked on, the film is set for a theatrical re-release on November 14.
“The whole atmosphere has changed in India. It’s become more communal and fundamental, with the Congress and the Left failing, giving room for communal forces to take over,” says Sathyu, over telephone from Mumbai where he’s readying for the film’s premiere.
The film dealt with the plight of Muslims in post-Partition India through a drama of nuanced relationships between members of a large family. “We have the second largest Muslim population in the world, after Indonesia. You can’t doubt their nationality or their patriotism. The whole idea of making the film in 1973, was to show that ‘we are not different from the others’.”
Winner of the National Award in 1973, the film was India’s entry for the Academy Awards in the Best Foreign Film category. Garm Hava starred Balraj Sahni and Dinanath Zutshi in the leading roles and marked Farooq Shaik’s debut. Based on Ismat Chugtai’s work, the film was written by noted poet Kaifi Azmi and Sathyu’s wife Shama Zaidi. One of the biggest challenges of making the film, says Sathyu, was shooting on location in Agra. There were no film sets used.
The one compelling reason that made him want to tell the story? Sathyu’s response is a bit underwhelming: “We got finance for the movie! D.K. Karanjia, who was heading the Film Finance Corporation (which later became the NFDC) liked the script and agreed to finance it. There’s nothing pre-planned about such things. Later, it just turns out to be whatever it is,” laughs the 83-year-old.
He does concede that it took almost 25 years after Partition for a film on the subject to be finally made. “Ritwik Ghatak and Nemai Ghosh (noted photographer who made Chinnamul) did make films on the aftermath of the Partition of Bengal, but no one had attempted this…on the Partition that led to India and Pakistan being created. The subject was too delicate and many people didn’t want to remember it,” he points out.
What does he hope the film’s re-release will achieve? “That’s an experiment. The film has an old-fashioned narration, of the kind not being used in today’s films. Today there’s a lot of ‘bang bang’ stuff. I’m here to see if people are still interested in this kind of cinema. You can never say what becomes a success,” says Sathyu.
After the film was made, there were apprehensions that it was a rather delicate subject. The whole process of getting censor certification for the film took 12 months. And when it was finally released, it was in Bangalore that it was first shown. When it was ready for release, midterm elections were on in UP. “There was a belief that the film was made to move the Muslim vote...we had no such thing in mind. Ultimately Mrs. Indira Gandhi helped us get the certification and it was released in the south because there was not much impact of the Partition here.”
The film will be released through PVR Director’s Rare across nine Indian cities on November 14, including Bangalore, Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, Pune and Ahmedabad. Then it will also go to single theatres.
Sound restored over a year
Both Garm Hava's director M.S. Sathyu, and R.D.Deshpanday, MD, Indikino Edutainment — the company that restored the film — admit that the film's restoration was a tedious process, beginning with having to repair torn and scratched film negatives. The almost two lakh frames were restored frame by frame, at a cost of almost Rs. One crore. But the biggest challenge was to convert the sound — originally in mono form — into the present Dolby surround sound. "Sound restoration is rarely undertaken as it's a complicated process; then matching it to the original picture was a challenge. It was done over a year in Los Angeles," says Deshpanday, whose company has interests ranging from hospitality to agriculture across India and Europe. A film lover, he says they undertook the project after acquiring a motion picture company, as they hope to build a library of Indian classic films. "Our idea is that such a film should be available to the younger generation. These issues of lack of trust and questions of national identity are not limited to our country alone," he adds.

The 2014 election was very bad for Democrats. It was almost even worse.By Aaron Blake November 13 Follow @aaronblakewp

As bad as things were for Democrats on Nov. 4, it appears they could have been even worse. Witness: A new survey from the Public Religion Research Institute .
The poll shows that 19 percent of Republican voters made up their minds in the final week of the campaign. By comparison, nearly one-third — 31 percent — of Democratic voters say they decided in the final seven days of the campaign (including 10 percent on Election Day).
To put that in perspective, consider that the generic ballot favored Republicans 52 to 47. If you extrapolate those late-deciders onto those numbers, around 10 percentage points worth of the GOP's 52 percent of voters would have decided to vote Republican in the closing days, while 14.5 points of the Democrats' 47 percent held out that long — including about five points until the final day.
Before those late deciders ... well ... decided, the GOP would have led by about nine or 10 points on the generic ballot, at least according to this poll. (Again, this is rough math.)
Had those late-deciders broken more evenly, or a few extra points' worth of Democrats decided not to vote at all, it's possible that the GOP's 52-47 margin could have been even bigger, and maybe we'd be talking about more GOP House seats and/or a 10- or 11-seat GOP gain in the Senate rather than a likely nine-seat gain (with the possible additions of states like Virginia and New Hampshire).
That's all very hypothetical, though, and these are national numbers — not focused on key Senate races -- so they are only so useful. Also, it's quite possible those Democratic late-deciders are simply partisans who weren't all that enthusiastic about voting and, thus, didn't technically decide until the very end, even as their votes were basically foregone conclusions.
But for what it's worth, exit polls in Georgia, North Carolina and Iowa all showed much the same thing: Republican Senate candidates leading by substantial margins among early-deciders, and Democrats leading by several points or more among late-deciders. In Georgia, for instance, people who decided their vote in final week favored Democrat Michelle Nunn, 50-43. People deciding earlier favored Republican Sen.-elect David Perdue, 55-43.
And for Democrats fretting about just how bad last week was, these polls suggest — at least to some degree — that they dodged another bullet or two.

Will area finally see season s first snow Slight chance tonight.By David Streit November 13
Today’s Daily Digit
A somewhat subjective rating of the day’s weather, on a scale of 1 to 10.
5
A chill in the air, clouds in the sky;  a stray late day shower, no need to cry.
Express Forecast
Today: Increasing clouds, light breezes. Shower chance late. Highs: 47-52.
Tonight: Possible evening showers, snow mix before ending? Lows: 28-34.
Tomorrow: Sun returns, gusty winds. Highs: 42-46.
FORECAST IN DETAIL
Temperature Map
Temperatures: Latest D.C. area temperature map. See interactive map on our Weather Wall .
Afternoon temperatures are some 15-20 degrees lower than the past couple of days but, still, the first day behind the cold front is pretty ho-hum, at least by Midwest standards. The cold ooze keeps it up though and makes for a much chillier weekend than we are used to. At least it takes the sweat out of all that yard work! Even Reagan National is likely to see its first freeze of the season on Friday night; gravel or no gravel.
On Saturday, plenty  of sun and light winds make for a fine brisk fall day for those headed over to the Navy game but that Maryland night game is a huddle under the blanket one. Prospects for the snow bros are bleak as the late Sunday/Monday system looks all wet.
Today (Thursday): The sun is likely to still get in a few cameo appearances during the morning to take the worst of the chill off. However, clouds eventually swamp the skies and that will cap our highs in the upper 40s to near 50.  Rain showers may develop, especially in our western areas, late in the afternoon. Winds from the northwest are light. Confidence : Medium-High
Tonight: A very weak disturbance passing by in the evening could set off  showers (40% chance), and an outside chance of a rain/snow mix before ending (if the precipitation lingers late into the night when colder air arrives). If you are one of the unlucky ones to get wet, be careful, all  those leaves are slippery! Winds begin to build from the northwest at 10-15 mph, with gusts back up to 25 mph. Most of the showers quickly move off to the east before midnight. Lows drop to the low-to-mid 30s. Confidence: Medium
For related traffic news, check out Dr. Gridlock . Keep reading for the forecast through the weekend…

Tomorrow (Friday): Sun returns in full force but gusty northwest winds take their toll on the temps. In fact, it will struggle to do better than low-to-mid 40s, easily making it the coldest day since last March.  Very dry air makes it a lip balm kind of day. Confidence: High
Tomorrow night: The stars are aglitter in the clear cold heavens. The drop off in winds is welcome but the cold airmass is finally in full control.  Lows drop to the 20s in most locations and even Washington National should hit freezing for the first time this season. Confidence: High
A LOOK AHEAD
Saturday is a picturesque fall  day with bright golden sun highlighting the splotches of fall color that survived the earlier winds. Temperatures are about 10 degrees colder than normal with highs only in the mid-40s. The early setting sun makes for a very chilly evening with 30s quickly settling in and most of the area ends up right back in the 20s for lows. Confidence: High
What was a light snow event in the Midwest the night before is just a ceiling of clouds over us on Sunday. This makes it hard for temperatures to recover from the overnight chill and we have to settle for highs in the mid-to-upper 40s again. Easterly winds increase the low humidity and reduce the static cling factor. A surge of moisture coming up from the south is likely to bring showers to the area overnight (70% chance) but that Gulf inflow drops snow chances to nil. Temperatures  only fall to the mid-to-upper 30s.  Confidence: Medium
Monday starts out cloudy with a shower now and then but that may transition to some fairly steady rain (80% chance) by afternoon.  This is all ahead of a cold front that will make the current one look like child’s play on Tuesday. Highs should reach the upper 40s to lower 50s. Confidence: Medium

What role should robots have in fighting EbolaBy Dominic Basulto November 13 Follow @dominicbasulto
Sending in the robots to clean up after an Ebola outbreak sounds like a no-brainer, but would you really want your loved ones buried by a robot? (John Moore/Getty Images)
The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy recently organized a symposium of top robotics experts  at Worcester Polytechnic Institute to brainstorm how field robots could be used in future Ebola-like pandemics. While the researchers came up with a number of innovative short-term and long-term ideas for how robots could be used to fight Ebola  – everything from cleaning and decontaminating rooms to actually administering IVs to humans under medical treatment — there are still a number of important issues to clarify before we hand over the task of fighting Ebola to the robots.
On the surface, of course, handing over the dirty work of cleaning up after an Ebola outbreak to the robots sounds like a no-brainer. Instead of putting humans into harm’s way, why not just send in a robot? That’s the logic behind the Xenex germ-zapping robots , the TRU-D sanitation robots , the HStar Technologies medical robot that can lift and carry patients in its arms and the QinetiQ unmanned ground vehicles that can be used to detect and remove hazardous materials. There’s even an amazing medical robot that can remove the sheets from a patient’s bed and then discard the contaminated linen . No hands, no fuss. Robots can’t develop symptoms from Ebola, they are relatively easy to disinfect (except for their wheels), they dutifully carry out tasks without talking back and they can dispose of hazardous waste efficiently.
One idea proposed by robotics researchers is to repurpose Baxter industrial robots for the fight against Ebola. (Tomohiro Ohsumi/Bloomberg)
Scratch the surface, though, and you can start to see the moral and philosophical questions that arise once robots start doing more than just grunt-level decontamination work. In short, everything changes once robots also become human-like caregivers of Ebola patients rather than just repurposed industrial robots.
Even assuming that wise and highly moral technologists have created robots according to something approximating Isaac Asimov’s Three Laws of Robotics , there still exists all kinds of potential for things to go wrong as robots go about trying to observe these laws. Just read any of Asimov’s “Robot” stories  (or, better yet, watch the Will Smith movie ) to understand how things might go awry.
Here’s just one real-world example: What would an Ebola robot following Asimov’s Three Laws of Robotics have made of Kaci Hickox, the controversial Ebola nurse, and all the questions – both legal and moral – raised by her decision to flout quarantine guidelines while in New Jersey and then in Maine? How would you possibly program an artificially intelligent robot to deal with that scenario?
The First Law of Robotics  seems to be fairly incontrovertible: “A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.” Okay, so if we know that a potentially infected Ebola nurse (showing no signs of infection) still has some small statistical chance of spreading Ebola to others, what would a robot caregiver do if it saw the nurse taking bike rides around her community, potentially enabling the spread of Ebola? The robot couldn’t physically harm the nurse, of course. And it probably couldn’t impose a mandatory quarantine, either, since that might harm the individual by infringing on constitutional rights. However, the whole “inaction” clause of the First Law opens up another loophole – the caregiver robot couldn’t exactly sit around, watching patients taking bike rides whenever they want if they potentially posed a risk to other human beings.
So, the robot would be forced to revert to the Second Law of Robotics , which is: “A robot must obey the orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.” Easy, you say, the Ebola robot wouldn’t actually have to worry about what to do in these examples – it would be told what to do by humans. But, as we know from reality, what New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie might give as an order (mandatory quarantine) could differ from what Maine Gov. Paule LePage and state health authorities might order (voluntary quarantine). Which order, then, should the robot follow?
Faced with all these potential contradictions, the robot would have to resort to the  Third Law of Robotics : “A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.” Okay, so now you’d have an Ebola-fighting robot with a limited degree of freedom able to make decisions on its own about what’s right for humanity. Even if you add in another, Fourth Law, as Asimov later did – “A robot may not harm humanity, or, by inaction, allow humanity to come to harm” – you suddenly have robots making decisions about what to do about Ebola on a global, rather than local, level. What might be good for humanity in general might not be good for an individual Ebola patient, that patient’s lovable pet dog, or that patient’s immediate family.
Maybe all of this is just over-thinking the matter too much, influenced negatively by too many dystopian novels about robot overlords. After all, as Dmitry Berenson, an assistant professor in Worcester Polytechnic Institute’s robotics program, emphasized at the Ebola robotics symposium, “We’re not trying to make this a completely automated process.” Theoretically, human operators would always be a safe distance away, whether it’s taking off hazmat clothing, operating a telepresence robot, or overseeing the cleanup of an Ebola-infected area. Robots would not be working autonomously, so no scary dystopian scenarios of robots taking over.
Fair enough.
However, clearly there are a lot of moral and philosophical considerations to take into account before the White House signs off on any proposal for the extensive use of robots in fighting Ebola. Robots might be great at performing simple instrumental tasks like cleaning up an infected room, but they are far less equipped to take on human-like qualities as Ebola caregivers. Even the concept of robotic burials — robots carrying out full burials of humans in order to protect a community from potential infection risks — could face strong pushback in some communities. Would you want your loved one’s body handled by a robot? And, there’s always the issue of whether using robotic caretakers would somehow stigmatize or psychologically traumatize a patient. (You know it’s the beginning of the end when a robot shows up to treat you instead of a human doctor.)
Let’s just hope that, in the future, Ebola fighting robots will be just as accomplished as navigating complex moral and philosophical issues of tackling a pandemic as they are at navigating the complex terrain of physical world obstacles.

The U.S.-China climate deal is historic  but it will still take more to save the planetBy Chris Mooney November 12 Follow chriscmooney

Climate experts on Wednesday said the historic  agreement  between the United States and China to curb greenhouse gas emissions, though a major breakthrough, still will likely not move the world back into a climate safe zone that would avert the worst effects of global warming.
According to the deal, the United States will reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by up 28 percent below their 2005 level. It would do so by 2025. China, meanwhile, pledges to limit its fast-rising carbon dioxide emissions to the level reached in 2030 and no higher. It will also try to get 20 percent of its energy from non-fossil fuels sources by then, if not earlier.
The agreement comes after another similar  announcement recently by the European Union. EU members committed to reduce their collective emissions by 40 percent below their 1990 level. They are promising to do that by 2030.
With Europe, China and the United States all pledging to take action, the world's three largest sources of emissions are for the first time working to significantly prevent the warming of the planet. "If China, the U.S., and the E.U .… got in a room, that's about 60 percent of global emissions right there," said Princeton climate scientist Michael Oppenheimer.
Despite the burst of activity, however, climate experts warn that even these ambitious efforts are unlikely -- without concerted further action -- to solve the world's climate challenges. On Wednesday, for example, a grim report released by the International Energy Agency suggested  that the world is on track to pump so much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere by 2040 that it will cause irreparable harm to the planet's ecosystems.
The IEA says that humans can only emit about 1,000 additional gigatonnes of carbon dioxide (one gigatonne is equal to a billion metric tons) into the atmosphere before passing a dangerous threshold.
Climate scientists warn that pumping more carbon dioxide than that into the atmosphere would likely cause a more-than-2 degree Celsius rise in global temperatures over levels that existed before the rise of industry in the 19th century.
Such a rise could cause dramatic sea-level rise due to the melting of the planet's ice sheets, threats to agriculture, and more severe weather.
Experts were scrambling on Wednesday to determine how the new U.S.-China agreement affects the 2 degree target. "The answer we’ve come to so far is that it depends," said Taryn Fransen, a senior associate at the World Resources Institute, an environmental think tank. "I think the big question in terms of total emissions is going to be when and at what level China peaks" its emissions.
According to  projections from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the world is churning out more than 30 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide annually from energy use. The United States accounts for a little over five gigatonnes, Europe produces about four gigatonnes, and China emits about 9.5 gigatonnes.
But global emissions are also still on a rise, meaning that in coming years the global annual number is projected to exceed 40 gigatonnes. The International Energy Agency says under current its projections -- which do not account for the brand new U.S.-China agreement -- the world will produce the threshold-breaking 1,000 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide by 2040.
Forecasting changes to emission patterns is extremely difficult and imprecise, and it's not clear just how significant an impact the new agreement would have on these projections. But climate experts say that it's unlikely the new agreement -- without further action by both developing and developed countries -- would be enough to avert some of the worst outcomes.
"Obviously, if only the U.S. and China were doing something, then we’d fall short," explains David Hawkins, director of climate change programs at the Natural Resources Defense Council. "And it’s also true that if we don’t do anything more than this deal, we would bust [the] budget."
Nonetheless, the experts underscore that this deal has a symbolic value that goes far beyond the literal emissions cuts (or caps) that have now been pledged, precisely because the world's top two greenhouse gas emitters have now both come to the table.
If the agreement lays the groundwork for a broader global agreement -- one that encompasses other major emitters like India, Japan, and Russia -- then that is the real payoff. That agreement could happen in Paris in late 2015, when the nations of the world gather to try to achieve a global agreement to cut greenhouse gas emissions.
"I take what happened last night as really one of the most important developments that I’ve seen in the international negotiations over the last 5 to ten years," says Robert Stavins, an environmental economist at the Harvard Kennedy School. That is not because of the literal emissions reductions that China and the United States have pledged, but rather because of the fact that they lay a foundation for more movement in reducing the emissions of other developing nations (besides China).
The Earth system, after all, doesn't care about political victories -- only raw physics. "The planet doesn’t give A’s for effort," says  Nathaniel Keohane , who heads the international climate program of the Environmental Defense Fund. "Deeper reductions will be needed but this is a very good first step."

American Horror Story: Freak Show recap - BullseyeBy Lauren McEwen November 13
Mat Fraser as Paul the Illustrated Seal, Erika Ervin as Amazon Eve. CR: Michele K. Short/FX
The episode picks up a few days after the twins’ “disappearance.” Elsa returns to the camp, a new bounce in her step thanks to the fact that she’s sold the twins to Dandy and Gloria Mott. Once there, she immediately begins prepping for the “television show” that Stanley the Con Man promised her, pulling a red-and-white wheel of death from storage so that she can practice throwing knives.
So far, the two major components of Elsa’s imaginary TV show are singing and knife throwing. Am I the only one who is kind of intrigued? Anyway, Elsa is sticking to her story: The twins ran off, but don’t worry about it, everybody, because I’m gonna be on a Hollywood TV show and all of you can come along!
Although they are all reeling over the twins’ disappearance, the troupe pulls it together to celebrate Elsa’s birthday week. Ethel bakes her a cake and the rest of the carnies shower her with sweet, cheap and handmade gifts, including a (really creepy and exploitative) hot water bottle thing with Ma Petite inside; ready to cuddle with Elsa at a moment’s notice.
Later, Elsa goes to bed with…Paul the Illustrated Seal, who is, apparently, her secret, part-time lover. She wants him to come to Hollywood with her – before the others, of course – where he can learn to drive and pose as her chauffeur when she has “normal” suitors. For the record, Elsa is the worst.
After their romp, Paul makes a visit to Penny the candy striper, the young woman who Elsa had drugged and sexually assaulted on camera in the first episode. Paul was one of the carnies who assaulted her, but they have been seeing each other secretly for weeks, with him sneaking in through her bedroom window. In light of the fact that he once raped her at Elsa’s command, Paul refuses to have sex with Penny until she truly knows him.
Given her past crimes, it should come as no surprise that Elsa sold the twins to the Motts out of jealousy. So far, the arrangement seems to be suiting both sisters. Dandy has decided that he is in love with the twins. Bette, of course, is thrilled to be with Dandy. He’s been kind to them, showering them with gifts and having the household cook whip up special meals for them. Dot, on the other hand, is initially wary of Dandy and his affections, but she perks up when he reads them a news article about the first successful surgery performed on conjoined twins. If putting up with Dandy’s creepiness will help her to finally get rid of Bette, Dot’s willing to stomach just about anything.
Paul and Dandy both head to the drugstore to pick up gifts for their ladies. Paul recognizes Dandy from the freak show and, after peeking at Dandy’s purchases, quickly realizes that he has the twins. That night, he shares his suspicions with Jimmy, but Jimmy doesn’t want to believe him. Elsa saved them all, buying their loyalty in the process. Paul tells Jimmy that he can’t see Elsa for who she is because of his own prejudices. Jimmy could possibly pass as a “normal” person, and he has put Elsa on a pedestal, as a result, but Paul’s eyes are clear.
Back at the Mott mansion, Dot reads an update on the conjoined twins who were surgically separated and is devastated by the news. The larger twin died, while his brother lived. She’s perfectly fine with the idea of Bette dying, but she is not OK with putting her own life in danger. Bette thinks that it’s an abomination to mess with God’s will and Dot argues that they are “God’s cruel joke.”
Seeing an opening, Dandy decides to bring up something that has been bugging him: the twins’ diaries. He doesn’t think that they should have secrets from each other. He offers his own “secret” in exchange for one of theirs. He claims credit for taking out Twisty the homicidal clown. Unwilling to believe that Jimmy lied, Dot refuses to share a secret in return. He flies into one of his rages, tearing up his playroom. Dot may be the worldlier twin, but that was a really dumb move. Dandy is dangerous and anyone who is around him for more than five minutes should be able to sense that.
With the twins gone, Stanley sets his sights on Jimmy. He wants Esmeralda to lure Jimmy into a barn so that they can chop off his hands and sell them to the Morbidity Museum. Naturally, Esmeralda doesn’t want to do it. She’s falling for Jimmy and amputating his arms will severely damage any chances she has with him, so she offers up an alternative. Ma Petite is small enough to fit in one of Stanley’s jars. Esmeralda offers to lure the woman to the barn, put her in a jar and fill it up with embalming fluid.
Elsa and Paul get into a fight. He confronts her about the twins and she demands to know why he smells like cheap perfume. (I shall randomly quote the line “the general consensus is that you’ve done something nefarious with those girls” for the next week.) Realizing that all of her employees suspect that she got rid of the twins, she wakes up the rest of the troupe and starts berating them about their pasts and the awfulness from which she saved them. She skillfully manipulates them until they offer to prove they trust her. Her test of choice? One of them must strap themselves to her wheel while she gets in some target practice.
Paul ends up taking the challenge and, to Elsa’s thinly veiled delight, ends up taking a knife in the stomach. The other carnies rush to his aid and Elsa pretends to call a doctor, but instead leaves him for dead. Her act isn’t as tight as she believes, though. By the end of the episode, Jimmy and Ethel, two of her most loyal troupe members are both suspicious of her.
Esmeralda tries to go through with her plan to kill Ma Petite, tricking her into going to the barn by promising her a totally legit “surprise.” She gets her into the jar, but Ma Petite is so sweet (She broke my heart when she was in that jar pretending to be a butterfly.) that Esmeralda can’t bring herself to kill her. The next morning, she brings Ma Petite back to camp and asks Jimmy to run away with her.
Furious with Esmeralda, Stanley insists that they go back to his old plan and kill Jimmy. He might have to get in line behind Dandy, though. Distraught after reading Dot’s diary, Dandy accepts the fact that he will never love. “My purpose is to bring death,” he says dramatically, while tucking a huge knife into the back of his orange, pleated slacks. Moments later, Jimmy shows up, looking for the twins and possibly walking to his death.

Dont want people saying Im too old to act: Judi DenchBy: Press Trust of India | London | Posted: November 13, 2014 7:06 pm
Veteran actress Judi Dench, who will turn 80 next month, says she is tired of people telling her that she is too old to act.
“I don’t want to be told I’m too old to try something. I want to see for myself if I can’t do it rather than be told you might have a fall or you can’t learn your lines. Let me have a go. Let us all have a go,” Dench said during a screening of the BBC’s ‘Esio Trot’.
Dench said the only time her age bothered her was when she turned 40 but since then she has come to consider it just a number, reported the Radio Times.
“Age is a number, it’s something imposed on you… It drives me absolutely spare when people say ‘are you going to retire, isn’t it time you put your feet up’ or tell me (my) age,” she said.
“The only time I got really upset was when I was 40, for some reason. I got really upset when I was 40, and I was alright after that. It’s that old thing: you are only as old as you feel. It’s not to do with age; it’s something to do with inside. It’s the engine.”

Delhi Assembly polls: Somnath Bharti among 22 candidates named in AAPs 1st listPrint
The party has not included the name of its chief Arvind Kejriwal in the first list.
By: Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: November 13, 2014 7:03 pm | Updated: November 13, 2014 7:08 pm
Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Thursday released its first list of 22 candidates fielding former ministers Somnath Bharti, Saurabh Bhardwaj, Satyendra Jain and Girish Soni in the Delhi Assembly elections, the dates of which are yet to be announced.
The party, however, has not included the name of its chief Arvind Kejriwal in the first list. It said that it is now screening all the applicants and some names, which have not made it to the first list, will be accommodated.
Soni, Bharti, Bhardwaj and Jain have been fielded from the same constituencies they had won in the last Assembly elections. Eight sitting MLAs also figure in the list.
AAP has not included any new face in the first list while fielding 11 other candidates who fought last Assembly elections but were defeated by a close margin.
“AAP has formed a probe committee led by party’s senior leader Anand Kumar and it will look if allegation emerge against any candidate during elections. If allegation is proved, party can even cancel their ticket in the last moment,” AAP’s PAC member Sanjay Singh told reporters here.
Asked why party then fielded Bharti, who is facing serious charges in Malviya Nagar midnight raid, Singh maintained that the former Law Minister was innocent and that he had gone there on request of local people and tried to help them in busting a “prostitution and drug racket”.
Among the sitting MLAs, who have again been given tickets, are Bharti from Malviya Nagar, Bhardwaj from Greater Kailash, Satyendra Jain from Shakur Basti, Girish Soni from Madipur, Manoj Kumar from Kondli, Jagdeep from Harinagar, Jarnail Singh from Tilak Nagar, Vishesh Ravi from Karol Bagh, Sanjeev Jha from Burari, Bandana Kumari from Shalimar Bagh, Som Dutt from Sadar Bazar and Commando Surender from Delhi Cantt.
The 11 candidates, who had unsuccessfully contested the elections in 2013 but given ticket again are Sandeep (Sultanpuri Majra), Anil Bajpai (Gandhi Nagar), Atul Gupta (Vishwas Nagar), Rajesh Rishi (Janakpuri), Gulab Singh (Matiala), Vijendra Garg (Rajendra Nagar), Kapil Mishra (Karawal Nagar), Jitendra Tomar (Tri Nagar), ND Sharma (Badarpur) and Bhavna Gaur (Palam).
AAP said the candidates have been selected based on their performances in their constituencies.
“Party may also release its second list of candidates in the next seven days,” another AAP leader Ashutosh Srivastava said.
He also said that the party would fight the forthcoming assembly elections on the issues of water, electricity, development, health and education.
In the last elections, AAP had selected candidates, who had attached signatures of 100 voters in their constituencies along with their applications, but it didn’t adopt such a process this time.
“In these Assembly elections, party has dropped the process of directing applicants to get signatures of 100 voters attached along with their applications,” Srivastava said.
In the assembly polls held in December last year, AAP continued…

Aamir Khan smitten by Anushka Sharma in PK song  Love is a waste of timePrint
‘Love is a waste of time’ features the film’s lead actors Aamir Khan and Anushka Sharma.
Written by Sunitra Pacheco , Edited by Sarika Sharma | Mumbai | Posted: November 13, 2014 7:02 pm | Updated: November 14, 2014 1:34 pm
After the release of their first track, ‘Tharki Chokro’, the ‘PK’ team has now released an adorable song, ‘Love is a waste of time’ featuring the film’s lead actors Aamir Khan and Anushka Sharma.
The video is sweet and goofy with Aamir and Anushka dressed in bright coloured outfits as they make their way around town, having a ball in each other’s company. Aamir, who plays the titular character in the film, is clearly smitten by the pixie haired girl, and we’re sure you’ll know just why!
Penned by Amitabh Varma, the melodious song has been sung by Sonu Nigam, Shreya Ghoshal and features music by Shantanu Moitra.
The song has some similarities with Shreya and Sonu’s earlier duets ‘Zoobi Doobi’ ( 3 Idiots) and ‘Pal pal’ (Lage Raho Munnabhai).

Five Bengali films to premiere at KIFFBy: Press Trust of India | Kolkata | Posted: November 13, 2014 7:01 pm
To promote young talents in Bengali film industry, five new films in the language are being premiered at the ongoing Kolkata International Film Festival.
Introduced for the first time, the ‘Bengali Panorama’ section consists of five films belonging to different genres.
“None of these films have been screened elsewhere. We selected them on the basis of their quality,” KIFF director Yadab Mondal told PTI.
Riingo Banerjee’s ‘The Kite’ takes a cue from Khaled Hosseini’s famous novel ‘The Kite Runner’ and weaves a story of a man’s search for his childhood friend’s son, taken captive by terrorists.
The emotional drama is a story of redemption where a coward emerges as a hero but the backdrop is different from the original novel as it is set on a fictitious place called Ishanpur.
Young independent filmmaker Anindya Chatterjee has used songs and dances of Jhumur, a folk art form of Purulia, to narrate a love story in his film ‘Jhumura The Folklore’.
Shot in blu-ray format, Pallab Kirtania’s ‘Daughter of Clouds’ tells the story of a doctor who is serving the underprivileged tribals of rural Bengal.
Sovan Tarafder’s ‘Selfie’ portrays the multi-dimensional relation between a hero and a commoner.
Nitish Mukherjee’s ‘Chaar Adhyay’ on the other hand is based on Tagore’s novel of the same name.
Altogether, 137 feature films from 60 countries will be screened across 12 venues in the city during the Festival to run till November 17.

Six reasons to watch Kill Dil : Ranveer  Parineeti and OfCourse! our GovindaThough the music does prove to be a setback for the venture, the dialogue promos are being liked by the people for the sheer comic sense.
Written by Sonal Gera , Edited by Sarika Sharma | New Delhi | Posted: November 13, 2014 6:57 pm
Take a pinch of Parineeti Chopra’s screen presence. Mix it with Govinda’s effortless comic timing. Saute it with Ranveer Singh’s exuberance and energy. Garnish this delicacy with Ali Zafar’s acting repertoire. Voila! You have a perfectly cooked and precisely booked story of four madcaps – ‘Kill Dil’.
The movie which marks the return of actor Govinda to the silver screen is all set to hit the theatres tomorrow and we give you few reasons to give this movie a dekko.
The first and foremost reason is Govinda. (Woot! Woot!) The talented actor-turned-politician is making a comeback to the silver screen after what you can call a sabbatical. And he is on a film signing spree. He plays a negative role – a gangster – in the movie which seems interesting enough to pull the crowds into the theatres. Moreover, his dance moves make amy movie a must watch. One can see Govinda shaking a leg to the song ‘Bol Beliya’ and Parineeti ‘trying to match steps’ with him.
The actor turned politician infact has also enlivened the promotional duties and events with his presence. His co-stars in the movie Parineeti Chopra, Ranveer Singh and Ali Zafar are already going gaga over him and are leaving no chance to praise this legendary actor.
Second reason: Ofcourse! The energeticccc Ranveer Singh. He is different and we guess, everybody agrees to this. He is raw, exuberant and exceptionally full of energy. He is loved for the naughtiness and hated some times for the same reason; but he can never be ignored. Be it his unapologetic wit and humor or the rapport he shares with most of his co-stars, he always steals our hearts. And this time around too, he plays a rusty character, something which he has mastered till now. His look in the movie is cute to say the least and the colourful clothes are surely intriguing (Pun Intended!)
Parineeti Chopra is our third. The talented actress who has always been appreciated for her acting talent and criticized for the weight issues, has tried a different look in the movie. She has reduced oodles of weight and has gone glam and we must admit, she looks quite good. And this role too seems a bit different from the roles she has been playing till date.
Ali Zafar makes for our fourth reason. We know he is great at acting and we also know he can fare well in comedy too. His role is of a goon, something (like Parineeti) which he has not played before. His ‘bromance’ with Ranveer Singh is also looking good onscreen.
Also, Shaad Ali returns to the timeline with this flick. Though ‘Saathiya’ continued…

Omar attacks Congress for taking credit of administrative unitsPrint
By: Press Trust of India | Gool (j&k) | Posted: November 13, 2014 6:41 pm
Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah on Thursday charged that Congress was trying to take credit for the creation of new administrative units by his government when the party had actually wanted to put the issue on backburner.
“Congress was not at all interested in the creation of new administrative units and their leaders told me personally and directly that this was not their priority and the issue could be put on backburner,” Omar said while addressing an election rally here today.
“I do not want to indulge in divulging their (Congress’s) shortcomings, but their attitude compels me to speak in public to set the records straight,” he said.
Omar said he had to put his chair at “stake” for bridging the gap between the government and people by creating new administrative units through the state.
“Now, when these administrative units have already been set up, Congress is being boastful about the decision and wants to take all credit for it and other important measures taken by National Conference-led government,” he said.
Targeting the Opposition PDP, Omar said, “Parties like PDP have made politics a trade to obtain personal profits out of it.”

Clinton is hardly the solution to Democratss woesBy Jennifer Rubin November 13 Follow @JRubinBlogger
She is kidding, right? Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) says the Democrats’ big mistake was not to run hard enough on the “war on women.” For conservatives, that ranks up there with “The Democrats’ stimulus was not big enough” and “President Obama doesn’t do enough TV.”
Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.). (Kimberly White/Getty Images for Vanity Fair)
The Huffington Post quotes her as saying “I resent the notion that women shouldn’t be talked to directly about issues we care about. It’s a shame that the range of issues that affect women have been successfully rebranded into this one tight phrase to dust off the shoulder.” Well, I think it was the Democrats who did the branding, but nevertheless this is fascinating on several levels.
First, if the party comes to its senses and realizes Hillary Clinton is a bad politician with a troublesome record who has been around too long, why not Gillibrand for president? At 47 years old, she is younger than Clinton (67) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) (65). She arguably has a more winsome personality than either. She has no direct tie to the Obama administration and therefore need not defend his blunders. She “evolved” from her conservative days in the House and, among other liberal causes, became a key player in repealing Don’t Ask Don’t Tell and investigating assaults against women in the military. She is well-off, but not in the league of Clintonian wealth. In many ways she would be a much more formidable opponent for Republicans than Clinton.
Republicans  nevertheless should hope she is serious about doubling down on “the war on women” and is taken seriously by other Democrats. Having finally reached some equilibrium on the gender divide, Republicans would love to talk about energy, health care, education, taxes and the like while Democrats run a Mark Udall-like campaign obsessed with abortion and contraception. For this very reason, I think Gillibrand is playing to the base rather than giving her best political advice. (The need to play to the base despite common sense is among the problems Democrats face these days.)
And that brings us to the most intriguing question: Are Democrats lost without appeals to gender and race? Their policy cupboard is so bare these days that at times it seems this (along with appeals to tax the rich even more) is all they talk about.
As they obsess on these issues, they have lost white voters, liberal journalist Thomas Edsall reminds us : “The opposition of whites to the Democratic Party is visible not only in voting behavior, but in general opposition to key Democratic policy initiatives, most tellingly in hostility toward the Affordable Care Act.” He continues:
Republicans are not satisfied with winning 62 percent of the white vote. To counter the demographic growth of Democratic constituencies whose votes threaten Republican success in high-turnout presidential elections, Republicans have begun a concerted effort to rupture the partisan loyalty of the remaining white Democratic voters. Their main target is socially liberal, fiscally conservative suburbanites, the weakest reeds in the Democratic coalition. These middle-income white voters do not share the acute economic needs of so-called downscale Democratic voters and they are less reliant on government services.
The Republican strategy to win over these more culturally tolerant, but still financially pressed, white voters is to continue to focus on material concerns – on anxiety about rising tax burdens, for example — while downplaying the preoccupation of many of the most visible Republicans with social, moral and cultural repression.
In this sense Obama is more a symptom than the cause of Democrats woes. A party that depends on stirring up a sense of victimhood and on the other side behaving badly is on shaky ground. That used to be the GOP; now it’s the Democrats. In 2016, that would put a heavy burden on a stale candidate not known for her light touch or creative policies. (“One question presents itself: how transformative a political leader is Hillary Clinton?” Edsall writes . “Can she avoid entrapment by divisive issues of key importance to competing wings of the center-left coalition: L.G.B.T. rights; marijuana legalization; climate change; gun control; racial profiling; fracking; pension rights for public employee unions; citizenship for undocumented immigrants; and the ever pressing social welfare needs of the country’s poor?”)
Maybe Gillibrand can be their Cory Gardner. Clinton certainly can’t be.

Eight sad Craigslist ads for Redskins ticketsBy Dan Steinberg November 13 Follow @dcsportsbog
(By Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post)
We’re barely past the midway point in this Redskins season, and already the online ads for Redskins tickets are filled with pathos and sadness, a barely disguised longing for something grander, something prouder, something more expensive to hawk online.
Granted, not every Craigslist ad shows the traits I’ve picked out here. But it wasn’t very hard to find a few listings that reeked of mid-November Redskins angst. For example:
 
THE REALISTS
“Fine, the team stinks,” these folks admit. “But you, friend, can go to a game for cheap, and probably sit in nicer seats than you can really afford. And then move down. And spend your savings on beer.”

Rolls Royce Ghost Series II is a class apartE-mail

This bike is rubbishYour e-rickshaw has arrived
Products “upcycled” from the scrap heap typically conjure up images of sloppy welds and suspect dexterity – until, that is, you see how craftsmen can build precise, one-of-a-kind bicycles from old car parts . That’s the raison d’être behind the Bicycled initiative, an informal partnership between Lola Madrid, the advertising agency where Cassis works, and a local Madrid bikemaker. The results are downright sensible, if not visionary.
“To be honest, it is a little odd,” Cassis admits as he explains why an ad agency is attempting – in a sort of water-into-wine moment – to upcycle car carcasses into single-speed velocipedes. “But sometimes our talented people come up with amazing ideas that aren’t related to advertising, so we created a department to actually try and make stuff like this happen.”
With maker-centric online marketplaces such as Etsy.com flourishing, there is nothing new about upcycling. For years, clever people have converted wine bottles into candleholders and Mason jars into light fixtures, not to mention the ubiquitous toilets and tubs turned into flower planters. But as a global trend, upcycling – loosely defined as the process by which discarded materials are reimagined into something more valuable – is charting novel, more ambitious paths.
Take Akala sandals , fashioned from discarded vehicle tires in Kenya. In Mumbai, entrepreneur Anu Tandon Vieira, founder of The Retyrement Plan , transforms old tires and other recycled materials into weatherproof outdoor furniture. In Rwanda, Angaza Limited turns discarded vinyl banners into fashion-forward purses and handbags . And in the UK, French product designer Gaspard Tiné-Berès has created Short Circuit, which gives new life to old kitchen appliances .
Unlike these efforts, however, a delicious irony lies at the center of Bicycled. What could be more symbolically resonant than taking a rusty old gas-guzzler and turning it into an emissions-free machine for the urban masses?
“A bike made from junked cars is a bike with an opinion,” says Cassis, Lola Madrid’s creative director. “And there’s the novelty of a bike that’s special.”
Part of the appeal lies in the fact that, like snowflakes, no two Bicycled bikes are alike. Singularity is the happy byproduct of melted-down sheet metal shaped into tubes for the bike’s welded frame; a belt-drive “chain” fashioned from a transmission belt; saddle covers from leather seating surfaces; reflectors from a turn-signal lamp; and a seat-post clamp from a door handle. It’s modern-day alchemy with an eco-conscious twist.
(LOLA Hace)
Compelling? Many people think so, as evidenced by the consumer response at the March 2013 SXSW (South by Southwest) music and media festival in Austin, Texas, where the concept was showcased.
“People loved it,” Cassis says. “We received 7,000 inquiries and advance orders, even though we said it would be an expensive bike [about 500 euros, or nearly $800]. The general reaction was, ‘Congratulations on an amazing idea. I want one.’”
Those enthusiasts likely will wait a while. Like many an Etsy artisan has discovered, it can be difficult to keep pace with demand. Melting down the sheet metal, then welding together a tubular frame and building the rest of one bike currently takes three months, Cassis says. And with at least 7,000 initial inquiries, that’s some daunting math.
“If you want to sell, say 500 or 1,000 bikes, and it takes three months apiece to make them, that’s crazy,” Cassis notes. “So we’ve currently taken a pause in building the bikes. In the long term, we’ll figure out how to make the frames faster, then resume production.”
Might demand diminish in the interim cooling period? Count Cassis among the sceptics , insisting that consumers are always drawn to products with a story to tell because that, in turn, is a story they can tell to others.
Closed for debate is this: With the European Environment Agency estimating that some 17m cars will be scrapped across the continent during 2015, there is little danger that Cassis and company would run out of source material.

India s gold demand surges 39 pct to 225.1 tonnes: WGCGold futures price falls on global cues
India’s gold demand during July-September quarter this year shot up by 39 per cent to 225.1 tonnes against the overall third quarter demand in 2013 on rise in jewellery sales, says a World Gold Council report.
The overall third quarter demand in the country for 2013 stood at 161.6 tonnes, WGC Gold Demand Trends report showed.
Gold demand during the period in terms of value rose by 31 per cent to Rs 56,219.3 crore as compared to Rs 42,829.6 crore in the third quarter of 2013.
Similarly, the total jewellery demand was up by 60 per cent at 182.9 tonnes as against 114.5 tonnes in the same period last year.
The value of jewellery demand surged by 51 per cent to Rs 45,681.6 crore from Rs 30,346.5 crore in the third quarter of 2013.
“The rise in demand for gold jewellery during third quarter of 2014 reflects the unusual low base of third quarter of 2013 that was impacted by the introduction of a range of duty increases and restrictions.
“The third quarter can be viewed as normal for gold demand in spite of the unfulfilled expectations of a duty cut and policy relaxations from the new government,” WGC Managing Director (India) Somasundaram PR said here.
He further said that demand around Diwali reflected the general optimism seen in the country.
“It is now beyond debate that import restrictions have had little impact on demand for gold and yet have strengthened the unauthorised supply channels and seems at odds with the overall sentiment that defines the new government’s business approach,” he added.

M&M to launch two compact SUVs in 2015 | Honda may defer launch of Jazz to next yearM&M plans to launch 3 new vehicles, including 2 compact SUVs in 2015
By PTI | 14 Nov, 2014, 07.57AM IST
In the two-wheeler segment, the firm is eyeing various global markets besides India to launch the French firm's products.

NEW DELHI: Auto major Mahindra & Mahindra plans to launch three new vehicles, including two compact SUVs, next year as it looks to strengthen its position in the domestic market.
In the two-wheeler segment, the firm which is in the process of acquiring 51 per cent stake in Peugeot Motocycles for 28 million euros, is eyeing various global markets besides India to launch the French firm's products.
"We were slow on launches in 2013 and 2104. Now we are back with new launches. In 2015, we will launch two sub-4 meter compact SUVs and one light commercial vehicle. All the three would come on completely new platforms," Mahindra & Mahindra Executive Director Pawan Goenka told reporters here.
The company is also in the process of developing new series of engines with its Korean arm Ssangyong, he added.
Earlier this year, M&M had announced plans to invest Rs 4,000 crore at the Chakan plant to take the overall capacity to 7.5 lakh units annually when fully operational. The fresh infusion would take its total investment in Chakan to Rs 8,000 crore.
In 2013, the company had announced plans to invest Rs 10,000 crore in three years.
Commenting on the plans with Peugeot Motocycles, Goenka said: "We are looking at ASEAN region, particularly Vietnam, North African countries and India to launch products from the Peugeot Motocycle portfolio."
He said, however, that it was "hard to say" as to when two-wheelers from Peugeot stable could be launched in India as the current models are expensive.
"The products in their current avatar would not be feasible for India due to pricing. We will have to do some market research as see what products would suit Indian requirements," Goenka added.
Last month, Mahindra Two-Wheelers, a fringe player in the domestic market, had inked a pact to acquire 51 per cent stake for 28 million euro (over Rs 215 crore) in Peugeot Motocycles, part of the 54 billion euro French auto major PSA Group.
He said Mahindra could do a market research after February next year when the acquisition process is completed.
"India is certainly on for us but at the same time it is not a burning issue," Goenka said.
When asked if the company could look at utilising the French firm's manufacturing resources for Mahindra Two Wheelers, Goenka said: "Certainly, it is possible. There are two possibilities. First one is motorcycle brand Mojo, which we plan to launch in India in next six months and thereafter in international markets.
"Secondly, we will start producing electric scooter GenZe in the US next year. We are keen to take this product to Europe also."
On Mahindra's strategy to turnaround Peugeot Motocycles, Goenka said: "We need to work on two levels. Firstly, we need to see how we can lower the material costs and secondly how to increase margins. At this moment I cannot say when we will be able to achieve break even but I will be happy if it happens in 2-3 years.
"There is no magic wand. All such acquisitions take time to turnaround... We have plans."

Heard Osama taking his last breath: US Navy ...Heard Osama bin Laden taking his last breath: US Navy SEAL Robert O'Neill
PTI Nov 13, 2014, 05.55PM IST
("Eighty-something minutes…)
WASHINGTON: A former US Navy SEAL who claims he killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan has said that he heard the world's most wanted man take his last breath after he pumped three bullets into the head of the al Qaeda chief.
"I was standing above him when he took his last breath and I heard it audibly," Robert O'Neill recounted.
In part two of "The Man Who Killed Usama bin Laden" aired on Tuesday night, O'Neill told Fox News that it was just chance that he ended up being the shooter in the famous mission at bin Laden's compound in the Pakistani garrison city of Abbottabad in 2011.
The 38-year-old commando described how after making it into the compound with his team, he entered the room and saw bin Laden.
"Standing on two feet in front of me, with his hands on his wife's shoulders behind her was the face that I'd seen thousands of times, UBL," he said. "Very quickly I recognised him and then it was just pop, pop pop."
After bin Laden's death, the SEALs' mission was not over. O'Neill described the team's harrowing 90-minute flight back to Afghanistan after completing the raid on May 2, saying the team knew at any moment they could be shot down from the sky.
"Eighty-something minutes into it, somebody came over the radio to everybody and said, 'All right gentleman for the first time in your lives you're going to be happy to hear this.... welcome to Afghanistan,'" he says.
"And everyone was like; oh my God.... we just did it. We just pulled it off and we got him. And we all lived. We're all fine. It was insane. So then, there was high-fiving and stuff. Guys were, cause I mean, we got Usama bin Laden and we're going to live....amazing."
O'Neill said that he and the other SEALs did not think they would make it out of the compound, but he said they felt that the mission would be worth sacrificing their own lives.
"We are going to die eventually, this is a good way to go and it's worth it to kill him," he said they thought. "He's going to die with us."
O'Neill has faced heat from other Navy SEALs who have either discredited his claims or said that it's impossible for O'Neill to know that it was his bullets that struck and killed bin Laden.
Without directly addressing O'Neill and his claims, the military brass wrote a timely letter criticizing SEALs who take public credit for their actions.

Murthy pitches for higher autonomy to collegesIT veteran N R Narayana Murthy pitches for higher autonomy to educational institutions
PTI Nov 13, 2014, 05.37PM IST
BENGALURU: IT veteran N R Narayana Murthy today advocated higher autonomy and less governmental interference in the functioning of educational institutions.
"I think, my own personal view is there should be higher and higher levels of autonomy, government should not interfere in setting up colleges, in running colleges. The market, the society will decide which is a good university, which is not a good university, rather than government mandating," Murthy said.
Speaking on the sidelines of an event organised to announce Infosys Prize 2014 here, he said, "That's where I think the role of AICT and UGC must be reduced and we should provide full autonomy to professors, researchers and administrators of university. Then I think things will improve a lot like it happens in advanced countries."
The Infosys Science Foundation today announced the winners of the Infosys Prize 2014 across six categories like Engineering and Computer Science, Humanities, Life Sciences, Mathematical Sciences, Physical Sciences and Social Sciences.
Asked whether he thinks that with the mushrooming of schools and colleges there would be no quality control, and how this can be curbed, Murthy said, "All over the world these things have happened. But it is the market that will determine who is a success and who is not. I don't think government control is what is going to improve this."
"So my view is that instead of trying to curb things, in the beginning there will be certain percentage of people who will take advantage of this freedom. But that's ok... A small percentage of people will suffer. But in the end, we will come out with a system of education, with a system of university, with a system of colleges that are of a better quality than what it is," he said.
Asked if there should be more private investment in education, Murthy said, "More than private what I would say, whether it is IITs or IISc or National Law School or other Universities, the government should take a back seat, there should be greater and greater freedom to the academicians, to the administrators, to the students to determine how their own institution should progress."
Stating that the country had a huge problem in education, he said, "The quality of education is low, the percentage of people who go to colleges is low. Therefore we have a huge set of challenges. But we are making progress. There is no doubt about it, but we can make even faster progress if we agree to learn from those countries that have done better than us. We have to open our minds."
To a question if lack of funding was the problem, he said, "I think funding will come, funding is not an issue. We have to provide full freedom to those institutions that are already there for them to reach a better level."
"The key issue is providing full academic freedom," he added.
Asked what are the three things needed to reshape the country and make it a better place, Murthy said, "I think at the end of the day you have to reduce friction to businesses, ideally to zero so that more and more entrepreneurs can create more and more jobs with higher and higher disposable income."
"Second, create an easy to understand, easy to interpret, easy implement tax system and collect more and more taxes; third use the tax money efficiently and without corruption to provide basic common good - education, healthcare, nutrition, shelter etc for the poor and also to create infrastructure for every Indian."

TEV Project, the slot-car highway
Depending on the region in which they are registered, NEVs are limited by law (and usually, by engine output) to speeds below 25mph or 35mph. The best resemble earnest attempts at space capsules, the worst evoke street-legal golf carts (and often because they are, quite simply, street-legal golf carts).
But not the Cruser Sport. This forthcoming model from Ecocruise, a startup based in the Pacific northwest US state of Washington, sooner evokes a dune buggy than a municipal-course beverage cart. When you consider its pedigree, that makes a lot of sense.
Ecocruise is the brainchild of Steve Leighty, a veteran of the off-road motorsports industry, having founded Kasea Motorsports in the 1990s. Beginning by importing Chinese scooters, Leighty realised he could design and build sportier vehicles – ATVs, dirt bikes and motorcycles – himself, and ship the prototypes to China, Korea and Taiwan to be mass produced; the production versions were then sold back to customers in the US. Business prospered, but by 2004 Leighty was ready for a new challenge, and turned his attention to electric mobility.
The two-seater Cruser Sport is the first Ecocruise model to hit the streets, and it is anything but boxy, with a swooping carbon fibre body over exposed tubular steel, plus a covered rear hatch and T-tops. Exposed suspension and 14in aluminium wheels impart a beefy stance, and the bucket seats reinforce the off-road lineage. Safety – hardly an afterthought, even for low-speed neighbourhood electrics –  comes in the form of US Department of Transportation-approved safety glass and seatbelts, antilock brakes and a two year bumper-to-bumper warranty and three-year warranty on the lithium-ion batteries. Leighty claims that the topmost battery package will take the Cruser Sport up to 60 miles on a charge.
The car will retail for $8,500 to $11,900 in the US, depending on motor and battery options, when deliveries commence in January 2015. Shortly thereafter the company plans to release the more conventional one-seater EZIP-4 for around $3,800. A line of service and utility vehicles, including electric scooters, will follow. Distribution in the US is managed through a group of roughly 50 independent retailers, while in Europe, an expected partnership with UK’s Urban Mover will provide a readymade dealer network.
And lest the putter-perfecting neighbourhood-electric user be denied, Cruser Sports will soon  be available in golf-cart form, too.

Wal-Mart Stores Inc third-quarter sales rise...Neighborhood Market stores i
(Wal-Mart Stores Inc reported…)
Wal-Mart Stores Inc reported a higher-than-expected profit as comparable sales at its US stores rose for the first time in seven quarters, helped by its small-format 'Neighborhood Market' stores and higher prices.
Wal-Mart's shares rose 2.2 per cent in premarket trading.
The world's largest retailer said overall US same-store sales rose 0.5 per cent in the third quarter.
Wal-Mart has been facing sluggish sales in the United States as its core low-income customers struggle with stagnant wage growth and higher taxes. A cut in government food stamp benefits has also reduced their spending power.
The company cut the top end of its full-year forecast for earnings from continuing operations to $5.02 per share from $5.15. It raised the lower end by 2 cents to $4.92.
The company said its forecast took into account higher health-care costs for its US employees, investments in e-commerce and a highly promotional holiday season.
Net profit attributable to Wal-Mart fell marginally to $3.71 billion, or $1.15 per share, for the quarter ended Oct. 31, from $3.74 billion, or $1.14 per share, a year earlier.
Total revenue rose to $119 billion from $115.7 billion.
Same-store sales at its Neighborhood Market stores rose about 5.5 per cent.
Analysts on average were expecting earnings of $1.12 per share on revenue of $118.32 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Infosys in race to acquire Airbus unit CIMPAInfosys in race to acquire Airbus unit CIMPA

(The deal will help Infosys…)
By Chandra R. Srikanth
Software major Infosys is in the race to acquire CIMPA, the engineering services unit of Airbus, people familiar with the development said, making it potentially the first acquisition after Vishal Sikka took charge as CEO over three months back.
The deal will help Infosys deepen its presence in the engineering services space, a segment that currently contributes to less than 5% of its revenues. Sources said Infosys could also get a revenue assurance from Airbus as part of the deal.
France-based CIMPA works in the area of product lifecycle management, has 940 employees and had sales of 100 million euros in 2012. Sources said the valuation for a captive unit is typically likely to be 0.7-0.8 times sales, although it could go up to 1 times sales depending on the profitability of the unit. So, the valuation for this unit could be in the range of $100-$136 million.
A French paper Les Echos reported in June that Airbus had put its engineering unit Cimpa on the block, as part of a plan to divest non-strategic assets. Airbus had not commented on the report then.
A person familiar closely involved with Infosys said the company was looking at assets in areas such as engineering services, geographics such as Nordics & Japan but declined to comment on whether its looking at CIMPA in particular. However, sources cited above said Infosys is keen to acquire this asset to boost its capabilities in the PLM space and is competing with the likes of HCL Tech and Tech Mahindra for this acquisition.
While an Infosys spokesperson said the company does not comment on speculation, HCL Tech said it does not respond to rumours. Tech Mahindra did not respond to e-mail queries.
Engineering services currently contributes to less than 5% of Infosys revenues, as per the latest quarter ended September 2014. But with the global manufacturing sector undergoing rapid changes, industry analysts believe engineering services and PLM will gain more traction going forward.
"China has dominated the manufacturing sector but now countries like US and Germany want to stage a comeback. PLM will play a crucial role," said a brokerage analyst tracking Infosys, who did not wish to be named.
Sikka himself in the last few months has been talking about the huge opportunity in the manufacturing sector, thanks to rapid changes in technology.

Market s rise slows as P-E ratio swellsMarket’s rise slows as P-E ratio swells

If investors are wondering why the record-setting stock market has suddenly stopped going up in big price chunks — inching up to fresh highs with fractional gains instead — one theory is that stocks are expensive again after rallying about 10% since October 15. Price-to-earnings ratios, which dipped sharply to below-average levels in mid-October when stocks were swooning, have shot right back up to the pricey levels they were at prior to the scary drop.
P-E ratios, a common stock market valuation metric, have done a round-trip from the market’s prior peak on Sept. 18 to its recent low on Oct. 15 to Wednesday’s close of 2038.25, or a tiny 0.07% drop below Tuesday’s record high close of 2039.68. The index has inched up or down three of the past four sessions.
Back on Sept. 18, the S&P 500 was trading at 16 times its projected earnings for the coming four quarters, above the long-term average of 14.8 since 1968, Thomson Reuters’ data show.
After tumbling nearly 10%, the P-E on the benchmark U.S. stock index tumbled to a below-average 14.4 in the week ending Oct. 17. But since the big rally, the market began this week with a P-E of 16 — its priciest valuation since the bull market started in March 2009 and exactly where it was prior to the late-September to mid-October selloff.
But just because the market is trading at an above-valuation doesn’t mean that it is poised for a major fall. The S&P 500’s forward-four-quarter P-E was 20.3 at the 2007 market top and 26.2 at the 2000 market peak. Higher valuations, though, do make it harder for the market to chug higher.
The data below show the S&P 500’s week-ending forward-four-quarter P-E since the week ending Sept. 19:
Week ending  P-E
Nov. 7            16.0 (new S&P record close)
Oct. 31                15.7
Oct. 17          14.4  (mid-October S&P 500 low)
Oct. 10                14.9

Sensex Ends Lower; BPCL, HPCL Slump
NDTV | Updated On: November 13, 2014 16:04 (IST)
BSE Sensex and Nifty ended moderately lower today on profit-taking as investors pared some positions after the recent gains.
The Sensex ended 68 points lower at 27,940 while Nifty settled at 8,357, down 25 points.
Lancelot D'Cunha, CEO of ITI Wealth Management, said markets saw some profit-taking ahead of the weekend. "Markets could see some correction on profit-taking after the sharply rally in which it set new highs. But the undertone remains positive based on medium term trends and fund inflows," he said.
Strong selling pressure in oil retailing companies after BPCL and Indian Oil reported disappointing quarterly earnings. The increase in excise duty on petrol and diesel also weighed on the PSU oil retailers.
BPCL fell 4.5 per cent to be the biggest loser among Nifty companies. HPCL slumped over 6 per cent while Indian Oil fell over 4 per cent.
Oil and gas major ONGC fell nearly 2 per cent while RIL fell 0.5 per cent.
However, some buying in IT stocks helped cap the losses. Infosys, HCL Tech and Tech Mahindra rose between 1 per cent.

Rupee Ends Lower at 61.5 Amid Choppy Trend
Reuters | Updated On: November 13, 2014 17:40 (IST)
The rupee continued its see-sawing trend and weakened marginally on Thursday as losses in domestic shares weighed despite the sharply lower-than-expected retail inflation print for October.
The partially convertible rupee closed at 61.5450/5600 per dollar compared with 61.4925/5000 on Wednesday.
India's economic outlook brightened on Wednesday with a surprise pick-up in industrial output and further cooling in consumer prices, data showed, boosting Prime Minister Narendra Modi's bid to end the longest slowdown in growth in decades.
Dealers said state-run banks were spotted buying the greenback on a sustained basis in both the spot and forward markets.
Some suspected this buying could have been on behalf of the Reserve Bank of India, which is likely to wary of excessive appreciation of the rupee in an attempt to maintain export competitiveness.
Asian currencies too were broadly weaker compared to the dollar.
"The rupee is ideally going to stay in a 60.50 to 62.50 range for the next few months. But seeing the price action, any negative news on rupee and the Indian economy may push the rupee towards 66 levels," said Vikas Babu Chittiprolu, a senior foreign exchange trader with state-run Andhra Bank.
"There is however not much reason to panic and it is important to note that the RBI is better prepared and in complete control of the rupee situation and unlikely to allow a repeat of the last year trauma," he added.
The Sensex fell on Thursday, retreating from a record high hit in the previous session as state-run oil companies such as Bharat Petroleum Corp declined after the government raised factory gate taxes on petrol and diesel.
Foreign fund buying of local shares and debt in recent sessions however has been a key boost for the local unit.
So far in November, foreign funds have bought shares worth $1.44 billion and debt worth $613 million, taking total inflows so far this year to $15.1 billion and $23.2 billion in the two asset classes respectively.
In the offshore non-deliverable forwards, the one-month contract was at 61.74/84, while the three-month was at 62.30/40.

By: Express News Service | Jammu | Posted: November 13, 2014 7:25 pm
Leader of the opposition in Rajya Sabha and former Jammu Kashmir Chief Minister Ghulam Nabi Azad on Thursday said that the state needs a chief minister with development orientation and whose heart beats for the poor.
Addressing a series of public meetings in Reasi and Banihal, said that some parties are propagating that the chief minister should be a Hindu from Jammu, while some others are trying to woo the electorate that he should be from Kashmir Valley.
“I, as an Indian, am not bothered whether the chief minister should be from Muslim, Hindu, Sikh, Christian or any other community. We are not bothered about religious identity of the chief minister,” he said, adding that “what state needs is a secular leader whose heart beats for the poor and down trodden irrespective of their caste and religion”.
“We need a chief minister with a development orientation having a capacity of building roads, schools, hospitals, colleges, universities, government buildings, besides creating new avenues of employment for educated unemployed youth of the state and who can maintain law and order,’’ he said while appealing people to vote for Congress. And above all, he or she should have the capacity and capability to deal with post flood situation which had caused devastation and washed away lakhs of houses and agriculture land, besides schools and hospital buildings, bridges and roads across the state.
“Mere religious sentiments and polarization of votes in the name of religions and regions is not going to help the state to make a comeback on the path of development and prosperity,’’ Azad said. The Congress is contesting Assembly elections with a vision and a specific agenda to serve the people of all the three regions of the state, he pointed out.
Listing various development projects initiated during the regime of UPA-I and UPA-II, Azad also reminded people of various projects started during his tenure as chief minister. “Many projects are still incomplete”, he said and sought support of the people to finish them so as to improve socio-economic conditions of the people.

Nokia bags 3G contract from BhartiAirtelThe deal will help Airtel enhance its 3G network in the Mumbai, West Bengal and Bihar.
By: Tech Desk | New Delhi | Posted: November 13, 2014 7:08 pm | Updated: November 14, 2014 2:27 pm
Nokia Networks has bagged a 3G contract from Bharti Airtel that will help Airtel enhance its 3G network in the Mumbai, West Bengal and Bihar telecom circles using Nokia’s latest Single RAN (radio access network) advanced platform. The deal includes an India-first dual band, dual carrier 3G network implementation, refarming 900 MHz to complement Mumbai’s existing 3G network on 2100 MHz. This will enable higher throughput and thus improved 3G services for Bharti Airtel’s customers.
Under the contract, Nokia Networks will supply its Single RAN Advanced platform, based on its energy-efficient Flexi Multiradio 10 Base Station. This multi-standard radio platform is optimal because it will also support Bharti Airtel in its TD-LTE rollout and pave the way to FDD-LTE in the near future.
In addition, Nokia Networks will deploy its Flexi Lite Base Station, a small all-in-one base station optimized for indoor and outdoor micro-cell deployments to provide the best coverage in densely crowded areas. Nokia will also supply its extremely compact, highly scalable and flexible multi-technology, all-IP multicontroller RNC (mcRNC).
Nokia’s NetAct network management system will enable effective monitoring and management of Bharti Airtel’s networks. Nokia Networks will also provide a range of services such as network planning and optimization, network implementation, network operations, and care services including hardware and software maintenance as well as competence development.

Dont want people saying Im too old to act: JudiDenchBy: Press Trust of India | London | Posted: November 13, 2014 7:06 pm
Veteran actress Judi Dench, who will turn 80 next month, says she is tired of people telling her that she is too old to act.
“I don’t want to be told I’m too old to try something. I want to see for myself if I can’t do it rather than be told you might have a fall or you can’t learn your lines. Let me have a go. Let us all have a go,” Dench said during a screening of the BBC’s ‘Esio Trot’.
Dench said the only time her age bothered her was when she turned 40 but since then she has come to consider it just a number, reported the Radio Times.
“Age is a number, it’s something imposed on you… It drives me absolutely spare when people say ‘are you going to retire, isn’t it time you put your feet up’ or tell me (my) age,” she said.
“The only time I got really upset was when I was 40, for some reason. I got really upset when I was 40, and I was alright after that. It’s that old thing: you are only as old as you feel. It’s not to do with age; it’s something to do with inside. It’s the engine.”

Slamming Prachanda  Maoist leader Bhattarai says Constitution will be drafted in assembly  not streetPrint
Maoist leader Baburam Bhattarai said revolutionary forces need to collaborate and cooperate with each other for consolidating democratic achievements. (Source: Reuters photo)

Striking a dissent note with fellow comrade Prachanda, Maoist leader Baburam Bhattarai on Thursday said that his party is committed to draft the new constitution within the Constituent Assembly.
His remarks came after United Communist Party of Nepal-Maoist (UCPN-M) Chairman Prachanda’s threat to unilateraly announce the constitution from the street, if major political parties failed to forge consensus on key issues including the number of federal units.
“People will announce their own constitution through the street, if ruling parties go ahead by disregarding the voice of the opposition parties,” Prachanda on Wednesday said in Rolpa district, considered Maoists’ headquarters during the decade-long insurgency.
Bhattarai said revolutionary forces need to collaborate and cooperate with each other for consolidating democratic achievements.
They fought the democratic struggle jointly and initiated the peace process by a 12-point agreement signed in New Delhi between the then underground Maoist party and other democratic parties, he said.
Maoist Vice-President Narayankaji Shrestha said his party is committed to promulgating the constitution by January 22, 2015 as agreed by the political parties and the party is ready to show flexibility for the sake of forging consensus.
He also dismissed the allegation made by ruling parties that UCPN-Maoist has abandoned the path of dialogue and consensus saying: “we are not obstructing the process of drafting the new constitution as claimed by the Nepali Congress and CPN-UML.”
“We are ready to sit for dialogue to forge consensus on key issues of the constitution,” he added.
The ruling parties Nepali Congress and Communist Party of Nepal-United Marxist Leninist are saying they would opt for voting process to settle the disputed issues of drafting the new constitution if no consensus emerges.
The Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML command two-third majority in the 601-membered Constituent Assembly, which is sufficient to draft the new constitution.
However, opposition parties including UCPN-Maoist and Madhesis based parties are pressing to settle the disputed issues of the constitution.
Political parties are yet to agree on forms of governance, federal structure and judiciary system.

India to See Stable Growth; Prospects Depend on Reforms: OECDMore Steps to Rationalise Subsidies on Anvil: Arun Jaitley
Nay Pyi Taw: Indian economy is expected to see an average growth of 6.7 per cent over the 2015-19 period and a further boost would depend on reform plans of the government, says a report.
However, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) on Thursday also said India and China face significant challenges.
"India's growth should remain stable at 6.7 per cent, before any potential boost from the new government's reform plans," the report, released at the ASEAN Business and Investment Summit said.
"Emerging Asia" is set for healthy growth over the medium term even as outlook for many OECD countries remains subdued, as per the grouping's latest economic outlook report for Southeast Asia, China and India.
"India's growth should be stable over 2015-19, but the prospects could change depending on the implementation of reforms by the new Modi government," the report said.
These plans include promoting domestic and foreign investments, creating jobs, improving food security, raising standards of education and skills development, building new infrastructure, enhancing water governance and increasing the country's overall competitiveness, particularly in the manufacturing sector, it added.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government came to power in May after a thumping victory in the general elections.
In October, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank projected 5.6 per cent growth rate for India this year, citing renewed confidence in the market due to a series of economic reforms pursued by the new government.
Meanwhile, OECD in its report said that annual GDP growth for the ASEAN -10, China and India is forecast to average 6.5 per cent over 2015-19.
"Growth momentum remains robust in the 10 ASEAN countries, with economic growth averaging 5.6 per cent over 2015-19," it noted.
The members of ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) are Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Brunei Darussalam, Singapore, Cambodia, Lao PDR and Myanmar.
However, the report said that China's growth is expected to slow down to 6.8 per cent over 2015-19 period.
It also noted that public sector reforms have made substantial progress in Southeast Asia, China and India. Paris-based OECD is a grouping of about 34 countries.

J&K Assembly polls: Political leaders criss-cross the state for campaigningPrint

Campaigning for the first phase of the five-phased Assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir is in full swing as the top leaders of various political parties are criss-crossing 15 constituencies which will go to polls later this month.
The electorate in the 15 constituencies – spread over six districts across all the three regions of the state – will exercise their franchise in the first phase.
All the major political parties in the state – National Conference (NC), Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Congress and the Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) — are busy with the electioneering in the three regions of the state – Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh.
The political leaders have to hop from one region to the other as the people in five constituencies in Kashmir Valley, all the four constituencies in Ladakh region and six in Jammu  division will exercise in their franchise on November 25.
Interestingly, BJP, which is hoping to achieve its ‘Mission 44 plus’ – the magical mark in the 87-member Legislative Assembly, for the first time is focusing on Kashmir as party general secretary Ram Madhav has visited the Valley several times since the elections were announced.
Winning some seats in the Valley and Ladakh region, along with a majority of 37 seats in Jammu division, would be important for the party’s prospects and its dream of having its government in the state for the first time ever.
Though BJP has not started an aggressive campaign on the ground, the party leaders, including top leaders from Delhi, are busy in developing a strategy for increasing their chances of opening an account in the Valley, where, so far, the party has not won any seat.
Chief Minister Omar Abdullah, the star campaigner of the  ruling National Conference (NC), is also travelling to different regions of the state for campaigning.
With the party facing a tough time in the absence of its president and former Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah, the campaigning has largely been left to Omar, who kick-started it from the Valley by addressing gatherings in north Kashmir.
Farooq is currently undergoing treatment in London and will not be able to take part in the poll process in any way.
Omar addressed gatherings in Beerwah – the constituency where from he is contesting but goes to polls in the third phase, then moved to Bandipora assembly segment.
The NC working president then travelled to Jammu region and campaigned for his party candidates in Nagrota and various areas of Banihal assembly segment for three days.
Omar will next go to Ladakh region for campaigning, following which he would return to the Valley to canvass for the candidates in other constituencies here.
Similarly, the leadership of opposition PDP has also been travelling to many constituencies in both Kashmir and Jammu regions, particularly to Chenab Valley where continued…

More forces to be sent to Jammu and Kashmir  Jharkhand if needed: Rajnath SinghBy: Press Trust of India | Gurgaon | Posted: November 13, 2014 3:03 pm
The Centre on Thursday offered to send additional paramilitary forces to Jammu and Kashmir and Jharkhand to ensure peaceful polling in the coming Assembly elections if required.
“CRPF and state police forces are there and if need arise we will send more forces,” Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh said on the sidelines of a function in Gurgaon.
Home Minister, however, said he believed that elections in Jammu and Kashmir and Jharkhand will be completed peacefully.
Assembly polls in the militancy-hit Jammu and Kashmir and Naxal-hit Jharkhand will be held in five phases between November 25 and December 20.
The CRPF has deployed close to 60,000 personnel in Jammu and Kashmir for security duties and in view of the upcoming polls, the central government has sent a total of 381 companies (one company comprises around 100 personnel) of various central forces like BSF, ITBP and CISF.
In Jharkhand, there are close to 25 battalions of CRPF which is currently undertaking operations against Left Wing Extremists, along with some units of other paramilitary forces.
Similarly, a total of 136 companies of forces have been asked to report for poll duties in Jharkhand.
In addition, state police forces of both the states will be deployed during the elections.

Upper castes are invaders: Bihar CM ManjhiComments
As Janata Dal (United) leader Nitish Kumar embarked on his Sampark Yatra to reinvigorate party workers, chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi staked claim to the Dalit constituency on Wednesday, saying: “Upper castes were foreigners and descendants of Aryan invaders, while the true Indians were the Dalits and the indigenous people.”
Issuing a clear message to tribals and Dalits to close ranks and re-invent their political strength at Bettiah, 300km north-west of Patna, Manjhi asked them to work in tandem for their educational, social and political rights. He took on the mantle of a ‘social reformer’ too, asking the tribals to shun consumption of alcohol and tobacco and go attend school.
“Earlier, the number of tribals was only 1% of state’s population but the percentage has reached 16% after the Tharus were accorded the status of scheduled tribe (ST). The total number of tribals is about 16 lakh in Bihar. Keep away from alcohol and assert your political rights,” Manjhi advised.
After being elected the CM, Manjhi has been asserting his Dalit identity to counter the widespread impression that he was a stopgap chief minister. He has been working to carve out a niche for himself and come out of the shadow of Nitish Kumar. At his public meetings, especially while addressing Dalits and tribals who together number 24% of Bihar’s population, Manjhi has attempted to consolidate his constituency by trying to make them aware of their latent political strength, which could be used if they come together.
The first signs of his political ambition to continue as CM after 2015 assembly polls became evident when he told Dalits at his village Mahkar in Gaya district if 22% Dalits came together and became politically aware, no one could stop a Dalit from continuing as the chief minister.
“This time, I was made chief minister by others under different political circumstances. We constitute around 22% of the state population. If you become more politically aware, you can be in a position to choose a Dalit chief minister by your sheer strength,” Manjhi said.
Manjhi seems to have taken cue from his predecessor Nitish Kumar. While Kumar tried to carve out a vote bank among the Dalits by bracketing 21 out of 22 scheduled castes in Bihar as ‘Mahadalits’, leaving out the powerful Dusadhs (Paswans), Manjhi has gone a step further by calling upon Dalits and tribals to form one single bloc of voters. Manjhi has also tried to draw a bigger line than his predecessor by aiming to form a trans-Dalit constituency along with extremely backward castes (EBCs).
Watch: Bihar CM says upper caste people are foreigners
It became evident when he asked Dalit youth at a function in Patna to raise their numbers through “inter-caste marriages” inside and outside the Dalit community. Manjhi had stoked a controversy when he recalled an incident in which a temple was washed after his visit in course of his bypoll campaign in Madhubani.
He had also attacked other castes, saying that people who came to him for some work felt no qualms about falling at his feet. Many in his own party believe Manjhi is seriously pitching for Dalit consolidation of the kind seen in Uttar Pradesh, under the leadership of BSP leader Mayawati and lead a separate Dalit constituency Bihar has never had. Manjhi is the third Dalit leader to hold the post of chief minister.

Qatar cuts oil output due to market oversupply, maintenance-source
Reuters Nov 13, 2014, 06.31PM IST
(The reduction to 650,000…)
DOHA: OPEC member Qatar expects to lower oil output to about 500,000 million barrels per day (bpd) by the end of November, down from 650,000 at the end of October and from 800,000 a month earlier than that, an industry source familiar with the matter said.
The reduction to 650,000 was decided because of market oversupply, and the second to 500,000 was made necessary because of refinery maintenance, the source said. Qatar's maximum oil production capacity is 800,000.
"The market is oversupplied and this is why we cut down in October. We found that there's generally less demand," said the source.
With maintenance due at Qatar's Mesaieed refinery, production is expected to drop to around 500,000 bpd.

DreamWorks Animation (DWA) soared 14% to $25.52 Thursday on reports that  toymaker Hasbro (HAS) is in talks to acquire  the film studio.
DreamWorks is known for such animated movie franchises as Shrek and Madagascar.
The New York Times, citing anonymous sources briefed on the talks, reported that Hasbro is in "advanced talks" with the film studio about a potential deal financed with a combination of cash and stock. A price has not been determined.
Hasbro fell 4.3% to $54.98.
According to Deadline.com , "DreamWorks Animation is deeply engaged in two potentially game changing negotiations that could transform the company — including one with Hasbro to forge a family entertainment powerhouse to be called DreamWorks-Hasbro. The other talks are with Hearst to turn DWA's AwesomenessTV into a joint venture."
DreamWorks CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg would become chairman of the combined compan, the website says.
In September, Japanese telecom giant SoftBank was reported to have held talks with DreamWorks, but the negotiations didn't lead to a public offer. SoftBank owns Sprint.
Hasbro and DreamWorks Animation declined to comment.
Toy analyst Margaret Whitfield says that "given the importance of the Disney relationship to Hasbro, I doubt the deal would proceed without first ensuring Disney had no objection.  If bought, it would be another platform to transform its (Hasbro) many toy properties into entertainment brands as it has done with several studios."

Facebook addresses privacy fears while ramping ad targeting
AFP Nov 13, 2014, 06.41PM IST
(Information is collected…)
SAN FRANCISCO: Facebook on Thursday made it easier for people to understand and control how their information is used at the leading social network while expanding its quest to better target ads.
The simplified data policy came as Facebook announced that work to improve targeting of ads in the United States is expanding to other countries.
Several months ago, Facebook began using information such as where people go on the Internet to help target ads.
For example, visits to an array of travel-related websites could prompt vacation ads to pop up for a person at the social network.
Feedback from a website where someone bought a stereo would raise the likelihood of them seeing ads for speakers or other accessories.
New ads come with a built-in option of people seeing why they were shown the marketing messages and allowing them to remove "interests" from advertising profiles at Facebook.
"We also wanted to make sure people could turn that off," Facebook advertising vice president Brian Boland told AFP.
"We are not changing the ways and places people opt-out, but we are going to enhance the way we apply those controls."
If a person opts out on any device, the choice will be applied no matter what smartphone, tablet, or computer they use to access Facebook, according to Boland.
"In order to apply that setting for most publishers, you would have to go into the settings on each device to limit tracking," Boland said.
"What we are doing is if we see that setting once, anywhere, we will apply it across everywhere you use Facebook."
Facebook is expanding the ad targeting update to Britain, Ireland, France, Germany, Canada, and Australia with more countries to be added in the future, he said.
Steps taken by Facebook on Thursday included launching a "privacy basics" education center that uses animation and video to walk people through tasks such as deleting posts or blocking unwanted viewers.
The effort by the California-based firm is in response to concerns by regulators and social network users regarding how well privacy is safeguarded online, Facebook chief privacy officer Erin Egan told AFP.
"They want information in an easily accessible format," Egan said. "How it is collected and how it is used, in simple and precise data policies."
The education center is starting with 15 short instructional videos in more than 30 languages, and provides the option of sending links to friends so insights can be shared.
Facebook also rewrote its data policy to make it easier to understand and navigate, and to add a part regarding information collected when people use a "buy" button being tested at the social network in the United States.
Information is collected when people use Facebook services for purchases or financial transactions, like buying something on Facebook, making a purchase in a game or making donations, according to a the policy.
"We are just being more clear," Egan said about Facebook's re-written data policy.
The advertising profile feature in new Facebook ads will reveal what, if any, targeting information came from purchases or other financial transactions, according to Egan.
Nothing was changed regarding data policies at Facebook-owned applications such as WhatsApp, the privacy officer said.

Zimbabwe strong in reply to Bangladeshs 503Raza and Masakadza added 104 for the unbroken second wicket partnership as Zimbabwe gave a strong reply to Bangladesh's 503. (Source: AP File)

Zimbabwe’s top order came good to put up a strong reply to Bangladesh’s huge first innings total of 503 on the second day of the third and final Test in Chittagong on Thursday.
Opener Sikandar Raza remained unbeaten on 54 and Hamilton Masakadza was on 51 as the tourists reached 113-1 by stumps, still trailing by 390 runs with nine wickets in hand.
The pair added 104 for the unbroken second wicket after opener Brian Chari was caught behind off Rubel Hossain without scoring.
Rubel had earlier shone with the bat, making an entertaining 45 off 44 balls to help Bangladesh post their highest total against Zimbabwe, surpassing the 488 in Chittagong in 2005.
After nine wickets had fallen for 452 runs, Rubel smashed four sixes and two boundaries during a last-wicket stand of 51 with Jubair Hossain.
Openers Tamim Iqbal (109) and Imrul Kayes (130) had laid the platform for a big total on Wednesday and Shakib Al Hasan led Bangladesh’s batting charge on the second day with 71.
Zimbabwe’s bowlers prevented a bigger total by claiming eight wickets in the first two sessions after the hosts resumed the day at a commanding 303-2.
Mominul Haque added just two runs to his overnight score of 46 when he was caught the slips by Brendan Taylor off
Tinashe Panyangara.
Shingi Masakadza trapped Mohammad Mahmudullah leg-before for 16 before Bangladesh captain Mushfiqur Rahim dragged a low ball from Hamilton Masakadza on to his stumps after making 15.
The hosts are hoping to sweep the series 3-0 after winning the first two Tests in Dhaka and Khulna.
The Test series between the two lowest-ranked teams will be followed by five one-day internationals.

Mohammad Hafeez reported for suspectactionMohammad Hafeez can continue bowling but has to get his action tested within 21 days (Source: AP)
By: Reuters | Posted: November 13, 2014 7:37 pm
Pakistan’s Mohammad Hafeez has become the latest off-spinner to be reported for a suspect bowling action, the International Cricket Council said on Thursday.
The 34-year-old all-rounder was reported by the match officials during Pakistan’s 248-run victory in the first Test against New Zealand in Abu Dhabi.
As per regulations, Hafeez, who took a wicket in New Zealand’s second innings, can continue bowling but has to get his action tested within 21 days.
Hafeez’s team mate and fellow off-spinner Saeed Ajmal is currently under suspension for an illegal bowling action.
Other off-spinners Sachithra Senanayake (Sri Lanka), Kane Williamson (New Zealand), Prosper Utseya (Zimbabwe), Sohag Gazi (Bangladesh) have all been reported in recent months as governing body ICC is trying to cleanse the game off bowlers with dodgy actions.

Milos Raonic withdraws from ATP TourFinalsPrint
By: Reuters | London | Posted: November 13, 2014 7:32 pm | Updated: November 13, 2014 7:35 pm
Canada’s Milos Raonic has withdrawn from the ATP Tour Finals in London due to injury and been replaced by Spain’s David Ferrer.
The 23-year-old lost his first two round-robin matches at the season-ending tournament to Roger Federer and Andy Murray.
“I am sad to announce that I have to withdraw from the rest of this competition, due to a low grade tear in my quad.
It was a hard decision,” Raonic said on Twitter.
“You, the fans deserve a great show, and I wouldn’t step out if I couldn’t. I am sorry for the fans. I will do everything to be here next year.”
Raonic, the first Canadian singles player to qualify for the showpiece event, has been replaced by Ferrer and the Spaniard will play Japan’s Kei Nishikori later on Thursday.

As Modi visits Myanmar  border districts join hands to curb smuggling  boost border tradePrint
Written by Samudra Gupta Kashyap | Guwahati | Posted: November 13, 2014 7:47 pm
Even as Prime Minister Narendra Modi paid a visit to Myanmar to push for better ties with the neighbouring country, officials of districts sharing the border on both sides met at Changlang in eastern Arunachal Pradesh to join hands in curbing arms smuggling and infiltration and improve border trade in the area.
Hosted by Changlang district deputy commissioner Chanchal Yadav, the one-day meeting also focused on other cross-border issues like law & order and drug trafficking  and also activities of several insurgent groups of Assam and Nagaland in the area. The Myanmarese delegation was led by Ru San Kuye, chairman of the Naga Self-Administered Zone.
“While delegates from both sides agreed to increase cooperation between the law enforcement agencies at the district level to maintain peace and tranquility along the international border, they agreed for real-time intelligence sharing on the activities of insurgents, arms smugglers, drug traffickers and smugglers particularly of wildlife and wildlife products operating along the Indo-Myanmar border,” an official told The Indian Express from Changlang.
The Indian delegation that also had officials of security forces deployed in counter-insurgency operations in Changlang district, shared specific information about movement of insurgent groups like NSCN(K) and NSCN(IM) and ULFA and asked their Myanmarese to share intelligence in order to curb their activities.
The Indian officials also discussed the issue of citizens from both sides smuggling narcotics including opium during the three designated free-movement days of the month and asked their Myanmarese counterparts to take necessary action on their side. “The Myanmarese side said more roads are being planned to connect inaccessible areas in their territory which in turn will help curb smuggling as well as use of these areas by insurgent groups,” the official said.
Myanmar officials also requested the Indian officials to speed up construction of a Border Haat at Pangsau Pass inside Indian territory so that people from both sides could exchange various goods on a regular basis and in the process cut down smuggling. People from both sides are free to walk across the border at Pangsau Pass on the historic Stilwell Road (built during World War II) on three designated days — 10th, 20th and 30th of every month — to buy and sell 62 specific items. A formal Border Haat however is yet to be opened there.
While Myanmarese officials expressed willingness to buy agricultural machineries and construction materials from India through Pangsau Pass, Indian officials also agreed to arrange English language training for Myanmar officials deployed on border guard duties. On the request of Myanmarese delegates, the Indian side also agreed to train farmers on the other side on tea, rubber and cardamom plantation.

The Centre has named actor Rajinikanth as winner of the Centenary Award for Indian Film Personality of the Year. This was announced by Colonel Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore, Minister of State, Information and Broadcasting, on Tuesday.
The Chennai-based actor would be receiving the honour at the 45th International Film Festival of India to be held in Goa from November 20 to 30. Social media was agog with excitement as fans posted messages congratulating their ‘Superstar’, as he is fondly known.
The 63-year-old actor is a recipient of the Padma Bhushan, the third highest civilian honour which he got in 2000. He has also won a number of awards from the Tamil Nadu government.
Hailing from a modest background, the actor had a dream debut in K. Balachander’s Aboorva Ragangal in 1975 and fans are eagerly looking forward to his upcoming Lingaa.
“His contribution to cinema is immense and no amount of awards is enough. This award is a recognition for his pan-Indian popularity,” said Bobby Simha, actor and a fan of Rajinikanth.

The Passenger  Columbia Room to close Jan. 1By Fritz Hahn November 12 Follow @fritzhahn
It's finally official: The Passenger and the Columbia Room are closing to the public on Jan. 1. The two trailblazing cocktail bars will then take different paths: Derek Brown is moving the Columbia Room a few blocks north to Blagden Alley, where it will occupy the space above chef Jeremiah Langhorne's forthcoming restaurant, the Dabney . The Passenger, meanwhile, will go dark until Tom Brown, Derek's brother, is able to find the perfect place for it in Shaw.
The Passenger's no-frills atmosphere have made it a popular place for cocktails, especially on Tiki Tuesdays. (2011 Photo by Amanda Voisard/The Washington Post).
"When we shook hands with [partner] Paul [Ruppert], we always knew there might be an end to the Passenger and the Columbia Room," Derek Brown said. The block of Seventh Street NW has long been slated for development by Douglas Development, but the developers were happy to let the buildings stay occupied while they finalized plans for an office building on the land. When the tiki bar Hogo closed in August , Tom speculated that the Passenger and Columbia Room could follow by the end of the year. Last week, the brothers got the official notice that construction is going to begin early next year. Both spaces must be emptied by Jan. 4.
Ironically, the bar is preparing to celebrate its fifth anniversary this weekend with a three-day party that will now become an Irish wake.
The Browns had been looking for new spaces in Shaw. In late October, Derek signed a lease for the new Columbia Room in a Blagden Alley building known as "The Gang of Three," because it cobbles together three existing rowhouses into one space. The first floor has been leased by the Dabney, though Brown stresses that "The only connection we have is that Jeremiah and I are friends. We respect the hell out of each other. We respect what they do. But we're not going to be the bar for the Dabney."
If all goes according to plan, the new Columbia Room is "about a year away, by the end of 2015." The new space will be about five times larger than the current setup, which has just 10 reservations-only seats. Brown anticipates having an area for walk-in customers, but hasn't quite nailed down the specifics of how an expanded Columbia Room will remain the same sort of intimate cocktail den that has garnered multiple "Outstanding Bar Program" nominations at the James Beard Awards. "We don't want to change this radically," Derek said. "We love what we do. We want to keep the core and expand around it."
Meanwhile, Tom has had less luck nailing down a new location for the Passenger. "I've been looking at spaces for a while," he said, "but it didn't work out, or it wasn't the right situation. You can't do the Passenger in a new buildout. Right now, unless someone comes up with the magic space in Shaw, I'm not ready to jump into anything."
Brown has other irons in the fire right now, though he's loathe to go into specifics about them before leases are signed. "I might do things in another neighborhood, but Passenger needs to stay in Shaw, even if it goes dark for a while … This neighborhood made the Passenger what it is – the juxtaposition of old and new. You have a lot of tourists in the area, but also a lot of people who live in the neighborhood. We focused on the people who live here, they're our regulars."

While the hunt continues, Tom has talked to other bar owners about hosting "Passenger in Exile" events after January 4. Before that happens, there are a few celebrations to hold.
This weekend, the Passenger marks five years with $5 kimchi dogs, $5 whiskey shots and $5 pints of 3 Stars beer from opening on Friday to closing on Sunday. The two bars also have big plans for New Year's Eve: The Columbia Room will have some "very special cocktails" at its New Year's Eve seatings; reservations will be available starting Dec. 1. The Passenger, meanwhile, is holding its traditional DJ dance party in the Warehouse Theatre space, with a $10 cover charge and no advance tickets.
There's plenty of nostalgia for what the Browns have accomplished over the last five years. Both bars have made it onto numerous "Best Bars in America" lists, and the Passenger has won legions of fans by having some of the area's best bartenders serving top-notch cocktails in an unpretentious atmosphere. "I think we're the first blue-collar cocktail bar," Tom said. "Before we opened, there were speakeasies [like PX and the Gibson] and there were restaurant bars and there were fancy hotel bars. But you could come in here and get a fancy cocktail, and your non-fancy cocktail friend could get a Schlitz. We're trying to appeal to everyone, to have them all come in and sit down and be friends."
"Even though we knew the Passenger only had five or ten years, I kind of always thought it would last," Derek said.
But, Tom added, the brothers realize that while the Passenger and Columbia Room were special, they're only a sliver of the neighborhood's history. Paul Ruppert's family has operated restaurants and stores on the block since the 19th century. "If the Rupperts' hardware store had stayed open, it would be 125 years old this week. We're waxing nostalgic about five years, but the Rupperts are leaving behind generations of memories in this place."

Iran just released video of its new stealth drone -- but is it realBy Dan Lamothe November 12 Follow @danlamothe
Three years ago, a stealthy Air Force RQ-170 Sentinel drone crashed in eastern Iran , highlighting the U.S. government’s surveillance efforts there and inflaming tensions between the two countries. It appeared to mark the first time that a U.S. drone had fallen into enemy hands.
Iranian officials now say that recovery has paid off. They just released video they claim shows a new Iranian drone reverse-engineered from the RQ-170 lost in 2011. That aircraft sustained little damage when it crashed, the Iranian state television state al-Alam reported at the time.
The new video shows an aircraft with a bat-wing design, like the Sentinel. The American version has rarely been seen, but a 2009 fact sheet released by the Air Force said the program relied on Lockheed Martin technology to develop a “low observable” unmanned aircraft. As this previous Checkpoint post notes , the Pentagon did not confirm its existence until that year when photos of one were taken at Kandahar Airfield in Afghanistan. There are still no photographs of it published on official Defense Department websites.
Officials in Tehran said in May that Iran had produced a Sentinel copy, and planned to arm it to attack U.S. Navy ships. But industry sources said the version shown  in photographs at the time was a fake, and not flyable.
Already, the Aviationist blog and others that track drone issues have raised question about whether Iran may be incorporating some slight-of-hand in the just released video. Some of the frames appear computer-generated, and the way the aircraft moves suggests it is merely a small model, skeptics say.

The 12 most bizarre movies on NetflixBy Caitlin Dewey November 12 Follow @caitlindewey
(YouTube)
It’s no secret that Netflix has, shall we say, a diverse catalog of offerings. You’ve got your “Pulp Fiction.” Your “Fargo.” Your back seasons of “Mad Men.” And then, of course, there’s the classic horror flick, “Zombie A**: Toilet of the Dead.”
There’s a good reason for Netflix’s eclectic library: The service basically streams at the pleasure of the movie studios and distributors it contracts with, much like Amazon.com Instant Video, Spotify, Google Music, or any other site that lets you stream content. The site signs temporary licensing deals with distributors; the distributors hand over a bizarre range of material; those deals eventually expire, and they do it all again. This is, incidentally, why movies seem to appear and disappear on Netflix so regularly. It’s also why, even after weeks or months of subscribing, you’ll feel you haven’t yet plumbed the service’s shifting (and shifty?) depths.
(Disclosure: Amazon.com chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.)
Fortunately, the Internet now has  /r/theworstofnetflix , a new subreddit dedicated solely to the surfacing of Netflix’s most obscure, most incomprehensible, movies and TV. And It’s easy to see why the forum has attracted more than 2,300 subscribers in its two weeks online — there’s a lot of truly head-scratching garbage on here. We decided to dig up the details for some of its top contenders. Feel free to look them up on Netflix, or, you know — don’t.

A US-China Breakthrough for the Planet -- and New Economic Growthreddit
The forecast for climate change has been undeniably altered overnight -- positive news for the planet and for economic growth.
US President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping, the leaders of the world's two largest economies and two largest emitters of pollutants into the atmosphere, demonstrated that, together, they are leading the global fight against climate change.
Their commitments are an absolutely essential first step if we are to hold the warming of the planet under 2 degrees Celsius, and avoid the disastrous consequences of an even more uncertain world. China committed to an emissions peak by 2030, with 20 percent of its energy coming from renewable sources, and the United States agreed to reduce its emissions by 26-28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. Importantly, they agreed to expand their joint clean energy research and development.
At stake are the economic prospects of current and future generations. The costs to cities, coastlines and crops, as well as to the health and livelihoods of thousands, are mounting.  But more than reacting to this reality, what China and the United States did was show the necessary determination to build a future based on low emissions through clean energy and livable cities because it makes sense for the environment and economies.
We have opportunities today to invest in clean energy innovation that will create jobs and grow stronger, healthier, more resilient economies. Our research shows that investing in climate-smart solutions such as clean transportation can reduce air pollution and grow jobs.  And, today, we see that we have the leaders willing to get us there.
Presidents Xi and Obama's agreement could lead to a global economic and energy transformation. They pledged to strengthen cooperation in developing and expanding the use of clean energy and technology, including carbon capture and storage.
I applaud their emerging ambition and the timing of their statement. By coming out early and standing together, they are creating momentum as countries begin developing their emissions reduction plans on the path to a 2015 international climate agreement in Paris.
Still, the announcement, while extraordinary, is not enough. We need all of the world's major economies to step up. We must start at the national level with higher goals for renewable energy and energy efficiency. Governments must provide the policy signals that encourage private sector investment in clean energy -- including renewable energy, energy efficiency, and carbon capture and storage. That includes pricing carbon and phasing out harmful fossil fuel subsidies .
The two presidents laid the critical cornerstone for global action toward an international accord in Paris next year.  Now we call on others to build on their commitments.

The Real Reason Monster s CEO Lost His Jobreddit
When was the last time you looked for a job or an employee on Monster.com?  If you're like most people, you've heard of Monster, but haven't used it lately.
Monster Worldwide has announced that CEO Sal Iannuzzi is leaving. His departure comes after several years of declining marketing share, poor earnings and a plummeting stock price. Industry analysts have suggested that Monster's decline is because they were out innovated by newer more social technology like LinkedIn.
They're wrong.
It wasn't a technology failure; it was a leadership failure.
Monster was founded on the belief that helping people find jobs was a noble endeavor.  Founder Jeff Taylor's mantra was, "It's half about a better job, and half about a better life." Yet if you look at Monster today, you don't see any semblance of the noble purpose that used to drive their business.
During a Monster town hall earlier this year, when CEO Iannuzzi had his entire organization gathered together, he didn't mention job seekers once. Instead, he told his team that the sole goal of their new strategy was to increase the stock price. Not help customers, not improve the industry, just increase the earnings. Their business was no longer about making people's lives better; it was about making money, end of story.
Iannuzzi made a classic and very common leadership mistake; he focused on profits instead of purpose. For the last seven years, Ianuzzi's public and private narrative has been a non-stop focus on earnings.  But his focus on earnings didn't drive profits; it eroded profits.  And now, a billion dollar organization once heralded as the industry innovator is on the verge of becoming irrelevant.
Iannuzzi fell victim to the same quagmire that many leaders do.  He got so caught up in chasing the numbers, he tried to short-circuit three fundamental truths about human motivation:
People want purpose and meaning in their work.
Emotion drives behavior.
The words of the leader matter.
Iannuzzi once said in a Wall Street Journal interview, "I owe it as part of my fiduciary responsibility to increase shareholder value any way that I can."
He's wrong.
Greed has been cloaked under the guise of fiduciary responsibility, and it has been aided and abetted by boards and shareholders. But the job of the leader is about more than just making money.  It's about creating a sustainable organization that adds value to customers and employees.
Peter Drucker once said, "Profit is not the purpose of a business, it's the test of its validity."
Monster and Iannuzzi are not unique.  The same thing happens in conference and boardrooms every single day. The narrative of profit, earnings and bonuses that was supposed to improve employee performance has had the opposite effect.  It stripped the joy and meaning from work in ways that have a chilling effect on company performance, customer service, and employee morale.
Money matters; lack of money will drive people to do all kinds of crazy things.  But stock price, earnings, and even bonuses will not create organizational greatness.  People want more than just money from their work.  They want their work, where they spend the better part of their lives, to count for something bigger than just a balance sheet.  They want, they need, and they deserve a noble purpose.
Monster and Iannuzzi should serve as a cautionary tale.  When a leader overemphasizes money, you eventually wind up making less of it.

What I Learned from Einstein: The Importance of Culturereddit
Recently, I participated in a Future of Work salon where each of us was asked to relate a seminal event in our lives. I talked about my experience as a child, playing with Albert Einstein, a friend of my family.
Growing up in Princeton, New Jersey, I was allowed to walk up to the end of our short dead-end street and through my grandparents' backyard to knock on the door of Albert Einstein's house.  When I arrived at Einstein's door, he welcomed me in.  As a kid, I loved doing math problems in my head and Einstein invited me to do puzzles with him, which I really enjoyed.
While I enjoyed the puzzles, what was even more special about this experience was the atmosphere Einstein created.  We often tried approaches that didn't work out, but that was fine with Einstein. He encouraged experimentation and wasn't critical of wrong turns. In fact, he didn't consider any of the paths we tried to be wrong. That was a major difference between my experience with Einstein and my experience with many other adults. There were no right or wrong answers, there were just experiments, with curiosity leading the way, and that was the way I learned at Einstein's house.
I had no idea Einstein was famous. I was taught to call adults, who were family friends, "Uncle" or "Aunt," whether or not they were relatives. Referring to adults by their first names was out of the question. Adding "Uncle" or "Aunt" to their first names was considered to be a more respectful way to address adults who were friends of our family, than using "Mr., Mrs., or Dr." with their last names. To me, the person I did puzzles with was "Uncle Al." Sometime later after Einstein had died, I found out who "Uncle Al" really was, and I asked my dad why he didn't tell me. My dad responded that Einstein wouldn't have wanted me to act any differently from the way I had acted. I was appropriately respectful of the nice man, who was the most patient person I had ever spent time with, but I didn't bow down in front of this very famous scientist. Sometime later, I found a quote of Einstein's that "everyone should be respected as an individual, but no one idolized." That definitely applied to the way he expected to be treated and the way he treated others.
In addition to his encouragement and acceptance, Einstein created a light, playful atmosphere, fueling my engagement and resulting in what I would later come to recognize as a state of flow, as defined by Mihaly Csíkszentmihályi. In this state of flow, I experienced a particular kind of focus, that was light and came about naturally, and that I could sustain for a long time. With that light focus, I wound up feeling energized, which is very different from the kind of focus that I refer to as a "full frontal assault" when I'm trying to solve a difficult problem and am focusing with laser beam attention. This kind of narrow focus requires lots of energy and is very draining, which makes it difficult to come up with creative solutions to problems.
Leading and participating in highly collaborative organizational cultures, I've once again experienced that same spirit of engagement, curiosity, and creative focus.  These high-performing organizational cultures encourage experimentation, collaboration, and creativity in an open, accepting environment. This leads to an increase in innovation and engagement, both of which are desperately needed to solve the challenging and pressing problems that organizations face today.

The Hard  Daily Switch from Work to HomeAn Australian website recently sent me a list of interview questions about my book, Backbone , including one about how "time-poor" working parents can help their children develop character strengths like resilience and persistence.
But by far the biggest problem for working parents is not time, but tuning.
As a parent, you need to stay in tune with your child -- yet, working all day makes that really hard.
When my children were young, I was an editor on an education newspaper in central London, and cycled 20 minutes home at the end of the day to a house in north London and my three under-5-year-olds. I loved them, I longed to see them. But when I got there -- oh dear, I so often didn't!
I'd been living all day in neon office light, with grown-up office people. My head was still buzzing with the rhythms and problems of my fast-paced day. Home was domestic, lamp-lit and adhering to its own time table. The children were tired and wanted to compete for my attention. I was tired and wanted to have a drink and stare into space. I simply wasn't on the wavelength of baby food, runny noses and bathtime. I had to consciously slow myself down and feign an interest in the cartoon they'd watched on television, or the drawings they'd  done at nursery that morning.
I remember it as an almost physical problem -- the way my mind and body had to recalibrate before I was in tune with my children again, and it always took time to happen. We are, after all, only simple biological creatures, operating within defined limits, and simply can't chop and change on a whim. No matter how hard I worked at faking it, inside, I knew there was no way I could throw a switch and change instantly from one way of being to another.
Because to work well in a job, you not only have to be good at the tasks you are doing, but also fully tuned in to the culture you're working in -- who's in, who's out, what's the jargon, what's the dress code, what's happening, what's about to happen? You have to understand the jokes, watch the numbers, guard your back, make friends and allies, placate enemies and leap at every opportunity. You are a working person to your core, with working clothes, gestures, language, thoughts and relationships.
At home, to be a good parent, you have to be completely different -- slower, sloppier, less bothered by baby sick on your shoulder or bathroom accidents. You have to be interested in sticks and Lego and long, rambling stories about almost nothing. "And then she said... and I said... and her mommy gave us a snack... and it was animal crackers... no, it was peanut butter... no it was... I forget," and laugh at silly jokes you don't really find funny.
And technology is no help here at all. This is a visceral process, taking place in the very cells of our being. We may have gotten regular updates throughout the day on our children's meals, moods and activities. We may feel we know all we need to know about what's going on in their lives. Even so, we have to literally get back in touch with them, hugging them, sitting them on our laps, stroking their hair, while we slow our minds and soften our edges, until we're fully back in parenting mode again. And even then, whenever our phone buzzes, we are likely to be instantly tugged back into our working self.
I don't think there is any short cut to this, or even anything to be done about it, except simply be aware that it happens. To know that it takes time, and can't be forced or hurried, but that the transformation always happens in the end. Don't beat yourself up trying to be what you can't be, but be very mindful of yourself and your children, turn off your phone and be careful not to add in extra strains and stresses while it's happening.
In the end, I couldn't do it every day. Like so many parents, I stepped back from full-time work and spent the bulk of my time at home with my children.
It didn't solve everything. My career lost steam and it was harder to gear up to the rush and focus of my short working week after four full days of cookie dough and play dates, but the transition from home to work was always easier to fake than the one from the office to home, and the emotional toll on me was far less. I lost some things, and gained others. And best of all, I felt more in tune with my children

This is not the right time to book profits: AnalystDeepak Shenoy
In a chat with ET Now, Deepak Shenoy, Founder, Capital Mind shares his view on markets:
ET Now: What do you do now, do you stick by with the market or do you profit take because you did talk about now trading with caution at the 8400 level?
Deepak Shenoy: Yes, it is time for caution but it is not time for action in terms of profit booking. We would usually book profits when markets reverse rather than when markets go up because that is kind of accepting the fact that we do not know where the market is going to go.
We were looking at corporate profits and some completely incongruent with what seems to be the opinion in the market today, hardly anybody is bearish but corporate profits have been growing, the Nifty 50 companies that have announce results have shown a consolidated profit growth of less than 5% year on year for the same quarter, so that is a little bit of a worrying data stance.

DHS hit with immigration lawsuitBy Katie Zezima November 12 Follow @katiezez
Advocacy groups are suing DHS over deportation policy. AFP PHOTO / Saul LOEBSAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images
Anibal Fuentes came to the United States illegally years ago, faced deportation proceedings in December and was ordered to leave the country. Now, he is among a group of people suing the Department of Homeland Security.
An advocacy group filed a lawsuit against DHS Wednesday, alleging that the agency failed to respond to a rulemaking petition filed in February that asked the agency to suspend deportations of undocumented workers and their families and expand the deferred action for childhood arrivals program. A number of people who came to the country illegally, including Fuentes, are plaintiffs in the lawsuit.
The National Day Laborer Organizing Network claims that the agency is in violation of the Federal Administrative Procedure Act. "DHS’s failure to respond constitutes an effective denial that is arbitrary, capricious and void of any legitimate explanation,” the group said in the lawsuit.
"What the law says is, they have to respond in a reasonable amount of time," said Jessica Karp Bansal, a staff attorney at NDLON. "In a case like this where peoples' lives are at stake, nine months is clearly unreasonable."
The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment on the suit.
The rulemaking petition was filed earlier this year as President Obama was mulling whether he should act alone on the issue. Fuentes and five other people who came to the United States illegally signed on. Now that the president has said he will take executive action to reform the nation's immigration system -- and has delayed his timetable for doing so from the end of the summer until after the midterm elections, but before the end of the year -- the lawsuit is intended to spur action.
But exactly what, if anything, it will accomplish remains to be seen. Obama told congressional leaders last week he intends to act despite calls from both parties to let Congress debate the issue, and warnings that acting alone will spoil his working relationship with the soon-to-be Republican-controlled Congress.
"This point is an important moment to push for action because the administration has made so many statements that they’re going to act, but they keep delaying and delaying," said Thomas Fritzche, a clinical teaching fellow at the Benjamin Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University in New York. Fritzche is one of the attorneys representing the network.
Fuentes, a day laborer from Chicago, has received a temporary stay of his removal. He is married with an infant son. Fuentes answered the door one night and found immigration agents looking for another man. They discovered that Fuentes was stopped at the border years ago after returning from his native Guatemala but was let go; agents in Chicago took him into custody.
"It’s uncomfortable not knowing what’s going to happen. You feel nervous because they might have good news or bad news," he said in Spanish.
Fuentes said he has waited months for Obama to do something to help people here illegally "and he hasn't done anything."

YouTubes new music service  explainedBy Hayley Tsukayama November 12 Follow @htsuka
PARK CITY, UT - JANUARY 19: A general view of atmosphere at the YouTube "Dear White People" Reception on January 20, 2014 in Park City, Utah. (Photo by Andrew H. Walker/Getty Images for YouTube)
YouTube has finally revealed a streaming music service set to compete with the likes of Spotify, Pandora, iTunes and Amazon.
Streaming music is a hot space right now, and companies are competing aggressively to negotiate contracts with artists and record labels. YouTube hasn't released any information on how the service will pay artists, but the Financial Times reported Tuesday that an agreement to share ad revenue was part of the deal Google struck with the independent record label rights agency Merlin. Whether that's enough to shield YouTube from Taylor Swift-like outrage from artists remains to be seen.
But for the average person, here's a breakdown of what YouTube Music Key is and how it stacks up against the competition.
What is it?
When most people think of music and YouTube, they probably think about music videos. So it's probably no surprise that videos are a big part of YouTube Music Key.
For one, subscribers will be able to watch music videos, ad-free. You'll also be able to play music videos if you use another app, or play music if you're not connected to the Internet.  As part of the subscription, you'll also get access to Google Play Music's subscription service. That gives you access to "expert-curated playlists" that the service offers via Songza.
When would I use it?
There's certainly a more social element to YouTube Music Key than you'd necessarily see from other streaming services. The fact that you're watching music videos, for example, automatically makes it a good candidate for party mixes where you might want something playing on the television in the background.
The option to listen to music offline, though, also means that you could use it when you go on runs or when you're just out and about.
How much will it cost?
The ad-free service will cost $7.99 per month -- two dollars cheaper than other subscription services such as Spotify, Pandora and its in-house rival, Google Play Music All Access. That is, at least, until the end of an unspecified promotional period when it will cost $9.99 per month, just like all the other services.
Right now the service is in beta -- and therefore invite-only -- but users can sign up to join at youtube.com/musickey.  An invitation comes with six months free service.
How does it compare to other streaming services?
That also remains to be seen, at least in terms of what kinds of songs you'll have ad-free access to. In terms of its catalog, YouTube hasn't released many details. Google Play Music has a catalog of more than 30 million songs. Spotify boasts more than 20 million.
Google hasn't officially announced any partners, and certainly not in this introductory blog post. Previous reports  have indicated that YouTube has signed deals with the three major labels -- Universal Music Group, Sony Music Entertainment and Warner Music Group -- plus the group of independent labels that work with Merlin.
The video component gives Music Key an interesting twist, not only because of the visual element, but also because it will be able to introduce you to interesting cover versions of songs, parodies, responses and more.
What if I don't want to subscribe to anything?
Even if you don't want to pay Google a monthly fee, the way music is displayed on YouTube will change for everyone. YouTube will be adding a "Music" tab to its site navigation that will show music videos, recommended and trending playlists, plus featured songs that pop up on any channels to which you may subscribe.
You'll also be able to see information on artists' discographies on YouTube and, in some cases, to play full albums on YouTube.

Chicago banks  investment firms join forces to boost...Chicago banks, investment firms form Financial Service Pipeline to boost minority hiring.
Minorities underrepresented in Chicago financial services industry, foundation says.
As the nation gets more diverse, 13 financial services firms with operations in the Chicago area have joined together to look for ways to get more black and Latino workers into their industry.
The group, called the Financial Services Pipeline, will hold an invitation-only summit Nov. 20 at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.
Minorities are underrepresented in the financial services industry, according to figures cited by Chicago Community Trust, a local foundation that is also involved in the effort.
  Open link
More than 90 percent of senior-level staffers at Chicago-area financial services firms are white, according to a 2012 survey detailed on the trust's website.
Among midlevel managers, 74 percent are white, and, among financial-services workforces overall, 67 percent are white, said the trust.
According to the U.S. Census, non-Hispanic whites accounted for 63 percent of the population as of 2013.
The financial services providers that are members of the group are: Ariel Investments, Bank of America, BMO Harris Bank, CME Group, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Holland Capital Management, Loop Capital, Madison Dearborn, Mesirow Financial, Northern Trust, Urban Partnership Bank, U.S. Bank and Wintrust Financial.
The group is conducting research to identify challenges to boosting the hiring of blacks and Latinos at all levels in financial services, and identifying ways that their hiring can be increased. At the meeting, early research findings by consulting firm Mercer on the status of blacks and Latinos employed by members of the group will be released. Also in development is a yearly index tracking minority representation in the financial services industry; the index will examine trends locally and compare them against other major U.S. cities.
Members where blacks have high-level jobs include Ariel, Holland, Loop Capital, Urban Partnership and Mesirow.
The keynote speaker at the event will be Frank Ross, director of the Center for Accounting Education at Howard University. His center's goals include generating interest in the accounting profession among minorities. Breakout sessions at the Nov. 20 event will include recruiting at the college level and earlier, and supporting early- and mid-career minority workers.
Attendees will include senior executives at some of the member institutions as well as other financial firms.

Sensex ends below 28K; Nifty above 8 350 | Stocks that can return upto 80% in a yearDevang Mehta
("Both these companies belong…)
ET Now caught up with Devang Mehta of Anand Rathi Financial Services for his outlook on some sectors and stocks. Excerpts:
ET Now: Which is the next TVS Srichakra?
Devang Mehta: Right now, probably the market is hunting for such stocks. There are a lot of such ideas. We do not know if these would emulate TVS Srichakra and become multi-baggers, but they could probably give you 50% to 80% return in a year's time.
Some stocks that immediately come to my mind are Sundram Fasteners and Igarashi Motors . Both these companies belong to the auto component or the auto ancillary universe, which has been cyclically doing very well on the back of good demand. These two, along with Kalyani Steel and others, could give you 40% to 60% type of returns .
Another stock, again from the same space, would be Atul Auto. It is into the production of three-wheelers. Their capacity is going to double in the next two to three years. It will do well.
ET Now: Anything else that is looking interesting from the small or the midcap pharma end?
Devang Mehta: One stock that we like from the pharma universe is Granules. The company's earnings growth has been triggering very well. It is in a growth phase. But it is not on the radar of most people. Granules would be one stock we would bet our money on in the midcap pharma space.
ET Now: What is the PE multiple for Granules, and what makes you bullish on Granules?
Devang Mehta: The PE multiple for it would be around 17-18 times one-year forward. But the more important thing is that the company is slowly but surely growing and it has not seen the sort of a dream run that other pharma companies have seen.
We feel there is substantial upside for them from here on. Their results have been very good, and the export demand being excellent.
ET Now: Lots of people are beginning to talk about the road sector. What is your sense on the road players? Anything interesting here?
Devang Mehta: You need to be very selective over here. The largest stock pick that would come to the mind is L&T. It is going to get the benefit of infra as well as the capital goods cycle turning. NCC is our top pick in the mid or small cap basket for infrastructure.
We do not like stocks like IVRCL for the time being. We feel there is still a lot of pain for them for another six months. But given the business model that NCC has at the current juncture, we feel it is about to be rerated. We see about 30% to 40% upside for NCC going forward.

Live Cricket Score  India vs Sri Lanka  4th ODIPrint
Rohit Sharma was the star of the day as the right-hander stormed into record books with his second ODI double hundred (Source: PTI)
By: Press Trust of India | Kolkata | Posted: November 13, 2014 12:08 pm | Updated: November 13, 2014 11:46 pm
Rohit Sharma created history by smashing the highest individual ODI score with a breathtaking knock of 264 as India thrashed Sri Lanka by 153 runs in the fourth cricket one-dayer to take a 4-0 lead in the five-match series in Kolkata on Thursday.
SCORECARD: India vs Sri Lanka 
Courtesy Rohit’s mayhem, India scored a mammoth 404 for five and then easily bowled out the islanders for 251 in 43.1 overs. Returning after a 10-week injury lay-off, Rohit had everything going his way after being let-off on individual score of four. (Social Storm: Rohit takes over Twitter, worldwide)
The Mumbaikar paced his innings to perfection as he first got set during the initial 50 runs before exploding against a clueless Lankan attack, as he scored his 264 off only 173 balls that had 33 fours and seven sixes.
In the process, Rohit also broke compatriot Virender Sehwag’s earlier world record of 219 runs, which he had set against West Indies in Indore, back in 2011.
Rohit is also the only batsman to register two double centuries in ODIs and also now holds the record for highest number of boundaries during his innings. (Stats: With 264, Rohit rises to top)
The epic milestone was reached when Rohit hit an elegant cover drive off Nuwan Kulasekara to become the first batsman with two double hundreds in ODIs. (First Reaction: ‘Once I got to 50, I had to convert it into a big score’)
Rohit did have ‘Lady Luck’ going his way as he was dropped twice after reaching his double hundred. The stylish right-hander was all set to carry his bat through before he was holed out in the long-off region off the final delivery of the Indian innings.
Fittingly, he received a ‘Guard of Honour’ from his teammates, who stood on both sides outside the dressing room with spectators also giving him a standing ovation.
It couldn’t have been a more memorable innings on the 150th anniversary of the hallowed ground which has seen many outstanding individual performances.
Rohit’s magnificent knock will rank among the very best played at this ground by the likes of VVS Laxman, Mohammed Azharuddin, Sachin Tendulkar to name a few.
The fifth and final match of the series will be played at Ranchi on November 16.
Stand-in captain Virat Kohli, the other day, termed Rohit as the ‘X-factor’ going into the World Cup and was vindicated after a knock which was a class act.
405 was never going to be easy after Lanka lost their first wicket for naught with pacer Umesh Yadav giving the breakthrough by claiming Perera (0) in the second ball.
Yadav next took the big scalp of Jayawardene cheaply as Lanka were 42/3 as the victory looked very near. Skipper Angelo Mathews was the top-scorer for the visitors with 75 from 68 balls (9×4, 1×6) and shared 118 runs with Lahiru Thirimanne (59) but it was too little looking at the monstrous target.
Yadav (2/38) once again was the pick of Indian bowlers even as Dhawal Kulkarni decimated the middle and lower order with best figures of 4/34. Stuart Binny and Axar Patel too chipped in with a couple of wickets each.
They say records are meant to be broken, and at Eden Gardens something similar was experienced. On any given day, and on any surface, 264 was once considered a fighting ODI target.
And as it turned out, Lankans could not even get past Rohit’s individual score and were bundled out for 251 in 43.1 overs to concede an embarrassing defeat.
The innings was not only a mix of elegance, class and timing but luck too played a big role with Sharma tumbling records after records making the Lankans look like school boys.
If the ground was ‘Very Very Special’ for VVS Laxman after his career-defining 281, Rohit, who had made his Ranji debut here too made this his second ‘home’ having scored hundred on Test debut.
Incidentally, the Mumbaikar, who scored 109 in the last IPL here, has hundreds in all the three formats, and Thursday he had the record score in his first ODI appearance at Eden Gardens.
The batsman used his wrists beautifully to the angling Eranga deliveries and cut anything when provided with a bit of width.
Thanks to wayward bowling by Lankans, Rohit was particularly ruthless in the ‘Batting Powerplay’ that fetched India 57 runs as he smacked the bowlers all around the park before taking a deft single to deep square leg to notch up his fifth ODI century, his first at this venue.
When Lankans batted, only time when they looked like putting up a fight was during the Mathews-Thirimanne partnership that yielded 118 runs.
It was young Axar, who showed good temperament to get the opposition captain out after being deposited into the deep mid-wicket stands off the previous delivery.
He bowled one that drifted in and Mathews who reached too close to the pitch of the delivery was beaten after the ball took an inside edge as Robin Uthappa whipped the bails in a flash.
Karn Sharma’s (0/64 in 9 overs) bowling performance was an aberration as he went for 23 in an over where Thisara Perera (29) literally launched into him.
The leggie seemed to have got the length wrong and was punished a lot for his half-trackers. With a huge total on the board, Karn’s poor show didn’t impact the overall performance much.
Credit should be given to Kulkarni, who also had an indifferent start going for a few runs but came back in the end to get the wickets of Thirimanne, Perera, Seekkuge Prasanna and Kulasekara.
It was Axar, who finished the match when Ajantha Mendis’s switch-hit turned out to be a mis-hit.

The durg controlling authority in Chhattisgarh on Thursday raided and sealed a unit of an antibiotic manufacturing company here, whose product was used in sterilisation camps in Bilaspur district where 13 women died and several others fell ill.
“A raid was conducted at the drug manufacturing unit of Mahawar Pharma Pvt Ltd this morning and after collecting samples of medicines from there it was sealed,” Food and Drug Administration Controller Ravi Prakash Gupta told PTI.
AIIMS doctors inspect one of the victims of Chhattisgarh’s Sterlisation tragedy, at a hospital in Bilaspur on Wednesday.
“We have suspended sale and supply of products of the company across the state and directives have been issued to chemists and drug suppliers in this connection,” Gupta said.
During the raid, a significant quantity of drugs were found burnt at the premises of Mahawar Pharma and a detailed report in this connection will be given to higher authorities, official sources in the drugs control department said.
Notably, Chhattisgarh government has already suspended the sale of six drugs used in tubectomy surgeries at separate government-organised sterilisation camps in Bilaspur district which claimed the lives of 13 women and left nearly 100 ill.

Fairfax Connector bus ridership up along the Silver LineA Fairfax Connector drops off passengers at the new Wiehle-Reston East station. (Luz Lazo/The Washington Post)
Ridership is up on Fairfax Connector buses serving Metro’s Silver Line.
Fairfax transportation officials say the Dulles corridor bus routes are transporting more passengers since the July opening of the new Metrorail station in Reston and four in Tysons:  Ridership is up by 4 percent on weekdays and 7 percent on weekends.
The news is not surprising given that the Silver Line also appears to be off to a solid start with around 15,000 weekday entries and the Wiehle-Reston East Metro station already surpassing ridership projections.
Fairfax transportation officials expected Metrorail to ignite greater use of the bus system. The county  timed a major overhaul of its bus service with the opening of the new line , redirecting buses from the Orange Line at West Falls Church to the five new Silver Line stations and creating the county’s busiest bus hub at Wiehle-Reston . About 40 percent of the Connector’s service changed in July and now the system makes 30,000 weekday trips to and from the new stations.
The strong numbers in the corridor also are good news for the overall county bus system, which this summer reported  drops in ridership compared to last year . Transit officials said then that they expected some fluctuation in ridership while transit users adapted to new travel patterns as a result of the Silver Line.
Fairfax Connector section chief Nick Perfili said riders are still trying new options, but the ridership numbers are encouraging particularly for buses serving Wiehle, between Tysons and Springfield, and the Reston neighborhood routes. The new bus routes that provide service on weekday midday, weekday evening, and weekends– No. 558 and No. 559– are also growing, he said.
The use of park-and-ride facilities also remains strong, with Herndon-Monroe Park and Ride 70 to 75 percent full and the Wiehle garage more than 80 percent full on a typical weekday, Perfili said.
Fairfax Connector is now planning service changes to 29 routes in January . The changes include adjusting bus travel times to reflect traffic conditions in the area near the Wiehle station.
The proposed changes will go before the County Board of Supervisors for approval next month and aim to improve on-time performance, reduce crowding and enhance connectivity between routes.

Duty hike: Fuel prices won t go up |  Govt to raise Rs 6000 crExcise on petrol, diesel hiked; no increase in retail rates

(The government has increased…)
NEW DELHI: The government has raised the excise duty on petrol and diesel by Rs 1.50 a litre to raise Rs 6,000 crore in the current fiscal without raising retail prices, as crude oil's sharp fall is helping both consumers and the exchequer. "Prices of petrol and diesel will not be increased because of excise duty," Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan told ET.
Oil companies were earlier planning a big cut in petrol and diesel prices after the fortnightly review on November 15. Industry sources said the increase in excise duties would significantly reduce the reduction in rates. They may also defer the price cut and offer a bigger reduction by the end of the month during ongoing polls in Jaharkhand and Jammu and Kashmir, sources said.
Crude oil entered a bear market last month, bringing windfall gains to the country. Brent crude, the global benchmark, dipped below $79 on Thursday. It was more than $115 in June. The fall has helped the country decontrol diesel and sharply reduce the oil subsidy burden.
Government officials said excise duty on petrol and diesel was raised from Wednesday midnight. ET had first reported to Tuesday that the government was deliberating a duty increase on petroleum products to get its share of the declining crude prices.
State oil companies were earning additional revenue of about Rs 2.25 per litre on petrol and diesel before the increase in excise duty. According to industry estimates, the increase in excise duty would help the government raise about Rs 13,000 crore additional revenue in a full year. Falling international oil prices have also helped the government in substantially reducing state oil firms' estimated revenue losses to Rs 84,485 crore in the current financial year compared to Rs 1,39,869 crore actually incurred in 2013-14 for selling diesel, kerosene and cooking gas below market rate.
Oil companies have cut petrol prices six times since June, making the fuel about 13% cheaper. Diesel prices have been cut twice. Petrol prices are currently at a 16-month low, while diesel costs the same as it did about a year ago. Lower fuel prices have contributed to the fall in consumer price inflation.

Rohit Sharma hits record ODI score of 264 runs against Sri LankaRohit Sharma smashes record 264 runs to become first batsman to score 2 double tons in ODIs
PTI Nov 13, 2014, 06.37PM IST
(harma also became the first…)
KOLKATA: Rohit Sharma today scripted history by notching up the highest-ever individual score in one-day internationals, scoring a breathtaking knock of 264 against Sri Lanka in the fourth cricket one-dayer here.
During his rollicking knock which came off just 173 balls, Rohit surpassed the previous record set by countryman Virender Sehwag, who smashed 219 in an ODI against West Indies at Indore, back in 2011.
Rohit also became the only player in world cricket to score two double hundreds in the 50-over format with his previous best of 209 coming against Australia at Bangalore in November last year.
Asked if he was tired after his epic knock, a smiling Rohit said, "Not really. I have had a break due to injury and I am not tired at all. I could have continued for another 50 overs."
Rohit also broke Shikhar Dhawan's List A record score of 248 scored against South Africa A in Pretoria last year.
In his 173 ball innings, Rohit hit 33 boundaries and nine sixes with his last 214 runs coming in only 101 balls.
His 33 boundaries were highest number struck by an individual in an ODI innings.
Rohit said that once he got to 50, he had to get a big one as he was set.
"Once I got to 50, I had to convert it into a big score. Normally, I have an idea of the team total as it helps you to build an innings. We know that under lights with dew factor into consideration, 350 is not a safe score anymore at the Eden Gardens."
EDen Gardens also holds an emotional place in Rohit's heart as he scored a big hundred (177) on debut at this very venue last year and has now got the highest-ever ODI score.
"It's been a great venue for me as I got my hundred on Test debut at this venue. The crowd were cheering me right through."
For the record, Rohit has also got a T20 hundred at this venue having scored one against Kolkata Knight Riders two seasons back.

The surprising reason why those 5 cent charges for plastic bags actually workBy Chris Mooney November 13 Follow chriscmooney
(Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)
If you live in Washington, you know the drill: After bagging your groceries, the checkout machine asks you how many bags you used. And if you used plastic or disposable bags (rather than bags you brought on your own), you have to pay 5 cents per bag . The District passed a law requiring as much in 2009 -- a policy that states like New Jersey and New York are also considering , and that has been adopted around the world  from Ireland and  Scotland to South Africa .
Some localities have gone farther still -- California and Hawaii have effectively banned  plastic bags outright -- but recent research suggests that charges or fees can also be effective (and have the added benefit of being less coercive). Moreover, it suggests that they work, at least in part, through a surprising mechanism. It's not just the relatively minor added cost, on its own, that impels people to stop using plastic bags and to instead bring their own bags with them to the store. Rather, it's the way this small change disrupts habitual behaviors and helps people draw a tighter linkage between the environmental awareness that they already possess, and actions in the world that actually advance that consciousness and their values.
Such is the upshot of a new study on plastic bag charges published in the Journal of Environmental Psychology by a team of Argentinian researchers, led by psychologist Adriana Jakovcevic of Buenos Aires University. Charging a relatively small amount for bags "produces changes in behavior," says Jakovcevic, "and these changes are not only because of the economic value of the incentive -- there are also some other processes at play that involve environmental concerns."
As the researchers note, Buenos Aires provides a perfect opportunity to study the effects of plastic bag charges because in 2012, the vast city's Environmental Protection Agency put in place bag restrictions that in turn led the leading supermarket chain association to institute a bag charge (the equivalent of 2.5 U.S. cents for bags of medium size and 4 cents for large bags) Oct. 9, 2012. For smaller supermarket associations, meanwhile, the same charge went into effect roughly two months later on Dec. 10, 2012. But for Gran Buenos Aires, the larger area that surrounds the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires (CABA), there was no change instituted at all.
This is, the researchers note, a "natural experiment": You have three groups of supermarket shoppers, two of which experienced new bag charges at different times, and one of which did not experience plastic bag charges at all. So the researchers conducted several field studies, observing shoppers leaving supermarkets in low-to-middle income areas in the three different regions at different times -- before any policies went into place, after the first change, and after the second change.
The result was that sure enough, the policies greatly increased the percentage of shoppers who were observed to be carrying their own bag. Here's a figure from their study, showing the effects for the first set of supermarkets to institute the charge (CABA1), the second set (CABA2), and for supermarkets in Gran Buenos Aires that never saw a bag charge instituted (GBA). Consumers were observed at four times: before any policies took place (Time 1), just after the first policy affected CABA1 (Time 2), four weeks after the policy change (Time 3), and then shortly after the second policy affected CABA2 (Time 4):
From Adriana Jakovcevic et al, "Charges for plastic bags: Motivational and behavioral effects," Journal of Environmental Psychology, 40 (2014), 372-380.
Clearly, the bag fees worked to dramatically increase the habit of people carrying their own bags. But importantly, in a second study that involved directly interviewing consumers who were observed to leave supermarkets carrying either plastic bags or their own bags, the researchers tried to get at why they had begun to adopt this new behavior, rather than paying the relatively small bag charges that had been instituted.
First, it turned out that a surprising number of people didn't like the bag charge policy, but started carrying their own bags anyway. According to Jakovcevic, it is likely that the small economic cost is the best way of explaining the behavior of these individuals. Past research, however, has called into question whether a purely economic effect like this is a lasting one, with sustained influence on behavior.
But there was another group of Argentinian shoppers -- those who supported the charge and carried their own bags for reasons of environmental concern. They cared much less about economics and much more about green motives. "The people who supported the policy most, they also say they do it for environmental reasons," says Jakovcevic, "and this is a stronger finding because it was an open question, the people could say anything that comes into their mind, and most of them say it was to protect the environment." For these shoppers, says Jakovcevic, the policy provided an opportunity to "rethink why they are using plastic bags or their own bags, and if they care about the environment, this will push them to change their behavior and change it longer over time."
Thus, the paper concludes that the bag charge might have worked "both by the activation of pre-existent pro-environmental attitudes and by a direct effect of the charge on behavior." In addition, it suggests that the new policy worked in another way as well -- by being disruptive of the status quo and changing people's default options and choices. "After the introduction of the plastic bag charge, customers had to explicitly approve or request to obtain a bag and pay for it," notes the study. They couldn't just get one without thinking about it.
So just maybe, a little 5 cent charge can indeed help the environment. You don't have to confiscate all the plastic bags in the world to save the environment (enraging anyone from industry to the Tea Party in the process). You can just give people the slightest push, and let them fix the problem themselves.

Higher autonomy should be given to universities: MurthyMurthy pitches for higher autonomy to educational institutions
PTI     Bengaluru   Last Updated: November 13, 2014  | 19:02 IST

IT veteran N R Narayana Murthy on Thursday advocated higher autonomy and less governmental interference in the functioning of educational institutions.
"I think, my own personal view is there should be higher and higher levels of autonomy, government should not interfere in setting up colleges, in running colleges. The market, the society will decide which is a good university, which is not a good university, rather than government mandating," Murthy said.
Speaking on the sidelines of an event organised to announce Infosys Prize 2014 in Bengaluru, he said, "That's where I think the role of AICT and UGC must be reduced and we should provide full autonomy to professors, researchers and administrators of university. Then I think things will improve a lot like it happens in advanced countries."
The Infosys Science Foundation on Wednesday announced the winners of the Infosys Prize 2014 across six categories like Engineering and Computer Science, Humanities, Life Sciences, Mathematical Sciences, Physical Sciences and Social Sciences.
Asked whether he thinks that with the mushrooming of schools and colleges there would be no quality control, and how this can be curbed, Murthy said, "All over the world these things have happened. But it is the market that will determine who is a success and who is not. I don't think government control is what is going to improve this."
"So my view is that instead of trying to curb things, in the beginning there will be certain percentage of people who will take advantage of this freedom. But that's ok. A small percentage of people will suffer. But in the end, we will come out with a system of education, with a system of university, with a system of colleges that are of a better quality than what it is," he said.

Toxic levels of a chemical in plastic medical devices could endanger preemiesBy Abby Phillip November 13 Follow @abbydphillip

A potentially toxic chemical that is strictly regulated in children's toys is also used in abundance in neonatal intensive care units, where premature babies are often struggling to survive.
A new study suggests that while being treated, preemies can be exposed to toxic levels of a chemical that is approved for use in hospital settings and found in abundance in medical devices such as intravenous tubes as well as fluid and blood bags.
The substance, di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate, or DEHP, is used to make plastic medical devices more flexible. But it also easily leaches into bodily fluids and tissues it comes into contact with.
Researchers at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore found that premature babies can be exposed to levels of the chemical that are 4,000 to 160,000 times higher than desired to avoid toxic effects.
DEHP has been linked to disruptions in normal hormone function, as well as increased inflammation, liver injury, and the disrupted development of the lungs, brain and eyes in animals. The risks are believed to be particularly high for newborn boys, because the compound has been found to affect the development of the testicles and the production of normal sperm in animals, according to the Food and Drug Administration.
"It's remarkable that the care of sick and developmentally vulnerable preterm infants depends on an environment composed almost entirely of plastic," said neonatologist Eric Mallow, who is the study's author and a senior research program coordinator at the Bloomberg School of Public Health. "The role of these synthetic materials in the clinical course of our patients remains almost completely unexplored."
Most medical devices are made of a plastic called polyvinyl chloride (PVC). The devices often provide life support to premature infants whose vital organs may be underdeveloped.
But the tradeoff can be significant.
The study found that a four-pound preemie can be exposed daily to toxic levels of DEHP that are 4,000 times the level desired to prevent toxicity that affects the male reproductive organs, and 160,000 times higher than desired to prevent liver damage.
In some cases, high exposure to the DEHP occurs though breathing tubes used to deliver support with a ventilator. But the exposure to toxic chemicals could be one of the reasons why preemies whose breathing is managed without a ventilator have better lung outcomes, researchers said.
"We were floored by how high the exposures are when you look at all of the devices together," said Mary Fox, an assistant professor in the school's Department of Health Policy and Management and co-author of the study. "It's a population that we know is vulnerable to begin with. They're struggling to survive. And the concern now is whether this phthalate exposure is actually contributing to their problems when these medical products are supposed to be helping them get better."
The results were published online in the Journal of Perinatology on Thursday.
DEHP is one of many compounds called phthalates that are added to plastics to improve their flexibility, transparency or durability. It is the only phthalate approved for use in medical settings --  but it isn't regulated.
Researchers say that immediate steps can be taken to evaluate where exposure to DEHP is happening in a medical setting and to reduce it where possible. Using alternate non-DEHP products should also be explored.
The European Union announced in 2011 that it would begin phasing out the chemical by 2015. In France, DEHP will be prohibited altogether in tubing for the care of neonatal and maternal patients by 2015.
"We do have to make tradeoffs and we want to save these babies," Fox says. "But can we save them by using alternative products that reduce their exposures to substances that may be harming them? It seems like we could."

The Cricket Association of Bengal on Thursday announced Rs 2,64,000 cash award for Rohit Sharma for his world record score of 264 in India’s fourth ODI against Sri Lanka in Kolkata.
In an outstanding display of stroke making , Sharma plundered the Lankan attack with a record 264 that came from just 173 balls with 33 boundaries and nine sixes as India scored a mammoth 404/5 in their stipulated 50 overs.
The CAB, which is also celebrating 150 years of Eden Gardens’ existence, was quick to announce that they would give Rs 1,000 per run for Sharma’s memorable innings, making it a total of Rs 2.64 lakh, joint secretary Subir Ganguly said.
The announcement was made during the innings break as the Mumbaikar said he loved playing at the venue where he had made his Ranji debut.
“I made my Ranji debut here, my Test debut here, got a 100 in the IPL and now this. The crowd here has been brilliant, they love the game here,” Sharma, who had scored a Test century on debut, said.
This was also Sharma’s first ODI appearance at Eden Gardens.

India to see stable growth; prospects depends on reforms: OECDFIPB role shrinks amid easier FDI flows
Indian economy is expected to see an average growth of 6.7 per cent over the 2015-19 period and a further boost would depend on reform plans of the government, says a report.
However, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) today also said India and China face significant challenges.
“India’s growth should remain stable at 6.7 per cent, before any potential boost from the new government’s reform plans,” the report, released at the ASEAN Business and Investment Summit here, said.
“Emerging Asia” is set for healthy growth over the medium term even as outlook for many OECD countries remains subdued, as per the grouping’s latest economic outlook report for Southeast Asia, China and India.
“India’s growth should be stable over 2015-19, but the prospects could change depending on the implementation of the reforms of the new Modi government,” the report said.
These plans include promoting domestic and foreign investments, creating jobs, improving food security, raising standards of education and skills development, building new infrastructure, enhancing water governance and increasing the country’s overall competitiveness, particularly in the manufacturing sector, it added.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government came to power in May after a thumping victory in the general elections.
In October, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank projected 5.6 per cent growth rate for India this year, citing renewed confidence in the market due to a series of economic reforms pursued by the new government.
Meanwhile, OECD today in its report said that annual GDP growth for the ASEAN -10, China and India is forecast to average 6.5 per cent over 2015-19.
“Growth momentum remains robust in the 10 ASEAN countries, with economic growth averaging 5.6 per cent over 2015-19,” it noted.
The members of ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) are Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Brunei Darussalam, Singapore, Cambodia, Lao PDR and Myanmar.
However, the report said that China’s growth is expected to slowdown to 6.8 per cent over 2015-19 period. It also noted that public sector reforms have made substantial progress in Southeast Asia, China and India.
Paris-based OECD is a grouping of about 34 countries.

Mamata accepts Sonias invite  talk of grand alliance getslouderCM Mamata, who observes the birth or death centenary of many luminaries at the state secretariat and assembly, never paid that tribute to Indira Gandhi. (Source: IE archive)

With Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee accepting the invitation of Congress President Sonia Gandhi to attend the 125th birth anniversary of the first prime minister of India Jawaharlal Nehru to be held at Talkatora Stadium in Delhi, voices, in both the TMC and Congress, supporting a grand alliance with a view of fighting the BJP have once again become active in the state.
“The Chief minister has accepted the invitation of the Congress President and she is going to attend the ceremony on the first day, November 17,'” Derek O’Brien, Trinamool Congress spokesperson and Rajya Sabha member told Indian Express. Mamata is going to Delhi on November 16 and will be back to Kolkata on November 19. In between, apart from meeting President Pranab Mukherjee, she will be attending a meeting of industrialists at the West Bengal pavillion of India International Trade Fair.
In fact it was Ahmed Patel, political secretary to Sonia Gandhi, who called Mamata and conveyed the request of the Congress President to the TMC chief.
Today at Zero Hour in the state assembly, former Pradesh Congress President Manas Ranjan Bhuina, while welcoming the move of the chief minister, said the time had come when all secular, democratic and nationalist forces should unite to fight the BJP.
“Jawaharlal Nehru was the architect of a secular, democratic India and it is now under threat from divisive, communal forces. I believe it is time all democratic, secular and nationalist forces should be united under the Indian National Congress to fight the menace of the BJP,” Bhuina said.
Later speaking to Indian Express on a possible alliance between the congress and the TMC, Bhuina said he did not have the authority to speak on that subject. “It is the sole prerogative of our party president Sonia Gandhi to say anything about this,” the former minister in the Mamata Banerjee government told Indian Express.
While Congress Legislature Party leader Mohammad Sohrab said: “It is good that Mamata is going to attend the birth anniversary of such a person who all through his life fought for secularism and nationalism. And those who believe in his ideals should come under one umbrella to fight the BJP.”
Trinamool Congress leaders this reporter spoke to did not like to comment on a subject that is being handled directly by Mamata. One MP on condition of anonymity said: “There can be an alliance but this will lead to a vertical split in the Bengal Congress unit. For leaders like PCC president Adhir Ranjan Choudhury or Somen Mitra, or Deepa Das Munshi an alliance with TMC is totally unacceptable.”
It is  interesting to note that Mamata, who observes the birth or death centenary of so many stalwarts and luminaries at continued…

Machil fake encounter case verdict related to JK Assembly polls:GeelaniPrint

Hardline Hurriyat Conference Chairman Syed Ali Shah Geelani on Thursday said the life term to five army personnel in the Machil fake encounter case of 2010 was BJP’s ploy to show its “soft face” ahead of the Assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir.
“This sentencing is related to the elections that are being held in the state. BJP is in fray and it is trying to show its soft face to the people of the state particularly to the people of the Kashmir Valley,” Geelani told PTI here.
The octogenarian separatist leader, however, expressed hope that such things would not have any effect on the people of Kashmir.
The Hurriyat hawk said there was “no justification” in  welcoming the verdict as there were “thousands of such cases where justice has not been meted out yet”.
“This is not a single case. So many massacres have happened in the state and particularly in the Valley right from 1947. There are thousands of cases like this where justice has not been meted out,” he said.
Geelani said Jammu and Kashmir was “under the occupation of forces and until and unless the people of Kashmir were given Right to Self-Determination, there will be no justice,” he said.
“There is no need to welcome this verdict. There is no justification in welcoming this. We are suffering from top to down,” he said.

As Modi visits Myanmar  border districts join hands to curb smuggling  boost bordertradePrint
Written by Samudra Gupta Kashyap | Guwahati | Posted: November 13, 2014 7:47 pm
Even as Prime Minister Narendra Modi paid a visit to Myanmar to push for better ties with the neighbouring country, officials of districts sharing the border on both sides met at Changlang in eastern Arunachal Pradesh to join hands in curbing arms smuggling and infiltration and improve border trade in the area.
Hosted by Changlang district deputy commissioner Chanchal Yadav, the one-day meeting also focused on other cross-border issues like law & order and drug trafficking  and also activities of several insurgent groups of Assam and Nagaland in the area. The Myanmarese delegation was led by Ru San Kuye, chairman of the Naga Self-Administered Zone.
“While delegates from both sides agreed to increase cooperation between the law enforcement agencies at the district level to maintain peace and tranquility along the international border, they agreed for real-time intelligence sharing on the activities of insurgents, arms smugglers, drug traffickers and smugglers particularly of wildlife and wildlife products operating along the Indo-Myanmar border,” an official told The Indian Express from Changlang.
The Indian delegation that also had officials of security forces deployed in counter-insurgency operations in Changlang district, shared specific information about movement of insurgent groups like NSCN(K) and NSCN(IM) and ULFA and asked their Myanmarese to share intelligence in order to curb their activities.
The Indian officials also discussed the issue of citizens from both sides smuggling narcotics including opium during the three designated free-movement days of the month and asked their Myanmarese counterparts to take necessary action on their side. “The Myanmarese side said more roads are being planned to connect inaccessible areas in their territory which in turn will help curb smuggling as well as use of these areas by insurgent groups,” the official said.
Myanmar officials also requested the Indian officials to speed up construction of a Border Haat at Pangsau Pass inside Indian territory so that people from both sides could exchange various goods on a regular basis and in the process cut down smuggling. People from both sides are free to walk across the border at Pangsau Pass on the historic Stilwell Road (built during World War II) on three designated days — 10th, 20th and 30th of every month — to buy and sell 62 specific items. A formal Border Haat however is yet to be opened there.
While Myanmarese officials expressed willingness to buy agricultural machineries and construction materials from India through Pangsau Pass, Indian officials also agreed to arrange English language training for Myanmar officials deployed on border guard duties. On the request of Myanmarese delegates, the Indian side also agreed to train farmers on the other side on tea, rubber and cardamom plantation.

Nepal: Slamming Prachanda  Maoist leader Bhattarai says Constitution will be drafted in assembly  notstreetPrint

Striking a dissent note with fellow comrade Prachanda, Maoist leader Baburam Bhattarai on Thursday said that his party is committed to draft the new constitution within the Constituent Assembly.
His remarks came after United Communist Party of Nepal-Maoist (UCPN-M) Chairman Prachanda’s threat to unilateraly announce the constitution from the street, if major political parties failed to forge consensus on key issues including the number of federal units.
“People will announce their own constitution through the street, if ruling parties go ahead by disregarding the voice of the opposition parties,” Prachanda on Wednesday said in Rolpa district, considered Maoists’ headquarters during the decade-long insurgency.
Bhattarai said revolutionary forces need to collaborate and cooperate with each other for consolidating democratic achievements.
They fought the democratic struggle jointly and initiated the peace process by a 12-point agreement signed in New Delhi between the then underground Maoist party and other democratic parties, he said.
Maoist Vice-President Narayankaji Shrestha said his party is committed to promulgating the constitution by January 22, 2015 as agreed by the political parties and the party is ready to show flexibility for the sake of forging consensus.
He also dismissed the allegation made by ruling parties that UCPN-Maoist has abandoned the path of dialogue and consensus saying: “we are not obstructing the process of drafting the new constitution as claimed by the Nepali Congress and CPN-UML.”
“We are ready to sit for dialogue to forge consensus on key issues of the constitution,” he added.
The ruling parties Nepali Congress and Communist Party of Nepal-United Marxist Leninist are saying they would opt for voting process to settle the disputed issues of drafting the new constitution if no consensus emerges.
The Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML command two-third majority in the 601-membered Constituent Assembly, which is sufficient to draft the new constitution.
However, opposition parties including UCPN-Maoist and Madhesis based parties are pressing to settle the disputed issues of the constitution.
Political parties are yet to agree on forms of governance, federal structure and judiciary system.

US jobless claims rise but still close to 14...Applications for US jobless aid climb to 290,000
Reuters Nov 13, 2014, 07.58PM IST
( The four-week average,…)
WASHINGTON: The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose more than expected last week, yet it remained near a 14-year low in a reminder that the labor market appears to be moving toward full health.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 12,000 to 290,000 for the week ended Nov. 8, the Labor Department said on Thursday.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a smaller increase. Claims have now been below 300,000 for nine straight weeks, and in October hit their lowest level since 2000 at 266,000.
"This increase is nothing to worry about," said Ian Shepherdson, an economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. "Claims can remain close to their current trend for an extended period."
Yields on US government debt were mostly flat following the data's release, suggesting little impact on Wall Street bets on when the US Federal Reserve will hike interest rates.
The Fed last month gave an upbeat view of the labor market, dropping its characterization of labor market slack as "significant" and replacing it with "gradually diminishing."
Together with a separate survey of employers that tracks job openings, the claims data suggests firms are well past a cycle of elevated lay-offs that began in the 2007-09 recession.
Still, even as claims have fallen, the pace of hiring has been remarkably steady in recent years and has averaged about 200,000 a month, although job creation has accelerated slightly this year.
Also, while workers are no longer being laid off at high rates, they appear to lack confidence in the labor market and are thus wary to quit their jobs. The share of the employed who quit has held steady most of this year, and remains well below pre-recession levels.
Fewer workers quitting their jobs reduces the available pool of workers for job openings and analysts believe this is a reason behind stagnant wage growth, arguably the biggest unresolved matter in America's labor market recovery. The Labor Department is due to release September data on the rates of job turnover - including the quits rate - later on Thursday.
The Labor Department said there were no special factors influencing last week's claims data.
The claims report showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid rose 36,000 to 2.39 million in the week ended Nov. 1.

Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc said it would buy Procter & Gamble Co's Duracell battery business in exchange for its $4.7 billion stake in the world's No. 1 household products maker.
P&G, in the midst of selling about half of its slow-growing brands, said it would pump in about $1.8 billion in cash into Duracell before the transaction.
"It is a good thing that P&G is moving swiftly to divest its non-core brands," Sanford Bernstein analyst Ali Dibadj said. "However, I don't take it as a good sign that Buffett would rather own Duracell than P&G."
Shares of P&G, which also reiterated its full-year 2015 organic sales and core earnings forecasts, fell about 1 per cent in early trading.
"I have always been impressed by Duracell, as a consumer and as a long-term investor in P&G and Gillette ," Berkshire Hathaway Chief Executive Buffett said in a statement.
"This is our kind of business... Not very exciting but a good, solid business," Buffett told FOX Business Network.
Buffett became a P&G shareholder in 2005 when the company, bought Gillette, Duracell's owner at the time. Buffett was Gillette's largest shareholder, owning its shares for over a decade, and once sat on its board.
P&G, whose brands include Pampers diapers and Tide detergent, said on Thursday the deal would be tax efficient for the company and maximizes Duracell's after-tax value.
The company said in August it would focus on faster-growing businesses by selling slow-growing brands. P&G said last month it wanted to split off Duracell.
Demand for Duracell's mainstay non-rechargeable alkaline batteries has waned as electronic devices has increased demand for re-chargeable batteries.
Berkshire owned about 52.8 million P&G shares as of June 30, or a stake of about 1.9 per cent worth $4.7 billion as of P&G's Wednesday close.
P&G said it would take a non-cash charge of about 28 cents per share in the current-quarter and expects to close the deal in the second half of next year.
Goldman Sachs & Co is P&G's financial adviser and Jones Day acted is its legal adviser.

MUMBAI: State run natural gas company GAIL (India), along with state gas companies of Turkmenistan, Afghanistan and Pakistan has set up a company that will build, own and operate 1,800-kilometer of gas pipeline across Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI).
The company has been incorporated as a Special Purpose Vehicle in the Isle of Man, a British Crown dependency and has been named TAPI Pipeline Company. It would be responsible for finance, design, construction, operation and maintenance of the TAPI pipeline.
Turkmenistan's national gas company Turkmengas, Afghan Gas Enterprise, Inter State Gas Systems (Private) and GAIL will own equal stake in TAPI Pipeline Company.
The TAPI pipeline will export up to 33 billion cubic meters of natural gas a year from Turkmenistan to Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India over 30 years. This will enable the landlocked Turkmenistan, which has the world's fourth-largest proven gas reserves, to expand its gas export market while supplying fuel to energy starved Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India.
The pipeline is expected to carry 90 mmscmd gas, of which India and Pakistan would get 38 mmscmd each. Afghanistan's share would be 14 mmscmd but the country has indicated that it may only take 1.5-4 mmscmd, which will result in the balance being shares equally by India and Pakistan.
ADB, the advisor for the TAPI gas pipeline project, had advised setting up a TAPI pipeline company such that a consortium leader can be identified to spearhead the operation of the pipeline.

NEW DELHI: Auto major Mahindra & Mahindra plans to launch three new vehicles, including two compact SUVs, next year as it looks to strengthen its position in the domestic market.
In the two-wheeler segment, the firm which is in the process of acquiring 51 per cent stake in Peugeot Motocycles for 28 million euros, is eyeing various global markets besides India to launch the French firm's products.
"We were slow on launches in 2013 and 2104. Now we are back with new launches. In 2015, we will launch two sub-4 meter compact SUVs and one light commercial vehicle. All the three would come on completely new platforms," Mahindra & Mahindra Executive Director Pawan Goenka told reporters here.
The company is also in the process of developing new series of engines with its Korean arm Ssangyong, he added.
Earlier this year, M&M had announced plans to invest Rs 4,000 crore at the Chakan plant to take the overall capacity to 7.5 lakh units annually when fully operational. The fresh infusion would take its total investment in Chakan to Rs 8,000 crore.
In 2013, the company had announced plans to invest Rs 10,000 crore in three years.
Commenting on the plans with Peugeot Motocycles, Goenka said: "We are looking at ASEAN region, particularly Vietnam, North African countries and India to launch products from the Peugeot Motocycle portfolio."
He said, however, that it was "hard to say" as to when two-wheelers from Peugeot stable could be launched in India as the current models are expensive.
"The products in their current avatar would not be feasible for India due to pricing. We will have to do some market research as see what products would suit Indian requirements," Goenka added.
Last month, Mahindra Two-Wheelers, a fringe player in the domestic market, had inked a pact to acquire 51 per cent stake for 28 million euro (over Rs 215 crore) in Peugeot Motocycles, part of the 54 billion euro French auto major PSA Group.
He said Mahindra could do a market research after February next year when the acquisition process is completed.
"India is certainly on for us but at the same time it is not a burning issue," Goenka said.
When asked if the company could look at utilising the French firm's manufacturing resources for Mahindra Two Wheelers, Goenka said: "Certainly, it is possible. There are two possibilities. First one is motorcycle brand Mojo, which we plan to launch in India in next six months and thereafter in international markets.
"Secondly, we will start producing electric scooter GenZe in the US next year. We are keen to take this product to Europe also."
On Mahindra's strategy to turnaround Peugeot Motocycles, Goenka said: "We need to work on two levels. Firstly, we need to see how we can lower the material costs and secondly how to increase margins. At this moment I cannot say when we will be able to achieve break even but I will be happy if it happens in 2-3 years.
"There is no magic wand. All such acquisitions take time to turnaround... We have plans."

Pakistan Cricket Board to file appeal against ban on MohamedAamir"Aamir's case is different from those of Butt and Asif. These two have still not really accepted their guilt. We want them to do more to first convince us they are indeed reformed," said Shaharyar. (Source: AP)
Posted: November 13, 2014 8:31 pm
The Chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Shaharyar Khan has ruled out any leniency for former Test captain Salman Butt and Muhammad Asif who are serving bans for spot fixing since 2010.
Shaharyar told reporters today in Lahore that while the PCB had started preparations for filing an appeal for banned pacer Aamir with the International Cricket Council (ICC), it had no such plans for Butt and Asif.
“The PCB is completing all legal formalities and will file an appeal with the ICC soon to get some relaxation for Aamir under the revised anti-corruption code of the ICC,” said Shaharyar.
“But we have no plans to do the same for Butt and Asif at the moment. First they have to convince us they indeed repent for what they did and are ready to reform themselves,” he  added.
The trio was banned for spot fixing during the fourth Test against England at Lords in 2010 and later also served jail sentences in the United Kingdom for the same offence.
The three cricketers have been given minimum five-year bans by the anti-corruption tribunal of the ICC but while the ban for Butt and Aamir ends in August, 2015, the former also has been given a two-year suspended sentence.
“Aamir’s case is different from those of Butt and Asif. These two have still not really accepted their guilt. We want them to do more to first convince us they are indeed reformed,” said Shaharyar.
Under the revised code, a banned player can apply to the ICC ACU to allow him to resume playing domestic cricket before his ban ends.
Shaharyar pointed out that Aamir’s case was different since he was very young when the incident took place and secondly he immediately repented and accepted his guilt.
“And he has cooperated fully with us and the ICC in reforming himself and helping in the fight against corruption,” the PCB chief said.
He said that except for a short statement from Butt and Asif which came after much delay, they had not worked with the PCB on their rehabilitation.
“First they convince us and then we will decide when to approach the ICC to seek relaxation for them as well,” Shaharyar said.
He clarified that it was wrong to presume that once the PCB appealed to the ICC Aamir could make a quick return to competitive cricket.
“His case will be scrutinised and dealt with by the ICC and its anti-corruption unit under a due process which will take some time.”
Butt, in a recent statement, has appealed to the PCB to plead his case.

Mizoram Assembly passes Lokayukta legislation  frivolous complaints could lead toarrestPrint
By: Express News Service | Aizawl | Posted: November 13, 2014 8:26 pm
The Mizoram Assembly on Thursday passed a bill to set up a Lokayukta in Mizoram in spite of some opposition members and alleged corruption watchdogs criticizing parts of it, particularly a clause that allows for punishment of complainants with a three month jail-term.
The Mizoram Lokayukta Act 2014 was passed by the 40-member state assembly after Law Minister Lalsawta introduced the bill on Thursday, saying the government has taken much time to frame the legislation both through setting up a committee and inviting comments from the public.
The law allows for the setting up of a three-member Lokayukta to be chaired by a current or former Chief Justice or judge of a High Court or someone with qualifications to be one, who will be assisted by a judicial member and one other member.
Members of the Lokayukta are to be appointed by a selection committee consisting of the CM, the Speaker, a HC judge and the Leader of Opposition, who can constitute a five-member search committee to recommend names.
The Lokayukta members will have a term of five years, or at least till they attain the age of 70 years. Their salaries will be at par with judges of the HC, but they will be disallowed from re-employment after their terms are over.
The new law also gives the Lokayukta power to appoint its own secretary and a director, who will oversee enquiries, investigations and prosecutions of corruption cases, including cases the Lokayukta takes over from any agency so long has it has not yet been heard in court.
The Lokayukta will have suo moto powers to investigate cases and powers to rope in any agency to aid in the investigations, but it will have to finish preliminary enquiry within 45 days, and a full-fledged investigation within nine months.
After that it will file a case in a special court, which will then have to pass judgement within 18 months.
Besides the CM and his Council of Ministers, MLAs, bureaucrats and heads of corporations, societies, companies or trusts that are partly funded by the state of centre can be investigated by the anti-corruption watchdog.
Some have however criticized the new law for its provision that complainants can be punished with a fine or imprisonment by the special court if a frivolous complaint led to an arrest of the accused.
The Lokayukta members can also be removed from office if the Supreme Court okays it after the Governor refers such a move.
The bill also carries with it a financial memorandum of Rs 13.90 crores to set up the Lokayukta, of which Rs 730.09 crores will be earmarked for annual salaries.

Sunanda Pushkar death: Police may sent viscera samples abroad for testingPrint
The AIIMS medical board had confirmed poisoning as the reason behind her death but did not mention the type of poison that caused her death.
By: Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: November 13, 2014 8:47 pm | Updated: November 14, 2014 7:55 am
Delhi Police are considering sending viscera samples of former union minister Shashi Tharoor’s wife Sunanda Pushkar, who was found dead in a hotel here in January, to forensic laboratories abroad to determine the type of poison that is suspected to have caused her death.
The AIIMS medical board had, in its second report submitted to police recently, confirmed poisoning as the reason behind her death but did not mention the type of poison that caused her death.
They had listed some kind of poisons most of which were radioactive isotopes that cannot be detected by labs in India.
According to a senior police official, police are now mulling sending the viscera samples to a UK-based laboratory which has facilities to test all kinds of poisons.
“With this almost clear that Sunanda died of poisoning, the biggest question which remains in the case is that the kind of poison (used) and how it reached her body. If these question can be answered, the case could head to its logical end,” the official said on condition of anonymity.
As of now, the police have asked the AIIMS panel of doctors to redo their investigation and name the poison which caused Sunanda’s death but if it fails to do so, the samples will then be sent abroad.
The three mobile phones and a laptop of the deceased have already been sent to a forensic laboratory in Gandhinagar, Gujarat, for investigations to check whether anything was deleted from the gadgets post her death.
Today too, police questioned some people who were related to the case but senior officials refused to divulge the identities of these people and what they told police.
The AIIMS panel of doctors had earlier said the police had not shared with it the photographs of scene of occurrence, statements and circumstantial evidences with them.
Police had not quizzed a single person in the last nine months nor did it try to inspect the ‘crime’ scene.
As the police try to reinvestigate the case from scratch, there are two possibilities in the case, first is that the police register a fresh FIR in the case and second it closes investigations stating that no foul play was found.
It was only after the AIIMS report that the police got suite number 345 of Leela Palace Hotel, where Pushkar was found dead, opened.
Police had also called upon the AIIMS doctors and experts from FSL to inspect the room during which fluid marks were found on Sunanda’s bed sheet, the carpet and a broken glass in the room. These articles have also been sent to forensic labs for examination.
The suite of the five star hotel, had remained sealed and was opened for the first time since the incident.

Five other people as qualified to offer advice to Hillary Clinton as Rudy GiulianiBy Philip Bump November 13 Follow @pbump
(Damian Dovarganes/Associated Press)
"The wrong way" to win a presidential race, former New York City mayor and short-term Republican presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani told Politico , "is to be too aggressive, and be too mean and to ever get personal." This was advice intended specifically for Hillary Rodham Clinton, who, unlike Giuliani, has never run for president before.
That, of course, is a joke; both Giuliani and Clinton ran in 2008, and this is how they did after each led in the polls shortly after the 2006 midterms.
But anyway, sure, advice from Giuliani about not being "too aggressive, too mean" in what Politico's Kyle Cheney describes as a "blunt and occasionally expletive-laden interview." And if he is qualified to offer advice on how to win a presidency, we figure that these five people are, too.
• Howard Dean. Dean actually has advice for Democrats, and because the next election is in 2016, that advice is necessarily about the presidential race. His advice, in short: "Do not yell." Ha ha, no, that's not it, but let's remember that his presidential experience consists of: 1) that incident and 2) being at the Democratic National Committee as Barack Obama suplexed John McCain.
• Robert Reich. Reich, who was Bill Clinton's labor secretary, suggests that Hillary Clinton be more populist, which, for those who haven't tracked Reich's recent work, is of a piece. Unlike Giuliani, however, Reich has worked in the White House, so that's something at least.
• Taylor Swift. Swift is not a "politician," as such, but she does know a little something about mobilizing people to take action. Being a pop star and being a president have a lot more in common than we're probably comfortable admitting: Each tweaks his or her performances to get enough people over the necessary hurdle (voting/buying a song) to be successful. In the political game of the music industry, it's impossible to disagree that Swift has been successful.
• Me. Unlike Giuliani, I have not run for president; unlike Giuliani, I also have not spectacularly failed at running for president. I know a lot about politics, have looked at a poll or two, and am good with numbers. For example, I know that 591,384 (the number of votes Giuliani earned in 2008) is just over half of 1,163,078 (the votes earned by Ron Paul). That sort of knowledge is helpful on the campaign trail.
• Literally anyone you might pass on the street today, wherever you happen to be. Let's say you swing by the Winn-Dixie after work to pick up a broiled chicken. "Say," you ask the cashier, "should a candidate for president be mean and get personal on the campaign trail?" If that cashier says no, he or she has offered campaign advice as valuable as that of the former mayor of New York. And you have a broiled chicken.

Outgoing Arkansas Gov. Beebe to pardon son over marijuana convictionBy Niraj Chokshi November 13 Follow @NirajC

Arkansas Gov. Mike Beebe (D) plans to pardon his son over an 11-year-old marijuana conviction, according to a local report.
“He was embarrassed, he’s still embarrassed and, frankly, I was embarrassed and his mother was embarrassed,” Gov. Beebe told local ABC affiliate KATV  (video embedded below) of his son Kyle’s 2003 felony conviction over marijuana possession. “All the families go through that. I mean, you know, it’s tough on the families, but hopefully kids learn.”
Beebe’s son Kyle was arrested in 2003 by police responding to a call from his then-girlfriend who alleged he shoved her. After entering the house, they discovered “more than an ounce of marijuana in a plastic bag,” according to a March 29, 2003, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette article. At the time, his father said his son deserved equal treatment.
“Obviously, his mother and I are heartbroken like any parent would be,” he told the paper then, later adding that his son “needs to be treated like everybody else – no better, no worse.”
When asked about those comments by KATV, Gov. Beebe says he stands by them and that Kyle Beebe applied for a pardon like anyone else.
Applications for a pardon— “a total forgiveness of a criminal penalty” — are first reviewed by the state Parole Board, which then makes a recommendation to the governor. Kyle Beebe’s pardon was one of 17 such recommendations deemed to have merit, according to an Oct. 20 Arkansas Parole Board document . That list included a handful of individuals convicted on similar counts of “possession of a controlled substance.”
“If they straightened up to get their life back on track and have a second chance, so this is no different,” Gov. Beebe told KATV of his son’s pardon. “It’s different because it’s my son.”
Kyle Beebe’s record had been sealed after he finished his probation stemming from the conviction, according to a Parole Board statement obtained by KATV . Six Parole Board Members voted that his application for a pardon had merit. The commissioner of the board did not vote.

Kim Kardashian once was linked to another Wizard (pre-Kris Humphries) #TBTBy Erin C.J. Robertson November 13 Follow @ECJRobertson
The Washington Post article from the Reliable Source column on March 14, 2008.
Right now, Kim Kardashian is busy breaking the Internet with her money shot (translation: she bares her oiled down derriere) on the cover of Paper magazine’s 2014 winter edition. The cover, of course, should come as no surprise, since the reality star’s whole career has been built on the age old adage “sex sells.”
But on this Throwback Thursday, we remember a time when a less naked Kim visited a Washington party free of charge (reportedly, appearing as Paper mag’s cover star was also gratis) and spent time with a Wizards player. This was pre-Kris Humphries.
Kardashian, who in 2008 could command $5,000 to $10,000 per club appearance, hosted Wizards-turned-Pistons player Caron Butler’s extravagant 28th birthday bash at the Park at 14th. Apparently, Kardashian and Butler met during his L.A. Laker days and became friends. So she didn’t charge for the appearance because she’d come to D.C. just to “kick it with him.”
Six years later, and the reality star has created a new maxim: “Getting noticed pays.”

Payrolls rose by 321,000 in November, way above the 230,000 estimated, while the unemployment rate held steady at 5.8 percent, a six-year low.
The report blew past forecasts, but also raised expectations that a rate hike from the Federal Reserve may materialize sooner than previously thought.
Ronald Sanchez, chief investment officer of Fiduciary Trust Company International in New York, said the number was "unambiguously strong," though it "could mean some changes to policy recommendations with the Fed. June 2015 is back on the table for when rates could rise."
Financials <.SPSY> rose 1 percent as higher interest rates would prop up earnings in the sector. Bank of America  rose 2.7 percent to $17.68 while Goldman Sachs  was up 1.8 percent to $195.45, boosting the Dow.
Utilities <.SPLRCU>, a dividend play, fell 0.8 percent as Treasuries yields rose. Energy <.SPNY> fell 1.2 percent alongside a 1.7 percent drop in crude  prices. Most sectors ended well off their highs of the session.
"The day's market action has to be seen in the context of the recovery we've had year-to-date. Payrolls confirm the strength of the economy, but that strength is reflected in stock prices," said Sanchez, who helps oversee $16 billion in assets.
Separate data showed new orders for U.S. factory goods fell for a third straight month in October, pointing to a slowdown in manufacturing activity.
The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> rose 58.69 points, or 0.33 percent, to 17,958.79, the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 3.45 points, or 0.17 percent, to 2,075.37 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 11.32 points, or 0.24 percent, to 4,780.76.
For the week, the Dow rose 0.7 percent and the S&P rose 0.4 percent. It was the seventh straight weekly gain, a streak not seen in a year for both. The Nasdaq fell 0.2 percent on the week.
American Eagle Outfitters  fell 13.8 percent to $11.91 after the teen apparel retailer forecast a current-quarter profit below analysts' estimates and reported its fifth straight drop in quarterly income.
About 5.81 billion shares traded on all U.S. platforms, according to BATS exchange data.
NYSE advancers outnumbered decliners 1,614 to 1,480, for a 1.09-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,809 issues rose and 927 fell, for a 1.95-to-1 ratio favoring advancers.

Local small business owners feeling confident about economy
A greater percentage of Chicago-area small business owners are planning to grow their businesses in the next five years, according to a new report from Bank of America.
Two-thirds of Chicago small business owners plan to expand their companies by 2019, up from 59 percent surveyed six months ago, according to the fall 2014 Small Business Owner Report, released Thursday.
More than half of Chicago-area respondents plan to target new industries and customers; 25 percent plan to open new locations; and 23 percent will be looking for investment partners.

Overall, the survey found that small business owners are confident about their companies' overall health, with 71 percent expecting to hit their revenue goals this year. Sixty-one percent expect more revenue this year and 48 percent plan to beef-up hiring. More than half of local business owners surveyed also said they planned to award salary bonuses to employees.
Optimism about the national economy is up, too, according to the survey. Forty-eight percent of local respondents reported that they believe the national economy will improve in 2015, compared with 34 percent last year.

Rosetta comet landingAfter 10 years of hard work, the Rosetta mission made history by landing on the surface of a comet. The lander Philae touched down on the surface of a comet more than 300 million miles away. (European Space Agency)
UPDATE: AT 11:03 AM, SUCCESSFUL LANDING WAS CONFIRMED.
For the next 24 hours or so, you can bite your nails right along with scientists from the European Space Agency and NASA as they attempt to drop a robotic probe onto a comet for the first time ever. You can read more about the mission here .
[Updated: Landing details]
The video above will stream live from mission control in Germany until 2 p.m. Wednesday. There's a viewing schedule on the ESA's Web site, subject to change of course . The team has already sailed through the first go/no-go decision point, but there are several left before the planned landing. Between 7 p.m. and 8:30 p.m. Eastern time Tuesday night, two more decisions will take place.
Here are Wednesday's highlights:
1:00 a.m. Eastern time -- The team will make their final go/no-go decision, leading to final preparations for the separation of the Rosetta spacecraft and the Philae lander .
4:03 a.m. Eastern time -- The scheduled separation.
7 a.m. Eastern time -- The first pictures from Philae are expected at this time. Mission control should also give an update on the data it's collecting during its descent.
9 a.m. Eastern time -- Mission control will undertake the final preparations for the landing, and much nail-biting will commence.
11 a.m. Eastern time (plus or minus 15 minutes) -- With any luck, the probe will land (hopefully upright) on the comet.
12 p.m. Eastern time (at the earliest) -- Mission control will present the first panoramic image taken of the comet, assuming Philae has landed successfully.

No Jordan Zimmermann-Cubs talk  and other GM meeting notesBy James Wagner November 12 Follow @jameswagnerwp
Jordan Zimmermann. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)
Welcome to hot stove season, when all sorts of rumors catch fire. But one that blazed late last night — the Cubs talking to the Nationals about Jordan Zimmermann — was just as quickly extinguished. Although the teams could be a match because of each other’s needs, the specifics just don’t make much sense. Echoing rebuttals from the other side, one Nationals official flatly denied that any talks had occurred.
This may not, however, be the end of Zimmermann trade talks. In fact, a few members of the Nationals could continue coming up in trade rumors. Five key players — Zimmermann, Ian Desmond, Doug Fister, Denard Span and Tyler Clippard — are entering their final contract years before free agency. The Nationals have talked extensions with Zimmermann, Fister and Desmond but haven’t completed any deals.
It’s hard to imagine the Nationals signing all three players to extensions, so they would be prudent to at least listen to what other teams would offer in a trade, to get an outside sense of a player’s value if nothing else. The larger question is why the Nationals would be willing to break up a talented team expected to contend again. Zimmermann has seemed willing to test free agency, but with him around next season, the Nationals will another good shot to push for the World Series. Should Zimmermann choose to depart afterward, the Nationals have talented young arms waiting to fill the void, and they could perhaps get a draft pick back if Zimmermann rejects a qualifying offer next offseason. That’s not all that bad.
>>> We explored the Nationals’ second base issue , where several factors should be considered, whether the answer comes through trades or free agency. Perhaps foremost, the Nationals could use a left-handed bat to help balance the lineup after Adam LaRoche’s departure. Without another left-hander, Bryce Harper and Denard Span would the sole left-handers, with Nate McLouth on the bench.
General Manager Mike Rizzo, however, said Nationals will not prioritize offense — such as a left-handed hitter — over defense for a second baseman. He said the Nationals’ mission will be to find the “best available player.”
“We like two-way players that are athletic and can play offense and defense, and that’s ultimately the type of guy we’re looking for,” Rizzo said.
>>> The Nationals inquired about young shortstops at the trade deadline, including Arizona’s Didi Gregorious. The Diamondbacks and Nationals have had minimal conversations so far this winter, according to a person familiar with the situation, so nothing is brewing now. The Diamondbacks have a surplus of middle infielders with veteran Cliff Pennington, and young shortstops Chris Owings and Nick Ahmed. 
>>> Ideally, the Nationals would keep Anthony Rendon at third base, where he shined defensively last season, and find a second baseman. But Rendon’s ability to play second base could allow the Nationals to pursue a third baseman in free agency or a trade if there is a right fit.
“I think part of Anthony’s allure and package is that he’s flexible,” Rizzo said. “He’s very gifted athletically. He’s very gifted defensively and he’s very flexible position player. He gives us a lot of different options and a lot of flexibility to do things that we need to do.”
>>> The Nationals have much to answer this offseason, and the size of the 2015 payroll could be a big factor. But if they make no major improvements and current players improve their weaknesses or take the next steps in their development, they should still remain a force in the NL and among a short list of World Series favorites.
“We like the team that we have,” Rizzo said. “We like the roster constructed as it is. We want to do everything we can to improve it any way, shape or form that we can. If that means staying as is, if it means getting younger, more controllable guys, or if it means making a trade or two, we’re going to do what’s in the best interests of the club and try to improve the team any way, shape or form. We like the team we have. It’s built the right way and it has a lot of quality players and gives us a chance to compete.”
>>> More to come from the meetings Wednesday.

Aldermen pass SRO preservation law10
Displaced tenants who lived in a building for at least 32 consecutive days would receive $2,000 to $8,600 in one-time relocation assistance, depending on the circumstances. A tenant who has to move because of unsafe building conditions would be entitled to $10,600 in relocation assistance.
The law also includes restrictions mandating how many units are reserved for people of different financial means.
Building owners do not consider the law much of a compromise.
"The numbers simply don't work. Over time, it could be catastrophic," said Eric Rubenstein, an owner of three SROs and executive director of the Single Room Housing Assistance Corp., which represents 75 properties.
The final version of the ordinance, however, offers more options for owners than earlier drafts and was repeatedly called a compromise during Wednesday's council meeting. The law does not apply to building owners who had sought city permits before June 25 for demolition or conversion to market-rate housing.
The tweaked proposal also gives owners a year to formally close on the sale of a building. Also, the proposal more specifically states that preservation fees collected under the ordinance could be tapped to offer forgivable loans and other potential financing sources to rehab existing SROs or grants to prospective buyers who want to maintain the buildings as affordable housing.
Housing advocates estimate that Chicago has lost more than 2,200 rooms of housing for very low- and low-income residents during the past three years.
In July, the Chicago City Council passed a six-month moratorium on the issuance of any building permits tied to the conversion or demolition of SRO buildings while aldermen devised rules governing redevelopment of the buildings.
"Some of the pushback that we get around the city, including in my ward, about affordable housing, people generally just don't like the idea of government-subsidized housing, and I think that conversation is fundamentally flawed," said Ald. Ameya Pawar, 47th.
"If you own a home, you get a mortgage tax deduction. That is a government subsidy."

Group sues to block fracking rules from being published3
The Joint Committee on Administrative Rules, an obscure arm of state government, cleared the way last week for oil and gas drillers to apply for permits to start fracking, a drilling process that injects water, chemicals and sand at high pressure into shale rock to unleash oil and gas.
The state could find itself at the center of an oil boom by next fall if the energy firms that have leased land here begin to drill.
The final rules aren't expected to be made public until published in the Illinois Register. That must happen by Saturday to meet a state deadline.
Those who've closely watched the process of crafting the fracking rules say the lawsuit attempting to block the rules is likely the beginning of a spate of litigation.
Legal challenges are expected on everything from how the rules were created to how permits are issued.
Mineral rights owners in southern Illinois who have been waiting more than a year for fracking to begin already have filed lawsuits in Wayne, White, Edgar and Hamilton counties claiming that the drawn-out process has tied up their land with unusable leases with oil companies, akin to an illegal land grab by the state.
Monday's suit includes the allegation that the Department of Natural Resources didn't provide the required 20 days' notice before scheduling public hearings on the rules and gave no reason for the lack of notice.
The suit also said that at least one agency representative must be present during hearings to answer questions from the public.
Instead, the suit claims, people who attended hearings were told there would not be a "question-and-answer session" and that no one would answer questions from the public.
Young said "the agency thoughtfully responded to issues raised by more than 30,000 comments submitted directly to the agency" and posted comments, drafts and transcripts on its website.
Also, the suit says, people were turned away from a Chicago hearing because the room was at capacity.
The suit claims this violated the Illinois Administrative Procedure Act, which states that the Department of Natural Resources "shall allow interested persons to present views and comments on the proposed rulemaking."
"We showed up for the Chicago hearing, but myself and a group of people were turned away," said Nathan Czuba, a resident of Cook County and a plaintiff in the suit.

Hundreds of his fellow farmers across nine rural districts of India’s newest and 29th state have committed suicide over debts of a few lakhs, leaving behind hapless widows awaiting moneylenders’ knocks. 
According to a list compiled by grassroots organisations Caring Citizens Collective and Rythu Swarajya Vedika, 375 farmers have committed suicide between June 2 and November 8.
The government is not buying this figure. A debate, however, does little for farmers or widows such as Kamalamma and Rajitha whose miseries are piling up.
Kamalamma who?
In the parched Pallepahad in Nalgonda district, Kamalamma, 36, sits forlorn at her house. Her tears have dried up, much like the wells in the village. 
Her husband, Dasari Ramulu, 45, committed suicide on August 21 by hanging from a tree. The marginal farmer had taken Rs. 5-lakh loan for borewells and for his daughter’s marriage last year.
For a farmer overburdened by the debt, the poor monsoon did not help. His paddy crop, the family’s only source of income, on an acre dried up.
Ramachandraiah, his elderly neighbour, offers the hindsight. “He never shared his pain with us. He might have feared he would lose the respect he had in the village.”
Now, Kamalamma looks clueless about how to bring up her three children who are in school. She goes to work as a farm labourer, earning Rs. 150 per day. With crops failing, that daily wage work too will stop. A buffalo the family had also died while giving birth.
Kamalamma dreads the day when moneylenders will come to collect. For sure, they will come.
What police report says: Suicide because of loan burden
What revenue official says: Suicide resulting from domestic quarrels

Rajitha who?
In Tarigoppula village of Warangal district, Rajitha, 24, is yet to come to terms with the loss of her husband. Polaboyina Pochaiah, 35, consumed pesticide on October 16.
In addition to his family’s two acres, Pochaiah had leased-in 10.5 acres at Rs. 3,000 per acre three years back.
The first year went fine but he suffered a loss the second year. He managed to cover up with an accompanying crop. But a repeat loss this year, with all of the maize in the 10.5 acre dried up due to bad monsoon, meant tenant farming proved too much of gamble.
His family says they were clueless about what was going on in his mind.
“I only know that he took loans from moneylenders,” says Rajitha.
His younger brother Kanakaiah showed HT the dried-up maize crop. He says the loan burden could be Rs. 2 lakh or much more.
Pochaiah’s two children are in elementary school. They are too small to know why their father committed suicide. Rajitha would be hoping they don’t get trapped in the same cycle.
What police report says: Suicide because of loan burden
What district collector says: Not yet brought to our notice; shall probe such cases

Debt-to-death cycle: the problem areas
June 2 was when KCR (as Rao is popularly known) took oath as CM of Telangana, which was carved out of Andhra Pradesh.
The government is not buying the figure of 375 farmer suicides and pegs the number at below 80. The Caring Citizens Collective and the Rythu Swarajya Vedika are not buying the government figures either.
A farm loan waiver of up to Rs. 1 lakh announced by Rao’s government is coming in tranches and is yet to be executed, thereby denying farmers fresh bank loans.
What’s more, if the state does not acknowledge farmer suicides, it denies families of the deceased government aid of up to Rs. 1.5 lakh.
Rains were scarce this year and erratic power supply is drying up the remaining crops.
KCR and leaders of his party, the Telangana Rashtra Samithi, are accusing Andhra Pradesh and its CM Nara Chandrababu Naidu for the power problem.
KCR’s defence is emphatic. The CM, who has a productive farm in his home district of Medak, says, "We are aware of the suicides. But what can we do when Chandrababu Naidu has vowed to destroy farming in Telangana and show me as a failure?”
Government banners such as this one at the Turkapally panchayat office in Nalgonda highlight implementation of the farm loan waiver promise to 3.6 million farmers. The waiver, however, is coming in tranches and not helping the farmers much as they are being denied a fresh bank loans. (Prasad Nichenametla/HT Photo)
Irrigation projects such as the Pranahita-Chevella that will bring Godavari waters to the parched Telangana are far from completion.

Peace clause  helps India  US resolve food subsidy row  WTO impasse endsIndia, US settle row over food security
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, November 13, 2014
First Published: 11:24 IST(13/11/2014) | Last Updated: 08:26 IST(14/11/2014)

India and the United States scripted a compromise formula on food subsidies on Thursday, paving the way to remove a major irritant in the stalled World Trade Organization (WTO) deal on easing of customs rules.
As part of a revised proposal, India and the US have agreed for an indefinite “peace clause” on food security until a permanent solution is found, marking a major success for the Narendra Modi government in global trade talks withstanding mounting diplomatic pressure from developed countries.
A “peace clause” gives legal security to member countries and protects them from being challenged under other WTO agreements.
HT first reported on September 22 the possibility the of breakthrough during Prime Minister Modi’s visit to the US when he discussed the issue with President Barack Obama.
Developed nations have shown support for a “peace clause” that would agree to developing countries’ demands on food security for a period of four years.
India, however, was pressing for a guarantee for further exemption until a permanent solution is negotiated and to find a way to allow countries the right to provide higher levels of subsidies for their poor beyond these four years.

The latest move will likely help WTO members ratify the so-called trade facilitation agreement (TFA) to make trade easier, faster and cheaper by making systems transparent and reducing red tape.
In July, India had withstood mounting pressure from the developed countries including the US, which had blamed New Delhi’s hard bargain strategy for the eventual collapse of the talks putting the WTO’s future in “uncertain ground.”
India had made it clear that state-funded welfare schemes for the poor were non-negotiable even as it took the blame for blocking the TFA in July, as it did not come bundled with a roadmap for rules on food subsidies.
"The United States and India reached agreement today (Thursday) on a set of measures intended to break the impasse in the work of the World Trade Organization (WTO) to implement the agreements reached last December," said a US government statement.
The two countries agreed that India's food security programmes would not be challenged under WTO rules "until a permanent solution regarding this issue has been agreed and adopted," it said.
India's commerce minister Nirmala Sitharaman tweeted that India and the US had "successfully resolved their impasse over food security issues in #WTO".
"WTO General Council will receive India's proposal and US will support us," she said.
Even after Modi's talks with Obama in September, India, however, held the view that without a permanent solution on food subsidies, public stockholding programmes such as buffer stock of food-grains will be hampered.
Existing rules cap the value of food subsidies at 10% of the value of production. But, the way the support is calculated at prices of more nearly three decades earlier means many countries would find it difficult to stay within the limit potentially attracting strong penalties from the trade body.
This will affect India’s food security programme and food grain procurement through the minimum support prices (MSP).
Bali package
New Delhi's decision in July to hold up the TFA to reduce trade barriers came after the WTO's members agreed at a December, 2013, meeting in the Indonesian island of Bali to implement the pact.
At the time of the Bali accord, WTO members agreed on a four-year "peace clause" to protect India from being punished over subsidies and stockpiles until a "permanent" solution" was reached. The agreement was due to take effect in mid-2015.
But after the Bali pact, Indian officials complained there were nearly two dozen meetings on the trade facilitation pact and just a handful on subsidies.
Bali was the first multilateral agreement concluded by the WTO since its inception in 1995.
It also signalled the first concrete progress on the Doha Round of trade liberalisation talks, launched in 2001 and aimed at underpinning development in poorer nations.
It took nearly a decade to conclude the trade facilitation part of the talks, which began in 2004.
"The agreement announced today (Thursday) between the US and India paves the way for full implementation of the WTO's Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA)...The agreement also reflects shared understandings regarding the WTO's work on food security," US Trade Representative Michael Froman said in a statement.
   
"We now look forward to working with all WTO members and with Director-General Roberto Azevedo to reach a consensus that enables full implementation of all elements of the landmark Bali Package, including the TFA," he added.

Sterilisation tragedy: Chhattisgarh CM orders judicial probe; doc heldComments
Chhattisgarh police on Thursday arrested the surgeon whose botched sterilisations claimed the lives of 13 women in Bilaspur earlier this week, and will produce him in a court later in the day.

Dr RK Gupta was on the run since the first deaths were reported and an FIR was lodged against him on Tuesday.
The 59-year old surgeon, who was honoured by the Chhattisgarh government on January 26 this year for accomplishing a massive target on mass sterilisation in the state-run campaign, was detained at Baloda Bazar, about 70 km from Bilaspur. 
"He has been arrested today (Thursday) after he was detained in Baloda Bazar district. He will be produced before the court soon," Bilaspur inspector general of police Pawan Deo told HT, adding more arrests are likely to follow. 
Following his arrest, the surgeon told reporters he has been made a scapegoat.
"I am innocent. The health of the women deteriorated owing to the sub-standard drugs prescribed to them following the sterilisation surgery," he claimed.
Gupta, who had operated upon 83 women in six hours last Saturday at the Sakri health camp in Bilaspur (which would mean that he spent just two minutes per tubectomy), was suspended on Tuesday by the state government.
While eight women died on Monday, three on Tuesday and one on Wednesday and at least two dozen others are being treated in various hospitals.
During the campaign even women of primitive tribes, whose sterilisation is banned by the government, were reportedly "coerced" to attend such camps.
Twenty-four-year old Chaiti Bai, a member of Baiga community, died late on Wednesday evening following the botched laparoscopic tubectomy in the camp at Guarela-Pendra in Bilaspur.
Bilaspur commissioner Sonmoni Borah confirmed to HT there were two Baiga women among the 16 who were rushed to Bilaspur from Guarela-Pendra for immediate medical treatment after they underwent sterilisation operation.
Amid reports that rusted equipment were used in the surgeries, a team of doctors from Delhi's premier AIIMS hospital is in Bilaspur to investigate into the incident.
The state government also banned the sale of four medicines which were given to the women after the sterilisation at different camps in Bilaspur on Wednesday. The drugs have been sent to a Kolkata laboratary for tests and analysis.
In the wake of the deaths and the subsequent protests, the Chhattisgarh government has decided to institute a judicial probe into it.
During his visit to Bilaspur to meet the ailing women patients, chief minister Dr Raman Singh declared that judicial commission will inquire into the botched-up sterilisation deaths.
“Instead of any departmental inquiry I have decided for a judicial probe that will thoroughly investigate into every aspect," he said. This was his second visit to Bilaspur after the reports on deaths emerged following the sterilisation in the state-run camp.

Gruden: RGIII a thick-skinned guyBy Mike Jones November 13 Follow @mikejoneswapo

When discussing the many aspects of growth that he hopes and needs to see in Robert Griffin III if he is indeed to develop into the franchise quarterback of the Washington Redskins , coach Jay Gruden has often mentioned the importance of mental fortitude.
Gruden believes that Griffin has displayed improvement in this area. And Griffin this season certainly has received additional tests in this area. But the quarterback remains a work in progress.
Gruden has stressed that Griffin can’t worry about being liked, whether by teammates or outsiders, and the quarterback can’t allow criticisms to impact him. As Gruden said over the summer, “He’s a perfectionist. He doesn’t like negative publicity,” Gruden. He doesn’t like negative plays to happen. He wants everything to be right. He wants everybody to love Robert, and that’s not going to be the case at the quarterback position.”
On Wednesday, a reporter asked Gruden if he believes Griffin is “mentally delicate.”
“No, no,” Gruden replied, and added: “You don’t want to have anybody mentally delicate. I just think people can chip away at you. If you continue to read everything written about you and listen to everything that is said about you on television then … he is a human being, it can wear on you. I think really for a young kid that has been through as much as he has – both good and bad – already at age 24 or however old he is, he has shown the fact that he is a thick-skinned guy and really in good spirits, both mentally and physically. So you’ve just got to continue to grow and learn from every experience both on and off the field and that’s what great quarterbacks have to do.”
Prior to Gruden’s press conference Wednesday, Griffin, in his own press conference, said that he isn’t worried about whether or not every teammate likes him, and that winning is his prime concern , which suggests Gruden’s messages may be getting through.
Asked if that stance was a reflection of the advice Gruden has given his star pupil, the coach said, “We talk about stuff all the time. We don’t just talk football in team meetings. Sometimes we talk about things like that. There are other things that come up that are important in a quarterback’s maturation process. You know, he is not perfect by any stretch, in any phase, off the field, on the field, but he is a guy that is willing to work at it and hopefully we can get him there.”

DC Court rules that Top-Level Domain not subject to seizureBy David Post November 13
As I mentioned several months ago , a group of plaintiffs, having obtained judgments in US courts against the government of Iran, has been seeking to satisfy those judgments via writs of attachment – court-ordered seizures – of property belonging to the Iranian government.  This can be a relatively straightforward process when applied to bank accounts, real estate, or tangible personal property – the usual targets of seizure orders.  But the plaintiffs here sought to seize the .ir top-level domain – the ccTLD (“country-code top level domain,” as distinguished from the “generic top-level domains” like .com, .org, and the like) associated with Iran.  This is, plaintiffs asserted, property belonging to the Iranian government, held here in the U.S. by ICANN, the US-based administrator of the global Domain Name System (DNS), on whom the writ of attachment was served.
It raises some pretty interesting questions – like “what the heck is a ccTLD, anyway?” and “how do you ‘seize’ it?” and “where is it located for purposes of ‘attaching’ it?” and many others.  [Geeky but useful DNS tangent here: as to the first question, country-code TLDS work like this.  The DNS consists, at the top of the pyramid, of a single simple file: the "root zone" file.  It lists, for each and every top-level domain recognized by the Internet, the name of the person or entity (known as the "Registry" for the TLD) responsible for assigning sub-domains in that TLD (university.ir, davidpost.ir, yournamehere.ir, etc.), and the IP Address of the machine used by the Registry to hold the list of sub-domains registered in that particular TLD.   If we look at the actual root zone file, -- be careful not to mess it up!  the entire Internet will come crashing down if you do!!** - we see that the Institute for Research in the Fundamental Sciences , located in Teheran, is the Registry for the .ir domain.  So that means that if you want a .ir domain name you need to apply to them - go ahead! *** Names are available, and they take Visa and Mastercard! Really!]
On Monday, Judge Lamberth of the DC District Court wisely dismissed the writs of attachment, holding that the ccTLD was not “property subject to attachment in the District of Columbia.”  This is the right result for many reasons – not least of which is that the DNS is a public resource of enormous value on which a substantial amount of the world’s trade and commerce and entertainment and communication now takes place, and the notion that pieces of it are available to satisfy private judgments would wreak havoc on the public Internet.  Judge Lamberth didn’t feel the need to go into all that – his ruling rests on the narrower (but perhaps more stable) ground that the “property” right in a ccTLD is “inextricably bound to” and “cannot be conceptualized apart from” the services provided by the ccTLD manager and the root zone administrator and the rest of the DNS, and as such can’t be attached or seized (under the general rule that services are not attachable or seizable).  Good stuff.
**  a bit of humor – you don’t have to write me to tell me that’s actually not correct . . .
***  WARNING:  as my colleague and friend Michael Froomkin has pointed out to me, purchasing an Iranian domain name with a Mastercard or Visa without a special license could violate the terms of the “Joint Plan of Action” regarding Iranian sanctions; so you might want to think twice . . .

After 30 years  a woman confronts her abuser -- and herselfBy Danielle Bostick November 13
Danielle Bostick (Photo by Trish Koch)
One afternoon two years ago, I received a flurry of texts, Facebook messages and phone calls that Rick Curl, a prominent swim coach in the same Washington, D.C., area league as my childhood team, had been arrested for sexual abuse of a minor that had occurred decades earlier.
While to my friends the story was little more than shocking gossip, it disturbed me in a different way. I felt unsettled, but wasn’t sure why. The next year, as I was pursuing a new career in clinical mental health counseling, I was assigned to write the story of my life. Suspicious details, along with troubling memory gaps, helped me to eventually pinpoint why I had been so disturbed by the Curl story. As it turned out, I had been the victim of a similar crime.
For nearly 30 years I’d been carrying a secret – one I’d kept from even myself.
In 1984, shortly after my parents got divorced, my swim coach and family friend, Christopher Huott, moved into my house under the guise of helping us, assuming many of the primary tasks of caregiving as my mom worked full-time and adjusted to single parenthood. He packed my lunches, provided transportation and entertained me with “Metroid,” “Tetris”  and “The Legend of Zelda.” He introduced my family to the national parks, and chose Latin as my foreign language in middle school, which ended up being my college major.
He also sexually abused me from the ages of 7 to 12. As an 8-year-old, I remember worrying I could become pregnant by what my abuser was doing.  At 9, I thought I would have to marry him.
Like some victims, I took years – decades actually – to come to grips with what happened to me. But unlike most, I ultimately came forward, reported the crime and allowed my name to be used in public court records and news accounts.  It wasn’t an easy decision, but there was a downside to silence.  My sense of shame increased as I hid this part of me. And, as I learned, remaining nameless in the face of such a crime invites all manner of vicious speculation — from acquaintances and strangers alike — and potential exploitation a second time.
The Rape Abuse and Incest National Network (RAINN) reports that the vast majority of victims will never report their crimes to law enforcement.  When they do, however, their willingness to engage with law enforcement is predicated on anonymity.  In fact, 90 percent of victims of sexual assault would be less likely to report their crimes if their identities were publicly revealed during the legal process.
There are numerous reasons victims keep their abuse history a secret.  “The victim’s post-rape circumstances are psychologically unique and not typically experienced by a victim of any other crime,” said Julaine Field, an associate professor at the University of Colorado and a licensed professional counselor. “Any choice to disclose is fraught with unwanted complications.”
It often feels safer for victims to deny or minimize the extent and impact of the abuse.  Naming and disclosing the experience can dredge up intense emotional pain, shatter the identity a victim has worked hard to construct, threaten his or her sense of normalcy, and disrupt interpersonal relationships, particularly if the perpetrator is still in contact with the victim or his or her family.
I experienced all of this when confronting my own abuse history. I never told anyone — not my mother or father, not my younger brother or my friends  — while the abuse was happening. I had contact with my perpetrator until 2012.  Frantically burying memory fragments of the trauma and constructing an alternate reality had allowed me to do that.  Cutting off contact would have been too close to facing what had happened. To protect myself and attempt to live a normal life, I had created a narrative of my childhood that was a lie.
Most adults can’t remember every facet of their childhoods, but most of my memories stopped shortly after my perpetrator moved into my childhood home.  Even recollections of benign experiences ended up locked in the same vault as the dark ones because of the pervasiveness of the abuse.  Yet geographic distance from where the crimes took place, details of a crime similar to my own, and taking a deep look into what I remembered of my past triggered something in me I could not ignore.  Although I would have preferred to lock up those memories again and move forward, I realized that continuing to keep the secret would be unhealthy for my family and me – I was now married with children of my own – and perhaps dangerous to the community where my perpetrator still had regular access to children because of his job as a swim coach.
When I decided to report my abuse, I had no specific memories of the assaults, which was very confusing. I did not know at that time that it is common for people to form and store memories of traumatic events very differently than non-traumatic ones. Although decades had passed since the crimes and I did not have linear, coherent accounts of the abuse, I was sure enough that it had happened to contact the Montgomery County police.  I assumed, at best, I could tip the police off to a potential pedophile, and maybe corroborate the stories of other victims whose memories might be clearer than mine.  At worst, I thought they would tell me that too much time had elapsed, or that I did not have enough information.  I was surprised when the detective encouraged me to make a report in person the next time I was in Maryland.
In March 2014, I walked into a Montgomery County police station with little more than memory fragments and a gut feeling that I had been abused.  After reporting what I remembered, the detective suggested a phone sting.  A recorder running, I called Chris from my cellphone, intent on discovering the truth, not just for the police’s case  but also for me.  We had been in touch until I had left the Washington area in 2012, and he was pleasantly surprised to hear from me.  I did not need a dramatic cover story.  I told him the truth — that I remembered very little of my childhood, I had strong suspicions I had been abused, and that I needed him to fill in these gaps for me so I could move forward in my life.  For nearly two hours, he confessed to abuse more horrifying than I had imagined or feared.
Suddenly, I was not just tipping the police off to a potential perpetrator, I was Victim A in a decades-old case.
I was still known only as a “36-year-old victim” when news of my case broke in the media.  Reporting my crime to police had given me a voice, but it also made me a victim in new ways.  Reactions to the news about Chris in the media were upsetting.  One of the perpetrator’s apologists wrote online, “(The accuser) should be ashamed of herself.  I bet 10 to 1 she is in debt, has credit cards up the wahzoo, and needs money.”
Vitriol was not limited to online fora.  Even after Chris was banned from USA Swimming, the new owner of his Laurel, Md., team told some families the accuser was mentally unstable, seeking a scapegoat for her problems. Friends called to tell me this, not knowing that I was his victim and that Chris had confessed to the crimes. Also distressing, an organization in Massachusetts that purports to support children in athletics promoted itself on Twitter by claiming — falsely — to have helped my family and me in our quest for justice.
Who were the beneficiaries of my anonymity?  An organization that was taking advantage of my misfortune. Supporters of my abuser who felt comfortable impugning the character of a nameless, faceless woman.  Perhaps even perpetrators, the vast majority of whom will never face justice and who count on the voicelessness of their victims to shield themselves from the consequences of their actions.
I began to see advantages to coming forward beyond my closest friends and a few family members. In the same way friends and former teammates had contacted me in the wake of the Rick Curl case, I continued to receive a barrage of texts and calls to inform me of my coach’s misdeeds. The final, pivotal moment for me came when a former teammate called to let me know that people within the swim community were saying that I was the victim. It clicked: I realized I had done nothing shameful and I had no reason to hide.
On a personal level, disclosing this aspect of my life on a larger scale would give me a voice that had been silenced for nearly three decades.  More generally, I hoped to destigmatize child sexual abuse, disrupt the culture of shame and silence associated with sex crime, and empower other victims to begin their journey of healing. In making this decision, I also let my children know the truth about my past.
I described the impact of my perpetrator’s actions in court on Sept. 11, when he was sentenced to 10 years in prison , and allowed the media to use my name and face in related coverage.  I had constructed an identity born of a void.  As I ascribed words to my experience after three decades of concealment and denial, it was as if I was speaking my abuse into existence and it became real.  While my life no longer felt comfortable or normal, it felt authentic. I was no longer living a charade.
In the past two months, I have not once regretted my decision.  Through my silence and shame, I was tacitly saying to my husband, “I don’t trust you enough to love all of me.”  I was saying to others, “If you know this about me, you will reject me.” Instead of the negative response I feared, I have been met with overwhelming love and affirmation. Victims of similar crimes have reached out to me in support and solidarity.
Every day I mourn the loss of the childhood in which my biggest source of sadness and confusion could have been my parents’ divorce.  I cannot go back and have a normal childhood, but in confronting the truth about my shattered childhood, I feel whole.  In choosing to share my experience, my burden is lighter because I am not alone.

Report: Solyndra program is profitableBy Max Ehrenfreund November 13 Follow @MaxEhrenfreund

Lost in the hubbub following President Obama's climate agreement with China was a smaller bit of surprising environmental news Wednesday: the Department of Energy's loan program is expected to make money for taxpayers.
Most people are familiar with the program because of Solyndra, a solar-panel manufacturer that went bankrupt in 2011 after borrowing $528 million from the federal government. Solyndra was one of a few bad bets the feds made -- Fisker Automotive, which built electric cars, went under last year.
You can't avoid defaults when you lend money, though, and on balance, the loans are being repaid. A report released in the next several days will give the department's first estimates of how the program is performing financially: the loans and guarantees will earn at least $5 billion over 20 years or so, according to a Bloomberg article citing a single anonymous source.
It is hard to know what kind of rate of return that number represents without more exact figures, and it's also important to note that the report contains projections based on the history of the program so far. The companies the government has backed could do worse than predicted. Then again, they might do even better.
In any case, the report won't end the debate over Solyndra. Conservatives are likely to argue that even if the program is earning money for taxpayers, the government should have lowered taxes and let citizens invest the money themselves . Some conservatives might even suggest  a tax on carbon dioxide  would be a more straightforward way of encouraging research into clean energy.
In short, you can still take issue with the whole idea of the loans if you like, but you can't claim that the program has been mismanaged or call it a failure or a boondoggle anymore.

The number of people working part time who would prefer to be working full time doubled during the financial crisis.

1. Top story: Congress to vote on the Keystone XL pipeline
Landrieu will use the vote to appeal to constituents in Louisiana's runoff. The runoff is Dec. 6, and Landrieu (D-Louisiana) made clear that she wants to vote to approve the pipeline before then. "I don’t think we necessarily need to wait until January," she said, noting that she could lose her seat. Ed O'Keefe in  The Washington Post .
Still, the proposal might not have enough votes to pass a filibuster. There are 57 or 58 senators ready to vote for approval. The House will vote Thursday and the Senate as early as Tuesday. A White House spokesman said Obama has "a dim view" of any legislative requirement that a specific project ought to be built, but did not say the president is planning to veto the bill. Elana Schor at  Politico .
The official report on the pipeline might understate the greenhouse gas emissions involved. The State Department study didn't take into account the fact that a relatively small increase in the worldwide supply of oil would also encourage people everywhere to burn more fuel, increasing carbon dioxide pollution. Neela Banerjee in the Los Angeles Times , August 2014.
MILBANK: Congress is doing what's best for Landrieu, not for the country. Congress is setting aside several urgent questions to help Landrieu, who is behind in the polls. What's more, Obama might have been able to use approval of the pipeline in later negotiations with Republicans. Now he might lose that leverage.  The Washington Post .

FRIEDERSDORF: Pregnant pigs' welfare is now a problem for Chris Christie. The New Jersey state legislature believes that giving pregnant pigs be given more space to move is clearly the right thing to do, but if Christie signs the bill, he risks alienating the pork industry nationwide and damaging his chances for a presidential nomination.  The Atlantic .

The bankers involved diddled the fix to their own advantage. They colluded by sharing information about clients’ pending orders and adjusting their own prices accordingly. Easy profits and plentiful bonuses ensued. Losers included those whose foreign-exchange contracts were tied to the 4 p.m. fix, including many firms and mutual funds."  The Economist .

Berkshire Hathaway to acquire P&G s DuracellBerkshire Hathaway to acquire P&G's Duracell
Duracell batteries
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Procter & Gamble Warren Buffett
Berkshire Hathaway Inc said it would acquire Procter & Gamble Co's Duracell battery business.
Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc said it would buy Procter & Gamble Co's Duracell battery business in exchange for its entire $4.7 billion stake in the world's No. 1 household products maker.
P&G, whose brands include Pampers diapers and Tide detergent, said it would contribute about $1.8 billion in cash to recapitalize Duracell before the transaction.
Shares of P&G, which also reiterated its full-year organic sales and core earnings growth forecasts, fell about 1 percent before the bell.

The household products maker said in August it could sell about half of its slow-growing brands and last month said it would sell Duracell to focus on faster-growing brands.
Demand for Duracell's mainstay non-rechargeable, disposable alkaline batteries has waned while a worldwide explosion in electronic devices has increased demand for re-chargeable batteries.
Berkshire owned about 52.8 million shares in P&G as of June 30, or a stake of about 1.9 percent, according to the most recent regulatory filing. ( http://1.usa.gov/1lZ2Ca3 )
"I have always been impressed by Duracell, as a consumer and as a long-term investor in P&G and Gillette," Berkshire Hathaway Chief Executive Warren Buffett said in a statement.
P&G said it would take a non-cash charge of about 28 cents per share in the current-quarter and said it expects to close the deal in the second half of next year.
Goldman Sachs & Co is P&G's financial adviser and Jones Day acted is its legal adviser.

Live: Sri Lanka struggle after Rohit s world record double ton propels India to 404/5print
Rohit Sharma redefined one-day batting with a 173-ball 264 to better Virender Sehwag's highest individual score of 219 and show when it comes to effortlessly ripping into the opposition, he is best-suited for the job.
Coming off an injury, Rohit couldn't have found better facilitators than Sri Lanka as he took them apart with precision and the elegance befitting royalty. He is now the only player to score centuries in Tests, ODIs and T20 at Eden Gardens, celebrating its 150th year. Add to that the 200 he had scored in Kolkata five years ago in a Ranji Trophy match and it's a record VVS Laxman would be proud of and something for Eden to brag about too.
That all four ODI double hundreds so far have come off India bats in Indian venues tells something about the odds faced by bowlers on slow pitches and fast outfields. But Sri Lanka somehow managed to make even the Eden pitch look better. Staying true to their mediocrity throughout the series, Sri Lanka gave Rohit an inch when Thisara Perera dropped him, on four, at third man in the fifth over. He went on to extract a yard.
Rarely clocking above 125km/hr, Sri Lanka's bowling was perfect for Rohit to settle into a rhythm. With responsible knocks, Ajinkya Rahane and Virat Kohli too gave Rohit the confidence to build his innings slowly. The last time he scored a double century, he had run Virat Kohli out. Maybe, India could benefit again next time if the duo comes to an understanding on this.
Not an easy job
The final scoreboard won't reflect the difficulty Rohit might have had earlier but it had actually taken him 22 balls to get his first boundary. It was a pull off Angelo Mathews over midwicket and even though he didn't time it well enough, the outfield gave the ball extra legs.
What followed was a riot as Sri Lanka continued to innovate means to concede runs. Putting six fielders on the off-side and asking the bowler to come round the wicket, or bowling on-side with fine-leg up were just some of the ways Sri Lanka ensured India were never short of scoring opportunities.
But then not everything was gifted to Rohit. At times the ball stopped and stayed low so caution wasn't thrown out of the window until India had crossed the 300-run mark. By lasting 50 overs and running hard with Virat, Rohit showed keeping fit too was one of his priorities in the two months away from cricket.
Then of course were some standout moments. The fashion in which he almost reached out to drive Nuwan Kulasekara in the 30th over showed how he has a way with timing and placement. Or the drive that fetched him a boundary and the status of being the only person to have two ODI double centuries to his name. More audacious was the way Rohit walked across the stumps to flick Kulasekara over midwicket for six. Over confidence? No. He has just that much more time.

Gogoi warns officers  says wont tolerate excuses for delayingprojectsPrint
Written by Samudra Gupta Kashyap | Guwahati | Posted: November 13, 2014 8:36 pm | Updated: November 14, 2014 2:00 am
Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi, known for his take-it-easy stance, Thursday sounded tough when he warned officers against dilly-dallying projects and said no excuses would be tolerated especially in case infrastructure projects got delayed. This warning comes at a time when the Congress government has started gearing up for the next assembly polls slated for early 2016.
“There should not be any delay in moving the files for obtaining ceiling for funds. Timely utilisation of certificates is a must for getting the next installment of funds. The departments must submit the utilisation certificates without fail. No excuses will be tolerated for dilly-dallying things,” Gogoi said. He was reviewing the progress and utilisation of Plan funds with ministers and senior officials of various departments here on Thursday when he issued this warning.
Gogoi particularly directed officials to start various infrastructure projects without further delay and identified a major storm-water drainage project and a JICA-funded water supply project for greater Guwahati, apart from several roads and bridges including the Guwahati-Chandrapur-Morigaon Road.
Asking the departments to submit utilisation certificates on time to obtain funds from the ministries, Gogoi said he would strictly monitor utilisation of Plan funds by the departmental heads and would evaluate their performance by noting it down in their Annual Confidential Report (ACR). “How the senior officials of the departments have utilised their Plan allocation would be reflected in their ACRs,” he said.
The chief minister also asked the departmental heads to prepare specific-project and scheme on the basis of the benefits that would accrue from it. “The departments must identify the areas where specific projects can bring in benefits to the people. It must focus on backward and far-flung areas to ensure that the fruits of development reach out to the people. Projects must bring in benefits and they must be viable and cost-effective,” he said.
Joining Gogoi, state chief secretary Jitesh Khosla on his part asked senior officials to exert to the full in utilising Plan allocations to the optimum level. “Don’t go home, stay overnight and finish your job. The process of sanction and release must not be delayed at any cost. The impact in the fields has to be seen,” he said.

Mizoram Assembly passes Lokayukta legislation  frivolous complaints could lead to arrestPrint
By: Express News Service | Aizawl | Posted: November 13, 2014 8:26 pm
The Mizoram Assembly on Thursday passed a bill to set up a Lokayukta in Mizoram in spite of some opposition members and alleged corruption watchdogs criticizing parts of it, particularly a clause that allows for punishment of complainants with a three month jail-term.
The Mizoram Lokayukta Act 2014 was passed by the 40-member state assembly after Law Minister Lalsawta introduced the bill on Thursday, saying the government has taken much time to frame the legislation both through setting up a committee and inviting comments from the public.
The law allows for the setting up of a three-member Lokayukta to be chaired by a current or former Chief Justice or judge of a High Court or someone with qualifications to be one, who will be assisted by a judicial member and one other member.
Members of the Lokayukta are to be appointed by a selection committee consisting of the CM, the Speaker, a HC judge and the Leader of Opposition, who can constitute a five-member search committee to recommend names.
The Lokayukta members will have a term of five years, or at least till they attain the age of 70 years. Their salaries will be at par with judges of the HC, but they will be disallowed from re-employment after their terms are over.
The new law also gives the Lokayukta power to appoint its own secretary and a director, who will oversee enquiries, investigations and prosecutions of corruption cases, including cases the Lokayukta takes over from any agency so long has it has not yet been heard in court.
The Lokayukta will have suo moto powers to investigate cases and powers to rope in any agency to aid in the investigations, but it will have to finish preliminary enquiry within 45 days, and a full-fledged investigation within nine months.
After that it will file a case in a special court, which will then have to pass judgement within 18 months.
Besides the CM and his Council of Ministers, MLAs, bureaucrats and heads of corporations, societies, companies or trusts that are partly funded by the state of centre can be investigated by the anti-corruption watchdog.
Some have however criticized the new law for its provision that complainants can be punished with a fine or imprisonment by the special court if a frivolous complaint led to an arrest of the accused.
The Lokayukta members can also be removed from office if the Supreme Court okays it after the Governor refers such a move.
The bill also carries with it a financial memorandum of Rs 13.90 crores to set up the Lokayukta, of which Rs 730.09 crores will be earmarked for annual salaries.

Fed on course for mid-2015 interest rate riseYou are here: Home > Collections
Federal Reserve on course for mid-2015 rate rise, job market to improve
Reuters Nov 13, 2014, 08.26PM IST
(Traders are mostly pricing…)
SAN FRANCISCO: The Federal Reserve remains poised to start raising U.S. interest rates by mid-2015, according to a Reuters poll of economists, but at a pace that's well short of what Fed officials themselves say would be appropriate.
The latest poll, conducted Nov. 7-13, showed that economists also expect the job market to continue to strengthen and inflation to trend higher.
Twenty-four of 43 economists polled by Reuters said the Fed will likely start raising short-term interest rates in June of next year.
Seven expected an earlier start, while 11 believed the first rise will come in September or later.
"If we still get softer, weaker inflation numbers, the markets are certainly going to wonder - is the Fed in position to raise rates in mid-2015 like they've been saying," said Sam Bullard, senior economist at Wells Fargo, who predicts a June 2015 rate rise.
If there is no pickup in inflation, and particularly in wages, "that's certainly going to be ammunition for Chair (Janet) Yellen and the doves there for rates to continue where they are for a little bit longer."
The Fed has kept rates near zero since December 2008, and last month reiterated a promise to keep them there for a "considerable time." But it said rates would rise sooner if the economy does better than expected, and later if it does worse.
Traders are mostly pricing in a September rate hike, with trading in fed fund futures implying they see just a 22 percent chance of it happening in June 2015.
Most comments and forecasts by Fed officials have suggested the first rate rise will come around the middle of next year.
Asked whether bond and rate markets were mis-pricing the likely series of rate hikes once the Fed begins tightening, 22 of 30 economists said 'yes,' with a large majority saying they were under-pricing that rate path.
Economists, for their part, see a shallower rate-hike trajectory than Fed officials.
The median forecast of 38 economists for the federal funds rate at the end of 2016 was 2.20 percent, compared with policymakers' median forecast of 2.88 percent. By the end of 2017, 31 economists projected a median federal funds rate of 3.30 percent; policymakers' median forecast was 3.75 percent.
Top Wall Street firms polled by Reuters last week saw a trajectory midway between that of the broader group of economists in the latest survey, and Fed policymakers [ID: nL1N0SX2HS]
The poll follows a government report that showed a decline in the U.S. jobless rate to 5.8 percent in October, lending weight to the Fed's assertion at its most recent meeting that slack in the labor market is diminishing.
Economists predicted gross domestic product growth will average 2.2 percent in 2014, rising to 3 percent in 2015 and back down to 2.8 percent in 2016.
The unemployment rate is seen dropping to an average of 5.5 percent next year and 5.3 percent in 2016, while core CPI inflation, a key concern for the Fed, is expected to rise to 1.9 percent in 2015 and 2.2 percent in 2016.
CPI often runs about half a percentage point higher than the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation, by which it measures progress toward a 2-percent target.

The Paul Ryan budget blueprint is backBy Greg Sargent November 13 Follow @theplumlinegs
For House Republicans, their guiding fiscal and economic lodestar remains — and will forever remain — the hallowed Paul Ryan budget. In its various iterations, it would repeal Obamacare, radically restructure Medicare to the detriment of beneficiaries, block-grant Medicaid , and aim most of its draconian budget cuts at programs benefiting people with lower incomes. Robert Greenstein of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has said earlier versions would result in “the largest redistribution of income from bottom to top in modern U.S. history.”
So it’s not surprising that House Republicans appear to be reading their big victory in the 2014 elections as a mandate to bring it back once again. The New York Times reports this morning that they plan to try to pass something akin to Ryan Budget 4.0, and leave it to the new GOP Senate majority to deal with it:
Next year, House Republicans will try again to transform Medicare and Medicaid repeal the Affordable Care Act, shrink domestic spending and substantially cut the highest tax rates through the budget process. Then they will leave it to the new Senate Republican majority to decide how far to press the party’s small-government vision, senior House aides said this week.
House Republican officials said the first budget blueprint of the 114th Congress will not stray far from the plans drafted by Representative Paul D. Ryan…Congressional Republicans intend to present a plan to overhaul Medicare, calling for voucherlike “premium supports” to steer people 65 and over into buying commercial health insurance, and to transform Medicaid, which would be cut and turned into block grants to state governments. 
Interestingly, though, the new Senate GOP budget chair, Jeff Sessions, is sounding a cautionary note about whether Senate Republicans will go along. As the Times notes, this poses a “test” for incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who will have to balance the demands of conservatives who want fealty to the Ryan vision with moderate Senators facing reelection who might be reluctant to go that far.
Ted Cruz has signaled he will demand that the new GOP Senate fashion itself in the image of the more confrontational, more conservative House, a reliable indicator other conservatives may demand the same. At the same time, multiple Republican Senators are up in states carried by Barack Obama, amid a presidential year electorate.
Indeed, if Republicans do claim an electoral mandate to revive the Ryan blueprint, a bit of context is in order. For one thing, while it is true that Republicans just won a big election, they lost another very big election only two years ago that was very much about the Ryan budget. Indeed, the author of the Paul Ryan blueprint — Paul Ryan — happened to find his way to the top of the ticket. And Democrats made the Ryan budget an issue in multiple Senate races they won that year.
For another, in the 2014 elections, some Republicans actually resorted to attacking Democrats from the left on entitlements, even in red states. As conservative writer Philip Klein has noted , this was actually a departure from a “limited government” vision based on the need to reform entitlements. Meanwhile, Republican post-election polling strongly suggested Obamacare — whose repeal is central to the Ryan vision — was not a major factor in the election’s outcome.
* HOW GOP WILL KEEP TARGETING OBAMACARE: David Drucker reports that Senate Republicans are moving closer to using the tactic called “reconciliation” to force simple majority votes to repeal Obamacare . But there’s a catch:
Repealing portions of Obamacare using reconciliation is only possible if 51 Senate Republicans (and 218 House Republicans) can agree on a budget resolution. Passing a budget is what makes a reconciliation vehicle possible. That means some of the GOP’s biggest budget hawks — those who often break with their colleagues and oppose spending bills as insufficiently austere — will have to support a consensus budget plan. Democrats are unlikely to help Republicans pass legislation that undermines Obamacare.
And so, any internal schisms among Republicans over spending could seep into the undying crusade to destroy Obamacare…
* OBAMA PLANS TO FIGHT, NOT FADE: Karen Tumulty and Juliet Eilperin report that the White House will not refrain from using executive action to advance Obama’s agenda , despite calls from Republicans (and some pundits) for him to respond to the elections by surrendering entirely. Key:
“We need to deliver for the folks who didn’t feel any reason to engage in the process” this year, said a senior administration official. “We have to have policy positions, or articulate our policy positions, that show to this emerging electorate — young people, Latinos, single women, that the Democratic Party is fundamentally better for them than the Republican Party. And it’s not just slightly better, it’s a lot better.”
Well, yeah, if you want your core constituencies to vote, giving them a reason to do that is a good place to start.
* CLIMATE CHANGE A KEY ISSUE IN 2016? Coral Davenport has a good piece running through the reasons the new U.S.-China deal to reduce carbon emissions could mean climate change will finally be a real issue in the next presidential election. An interesting detail:
The architect of Mr. Obama’s climate change plan is…senior counselor, John D. Podesta, who is likely to leave the White House next year to work as the chairman of Mrs. Clinton’s campaign. The climate plan that Mr. Podesta has drafted for Mr. Obama is expected to serve as a blueprint for Mrs. Clinton’s climate change policy, should she run….That…may pit Mrs. Clinton against a field of Republican candidates who question and deny the science that human activity causes global warming.
The GOP presidential primary candidates will likely pledge to overturn Obama’s executive actions on climate — which are necessary for the U.S. to meet its end of the deal with China — and oppose American participation in a global climate change treaty negotiated next year, making these differences central.
* WHY SCOTUS MIGHT GUT OBAMACARE: Rick Hasen explains how Chief Justice John Roberts could justify siding with the challenge to Obamacare on the basis of an isolated snippet of text in the law , even though Congress’ intent to provide subsidies to all 50 states is plain as day:
One argument he might make in defense of that position is that Congress has the ability to go back and fix any unclear language through a revised statute.
Roberts did something similar in striking a key provision of the Voting Right Act, arguing that Congress could update it if it chose to. If SCOTUS did void the subsidies, a tiny change to the law could fix that. Congress would come under tremendous pressure to do so. But Republicans would probably shrug.
* WHAT A SCOTUS DECISION GUTTING ACA WOULD MEAN: E.J. Dionne puts the possibility that SCOTUS will gut the law in the context of recent SCOTUS history :
Here’s a hypothetical for you: First, the Supreme Court issues a ruling that installs a conservative president. Then, he appoints two conservative Supreme Court justices who then join with three of their colleagues to make mincemeat of the greatest achievement of a progressive president elected by a clear majority. If such a thing happened in any other country, would we still call it a democratic republic?
But but but the challengers’ motivation in calling for subsidies to be struck based on a six word snippet of the ACA’s text is to preserve the “rule of law,” they tell us.
* LAST WORD ON SCOTUS AND THE ACA: Linda Greenhouse raises the possibility that four conservative justices, still steaming about the 2012 decision upholding the ACA, are trying to put the heat on Roberts . And:
In decades of court-watching, I have struggled — sometimes it has seemed against all odds — to maintain the belief that the Supreme Court really is a court and not just a collection of politicians in robes. This past week, I’ve found myself struggling against the impulse to say two words: I surrender.

The Bone Clocks debates the good lifeBy Alyssa Rosenberg November 13 Follow @AlyssaRosenberg
This post discusses the plot of David Mitchell’s “The Bone Clocks.”
I have found myself awfully resistant to the novels of David Mitchell in the past, but it seems fitting that “ The Bone Clocks ,” his new book about reincarnation and other forms of immortality, was the work that convinced me that trying Mitchell over and over again was worth it. “The Bone Clocks” has plenty in common with other Mitchell works: multiple narrators, multi-genre mimicry and the decline of civilization. And it is also a fantastical novel that uses its own wild inventions to praise the value of the everyday.
(Credit: Random House)
There are two classes of people who live forever in “The Bone Clocks,” Horologists and Anchorites. For Horologists, immortality means being reborn over and over again into the bodies of gravely ill children and healing them, retaining their accumulated memories each time. This life cycle is an involuntary condition. Anchorites, by contrast, make sacrifices to an icon of a heretical monk, who in return rewards them with Black Wine, a substance that arrests their cellular development for three months.
Both groups have to deal with mere mortals. The Horologists are born into their families. Anchorites abandon their own parents, siblings, lovers and even children, and feed on those of others. However different Horologists, Anchorites and humans are, they all have to figure out what it means to live a good life, whether that life consists of multiple passages from childhood to old age, an existence frozen at one age, or a single shot at happiness and kindness.
The life observed in most continuous detail in “The Bone Clocks” is that of the mortal Holly Sykes. Holly becomes tangled up with the Horologists and Anchorites when her younger brother Jacko becomes gravely ill and seems to be a different person when he recovers. She will learn many years later that the person who came back was actually Xi Lo, an ancient Horologist. Later, she has a relationship with Hugo Lamb, a privileged university student, who chooses to join the Anchorites rather than pursue a relationship with her. These entanglements (and a few other non-trivial details) ultimately place her at the center of a confrontation between the two kinds of immortals.
But the life she lives is just as important as her role in that conflict.
Holly is a sister to Jacko. She becomes a friend to Gwyn, who she meets when she runs away from home and takes a job picking strawberries. Gwyn’s observation, drawn from her own abusive family, that “Victims aren’t cowards. Outsiders, like, they never have a clue how brave you have to be just to carry on,” inspires Holly to become a social worker. Holly ends up a partner to Ed Brubeck and the mother to Aoife.
That relatively ordinary life proves surprisingly compelling to Horologists and Anchorites alike, despite the huge quantities of experiences they are able to assemble in their expanded lifespans.
When the Horologist Marinus, who Holly initially met as a kindly doctor when she was a child, delicately examines Holly’s brain, she is tremendously touched by what she finds there: “Memories of Holly meeting Crispin Hershey in Reykjavik, in Shanghai, on Rottnest Island. They loved each other, I see, but both only half guessed it. Holly’s first U.S. book tour for The Radio People. Holly’s office at the homeless center. Her Welsh friend and colleague Gwyn. Aoife’s face when Holly tells her that Ed died in a missile strike. Olive Sun’s voice on the phone, an hour earlier. Happier days. Watching Aoife perform in The Wizard of Oz while holding Ed’s hand in the darkness.”
And while Hugo gives up a chance at a life with Holly, Black Wine cannot wash away the memory of their fling at a ski lodge, or the very human central question that turns out to be at the center of Hugo’s life. “Did she love me too, Marinus?” Hugo asks Marinus during a pause in the hostilities between the two races of immortals. “I don’t mean after she found out about my little . . . dalliance with a paranormal cult that scarred her family and attempted to animacide her brother. I mean, that night. In Switzerland. When we were young. Properly young. When Holly and I were snowed in.”
David Mitchell being David Mitchell, plenty of other things happen in “The Bone Clocks.” There is wonderful mimicry of Oxbridge novels and high-end literary feuds. Mitchell even finds a way to use the enmity between the Horologists and Anchorites to turn out a very funny parody of identity politics and diversity initiatives.
But for all the limberness of Mitchell’s style, the strength of “The Bone Clocks” comes from Mitchell’s sense that Holly’s existence has a power that does not need to be validated by the Anchorites or the Horologists, and that in fact outlasts them.
These factions matter because of the specific pain they cause, rather than because of some sort of cartoonish destructive power. “Was there anything ‘small-scale’ about Jacko’s disappearance for the Sykes family?” Marinus wonders at one point in the novel. And Holly learns that you do not have to have mystical powers to achieve miracles. “‘Sleep tight, Gran, don’t let the bedbugs bite,’” Holly’s granddaughter Lorelai says near the end of “The Bone Clocks.” “Dad used to say that me, I used to say it to Aoife, Aoife passed it on to Lorelei, and now Lorelei says it back to me,” Holly remembers. “We live on, as long as there are people to live on in.”

Al Roker relieves himself in live stream of 34-hour #Rokerthon weather segmentBy Jason Samenow November 13 Follow @capitalweather
Al Roker (Today.com)
In a publicity stunt, The Today’s Show weatherman Al Roker is attempting to break the record for the longest televised weathercast.  The #Rokerthon, as it has been called, began at 10 p.m. last night and Roker has pledged to broadcast the weather continuously for 34 hours.
Roker cannot sleep during the broadcast, but is permitted a 5 minute bathroom break every hour.  During his first bathroom break, Roker inadvertently left his microphone on. What happens next leaves little to the imagination. Writes Today.com :
The evening’s most memorable moment came when Al took his first bathroom break — with his microphone streaming sound to viewers. Al’s take on the moment: “Live stream has a new meaning.”
The Twitter-sphere responded with hysterics.  Here’s a sprinkling of reactions:

Wizards teammates Rasual Butler and Kris Humphries dont reminisce about their Kardashian connectionBy Scott Allen November 13 Follow @ScottSAllen

Before he scored 18 points and produced a key turnover late in the Wizards’ 107-103 win over Detroit on Wednesday, the most memorable season highlight featuring Washington reserve Rasual Butler was Miami Heat rookie James Ennis’s  poster dunk on opening night.
“I just had the opportunity to get some good looks tonight, and they went down for me,” said Butler, whose point total Wednesday eclipsed the 17 points he’d scored in three other appearances this year. “We did a good job executing our plays, and I was the recipient of some good looks Coach [Randy] Wittman’s offense creates for players.”
Butler downplayed his contribution off the bench just as he downplayed his appearance on the E! reality television series “Khloe & Lamar” during an interview with The Sports Junkies on 106.7 The Fan earlier in the day. Toward the end of the interview, Junkies co-host J.P. Flaim asked Butler if he and teammate Kris Humphries ever get together and reminisce about their days being on “the Kardashian show.” (Humphries, of course, was once married to Kim Kardashian and was a regular on “Keeping Up With The Kardashians.”)
“No,” said Butler, who was a teammate of “Khloe & Lamar” co-star Lamar Odom with the Los Angeles Clippers for two seasons. “Nobody really even knows that I was on there, in that locker room.”
“So we gotta blow up your spot,” Flaim continued. “Were you on one episode?”
“No, man,” Butler pleaded. “Don’t do that. You can get your Wizards tickets on Wizards.com.”
Flaim then referenced Butler’s Wikipedia entry , which makes note of his appearance on “Khloe and Lamar” while he was dating Khloe Kardashian’s friend and former assistant, Malika Haqq.
“So you have something in common with your teammate Kris Humphries,” Flaim said.
“Ehhhhhh, I mean, that happened?” Butler said. “I don’t know.”
Yep, that happened. Here’s Butler greeting Haqq at The Lobster in Santa Monica during one episode.

Butler also made a cameo in the 2012 romantic comedy “Think Like A Man.” Sorry for blowing up your spot, Rasual.

Environmentalists can claim victory even if they lose on KeystoneBy Chris Mooney November 13 Follow chriscmooney

Va., a member of the committee, speak to reporters about the new urgency to get congressional approval for the Canada-to-Texas Keystone XL pipeline, at the Capitol in Washington. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)
For scholars of social movements, the conjoined environmental stories of this week -- the U.S. and China have struck a  historic deal  to limit greenhouse gas emissions, but Congress may  vote to approve  the Keystone XL pipeline -- perfectly fit one of their more influential theories.
You see, what may happen here is that the more politically radical climate change grassroots loses out on a symbolic issue (blocking a pipeline that will transfer dirty tar sands oil) but climate moderates win really meaty progress on cutting greenhouse gas emissions. And that aligns nicely with the theory of "radical flank effects" in social movements, as suggested in 1988 by the scholar Herbert Haines, who  argued  that in the Civil Rights Movement, a "radical flank" -- groups like the Black Panthers -- paved the way for the ultimate success of moderates, like Martin Luther King, Jr.
The Keystone XL pipeline, which would carry crude oil from Alberta to the coast of Texas, has been at the center of a very long running and multifaceted controversy. Because it crosses an international border, the  State Department must decide  whether the pipeline is in the "national interest" -- a process that has dragged on for years.
Greens have targeted the pipeline  on the grounds  the oil it would carry comes from tar sands and is very energy intensive to extract. They have therefore decided to make this a major battle in the fight to stop climate change. But environmental  reports from the State Department have generally been pretty pro-pipeline, suggesting that the pipeline won't have a big impact on greenhouse gas emissions and that other way of transporting crude from Canada would be even more environmentally detrimental.
So why have environmentalists made such a big deal out of it? As Haines put it, "radicals specialize in generating crises which elites must deal with." The Keystone issue, which came virtually out of nowhere due to environmental activism, would certainly count. It rallied climate advocates dramatically, gave them a cause, gave them energy, got them marching.
Moderates, though, "specialize in offering relatively unthreatening avenues of escape," writes Haines. They're super convenient for politicians to have around when they want to announce some major initiative while simultaneously placating their critics.
After a stalled debate in Congress, the House will take up a vote on whether to allow the controversial Keystone XL oil pipeline to be built, linking Canada to the Gulf of Mexico. (AP)
This process, of course, doesn't ever leave the radicals happy. Indeed, quite the opposite. Because they are defined by the outside world or the political opposition as being too extreme -- in the Keystone case, as being opposed to jobs and economic progress -- politicians may deem it beneficial or strategic to treat them as a kind of political sacrifice.
In 2013, I  interviewed Haines  about the Keystone battle and whether it could indirectly advance climate progress through a radical flank effect. One of the most telling things that he said is that the answer very much depends upon political momentum. "For a positive effect to happen," he explained, "what you kind of have to have is things moving in the right direction politically. So around environmentalism, it would have to be that the policy is already moving in a pro-environmentalist direction, like civil rights was, and the radicals come along and give it a boost."
It has been quite clear that momentum has been building, since President Obama's re-election, behind climate change action (partly because of the activists!). At the same time, it has also long been clear that the Keystone issue breaks, politically, in a way that much more favors the GOP than it does the environmental left. A  Pew poll  from earlier this year, for instance, shows that the public strongly supports Keystone overall, but that the issue divides those on the Democratic side. The center, though, is quite pro-Keystone: Independents favor its construction by 61 percent to 29 percent.
A mainstream U.S. politician, looking at polling like this, would generally see Keystone as a liability. Yet it is clear that the Obama administration has been hesitant to approve Keystone -- it cares what the base thinks, and it cares about climate change. Now, though, with the shift in Congress, the political context changes and Keystone may, simply, have too many supporters. (Although there are still hints that President Obama may veto  a Keystone bill.)
So if all of this goes down as it very well might -- Obama lands a gigantically significant climate deal with China, but Congress overwhelmingly supports Keystone and the president feels he cannot fight that consensus -- you are going to see all kinds of pundits slamming greens and talking about how Keystone was always a political loser. But that would be precisely the wrong conclusion to draw.
The real truth would be that greens have won -- just not in the way they wanted or expected. But then, activists rarely get to choose precisely how it is that their actions make the world a better place.

Sunanda Pushkar death: Police may sent viscera samples abroad fortestingPrint
The AIIMS medical board had confirmed poisoning as the reason behind her death but did not mention the type of poison that caused her death.
By: Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: November 13, 2014 8:47 pm | Updated: November 14, 2014 7:55 am
Delhi Police are considering sending viscera samples of former union minister Shashi Tharoor’s wife Sunanda Pushkar, who was found dead in a hotel here in January, to forensic laboratories abroad to determine the type of poison that is suspected to have caused her death.
The AIIMS medical board had, in its second report submitted to police recently, confirmed poisoning as the reason behind her death but did not mention the type of poison that caused her death.
They had listed some kind of poisons most of which were radioactive isotopes that cannot be detected by labs in India.
According to a senior police official, police are now mulling sending the viscera samples to a UK-based laboratory which has facilities to test all kinds of poisons.
“With this almost clear that Sunanda died of poisoning, the biggest question which remains in the case is that the kind of poison (used) and how it reached her body. If these question can be answered, the case could head to its logical end,” the official said on condition of anonymity.
As of now, the police have asked the AIIMS panel of doctors to redo their investigation and name the poison which caused Sunanda’s death but if it fails to do so, the samples will then be sent abroad.
The three mobile phones and a laptop of the deceased have already been sent to a forensic laboratory in Gandhinagar, Gujarat, for investigations to check whether anything was deleted from the gadgets post her death.
Today too, police questioned some people who were related to the case but senior officials refused to divulge the identities of these people and what they told police.
The AIIMS panel of doctors had earlier said the police had not shared with it the photographs of scene of occurrence, statements and circumstantial evidences with them.
Police had not quizzed a single person in the last nine months nor did it try to inspect the ‘crime’ scene.
As the police try to reinvestigate the case from scratch, there are two possibilities in the case, first is that the police register a fresh FIR in the case and second it closes investigations stating that no foul play was found.
It was only after the AIIMS report that the police got suite number 345 of Leela Palace Hotel, where Pushkar was found dead, opened.
Police had also called upon the AIIMS doctors and experts from FSL to inspect the room during which fluid marks were found on Sunanda’s bed sheet, the carpet and a broken glass in the room. These articles have also been sent to forensic labs for examination.
The suite of the five star hotel, had remained sealed and was opened for the first time since the incident.

Cabinet Secretary Ajit Kumar Seth to soon call meeting on ease of doing business
PTI Nov 13, 2014, 08.41PM IST
("I propose to convene a meeting…)
NEW DELHI: A meeting of senior government officials will be held soon to firm up steps for improving ease of doing business in the country, Cabinet Secretary Ajit Kumar Seth said today.
"I propose to convene a meeting shortly, may be in the next 10-12 days, on ease of doing business. How to improve this," he said here at the 'Services Conclave' organised by the Commerce Ministry and CII.
India has been ranked 142 among the 189 countries in the latest report of the World Bank, falling two places from last year's ranking.
The Commerce and Industry Ministry is taking steps in order to improve the ease of doing business.
In September, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said that India's ranking could be improved to the 50th position by making regulations easier among other steps.
On services sector, Seth said that there is a need to focus on standard issues of the sector to make it more competitive in the global market.
"Growth in services sector compliments growth in the manufacturing sector...there is a huge potential to be tapped in the sector. It contributes about 60 per cent in the GDP," he said.
He said the government would look into the recommendations made by the industry experts to enhance services exports.
"Standards and certification of services are important. We need a culture of standards...all this reform requires high level of coordination. We are trying to make this coordination more effective," he added.
Speaking on the occasion, Commerce Secretary Rajeev Kher also stressed on the need for the industry to give special focus on quality of services.
"There is a huge basket of services which India can deliver," he said, adding "what held us back are reforms. We are not able to pluck the low hanging fruits".
In 2013-14, services exports stood at USD 151 billion.

Too early to call Wal-Mart turnaround
An Obama veto of Keystone XL risks irritating plenty of peopleBy Aaron Blake November 13 Follow @aaronblakewp

President Obama is fond of telling Congress that it should pass things with the overwhelming support of the American people, including (among other things) comprehensive immigration reform, increasing the minimum wage, and increasing gun background checks.
And yet, Obama could soon be in a position of  vetoing something with a similar amount of support: the Keystone XL pipeline.
Poll after poll has shown support for Keystone is somewhere between very strong and overwhelming. A Pew Research Center survey this month showed support for the project at nearly two-to-one, 59 percent to 31 percent . And that was about the lowest level of support we've seen to date. Support has registered as high as two-thirds of Americans.
And as another recent Pew poll showed, it's not just Republicans and independents driving support for the project. In fact, basically the only group that opposes it is the most liberal of Democrats .
According to Pew's breakdown from June, three of the four Democratic-leaning groups -- including religious Democrats, young Democrats and the most moderate Democratic leaners -- all supported the project two-to-one.
Which is a long way of saying that Obama would likely have very few supporters were he to wield his veto pen, as the White House suggests he will following votes by the House and Senate -- which by all indications will approve the bill.
The White House, if it does veto the bill, will apparently argue that it can't approve it before the lengthy State Department review of the project's environmental impact is complete -- along with a Supreme Court case in Nebraska concerning a key part of the pipeline's route. That's fine, but it still remains that a strong majority of Americans are pretty keen on getting the pipeline done.
The question from there is how strongly Americans feel. On issues like the raising the minimum wage and increasing background checks, support is overwhelming but soft, and the opposition is often louder than the proponents, despite being a small minority. Which means there is little outcry when Congress doesn't comply with public opinion.
On Keystone, a March Washington Post-ABC News poll showed 62 percent of American believed "strongly" that the project would create a significant number of jobs -- though we would note that the vast majority of the jobs would be temporary -- while just 28 percent "strongly" believed that it would pose significant risks to the environment.
The first thing to know about the Keystone pipeline? It already exists. Here's a breakdown of the pipeline's various parts. (Gillian Brockell, Jhaan Elker and Kate M. Tobey/The Washington Post)
Obama has only vetoed two pieces of legislation so far in his presidency. Such is the benefit of controlling one of chambers of Congress (the Senate) for all six years.
Republicans hope having control of both chambers will mean, rather than the Senate effectively vetoing bills from the GOP-controlled House by not voting on them, they will be able to put the decision in Obama's hands, at which point public pressure on something like Keystone could be brought to bear.
And it looks like Obama will quickly be forced into making one of his toughest veto decisions -- at least when it comes to the court of public opinion.

Travelers share ideas on how to drive  walk  bike safelyBy Robert Thomson November 13 Follow @RT_Thomson
In my column for The Washington Post’s Local Living section , I wrote about this month’s Street Smart campaign , and invited travelers — all travelers, whether they drive, walk, take transit or bike — to submit safety messages they would like to share with the people they encounter.
Common sense rules are too often ignored. (Robert Thomson — The Washington Post)
Sometimes, a request like this opens the gates on pent-up rage stemming from anonymous confrontations in traffic. A common closing line is, “Thank you for letting me vent!” In this case, I’ve already gotten some well-reasoned notes that would help keep us all safe. Here’s one of those.
Dear Dr. Gridlock:
I walk, bike and drive to get to work and around my neighborhood, and reading your column this morning brings to mind a few changes-in-habit that could help make the cyclist/pedestrian/driver relationship more harmonious.
Driving. When making a right–on-red, after checking left for cars we must always be sure to check back on the right for pedestrians. We don’t always realize how much time has elapsed while we were checking left. Also, if the weather is rainy or super cold, let’s give the pedestrian/cyclist a break – we are in an enclosed comfortable situation while they are not.
Cycling. We always need to state clearly “Passing on your left/right” well before we are along side the pedestrian so they have enough time to move in the other direction. We need to say it every time regardless of whether we feel like it or we judge that the individual looks like they need it. Also, investing in a “step-through” bike is a great enhancement for riding in busy areas. It makes it much easier to hop on and off the bike for crossing streets or yielding to pedestrians where the area is narrow. Sometimes we just need to walk the bike for a few yards to make the whole walker/biker/driver mix a lot safer.
Walking. Let’s always remember to look both ways when crossing the street and put away our phones.
– Sarah Gilligan, Bethesda
I’d like to highlight that first point about looking where we are about to turn. That was echoed by several other letter writers, and failing to look is an all-too-common behavior at intersections. Gilligan is making an even more specific point: It’s not enough to stop, look right, look left, then hit the gas. When we concentrate on traffic approaching from the left, we may lose track of how many seconds have passed since the rightward glance. Often, it’s plenty of time for someone to have stepped out into the intersection.
Add your thoughts on how we should behave in traffic. I’ll be doing a column that includes many of your ideas.

Major U.S. City Will Raise Minimum Wage To $15Winner: Karl Rove
After the 2012 elections didn't quite go the way the GOP wanted it, Republicans responded by impaneling a team of experts to divine what hard lessons needed to be learn, and come up with a long-term strategy to get back on the winning side. That effort yielded the 100-page "Growth And Opportunity Project" report (more colloquially known as the "RNC Autopsy"). Progress on this venture has been decidedly mixed , at best.
Elsewhere, however, key GOP figures were contemplating a short-term solution, focused on the 2014 midterms. Chief among them was former Bush adviser and Fox News contributor Karl Rove. His vision: the Conservative Victory Project . Its goal: No more Todd Akins! Rove attributed key GOP losses to the fact that too many undisciplined candidates were making it through party primaries and into general elections against Democratic candidates that more seasoned, established GOP candidates could beat.
In an interesting coincidence of timing, Rove's project launched around the same time that Iowa's Democratic senator, Tom Harkin, announced he would be retiring. Subsequently, one of the first people to end up in the crosshairs of Rove's new organization was U.S. Rep. Steve King of Iowa. As The New York Times reported at the time :
Representative Steve King, a six-term Iowa Republican, could be among the earliest targets of the Conservative Victory Project. He said he had not decided whether he would run for the Senate, but the leaders of the project in Washington are not waiting to try to steer him away from the race.
The group’s plans, which were outlined for the first time last week in an interview with [American Crossroads president Steven J.] Law, call for hard-edge campaign tactics, including television advertising, against candidates whom party leaders see as unelectable and a drag on the efforts to win the Senate. Mr. Law cited Iowa as an example and said Republicans could no longer be squeamish about intervening in primary fights.
“We’re concerned about Steve King’s Todd Akin problem,” Mr. Law said. “This is an example of candidate discipline and how it would play in a general election. All of the things he’s said are going to be hung around his neck.”
Iowa ended up with Iowa state Sen. Joni Ernst as their standardbearer in that Senate race, and while she's pushed the envelope in the wrong direction at times, she's more or less proved to be a manageable candidate. (Though it arguably helped Ernst that the media, by and large, chose to give her multiple passes.) Over in Colorado, Rove got the sort of candidate he prefers in U.S. Rep. Cory Gardner -- again, a manageable alternative to Ken Buck . Throughout the primary season, Republicans avoided elevating the types of candidates -- your Todd Akins, Sharron Angles, and Richard Mourdocks -- that had previously sunk ambitions.
Tuesday, in the critical Colorado and Iowa races, Gardner and Ernst both prevailed, beating established Democratic candidates thought to have superior ground operations. The GOP may still need to revisit that "RNC autopsy." But in the short term, what Karl Rove wanted to get, he got.

I think if there was a big one, I would just climb out the window and slide down the outside, just in case.  That seems like a pretty solid plan.

Target Is Closing As Many Stores As It Opened Last Yearreddit
Target might have Alex , but the teen heartthrob isn't enough to save some of the company's stores from getting the ax.
The retail giant said Tuesday that it plans to shutter 11 underperforming stores by next February, about six months after it closed eight other locations. That brings the total number of closures to 19 this year -- as many locations as the company opened last year, according to its annual report .
“The decision to close a Target store is only made after careful consideration of the long-term financial performance of a particular location,” the company said in a statement . “All eligible store team members are being offered the option to transfer to other Target stores.”
Employees who choose not to transfer will receive severance payments, the statement said. The stores, closing by Feb. 1, 2015, include locations scattered throughout the South and Midwest. Evan Lapiska, a Target spokesman, said each store currently employs roughly 100 workers.
Target has struggled over the past year in the wake of a massive breach of customer data, which cost its chief executive his job. The company is also facing trouble as big-box retailers lose ground with shoppers to smaller stores and e-commerce sites.
In response, Target began testing smaller , urban express stores and beefed up its digital team in July. In this case, the company appears to be trimming fat as part of its turnaround strategy.
Here’s a full list of stores closing:

Little-known panel set to approve key fracking rules0
Current and former committee members say they can't recall the last time the committee prevented rules from moving forward, because that would require opposition from "an extraordinary majority," eight of the 12 members.
The public won't get a glimpse of the final fracking regulations until they are published in the Illinois Register. That might not happen until Nov. 15, the deadline for the state to finalize the rules.
Once the rules move forward, the permitting process can begin.
Oil and gas drillers may apply for a permit to begin operations 30 days after registration by paying a nonrefundable fee of $13,500. The permit application must disclose how and where the well will be drilled, the amount of fluid to be used and at what pressure it will be injected into the well. Drillers also will have to disclose what chemicals will be used at what concentration and plans for everything from well safety to waste containment.
Within five days of receipt, the Department of Natural Resources must post a copy of the permit application on its website and provide dates for the public to comment. The department has 60 days to approve or reject applications.
People in the southern part of the state have been pushing for fracking because they believe it will bring tax dollars to counties, create jobs and bring money to cash-strapped landowners.
In fact, landowners recently filed suit against Director Marc Miller of the state Department of Natural Resources and Gov. Pat Quinn in Wayne County Circuit Court, saying the state's delay in issuing fracking permits is akin to an illegal land grab.
The road to finish the fracking rules has been long and tortured.
First, while the law was being debated in Spring 2013, anti-fracking activists took over the governor's office. Josh Fox, the filmmaker behind two anti-fracking films, arrived in Springfield as the law was being passed to demand that his testimony be heard.
After the law passed and the Department of Natural Resources submitted its first proposed draft rules a year ago, environmentalists were outraged. Hundreds packed hearings; some 30,000 comments were filed about the rules, many of them critical.
Afterward, the Department of Natural Resources submitted a second draft of proposed rules, which oil and gas companies said were so restrictive that they doubted companies would go forward with fracking.
"Our hope is that (the rules committee) rolled back on some of the changes made on the second draft that we think went above and beyond the statute," said Mark Denzler, vice president of the Illinois Manufacturers' Association and spokesman for a broad coalition of businesses that support fracking.
"Their mode is questioning," Denzler said of the committee's role. "They push, they prod, they poke."
The committee is made up of some of the most powerful veterans in the legislature. Its most famous former member is President Barack Obama. It has dealt with some of the state's most controversial issues, including medical marijuana. But their role isn't to dole out policy.
Those who participated in the committee's behind-the-scenes fracking meetings say the issue is one of the most difficult its staff has encountered, because fracking is so controversial and regulations that call for everything from how waste water is stored to safety issues involve technical language.
"This is one of the few high-profile cases they've seen," said Charles Wheeler III, director of the public affairs reporting program at the University of Illinois at Springfield.
Wheeler, who previously reported about state government, said he's nearly certain that in his 24-year career at the Chicago Sun-Times he didn't write a single story about the committee.

Leaked Documents Expose Major Corporations  Secret Tax SchemesLeaked Docs Expose More Than 340 Companies' Tax Schemes In Luxembourg
ICIJ  | By                                                                Leslie Wayne, Kelly Carr, Marina Walker Guevara, Mar Cabra and Michael Hudson

This article was reported by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, a Washington DC-based global network of 185 reporters in 65 countries who collaborate on transnational investigations.
Pepsi, IKEA, FedEx and 340 other international companies have secured secret deals from Luxembourg, allowing many of them to slash their global tax bills while maintaining little presence in the tiny Central European duchy, leaked documents show.
These companies appear to have channeled hundreds of billions of dollars through Luxembourg and saved billions of dollars in taxes, according to a review of nearly 28,000 pages of confidential documents conducted by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and a team of more than 80 journalists from 26 countries.
Big companies can book big tax savings by creating complicated accounting and legal structures that move profits to low-tax Luxembourg from higher-tax countries where they’re headquartered or do lots of business. In some instances, the leaked records indicate, companies have enjoyed effective tax rates of less than 1 percent on the profits they’ve shuffled into Luxembourg.
The leaked documents reviewed by ICIJ journalists include hundreds of private tax rulings – sometimes known as “comfort letters” – that Luxembourg provides to corporations seeking favorable tax treatment.
The European Union and Luxembourg have been fighting for months over Luxembourg’s reluctance to turn over information about its tax rulings to the EU, which is investigating whether the country’s tax deals with Amazon and Fiat Finance violate European law. Luxembourg officials have supplied some information to the EU but have refused, EU officials say, to provide a larger set of documents relating to its tax rulings.
Today ICIJ and its media partners are releasing a large cache of Luxembourg tax rulings – 548 comfort letters issued from 2002 to 2010 – at www.icij.org and reporting on their contents in stories that will be published or broadcast in dozens of countries. It’s unclear whether any of these documents are among those still being sought by EU investigators, but they are the kinds of documents that go to the heart of the EU’s investigation into Luxembourg’s tax rulings.
The leaked documents reviewed by ICIJ involve deals negotiated by PricewaterhouseCoopers, one of the world’s largest accounting firms, on behalf of hundreds of corporate clients. To qualify the companies for tax relief, the records show, PwC tax advisers helped come up with financial strategies that feature loans among sister companies and other moves designed to shift profits from one part of a corporation to another to reduce or eliminate taxable income.
The records show, for example, that Memphis-based FedEx Corp. set up two Luxembourg affiliates to shuffle earnings from its Mexican, French and Brazilian operations to FedEx affiliates in Hong Kong. Profits moved from Mexico to Luxembourg largely as tax-free dividends. Luxembourg agreed to tax only one quarter of 1 percent of FedEx’s non-dividend income flowing through this arrangement – leaving the remaining 99.75 percent tax-free.
“A Luxembourg structure is a way of stripping income from whatever country it comes from,’’ said Stephen E. Shay, a professor of international taxation at Harvard Law School and a former tax official in the U.S. Treasury Department. The Grand Duchy, he said, “combines enormous flexibility to set up tax reduction schemes, along with binding tax rulings that are unique. It’s like a magical fairyland.”
FedEx declined comment on the specifics of its Luxembourg tax arrangements. Other companies seeking tax deals from Luxembourg come from private equity, real estate, banking, manufacturing, pharmaceuticals and other industries, the leaked files show. They include Accenture, Abbott Laboratories, American International Group (AIG), Amazon, Blackstone, Deutsche Bank, the Coach handbag empire, H.J. Heinz, JP Morgan Chase, Burberry, Procter & Gamble, the Carlyle Group and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority.
For their part, Luxembourg’s officials and defenders say the landlocked nation’s system of private tax agreements is above reproach.
“No way are these sweetheart deals,” Nicolas Mackel, chief executive of Luxembourg for Finance, a quasi-governmental agency, said in an interview with ICIJ.
“The Luxembourg system of taxation is competitive – there is nothing unfair or unethical about it,” Mackel said. “If companies manage to reduce their tax bills to a very low rate, that’s a problem not of one tax system but of the interaction of many tax systems.”
Less than 1 percent
Disclosure of the leaked documents comes at a sensitive time for Luxembourg, a nation with a population of less than 550,000. Amid the EU probe of Luxembourg’s tax deals, former Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker is in his first week in office as president of the European Commission, one of the most powerful positions in the EU.
Juncker, Luxembourg’s top leader when many of the jurisdiction’s tax breaks were crafted, has promised to crack down on tax dodging in his new post, but he has also said he believes his own country’s tax regime is in “full accordance” with European law. Under Luxembourg’s system, tax advisers from PwC and other firms can present proposals for corporate structures and transactions designed to create tax savings and then get written assurance that their plan will be viewed favorably by the duchy’s Ministry of Finance.
“It’s like taking your tax plan to the government and getting it blessed ahead of time,” Richard D. Pomp, a tax law professor at the University of Connecticut School of Law, said. “And most are blessed. Luxembourg has a very user-friendly tax department.”
The private deals are legal in Luxembourg but may be subject to legal challenge outside the country if tax officials in other nations view them as improper.
Luxembourg’s Ministry of Finance said in a statement that “advance tax decisions” are “well established in many EU member states, such as Germany, France, the Netherlands, the U.K., and Luxembourg” and that they don’t conflict with European law as long as “all taxpayers in a similar situation are treated equally.”
PwC said ICIJ’s reporting is based on “outdated” and “stolen” information, “the theft of which is in the hands of the relevant authorities.” It said its tax advice and assistance are “given in accordance with applicable local, European and international tax laws and agreements and is guided by a PwC Global Tax Code of Conduct.”
In its statement PwC said media do not have “a complete understanding of the structures involved.” While the company can’t comment on specific client matters, it rejects “any suggestion that there is anything improper about the firm’s work.”
ICIJ and its media partners used corporate balance sheets, regulatory filings and court records to put the leaked tax rulings in context. News organizations that have worked together on the six-month investigation include The Guardian, Süddeutsche Zeitung and NDR/WDR in Germany, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, Le Monde, Japan’s Asahi Shimbun, CNBC, Denmark’s Politiken, Brazil’s Folha de S. Paulo and others.
U.S. and U.K. companies appeared more frequently in the leaked files than companies from any other country, followed by firms from Germany, Netherlands and Switzerland. Most of the rulings in the stash of documents were approved between 2008 and 2010. Some of them were first reported on in 2012 by Edouard Perrin for France 2 public television and by the BBC, but most of the PwC documents have never before been analyzed by reporters.
The files do not include tax deals sought from Luxembourg authorities through other accounting firms. And many of the documents do not include explicit figures for how much money the companies expected to shift through Luxembourg.
Experts who’ve reviewed the files for ICIJ say the documents do make it clear, though, that the companies and their advisors at PwC engaged in aggressive tax-reduction strategies, using Luxembourg in combination with other tax havens such as Gibraltar, Delaware and Ireland.
The documents show that:
The Pepsi Bottling Group Inc., a New York-based unit of PepsiCo, used subsidiaries in Luxembourg to arrange a series of loans among sister companies that allowed the bottler to reduce its tax rate on its $1.4 billion purchase of a controlling interest in JSC Lebedyansky, Russia’s largest juice maker. At least $750 million of the money involved in the Russian deal traveled through a Luxembourg subsidiary named Tanglewood, before landing in a Pepsi subsidiary in Bermuda. Luxembourg acted as a tax-reducing conduit as the profits moved from Russia to Bermuda.
New York-based Coach Inc. set up two Luxembourg entities to move €250 million in Hong Kong earnings in 2011, an amount it expected to approach €1 billion by 2013. One Luxembourg entity acted as an internal corporate bank, allowing much of the luxury goods maker’s Asian operating earnings to glide through a series of foreign entities in the form of interest payments on money the company loaned itself. Filings in Luxembourg showed that in 2012, the company paid €250,000 in taxes on €36.7 million in earnings channeled into Luxembourg – a rate of well under 1 percent.
IKEA has used Luxembourg as part of a tax-savings strategy almost as complicated as the retail chain’s ready-to-assemble furniture. IKEA operates through two independent groups of companies: IKEA Group, which controls most of the 364 iconic IKEA big-box stores and Inter IKEA Group, which oversees franchise operations. Inter IKEA’s structure includes a Luxembourg holding company, a Luxembourg finance company, a Liechtenstein foundation and a Swiss finance arm. Leaked documents show IKEA’s Luxembourg operations opened the Swiss subsidiary in 2009 to outsource part of their financing operations to yet another low-tax jurisdiction, allowing the company to save taxes both in Luxembourg and in Switzerland.
Belgium’s richest family, the billionaire de Spoelberch dynasty, obtained a private tax ruling from Luxembourg in 2008. The de Spoelberch clan, part of the country’s old nobility and close to the royal family, holds a big stake in ABInbev, the world’s biggest brewer whose labels include Budweiser, Stella Artois, Corona and Beck’s. The records indicate the de Spoelberch’s routed €2 billion through Ireland and then Luxembourg, reducing taxes with each step. The only sign of Luxembourg companies controlled by the family appears to be a small letter box at an address that lists nearly 190 other companies.
Even the Canadian government got a private Luxembourg tax ruling. In 2008, the Public Sector Pension Investment Board, which manages pensions for all Canadian federal employees, including the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, bought real estate in Berlin. The pension board set up Luxembourg companies that helped it sidestep German land transfer taxes. A complex internal loan structure allowed the board to pay minimal taxes in Luxembourg on income from the German properties. The investment board has a Luxembourg office – a place where desks can be rented by the month and where two employees watch over600 million in European investments.
The Canadian pension board and Inter IKEA both said their tax planning complies with all laws and regulations.  The Canadian fund argues that because it has tax-exempt status in Canada, it ultimately gained “no tax advantage” by routing investments through Luxembourg. Inter IKEA said its total effective corporate income tax rate is currently around 14 percent.
Pepsi, Coach and an accountant for the de Spoelberch family’s Luxembourg holdings declined to comment on the specifics of their tax arrangements.
“This is the first time really that we’ve seen inside the workings of Luxembourg as a tax haven,” said Richard Brooks, a former U.K. tax inspector and author of the book The Great Tax Robbery, who was hired by ICIJ to help review some of the leaked documents. “The countries . . . that are losing money, they don't know about it, don’t know how it operates at all.”
Gilded Age
Last month, in the Gilded Age splendor of New York’s private Metropolitan Club, Pierre Gramegna, Luxembourg’s minister of finance, tried to woo the Wall Street crowd with some premier cru wine and a little levity. He told assembled financiers that he wanted to dispel the myth that his tiny country is nothing more than a tax haven:  “Luxembourg is not an offshore place. I say it loud and clear.”
What he got back was hearty round of laughter.
In the wake of the EU’s probe of its tax practices, Luxembourg officials continue to bristle at their nation’s tax haven label. The country, a founding member of the EU, boasts of being a multi-lingual nation in the heart of Europe with a business-friendly and stable government. Once primarily a steel-maker and manufacturer, Luxembourg has transitioned into a financial center rivaling London, New York or Hong Kong. With $3.7 trillion in assets under management by banks and other institutions, Luxembourg is second only to the U.S. as a global investment center.
More than 170 of the Fortune 500 companies have a Luxembourg branch, according to Citizens for Tax Justice, a nonprofit research and advocacy group. A total of $95 billion in profits from American corporations’ overseas operations flowed through Luxembourg in 2012, the most current statistics from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis show. On those profits, corporations paid $1.04 billion in taxes to Luxembourg – just 1.1 percent.
Other tax havens, Ireland for example, openly advertise rock-bottom corporate tax rates of 12.5 percent. Luxembourg instead maintains a statutory tax rate of 29 percent, but the leaked files show that the duchy has routinely approved tax rulings that whittle down what counts as taxable income to practically nothing. This can drop Luxembourg’s effective tax rate deep into single digits.
Less than 30 percent of the tax deals in the leaked documents include a specific figure for the amount of money that companies said they planned to “invest” through the Luxembourg agreements. The total for those deals was roughly $215 billion between 2002 and 2010. The figure would likely grow to several hundred billion dollars if projected investments in other deals in the leaked PwC documents were included. And the overall figure for money shuffled through Luxembourg as the result of confidential tax agreements would grow even larger if tax deals arranged through other accounting firms were included.
PwC’s letters seeking special tax rulings were usually 20 to 100 pages long. They detail various financial strategies and then specify the tax treatment the accountants expect to get for their clients – suggesting, for example, that dividends be treated as tax-free interest.
The leaked tax rulings indicate that negotiations were conducted in private meetings between PwC accountants and Luxembourg tax officials. PwC’s written proposals were often approved the same day they were submitted.
The deals can be so complex that PwC accountants frequently include “before” and “after” diagrams to illustrate how money flows from subsidiary to subsidiary and across different countries and tax havens. The leaked records show that Luxembourg’s 2009 tax deal for Illinois-based Abbott Laboratories – which makes arthritis drugs and Ensure meal replacement shakes – features 79 steps including companies in Cyprus and Gibraltar. Abbott projected it would invest as much as $50 billion via Luxembourg.
A spokesperson for Abbott declined comment.
In a 2009 presentation, PwC highlights Luxembourg as a place with “flexible and welcoming authorities” who are “easily contactable” and offer a “readiness for dialogue and quick decision-making process.”
Most of the leaked tax rulings were approved and signed by the same tax official, Marius Kohl, now retired. Sometimes known in tax circles as “Monsieur Ruling,” Kohl was described by one Belgian newspaper as “the guardian of the only door through which companies can enter the fiscal paradise of Luxembourg.” During his time as head of a Luxembourg agency called Sociétés 6, Kohl oversaw the approval of thousands of tax agreements, personally signing as many as 39 in the course of a single day. The Wall Street Journal has reported that since Kohl retired in 2013, it can take up to six months for a tax ruling to be approved.
A woman who answered the phone at Kohl’s home told an ICIJ reporter that he wasn’t interested in talking. In a recent interview with The Wall Street Journal, Kohl said: “The work I did definitely benefited the country, though maybe not in terms of reputation.”
When a Journal reporter asked whether the prices that companies’ Luxembourg affiliates charged sister companies outside the country for the use of intellectual property and other services were accurate, Kohl licked his thumb and held it in the air.
“There was no way to verify it,” he said.
Financial Power
Luxembourg’s economy benefits from a growing cadre of lawyers, accountants, and financiers who are hired to appear before the tax authorities. PwC, for example, said in 2013 that it had more than 2,300 employees in Luxembourg and that it expected to add another 600 in 2014.
Sprawling office parks of high-rise towers, not unlike those outside of Dallas or in northern Virginia, bustle with energy. Construction cranes dot the skyline. The International Monetary Fund reports that Luxembourg has the planet’s highest economic output per capita – $112,473 per person in 2013, more than double the United States ($53,001), France ($44,099) and the United Kingdom ($39,372).
“Luxembourg is not what people think it is when you think of a tax haven,’’ Mackel, CEO of Luxembourg for Finance, said. “We make steel and car components and have a logistics industry. Our financial center is diverse with first class funds, insurance, corporate finance and Europe’s leading stock exchange. Luxembourg is about much more than this one issue they try to make of it.’’
Still, Luxembourg has many ways to cut tax bills not always seen elsewhere. For example, some 80 percent of royalties on earnings from intellectual property – software copyrights, patents and trademarks, for instance – are exempt from taxes.
Corporations that have established toeholds in Luxembourg have made use of financial instruments that shift money around the map to play one country’s tax rules against another. This might be, for instance, a hybrid debt instrument that allows profits to move out of a high-tax EU country to a Luxembourg entity. The profits are treated as interest payments in Luxembourg, where they can be deducted from taxes. In the parent company's country, they can be treated as dividends and eligible for a tax exemption.
The EU recently banned the use of hybrid loans that exploit tax mismatches between country tax systems for companies headquartered in Europe. Luxembourg and other EU members have until the end of 2015 to enact the ban into law within their own borders.
As in many tax havens, a Luxembourg office can be just a mailbox. Office buildings throughout the city are filled with brand-name corporate nameplates and little else. Some have offices and no visible employees. One building at 5 Rue Guillaume Kroll is home to more than 1,600 companies; another at 2 Avenue Charles de Gaulle houses roughly 1,450; and a building at 46A Avenue J.F. Kennedy is home to at least 1,300, according to an ICIJ analysis of Luxembourg’s corporate registry.
These companies can represent big bucks. From the U.S. alone, direct investment into Luxembourg in 2013 was $416 billion, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. Of that, the vast majority, $343 billion, was in the form of holding companies, which are vehicles to hold securities and financial assets rather than to create local jobs. In fact, Luxembourg represents a tiny fraction of 1 percent – 0.13 percent in 2010 – of all overseas jobs with American companies, indicating it is a place that houses money more than it provides employment.
In 2011 Luxembourg passed new rules requiring that Luxembourg-based companies that serve as internal banks for larger corporate structures station a majority of their managers and board members in the Grand Duchy. It’s unclear how these rules are enforced and the Ministry of Finance did not respond to ICIJ’s questions about mailbox companies in Luxembourg.
EU probe
Luxembourg’s freewheeling ways are gaining it few friends in nearby Brussels, the EU’s headquarters.
The European Commission, the administrative arm of the EU, is investigating whether Luxembourg’s tax rulings for Amazon and Fiat Finance constitute illegal state aid, violating rules that bar EU members from offering deals to one company that are not available to all.
“In the current context of tight public budgets, it is particularly important that large multinationals pay their fair share of taxes,” Joaquín Almunia, the commission’s vice president for competition policy until last week, said earlier this year in announcing EU probes into tax practices in Ireland, The Netherlands and Luxembourg.
Reuters reported in 2012 that Amazon’s Luxembourg arrangements allowed it to have an average tax rate of 5.3 percent on overseas income from 2007 to 2011. Amazon company filings show that in 2013 the on-line merchant reported revenues of $20 billion from its European operations, which are channeled primarily through Luxembourg.
The commission’s Amazon probe focuses on one of the online retailer’s key companies in Luxembourg, Amazon EU S.à.r.l., which handles services to Amazon’s European customers.
The commission argues that a generous 2003 tax ruling by Luxembourg authorities allows Amazon EU S.à.r.l. to funnel millions of euros in tax-deductible royalties each year to yet another Amazon company in Luxembourg, a limited partnership that is tax exempted. This tax break and others like it allow Amazon to pay little in taxes in the Grand Duchy on its European sales.
The leaked PwC documents show that in 2009 Amazon EU S.à.r.l. reported more than €519 million in royalty expenses while the limited partnership Amazon Europe Holding Technologies SCS had an influx of the same amount “based on agreements with affiliated companies.” Thanks to the royalty expenses and other deductions, Amazon EU S.à.r.l. posted a taxable profit of just €14.8 million and paid €4.1 million in taxes in Luxembourg.
Amazon did not respond to ICIJ’s requests for comment.
As EU authorities are pushing their corporate tax probes, a leading multinational group, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, has proposed a new set of rules that would bar companies from using many common practices to shift profits into tax havens. Approval of the OECD’s proposals, however, is uncertain and years away.
Gramegna, Luxembourg’s finance minister, said in an interview with ICIJ in New York that “the European Commission is entitled, by treaty, to look after fair competition and at state aid. They decided to look into Amazon. We are telling the European Commission that everything we’ve done has been within the general principles of the European Union and the OECD.”
Adding a political twist to the Brussels probes is Juncker’s rise to the presidency of the European Commission. As Luxembourg’s prime minister, he signed into law the provision that allows companies to write off 80 percent of royalty income from intellectual property.
In a speech in July in Brussels, Juncker promised to “fight tax evasion and tax dumping. … We will try to put some morality, some ethics, into the European tax landscape.” But he also recently told German television : “No one has ever been able to make a convincing and thorough case to me that Luxembourg is a tax haven. Luxembourg employs tax rules that are in full accordance with European law.”
At a press conference two weeks ago, Juncker promised he wouldn’t try to influence regulatory cases involving Luxembourg: “I won't abuse my position in order to pressure commissioners to make different decisions regarding Luxembourg than they would regarding similar cases.”
Many observers are skeptical Luxembourg and its allies will give up the country’s flexible tax regime without a battle.
Jürgen Kentenich, chief tax fraud investigator in the German city of Trier, which lies near the border with Luxembourg, worries that big companies and their accountants will keep finding ways to take advantage of the deals offered by Luxembourg and other financial havens, while smaller companies and average taxpayers are left to make up the what’s lost in tax revenues.
“It’s always the same story,” he said in an interview with ICIJ’s partner, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. Accounting firms are always coming up with fresh ways to cut tax bills “and lawmakers and tax authorities are always behind, always chasing.”

Doritos-Flavored Mountain Dew Is Real  PepsiCo Confirmsreddit
PepsiCo Inc. is concocting a version of its Mountain Dew soda flavored to taste like cheesy Doritos chips, the company stated Friday.
The soda and snack giant said it tested the new flavor, dubbed “Dewitos,” on college students. The company did not reveal which colleges participated in the test, but at least one Reddit user, who goes by the username joes_nipples , posted a photo of the taste test on Friday, saying the soda did, in fact, taste like Doritos.
“We are always testing out new flavors of Mountain Dew, and giving our fans a voice in helping decide on the next new product has always been important to us,” a spokeswoman for PepsiCo said in a statement to The Huffington Post. “We opened up the DEW flavor vault and gave students a chance to try this Doritos-inspired flavor as part of a small program at colleges and universities.”
This isn't the first time PepsiCo has combined the highly caffeinated soda and the cheese-dusted nacho chips. PepsiCo also owns Frito-Lay, which makes Doritos, and the company has a long history of linking the two brands through new flavors or joint promotions. In 2008, PepsiCo released Doritos Quest , a sweet chip with a mystery flavor that was later identified as Mountain Dew.
The company has also long promoted Doritos and Mountain Dew, together enshrined in video gaming culture as the ultimate snacking cuisine, in marketing campaigns promoting the release of games on Microsoft’s Xbox.
Earlier this year, PepsiCo began printing special codes on bottles of Mountain Dew and bags of Doritos that can be used to unlock gear and increase experience points in “Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare,” which was released this week.
It’s unclear whether the Doritos-flavored soda will ever reach store shelves. But there's evidence to suggest that the Doritos and Mountain Dew combination is popular: In June, YouTube chef Rosanna Pansino introduced the world to Mountain Dew-flavored cupcakes topped with a Doritos crumble. And interest in the two brands, as shown by this Google Trends graph, seems to be on the rise:

The Future Of Drive-Thru Is On Your Phonereddit
There was a time when nothing symbolized Americans’ yearn for instant gratification as well as the drive-thru -- where we could order, pay for and eat a meal without ever having to leave the car.
Then along came the iPhone and a universe of apps that promised the ultimate convenience: burgers at the push of a button. Thanks to tech, you now have the luxury of never having to place a fast-food order with a human again.
As more young Americans move to cities -- and leave their cars behind -- mobile apps are increasingly looking like the 21st century's answer to the drive-thru.
“The mobile payment will become the urban version of the drive-thru,” said Maeve Webster, a senior director at DataSsential, a food market research firm. “The big thing that’s going to drive that is the population shift into urban areas.”
Over the past several months, the number of restaurants offering diners the ability to order and pay for their food through their phones has expanded rapidly. Taco Bell launched its mobile ordering app to much fanfare last week. Other eateries, including Panda Express and White Castle , also have similar apps.

McDonald's is reportedly testing an app that allows customers to order ahead and pay through their phones. The fast food giant already accepts Apple Pay at its stores. At Starbucks, which is widely acknowledged to have one of the most successful mobile payment apps, phone transactions are growing at a rate of nearly 50 percent annually , the company said in a conference call discussing its most recently quarterly earnings. Mobile payments at banks, restaurants and other locations are expected to grow 60.8 percent annually worldwide between 2011 and 2015, according to the 2014 world payments report from consulting firm Capgemini and the Royal Bank of Scotland.
The apps presumably appeal largely to younger city dwellers looking to order quickly and on the go. And the past few years have seen an increase in this type of customer. Between 2000 and 2010, the urban population in the country increased by 12.1 percent, compared to an overall population growth rate of 9.7 percent, according to Census Bureau data from 2012 . Nearly 1 in 7 Americans lives in the New York, Chicago or Los Angeles metropolitan areas and nearly 1 in 3 lives in one of the 10 most populous regions, the Census Bureau reported earlier this year .
Young people in their 20s and 30s with college degrees are particularly likely to choose close-in urban neighborhoods over the suburbs, according to a recent report from City Observatory , a think tank focused on urban policy. Young people are also driving less -- between 2001 and 2009, the number of miles clocked by the average 16 to 34-year-old dropped 23 percent, an October study from U.S. PIRG found.
Young people are driving less and less:
This chart from U.S. PIRG shows the change in number of trips per capita among 16- to 34-year-olds between 2001 and 2009.
If these patterns hold, it may not be long before the trappings of car culture -- including drive-thrus -- become increasingly outdated. The first drive-in window -- a setup where diners ordered through a window and a waiter brought food to their car -- appeared in Texas 1921, according to Michael Karl Witzel, the author of The American Drive In. It later spawned its now more-popular offshoot, the drive-thru, in the 1930s, he said.
From there, the growth “was another natural progression of the love of the automobile,” Witzel said. As cars, highways and commutes from the suburbs became more ubiquitous in the middle of the century, drive-thru windows began to increasingly dot the landscape. McDonald’s launched its first drive-thru on an Arizona military base in 1975 to cater to soldiers who weren’t allowed to get out of their cars in fatigues, according to the company’s website .
“We used to believe that [cars] were freedom machines, and we inhabited them in ways that amplified our freedom,” said Cotten Seiler, the author of Republic of Drivers: A Cultural History of Automobility in America. “Now the suburbs, which were supposed to be these havens of freedom and mobility and beauty, are some of the most congested areas. These are places where the promise of mobility doesn’t really deliver anymore.”
Despite the congestion, drive-thrus still generate a huge chunk of business for many eateries; at Starbucks, for example, stores with a drive-thru accounted for nearly half of sales last quarter, even though they make up only 42 percent of the chain's company-operated store portfolio. According to a 2012 report from the NPD Group, a market research firm, drive-thrus make up about 40 percent of visits at Mexican chains like Taco Bell, and 57 percent of visits at hamburger joints.
But the drive-thru's hold may be slipping. For the year ended September 2014, drive-thru visits to hamburger fast food chains were down 6 percent, compared to a 5 percent decline in fast food visits overall, according to NPD.
Using Apple's Passbook App to pay for a cup of coffee at Starbucks.
Forward-thinking chains are adjusting to this new reality. Starbucks announced on its earnings call last week that the chain will add delivery to its mobile app in some locations starting sometime in 2015 . It also added a feature earlier this year that allows users to hail an Uber through the Starbucks app.
Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz described these developments and other efforts to grow mobile transactions as "taking a page out of the drive-thru business,” which is known for convenience.
If the plan works, an Uber ride to your local Starbucks hailed through the chain’s app may one day feel as nostalgic and American as a waiter delivering a burger to your car on roller skates.

Marissa Mayer goes on $2.1B spending spreeMarissa Mayer goes on $2.1B shopping spree

Yahoo’s (YHOO) $640 million purchase of digital video ad firm BrightRoll is the latest big purchase by the company looking to reassert itself in a changing media world — by buying smaller companies.
The media company has bought or invested in 49 different companies with a disclosed value of $2.1 billion since CEO Marissa Mayer took the CEO role on July 17, 2012, according to a USA TODAY review of data from S&P Capital IQ. Yahoo disclosed the buyout values of eight of the 49 deals, so the total spent is higher than $2.1 billion.
BrightRoll ranks as the second largest buy Yahoo has made under Marissa Mayer’s leadership at $640 million. The only deal that was larger was $1.1 billion buyout of online app Tumblr announced in May 2013.
Much of Yahoo’s ability to aggressively buy smaller companies with promising technology is connected to the company’s good fortune in owning a large stake of Alibaba (BABA) shares. Yahoo raised $8.3 billion by selling 121.7 million shares in the Alibaba initial public offering months ago. That added to Yahoo’s financial firepower — giving it the ability to go on a shopping spree. Yahoo reported having $111.8 billion in cash and short-term investments as of September, giving the company a massive warchest to pursue deals.
And there’s more where that came from. Yahoo is still sitting on 401.8 million more shares of Alibaba that are worth $47.8 billion at Alibaba’s current price of $119 a share.
Investors appear to approve of Yahoo’s latest purchase. Shares of Yahoo are up $1.50, or 3%, to $50.54. Shares are up nearly 25% this year.

#ExceptionalCareers Series: Giving You the Edge for Successreddit
I've had the privilege of engaging with hundreds of remarkable undergraduates and graduate students while working at Duke University's Fuqua School of Business .  One thing that they all desire -- but struggle to attain -- is a clear understanding of what it takes to chart and sustain a successful career. And why shouldn't they want this? Careers are our livelihood.  They usually consume more than half of our waking hours and all too often, what we do is how others have come to define who we are.
I still remember vividly, the anxiety and the tremendous sense of failure during my senior year in college. As we moved towards graduation, everyone around me seem so certain what their next steps were and what their vocations were sure to be. My best friends were going to medical school, law school, doctoral programs, and other friends were heading into investment banking, consulting, and top companies.
I felt rudderless. And I had no idea what the next steps were, knowing only that I aspire to a great career, to make my mark on the world and falling awfully short of it all.
So here's the secret that no one really ever tells you -- this career anxiety and feeling of falling short -- they never really go away....
In my work at the Fuqua/Coach K Leadership and Ethics Center (COLE)>, I've also had the privilege of engaging with leaders across industries, sectors, and domains -- from CEOs, generals, partners of major firms, champion athletes, directors of major initiatives, and homemakers who are partners to their spouses in building successful organizations.
They are all leading exceptional lives and careers.  So what defines an exceptional career?
I posed this question first to dear friend and mentor, Frances Hesselbein (pictured).  Frances is the CEO and President of the Hesselbein Institute and former CEO of the Girl Scouts of USA.  In her career, she had co-shaped the army's leader development model, was the first woman on the cover of BusinessWeek, turned down a cabinet position from President Ronald Reagan because the Girls Scouts needed her during their time of transformation and who, for half of her career was a "homemaker".  This is her answer:
An exceptional career is one that provides an opportunity to serve.  It is a satisfying career in which you can't wait to get up in the morning to begin!  You have a sense of purpose and mission.  You know why you do what you do.  It is a response to a call to serve.  Once we do that, everything flows positively.  When I choose what I do, I ask, does it make a difference?
When I asked this question of others, a pattern began to emerge in their answers.  The very best people -- the ones who move mountains and inspire confidence in you to do the same -- those leaders have all built exceptional careers.
But they are defined by an understanding of who they are and what they stand for, and by a purpose and desire to shape the world for the better in a consequential way.
And because the definitions for success transcend the checkboxes of dollars or titles earned, and is instead, about making a difference - the chase never ends.
So while that career anxiety never goes away, it is framed by a different meaning, shaped by a different sense of self, and propelled by a different purpose.
So this Exceptional Careers Series will give you actionable tips, insights and an edge for building an exceptional career.  An exceptional career is not solely defined by the title or salary, but by a larger set of factors that lead to career satisfaction. It is one marked by service, growth, purpose, and meaning.
To this end, we will have short advice and how-to pieces, interviews with successful leaders, and reader Q&A. Many of the pieces will be co-shaped by my students and the leaders in our network.  We also want this to be co-created with you -- so write in the comments, questions that you'd like to see answered or ideas.  You can also tweet at me @SanyinSiang .
This is a series for all of us, by all of us.
If in reading or thinking about questions, this series should change the way you look at careers or success - great!  I hope this series will help you develop an intrinsic definition of success rather than let success be defined by others.
There will be new content on the second and fourth Wednesday of each month.  Different from the other pieces in my blog, each title in this series will begin with the words #ExceptionalCareers.
Let's start the conversation.  #ExceptionalCareers

DDA Sets Tentative Date for Housing Scheme Draw
NDTV | Updated On: November 13, 2014 17:22 (IST)
RBI Doubles Pre-Paid Card Limit to Rs 1 Lakh
The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) is most likely to hold the computerised draw of lots for its Housing Scheme 2014 on Friday. Balvinder Kumar, vice chairman of the DDA, told NDTV that said the housing authority in all likelihood will hold the lucky draw on Friday.

Pakistan trounce New Zealand  win first Test by 248 runsPakistan's dream run continued on Thursday as they beat New Zealand by 248 runs. (Source: AP)
By: Associated Press | Abu Dhabi | Posted: November 13, 2014 1:54 pm | Updated: November 13, 2014 1:57 pm
Misbah-ul-Haq became Pakistan’s most successful Test captain with a thumping 248-run victory in the first Test against New Zealand which ended on Thursday.
The victory lifted Misbah one ahead of former skippers Imran Khan and Javed Miandad’s joint Pakistan record of 14 Test victories.
New Zealand’s No.10 Ish Sodhi delayed the inevitable for over an hour on the fifth and final day and top-scored with a gritty career-best 63 with seven  fours and a six before he was the last man to go.
Sodhi frustrated Pakistan bid and shared a 54-run last-wicket stand with Trent Boult before he was out leg before wicket to fast bowler Imran Khan’s (2-37) inswinger.
Chasing a 480-run target, New Zealand was left lurching at 174-8 on the fourth day as they failed to cope with either the spinning duo of Yasir Shah (3-74) and Zulfiqar Babar (2-48) or the reverse swing of Imran and Rahat Ali (2-48).
Legspinner Shah had overnight batsman Mark Craig (28) clean bowled in his first over of the day before Sodhi and Boult prolonged the innings with some defiant batting.
Sodhi swept Shah for a four and a six to reach his second Test fifty and got a lucky escape when he gloved a sweep off Babar but wicketkeeper Sarfraz Ahmed misjudged the attempted catch.
Pakistan took a 1-0 lead in the three-Test series, with the top-order batsmen extending the form that had given the side a 2-0 series victory over Australia in the preceding series.
The lost only five wickets across two innings to New Zealand’s limited attack, which was playing its first Test on the United Arab Emirates’ slow, turning wickets.
Misbah scored his third successive century, Younis Khan smashed his fourth in five innings and opening batsman Ahmed Shehzad notched a career-best 176 in the first innings before fracturing his skull and was ruled out of the series.
Mohammad Hafeez, who was under pressure after only 48 runs in the three innings against Australia, responded with knocks of 96 and 101 not out; his first Test century in two years.
New Zealand batsmen struggled to adapt on turning wickets. The only positives for the Black Caps were the form of young opener Tom Latham, who scored a maiden Test hundred in the first innings score of 262, and the defiance of Sodhi at the end.
The second Test begins at Dubai from next Monday where the wicket is expected to suit Pakistan spinners more, followed by the last test at Sharjah from Nov. 26.

Rahul Gandhi  Sonia accuse  angry  Narendra Modi of destroying Nehru s legacyArmy, police search Jammu-Delhi Rajdhani after bomb threat
Congress party leaders President Sonia Gandhi and Vice President Rahul Gandhi accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of spreading the “poison” of communalism and asked party men to fight those out to demolish Jawaharlal Nehru’s “liberal India”, intensifying the battle over his legacy.
While both the Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi did not take the name of Modi, the reference was obvious when they spoke at a party function on the eve of the 125th birth anniversary of Nehru here.
Rahul Gandhi said that “angry” people are nowadays running the country and had a dig at Modi over the “Swachchta Abhiyan” saying “photo opportunities” are galore.
“These days, the foundation of love and brotherhood is being demolished. On one hand houses are being painted and roads are being cleaned. Photo opportunities are happening. Snaps are being taken. On the other hand, poison is being spread. The very foundations are being weakened,” Gandhi said.
In her speech made in the presence of former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and former Chief Minister Shiela Dikshit, Sonia Gandhi asked party men to be united and strengthen the organisations and connect and fight those forces out to demolish Nehru’s vision of a liberal India.
“Massive attempts are on to destroy the vision of Nehru, the way he used to look at India. The forces, which are doing this are targeting not only his persona but also his ideology, his vision, his life-long contributions and struggle,” she said.
The Congress President said that had Nehru been alive, he would have asked all Congressmen to fight communalism of all hues by becoming a “valiant secular soldier” for protecting the soul of India.
Out of power for the last six months after a crushing defeat in the Lok Sabha polls, the party is utilising the 125th birth anniversary of Nehru to rally round non-NDA parties on a platform raising the pitch of secularism.
It has organised an international meet on November 17 and 18 for which it has not invited Modi, who it accuses of appropriating the legacy of freedom movement leaders like Mahatma Gandhi, Nehru and Sardar Patel. Sonia Gandhi has extended invitations personally to leaders including Nitish Kumar and Mamata Banerjee.

Changing family needs impact not only day-to-day money matters but also plans for how to protect your loved ones  financial futures.Email
Today there are more single mothers, female breadwinners and stay-at-home dads than there were even a decade ago. Many couples are buying homes later — and having to make mortgage payments into their 50s and 60s. Many parents are having children later. So moms and dads may be facing surging college tuition bills at the same time that they're helping to care for their own aging parents.
Changing family needs impact not only day-to-day money matters but also plans for how to protect your loved ones' financial futures. Being properly insured is essential. Here are four groups that probably need life insurance the most:
Breadwinners: “If anyone in your life depends on you financially, you need life insurance,” says Marvin Feldman, CEO of consumer advocacy group LifeHappens.org. Increasingly, women are becoming the primary breadwinners in their households, so wives will need to have more coverage than their husbands. The number of women who are their families' sole or primary breadwinner has soared to 40 percent today from 11 percent in 1960, according to Pew Research Center. You may get life insurance policies through your employer, but the coverage is usually lower than individual policies and is only in place while you're employed.
Stay-at-home parents: If you have children, both parents should have life insurance, including the mom or dad who stays at home. Calculate the cost of services that a stay-at-home parent provides — childcare, caring for the home, transportation — in determining the amount of coverage needed. Financial adviser Carolyn McClanahan of Life Planning Partners says she advises working parents to also consider loss of income if they were to take time away from their job after the death of a stay-at-home spouse.  "If someone dies who is the center of the household and the center of your world, it makes it difficult to work,” she says. "Do you have resources to take time off and decompress while you readjust?"
Sharon answered viewer's life insurance questions in a live Twitter chat using #GetAPlan.
Older couples: Does it make sense to pay life insurance premiums in your 50s and 60s? If you have kids in college or adult children living at home, you may want to make sure they'll have some financial support if you're gone. Empty nesters who may have a mortgage and don't want to burden their spouse with this expense if they die will need life insurance too. "You should consider making sure you get enough life insurance to cover paying off the mortgage, continuing to pay for college, and potentially invest in life insurance that would allow your spouse to get a steady stream of income in the future," says Byron Udell, CEO of Accuquote.com.
Single moms: More than 40 percent of babies in the U.S. are born to women who are unmarried — that's a 10-percentage-point increase in the past decade, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. Most of these women are in their 20s and 30s. Millennial moms may think they’re too young to buy life insurance, but financial advisers say new parents often need life insurance the most.

Blood is everywhere: Marysville  Wash.  high school shooting 911 calls releasedBy Abby Ohlheiser November 13 Follow @abbyohlheiser

Moments after homecoming prince Jaylen Fryberg opened fire in the Marysville-Pilchuck High School cafeteria last month, a teacher took the phone from a student who had called 911 and frantically began to describe the situation — and the horrific scene.
“We have the shooter,” Megan Silberberger said. “We have many injured. Marysville-Pilchuck High School. We need emergency right away.”
Her chilling conversation with the emergency dispatcher was one of more than 40 911 calls that followed Fryberg’s Oct. 24 rampage, in which he opened fire on several of his classmates. Four of them died from their injuries; Fryberg was killed by a self-inflicted gunshot wound .
More than a dozen of the emergency calls were released Wednesday and detail the chaos at the Seattle-area school — and Silberberger’s attempts to stop the deadly shooting. Several of the calls, including Silberberger’s, can be heard on the Seattle Times Web site .
“I’m in the cafeteria; I have the shooter. One shooter,” she said. “Blood is everywhere. I do not see the gun. I have him down. … I need help now.”
The newly hired teacher — who reportedly tried to intervene in the shooting — told the dispatcher she was sitting next to the gunman. She did not know his name, she said, but identified him as a student.
“I tried to stop him before he shot himself,” Silberberger said. “He shot himself.”
She added: “Many are down. I do not know how many are down.”
The call ended when an officer arrived.
Here’s the full call, via the Seattle Times:
According to witness accounts, Silberberger tried to stop Fryberg, a freshman at the high school, during a brief pause in the shooting. After a short struggle, Fryberg reportedly shot himself .
In another call , a woman who lives in a building next to the school, told a dispatcher that “several” students from the school had escaped to her house after the shooting began. She relayed the identity of the gunman — including the spelling of his name — to dispatchers.
Dispatchers also fielded calls from worried parents. “My daughter just texted me that there are shots fired at her high school,” began one call. “I’ve got my son on a cellphone here saying he’s at Pilchuck High School, saying that someone was shot in the lunch room,” another parent said .
One school employee spent nearly 10 minutes on the phone with dispatchers. “We need ambulances ASAP,” Sue Olson told the dispatcher as she tried to gather more information from the school’s office.

Jaguar Land Rover UK staff reject pay deal, union calls for more talks
Reuters Nov 13, 2014, 08.04PM IST
(Talks between the Indian…)
LONDON: British workers at carmaker Jaguar Land Rover have voted against an offered pay rise and pension changes as Britain's biggest trade union said the firm should return to the negotiating table or face a ballot for industrial action.
Talks between the Tata-owned automaker and workers' representatives ended with no agreement in October after the union rejected a pay deal offering staff a rise of at least 3 percent in each of the next three years.
On Thursday, trade union Unite said nearly 13,000 staff had rejected the pay offer, with just under 500 accepting.
Unite national officer Roger Maddison said there were concerns over what he said were proposed reductions to pension provisions at the firm.
"With the company making a staggering 10 million pounds ($15.7 million) profit a day, it is no surprise that the workforce is angered by pension cuts and a pay offer that falls short in recognising their role in that success," he said.
Jaguar Land Rover would not comment on details of the pay or pension deal when asked by Reuters but a spokesman said the firm was very disappointed with the result of the ballot but committed to reaching a negotiated settlement.
After years in the doldrums, Jaguar Land Rover has enjoyed a new lease of life since it was bought by India's Tata group in 2008, recording a 2013/14 pre-tax profit of 2.5 billion pounds, more than doubling in three years.
Staff were offered a 3.6 percent rise in the first year plus a bonus and either 3 percent or the Retail Prices Index measure of inflation plus 0.5 percent depending on which is higher in years two and three, a trade union source told Reuters.
Last year the firm built almost one in three of Britain's 1.5 million cars and in October opened a 500 million pound engine manufacturing centre, its fifth site in Britain.

Will Loretta Lynch end Too Big To JailBy Nolan McCarty November 13

Liberals and conservatives will long debate the legacy of outgoing Attorney General Eric Holder.  Liberals and Democrats laud his deep commitment to civil rights and efforts to promote voting rights and criminal justice reform.  Conservatives and Republicans, on the other hand, deride him as an overly partisan and ideological figure that presided over debacles such as the Operation Fast and Furious, failed to fully investigate the IRS/Tea Party scandal, and hindered their attempts to implement voter ID laws.
But there is one area where there was some bipartisan agreement about Eric Holder’s tenure:  disapproval of his failure to aggressively pursue criminal charges against large financial institutions for their behavior in the lead-up to and the aftermath of the financial crisis.  Despite deferred prosecution agreements linked to large (but hardly deterring) fines, the Holder Justice Department will be long remembered for its “too big to jail” approach to financial crime.
Naturally, much of the disappointment on Holder’s record centers on the failure to hold those responsible for the recent financial crisis fully accountable. But as my co-authors and I argue in our recent book “ Political Bubbles ,” building a more credible and vigilant law enforcement regime for the financial sector is crucial for managing the systemic risk and market manipulation which could lead to crises in the future.  In that regard, the light-touch approach of the past six years represents a failure of financial reform.
With the appointment of Loretta Lynch, the two-time U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, there is an opportunity for the Justice Department to take a tougher approach to financial crime.  Although Lynch’s public record does little to suggest that her approach to Wall Street would differ dramatically from that of Holder’s, a very productive use of the Senate’s “advice and consent” prerogatives would be to open a discussion about how to end the “too big to jail” approach.  To that end, let me offer a few questions that senators might pose to Lynch:
* In reference to prosecuting corporate crime, the U.S. Attorney’s manual says:
In considering collateral consequences, prosecutors must determine whether there would be disproportionate harm to investors, pension holders, customers, employees, and others who were not personally culpable, as well as impact on the public arising from the prosecution.
How would your Justice department weigh the “collateral consequences” of its prosecution of financial firms?  Could some firms be too big, interconnected, or complex to prosecute?  As chair of Holder’s committee on policy, did you ever push for revisions to these policies?
* In comments to a civic association last year, you suggested that it was much easier to prosecute the small players in finance rather than the big banks. Doesn’t this mindset contribute to TBTJ?  As AG, what will you do to improve the capacity of the department to prosecute big firms as aggressively as it does small firms?  What resources and new authorities does the department need to accomplish such a goal (assuming it is one you share)?
* You played a major role in the Justice Department’s settlement with HBSC over charges that laundered money for terrorists and drug cartels. There were no criminal sanctions imposed on the corporation or the individuals involved, and the monetary settlement has been widely criticized as too low given the egregiousness of HSBCs alleged behavior.
* Do you agree with Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer’s rationalization of the settlement when he said:
I think I and prosecutors around the country, being responsible, should speak to regulators, should speak to experts, because if I bring a case against institution A, and as a result of bringing that case there’s some huge economic effect, it affects the economy so that employees who had nothing to do with the wrongdoing of the company… If it creates a ripple effect so that suddenly counterparties and other financial institutions or other companies that had nothing to do with this are affected badly, it’s a factor we need to know and understand.
* If you had to do it over again, what would you do differently?

Senate vs. Obama on IranBy Jennifer Rubin November 13 Follow @JRubinBlogger
President Obama has been making so many concessions that the likelihood of Iranian negotiators making a deal by the Nov. 24 deadline, rather than waiting for more generous terms to fall into their laps, is diminishing. Reuel Marc Gerecht and Mark Dubowitz write : “The deadline is approaching with dwindling hope for a deal in part because Iran has already gotten so much that it wants. During the 2012 negotiations leading to the interim deal, the White House accommodated Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei ’s red lines against reducing enrichment capacity and foreclosing an industrial-size program.”
The best news on the Iran dilemma in quite some time drew little notice yesterday. It came in the form of a written statement from Sens. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) and Mark Kirk (R-Ill.):
Sen. Robert Menendez, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. (Mark Wilson/Getty Images)
As co-authors of bipartisan sanctions laws that compelled Iran to the negotiating table, we believe that a good deal will dismantle, not just stall, Iran’s illicit nuclear program and prevent Iran from ever becoming a threshold nuclear weapons state. This will require stringent limits on nuclear-related research, development and procurement, coming clean on all possible military dimensions (PMD) issues and a robust inspection and verification regime for decades to prevent Iran from breaking-out or covertly sneaking-out. Gradual sanctions relaxation would only occur if Iran strictly complied with all parts of the agreement. If a potential deal does not achieve these goals, we will work with our colleagues in Congress to act decisively, as we have in the past.
That confirms what we suspected: When freed from the grip of Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.), the Senate can and is likely to move on a bipartisan basis to try to block any rotten Iran deal, stiffen the president’s spine and up the ante on sanctions if no acceptable deal is reached. That in turn may incentivize the administration to take stronger measures in lieu of drifting into a policy of containment.
It is obvious that the United States has frittered away its bargaining position, given Iran a sense of impunity and made the chance of a satisfactory deal nearly impossible. The Jerusalem Post reports :
“Deep gaps” remain between world powers and Iran over its nuclear program, a Russian official said on Wednesday, as negotiations intensified toward a November 24 deadline. But speaking from Muscat, Oman, where the negotiators have converged for several days after basing their talks in Vienna, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov expressed optimism that a deal could be reached by the deadline . . . . But Ryabkov’s optimism came as Tehran confirmed the government had tested a new centrifuge that could speed uranium enrichment, fueling the infrastructure with gas, in possible violation of an international agreement.
The best one can hope for is that Obama listens to the bipartisan hue and cry about a bad deal, holds firm and then accedes to increase the pressure on Iran so that there will be an incentive for the country to give up its nuclear ambitions. (Consider how strange is our dilemma: We must hope Congress forces Obama to accede to sticking with his own policy.) That may seem hard to imagine these days. Once convinced that Obama is a pushover, Iran may cease to take him seriously, and the West will be hard-pressed to recover its credibility. But Obama’s former Iran adviser Dennis Ross is fond of saying that to regain credibility all the United States needs to do is change its behavior. In a report co-authored by Ross and former ambassador Eric Edelman, they recommended a number of specific steps:
To peacefully prevent a nuclear Iran, American policymakers must use all available instruments of coercive diplomacy to restore credibility to their mantra that the United States is keeping all options on the table. They must do this promptly and resolutely. The Obama Administration can undertake several mutually-reinforcing steps to bolster its leverage at the negotiating table: conditioning further sanctions relief on dramatic and verifiable rollback of Iran’s nuclear program; working more closely with Congress on negotiating and implementing a final deal; augmenting the credibility of both the U.S. and Israeli military options; improving dialogue with regional allies; and interdicting clandestine Iranian arms exports.
It is too much to hope that Obama would take even stronger action, such as ousting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to “let Tehran know that America’s withdrawal from the Middle East and President Obama’s dreams of an entente with Iran are over.” But some sign — really, any sign — of toughness would be an improvement at this point.
The new Congress, in addition to trying to avoid a bad deal, should urge the president to proceed along some or all of these lines. Democrats’ willingness to join concerned Republicans at this stage is critical and will preserve any hope of eliminating Iran’s nuclear program without an Israel strike or U.S. military action (after a new president is elected, of course).

Jon Stewart tilts at #PointergateGet More: Daily Show Full Episodes , The Daily Show on Facebook , Daily Show Video Archive
 
From here on out, the people who sign off on stories at the Minnesota news station KSTP-TV 5 Eyewitness News will know that any news story they do has the potential to become a national news story. And not in a good way.
The station, an ABC affiliate, ran a story citing police concerns about a photo of Minneapolis Mayor Betsy Hodges with a canvasser in which the two were pointing at each other. KSTP anchor Bill Lunn said of the suspicious police, “They want to know why the mayor would take a picture with a convicted criminal while he and the mayor flashed gang signs.”
Thus was born #pointergate, a social-media laughdown of KSTP’s sensationalism.
Last night the story went “Daily Show,” as host Jon Stewart had fun with the notion of a scandal over a mayor and a canvasser pointing at each other. Stewart & Co. did exactly what thousands of other satirists have done in response to #pointergate, which is show a photo of someone else using the same pointing pose as the one that KSTP found so scandalous. In this case, Stewart showcased a photo of Stephen Colbert doing exactly that, then said, “All this time I’ve been the lead-in for a notorious gang member.”
Taking out a long print-out, Stewart said, “Unfortunately it’s time to once again update our list of innocent things black people do that look suspicious . . . Don’t wear a hoodie, don’t carry Skittles, don’t carry keys, don’t reach for a wallet, don’t drive in a car in a nice neighborhood, don’t drive in a car, don’t be a passenger in a car, don’t knock on a white person’s door and now, don’t point.”

India to see stable growth; prospects depend on reforms: OECDFIPB role shrinks amid easier FDI flows
Indian economy is expected to see an average growth of 6.7 per cent over the 2015-19 period and a further boost would depend on reform plans of the government, says a report.
However, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) today also said India and China face significant challenges.
“India’s growth should remain stable at 6.7 per cent, before any potential boost from the new government’s reform plans,” the report, released at the ASEAN Business and Investment Summit here, said.
“Emerging Asia” is set for healthy growth over the medium term even as outlook for many OECD countries remains subdued, as per the grouping’s latest economic outlook report for Southeast Asia, China and India.
“India’s growth should be stable over 2015-19, but the prospects could change depending on the implementation of the reforms of the new Modi government,” the report said.
These plans include promoting domestic and foreign investments, creating jobs, improving food security, raising standards of education and skills development, building new infrastructure, enhancing water governance and increasing the country’s overall competitiveness, particularly in the manufacturing sector, it added.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government came to power in May after a thumping victory in the general elections.
In October, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank projected 5.6 per cent growth rate for India this year, citing renewed confidence in the market due to a series of economic reforms pursued by the new government.
Meanwhile, OECD today in its report said that annual GDP growth for the ASEAN -10, China and India is forecast to average 6.5 per cent over 2015-19.
“Growth momentum remains robust in the 10 ASEAN countries, with economic growth averaging 5.6 per cent over 2015-19,” it noted.
The members of ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) are Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Brunei Darussalam, Singapore, Cambodia, Lao PDR and Myanmar.
However, the report said that China’s growth is expected to slowdown to 6.8 per cent over 2015-19 period. It also noted that public sector reforms have made substantial progress in Southeast Asia, China and India.
Paris-based OECD is a grouping of about 34 countries.

Most cyber attacks on India show Chinese IP address:NTROPrint
Cyber attacks have grown nearly five times in the last three years.
By: Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: November 13, 2014 9:10 pm | Updated: November 13, 2014 9:19 pm
Cyber attacks have grown nearly five times in the last three years and most of them have been found to be originating from the IP addresses located in China.
“Most of the cyber attacks that we have tracked show IP addresses located in China but we are unable to establish if the attacker is from China. We need international cooperation for handling such crimes,” NTRO Director of Cyber Security Operations Alok Vijayant said at Ground Zero Summit.
Government’s cyber security arm Computer Emergency Response Team-India (CERT-In) reported 62,189 cyber security incidents in the first five months of the current calendar year.
These attacks have been found to be originating from the cyber space of a number of countries including the US, Europe, Brazil, Turkey, China, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Algeria and the UAE, according to the official report.
The National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO) Director said that foreign countries are investing heavily in cyber espionage to gather crucial data and India needs to seriously consider a strategy to counter this strategy.
“Indian has a dearth of talent. In most of the cases Indians find cyber security loophole quickly with its solution but people may get tempted with high price paid in under ground market. Payment per exploit is as good as 15,000 euros and higher than that,” Vijayant said.
Cyber security expert Greg Walton showed his research on an attack mounted on Tibetan government in exile which showed its origin in Chengdu city of China.
“The attacker hacked e-mail id of a senior minister of Tibetan government in exile in Dharamshala and through that id they even attacked India’s ministry of external affairs,” Walton said.
India has seen increase in cyber attacks from about 13,000 in 2011 to 62,000 till mid-2014. The country has been unable to identify cyber criminals in majority of the case due to absence of international cooperation on the issue.

One killed in fresh Assam-Nagaland borderincidentPrint

One person was killed and three others injured when armed miscreants from the Nagaland side opened fire on a group of farmers from the Assam side in a village located on the inter-state border in Golaghat district on Thursday morning, with the police suspecting hand of the NSCN in it. The deceased, a 60-year old person, has been identified as Prem Ekka.
Golaghat Additional Superintendent of Police Nomal Mahatte said a group of villagers from Ratanpur village under Uriamghat police station were harvesting paddy in a field owned by a Naga person when a group of armed miscreants chased them and opened fire. “No villager from the Nagaland side was however involved in the attack. In fact when we reached the place, Naga villagers told us that it was the handiwork of some armed miscreants. We suspect them to be of the NSCN,” he said.
Uriamghat was in the news in August this year when armed miscreants from Nagaland had allegedly set several villages inside Assam on fire, leading to displacement of over 10,000 persons. While 13 persons had lost their lives in the August violence, about 1,000 people are still lodged in relief camps as they feared they would be attacked again if they returned to their respective villages.
Organisations in Wokha, the adjoining Nagaland district on their part claim that about 1,000 Naga villagers were also displaced when armed groups from the Assam side attacked their villages.

A delegation of 23 Shiv Sena leaders met Governor C Vidyasagar Rao on Thursday and handed over a petition seeking dismissal of the BJP government, which the party claimed was “unconstitutional”. A section of the top leadership, however, continues to hope for a rapprochement with the former ally and is reportedly still keeping lines of communication open with the central leadership of the party.
The party appears to be have been caught in two minds over the role it is supposed to play in the present political dispensation. The decision to approach the Governor came after the Sena, in spite of being the main Opposition party, was forced to accede space to the Congress whose legislators were in the forefront of undertaking an agitation against the BJP, leading to five of their MLAs being suspended.
Sena leaders acknowledged in private that even though the grassroots workers of the Sena was angry with the BJP, it was difficult for party leaders to position themselves as opponents of the ruling party.
“In politics, pragmatism should rule over emotions. The rank and file is hurt but as a party we stand to lose more by staying out. Our support base is similar. It will be difficult for us to project ourselves as ideological opponents of BJP the way Congress can. We are hoping better sense prevails on both sides,” said a three-time MLA.
The Sena is also afraid that the confrontation in the state may affect its stranglehold on the country’s biggest urban local body — the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation. The Sena rules the BMC in association with the BJP and a split would mean the party would have to face the BJP in the corporation elections too.
“When you split, you need to pay alimony and paying that could be ruinous for us in Mumbai,” a senior Sena leader said.

52-year-old clergyman arrested on charges of sexually abusing two minorgirlsPrint
By: Express News Service | Jaipur | Posted: November 13, 2014 8:52 pm
A 52-year-old clergyman was arrested late on Wednesday night on charges of sexually abusing two minor girls lodged in a home shelter run by him in the state capital. The priest, Johnson Chacko, was booked under relevant sections of POCSO (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) Act while his wife was arrested on Thursday after the police recorded statements of the alleged victims.
According to initial investigation, it was found that Chacko had been sexually abusing the two minor girls for the past two years. The girls were lodged at Mercy Home, a shelter home for destitute children, run by Chacko and his wife in Tara Nagar. The matter came to light after one of the girls confided in her teacher at a nearby school. The school principal then called in the police who raided the shelter home late on Wednesday night and arrested Chacko.
The alleged victims told the police that they had complained to Chacko’s wife that “he touched them inappropriately” but she had instead asked them to “keep quiet because he is like God.” Statements of the alleged victims were recorded and they were sent for medical examination on Thursday.
All the 19 inmates, girls aged between 7 and 12, have been shifted to a government shelter home. The inmates have collectively complained that they were ill-treated at the home and beaten up with metal rods and poorly fed. They said that Chacko misbehaved with all of them and sexually abused them, officials said.
Director General of Police Omendra Bhardwaj said, “We will conduct a survey and prepare a list of all shelter homes in the state that are running without a license. A copy will be sent to the respective district collectors and it will be ensured that all such illegal homes will be shut down.”
Social Justice minister Arun Chaturvedi said, “We will ensure a chargesheet is filed within a month. It was shocking to learn of the atrocities meted out to the children at the home. We are taking strict action against those involved in the case.”
State Women Commission chairperson Lad Kumari Jain told the Indian Express, “We will hold a separate inquiry into the incident and speak to the inmates at length of Friday. The government will have to intervene and ensure that action is taken at the state level so that no such incident recurs in other shelter homes across the state. This is the fourth such incident reported in the state recently and has become a shocking trend.”

David Axelrod: Hillary Clinton needs to get out of the cocoon of inevitabilityBy Philip Rucker November 13 Follow @PhilipRucker

David Axelrod, the chief strategist who guided President Obama into the White House, offered a blunt assessment Thursday of Hillary Rodham Clinton's likely 2016 presidential campaign, saying she needs to "get out of the cocoon of inevitability."
Axelrod, appearing on a political panel in Washington sponsored by The Wall Street Journal, said Clinton needs to develop a strategy and message for her candidacy rather than rely on tactics and the Democratic Party's demographic advantages in presidential elections.
"Tactics have to follow strategy," Axelrod said. "I think the danger for Secretary Clinton is that, as was the case in 2007, her candidacy is out in front of the rationale for it."
Axelrod said Clinton became "a very effective candidate" late in the 2008 primary cycle. "She was much more visceral, she was closer to the ground, she was talking about people and their lives," he said. In 2016, Axelrod said, "she has to throw caution to the wind and essentially get out of the cocoon of inevitability and really compete for it."
Some Democrats believe that after Obama built a powerful coalition of black, Latino, women and young voters in the 2008 and 2012 campaigns, demographics are destiny and ensure the party will keep hold of the White House for years to come. But Axelrod said Clinton would be foolish to believe this.
"That should not give her solace that the job is done," Axelrod said. "I think the candidate who's going to win in 2016 is the candidate who aggressively and in a forward-thinking way deals with this fundamental issue of the stagnancy of wages, the problems of the middle class, the lack of economic mobility that are central to who we are as a country."
Axelrod noted that running away from Obama and his record did not work for Democratic senators in 2014 and cautioned Clinton against repeating that strategy. Instead, he said, Clinton should develop a message that builds on his legacy, especially on economic issues, without simply running for a repeat term.
"People seek the remedy and not the replica," Axelrod said. "I think that in 2016, people will want someone who is a little less nuanced, someone who projects more of a sense of black and white certainty.... I actually think that is an environment that favors Hillary Clinton more than the 2008 environment because she tends to be someone that speaks in simple, declarative sentences and with great certainty."

Nebraskas attorney general-elect thinks the state can defend its same-sex marriage banBy Hunter Schwarz November 13 Follow @hunterschwarz
The ACLU of Nebraska plans to file a lawsuit challenging the state’s ban on marriage for same-sex couples next week, and the state’s incoming attorney general thinks the state can fight it and uphold the ban.
“I think there’s plenty of precedent out there to defend the case,” attorney general-elect Doug Peterson told the Journal Star . “I intend to defend the constitutional amendment.”
Nebraska voters approved a constitutional amendment in 2000 prohibiting same-sex marriage, civil unions, and domestic partnerships, which the ACLU challenged in 2003. According to the ACLU, their 2003 lawsuit was the first in the country to challenge a state’s constitutional marriage ban.
The 8th Circuit appellate court upheld the state’s ban in a 2006 decision.
Marriage for same-sex couples became legal in neighboring Iowa in 2009.
“If you live in Council Bluffs, Iowa, and work in Omaha, just driving across the (Missouri) river, you immediately lose any and all legal connection to your spouse and your family,” Charlie Joughin, a spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign told the Associated Press earlier this year.
Peterson, who was elected attorney general last week, will take office next year.

According to a BBC report , the concert could take place in the "coming months."
That still gives time for hard-liners to possibly pressure the ruling clerics to call it off. It’s happened before. A planned 2008 performance by British-Irish singer Chris de Burgh (best known for the easy-listening staple "Lady in Red") was canceled after permission was pulled without explanation. The cancellation was widely attributed to opposition from hard-liners.
Yanni has some important factors in his favor, however.
In October, the Grammy-winning Japanese musician Kitaro held a well-received concert in Tehran. A month earlier, a troupe of Chicago-based puppeteers received a standing ovation after a show in the Iranian capital. An American flag even was hoisted over the entrance of the City Theater.
The Ministry of Culture, meanwhile, appears to be pushing back harder against ultra-conservatives since the election of reform-leaning President Hassan Rouhani in 2012.
The ministry’s chief, Pirouz Arjomand, publicly railed on state-run media to denounce a mob that disrupted a May concert by local musician Vahid Taj.
And Yanni is scheduled to play in a place that’s sort of Iran lite: the Persian Gulf island of Kish.
The island is Iran’s version of cutting loose: Western-style resorts, dive shops, nightly live music (still, male-only singers) and relaxed rules on Islamic coverings that allow women to get by with minimal head scarves, short-sleeve shirts and bare legs. Iran’s morality minders, known as the Basij, are kept well in check.

It’s certainly not Dubai, just across the Gulf. But Kish is not without its moments. It’s a favorite of Iranian honeymooners. International travelers can check Iran off their list by getting visas on arrival in Kish or -- for Americans and some other Westerners -- an expedited process via tourist companies.
Hosting the globetrotting Yanni, whose concert venues have included the Acropolis and Taj Mahal, also may be a way for Kish to promote its dreams of opening an international music school.
There’s one potential glitch. The U.S.-based Yanni could be drawn into a Kish mystery that remains one of the countless disputes between the United States and Iran. In March 2007, a retired FBI agent, Robert Levinson , was last seen on Kish during a trip the State Department described as “private business.” An Associated Press investigation later said Levinson was working for the CIA. Iran claims to have no idea of Levinson’s whereabouts.

People with health insurance still cant afford all the care they needBy Jason Millman November 13 Follow @jasonmillman
The second open enrollment period for the Affordable Care Act begins Nov. 15. Americans can sign up for health insurance once again, but those who already did have mixed reactions to their coverage so far. (AP)
As open enrollment season starts, a new survey is providing an important reminder that you need to look just beyond the cost of a health plan's monthly premium to figure out your expected medical costs for the coming year. With things like deductibles and co-pays creeping higher for nearly everyone, many adults are spending a chunk of their income on out-of-pocket costs.
About 21 percent of privately insured adults said they spent at least 5 percent of their income on medical care (not including the cost of premiums), and 13 percent said they spent at least 10 percent of their income on these out-of-pocket costs, according to the Commonwealth Fund Health Care Affordability Tracking Survey.
This picture looks especially tough for the poor. People earning below the federal poverty line ($11,490 for an individual) were about four times as likely to spend more than 10 percent of their incomes on medical care compared to people earning more than 400 percent FPL, or roughly $46,000 for an individual.
And if you have a chronic condition, you're about twice as likely to spend at least 5 percent or 10 percent of your income on medical expenses.
(Commonwealth Fund)
People participating in the survey, taken from a nationally representative sample of adults, were asked to recall copays for hospital and doctor visits, as well as their spending on prescriptions and vision and dental care in the past year. Commonwealth Fund researchers then calculated those costs as a share of their income.
These costs do have an effect on whether people seek out care, the survey finds. Even about one-fourth of privately insured adults with deductibles less than 5 percent of income said they skipped out on needed care at some point because of their deductible.
(Commonwealth Fund)
Out-of-pocket medical spending has been one of the big issues to watch in the rollout of the Affordable Care Act's coverage expansion. Though the law limits how much a consumer has to pay out-of-pocket each year on care, people enrolled in new ACA marketplace plans are generally still facing higher deductibles compared to employer-sponsored health plans. And even deductibles in employer plans are growing more prevalent, as this year's Kaiser Family Foundation/HRET survey showed. Health plans now, however, are generally required to cover preventive services without cost-sharing.
The rise of high-deductible plans are supposed to help keep down health spending and make people be smarter consumers of their care — for example, maybe they pass up getting an unnecessary test if they're absorbing more of that cost. This becomes problematic, though, if they're skipping truly necessary care because they can't afford it.
This morning's Commonwealth report concludes with this warning: "Cost-sharing in health plans is affecting people’s medical decisions in ways that should be of concern to policymakers and the medical community."

A day before SC hearing on chit fund scam  Orissa pledges logistical support to CBI  EDteamPrint
Written by Debabrata Mohanty | Bhubaneswar | Posted: November 13, 2014 9:25 pm
A day before the Supreme Court hears the prayers of senior advocate Shyam Divan, the Amicus Curiae in the multi crore chit fund scam, seeking court monitoring of the probe, the Orissa government on Thursday asked the director general of police to provide all necessary logistical support and documents to CBI’s local office and ED’s sub-zonal office in Bhubaneswar.
On November 5, Divan had filed a a 10-page application before the SC Bench headed Justice T S Thakur & Justice R Vanumati, complaining that the Orissa government was not at all cooperating in the court directed CBI and ED investigation and wanted the apex court to monitor the tardy probe. In his prayer, Divan had stated that Orissa giving any document to Enforcement Directorate even after several reminders from the agency  as well as a letter from from vice chairman of SIT on black money, Justice Arjit Pasayat. Divan also mentioned that the CBI SIT on chit fund in Bhubaneswar is facing acute shortage of manpower and was finding it difficult to probe all the 44 chit fund companies.
The SC bench fixed the hearing to November 14.
With the prospect of SC coming down heavily on the Orissa government, the home department today asked the DGP to provide all logistical support to ED and CBI on an urgent basis. Two days ago, the home department had directed the DGP and other government departments to immediately provide sweepers, furnitures and 3-phase electric lines to the local CBI office. On Wednesday, the Cuttack Municipal Corporation too handed over several important documents related to Seashore group. The ED which is looking into the instances of money laundering by some of the chit fund companies including Artha Tatwa and Seashore, in September had complained to the Orissa chief secretary about Bhubaneswar police commissionerate not handing over the documents relating to Artha Tatwa chit fund group.
Divan complained that CBI had only one SP, one Dy SP & three inspectors to probe all the chit fund companies. CBI had asked the state government to depute 10 inspectors, 20 constables and 8 vehicles for SIT, but got only one inspector and two vehicles.
Meanwhile, a special CBI court in Bhubaneswar on Thursday sent former BJD MLA Pravat Tripathy, Mumbai-based model Preeti Bhatia, builder Vineet Lalani and former state Congress secretary Dilip Mohanty to judicial custody till November 26 after their bail applications were rejected. Tripathy was arrested by the CBI on October 31, on charges of hatching a criminal conspiracy wth chit fund group Artha Tatwa and allegation that he had received huge sum from the group. After the end of his 13-day remand by CBI, he was produced before the special CBI court this morning.
Preeti Bhatia was arrested by CBI on October 10 over her alleged links with chit fund group Artha Tatwa and its chief Pradeep Sethy. Money from Artha Tatwa were allegedly transferred to her company bank account, personal account and relatives’ accounts without any valid reason. Preeti and Pradeep Sethy along with one Indu Dewan were continued…

Mizoram plans to build second airport in light of upcoming traderoutePrint
By: Express News Service | Aizawl | Posted: November 13, 2014 9:21 pm
A site for Mizoram’s second airport has been identified as the state hopes to make the best use of an under-construction trade route that will link the landlocked North-East to the Bay of Bengal for the first time.
Chief Minister Lal Thanhawla said in the assembly Thursday the government has identified a site near the southern town of Lunglei and that it is waiting for a nod from the Civil Aviation Ministry before construction begins.
Responding to a starred question by opposition MLA Dr K Beichhua, Lal Thanhawla said a site has been chosen near Kawnzawl in central Mizoram that can at least be developed to cater to smaller-sized airplanes such as ATR flights although the government would prefer an airstrip large enough to accommodate larger aircraft.
Being a hilly state, it is difficult to find flat land for projects such as airports. Even the lone domestic airport at Lengpui is a tabletop airport, one of only five in the country along with those at Mangalore, Kozhikode, Kullu and Leh.
“A detailed project report of Rs 155 crores has in fact already been completed. But one hurdle we have faced is a rule that civil airports cannot be within 150 kms of each other as the crow flies. We have asked the Civil Aviation Ministry for special consideration,” Lal Thanhawla said.
The CM also explained the context in which the new airport is being considered, saying the main reason is because the Kaladan Multi-Modal Transport Transit Project (an MEA-funded road and waterway project that will link southern Lawngtlai town to Sittwe port in Myanmar’s Rakhine state) is soon to be complete.
“This project will put Mizoram on a major trade route, so we would prefer to have an airport in the southern parts of the state so that at least businessmen and officials can travel there easily,” the CM added.

Santelli Exchange: Jobless benefits... friend or foe
George W. Bush  frozen in timeBy Richard Cohen November 13
In Franz Kafka’s “ The Metamorphosis ,” Gregor Samsa awakes to find himself transformed into a large insect. In real life, Richard Cohen awakes to hear George W. Bush talking about Saddam Hussein’s weapons of mass destruction, Hussein’s dirty bomb and the grand coalition Bush had assembled to deal with all of that. Cohen is listening to National Public Radio’s “ Morning Edition .” He is startled, still a bit sleepy. Is this some sort of Groundhog Day? Has Cohen lost his mind, or has Bush? Cohen turns off the water (he is in the bathroom) and pays closer attention. Sure enough, the former president is on the radio promoting the book he has done on his father. It is called “ 41: A Portrait of My Father .” Nice title, but the portrait that emerges that morning is not of George H.W. Bush, but of the son, the author, who not only cannot bring himself to admit a mistake – the Iraq war — but also persists in babbling half-truths and just plain fairy tales. It is very early in the morning, and Cohen’s cynicism level is not yet up to par. He is floored by what he hears.
Once again, Bush palavered about weapons of mass destruction. “And even though there wasn’t, you know, a — we found a

dirty bomb, for example, he had the capacity to make chemical, biological and nuclear weapons,” he said of Hussein. But as The Post’s indefatigable Fact Checker has pointed out, that’s not what Bush said back in 2002. He didn’t then talk about capacity. No siree. Iraq had the stuff in hand, on the shelf, not only ready to go but also ready to be off-loaded to any terrorist organization that came into Hussein’s shop and asked for a bomb or two. Even that reference to a dirty bomb is a rewrite of history. It was never mentioned at the time. Bush should have mentioned Hussein’s death ray. He saved us from that, too.
To hear that voice, that voice replete with the tics of a pathetically determined youthfulness — “Yeah. I mean, I think — sure — I think people — you know, I can understand the comparisons between [my father] and me” — was jarring. It was as if time had not moved on, as if Bush was frozen in the amber of his own defense mechanisms. He went to war for the wrong reasons. He went to war to rid Iraq not only of Hussein, but also of his weapons of mass destruction. Hussein is gone, so — even before the war — were the weapons. Bush pitched the Middle East into the chaos that now prevails. He broke the bank. He got it all wrong.
But how can he admit all that? It is tough enough for me to confess an early enthusiasm for the war, but maybe because I, too, was wrong, I can empathize. The terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, rocked me. I was in New York. I went down to the World Trade Center. Later, friends of mine got anthrax in the mail. That, too, rocked me.
Bush must have been rocked, too. That awful day. Getting the news as he was talking to schoolkids. Not knowing what was happening. Being flown here and there to escape who knows what. The Secret Service all over him. Worrying about family, country, his own life. No president has been through that sort of thing. Did it take a toll? My God, how could it not have?
The Bush administration sewed it all into a neat package. The attacks, the anthrax … it was all Saddam, Saddam, Saddam. Over and over, Saddam. And I had been to Iraq years before. I knew the place a bit, the terror, the torture. Hussein was a thug, a button man who had murdered his way to the top. I wanted him gone. I was with Bush on that, although as the war approached, I expressed second thoughts.
Still, to be responsible for more than 4,000 American deaths has to be a crushing burden. I can understand, and I can further understand the need to avoid blame. But Bush has an obligation to face history, to walk it backward and determine how he went wrong. We need to know such things. Future presidents need to know such things. But Bush disappoints twice. He was wrong to go to war in Iraq, and he remains wrong not to admit it.

Wall Street: Just because its illegal doesnt mean bankers wont tryBy Matt O'Brien November 13 Follow @ObsoleteDogma
(Spencer Platt/Getty Images)
This time, it's a $4.2 billion fine . That's how much UBS, HSBC, Citibank, JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, and the Royal Bank of Scotland are collectively paying to U.S., U.K., and Swiss regulators for rigging the foreign-exchange, or FX, market.
Just another day on Wall Street.
This latest malfeasance was something regulators hadn't worried about before, because they didn't think it was possible. The $5.3 trillion FX market, you see, should be far, far too big for any one bank to profitably manipulate it or front-run their clients. And it is. The problem, though, is that big banks have just colluded instead for the past decade. Traders at supposedly competing firms worked together to rig the benchmark FX rates in their favor. They deliberately triggered clients' stop-loss orders—the price they'd automatically sell at to limit losses—to boost their own profits. Along with revealing what trades their customers were about to make, which would let them all make it first.
And, of course, the bankers set up chatrooms charmingly named things like "the 3 musketeers" where they planned all this out in semi-grammatical English. "I'd prefer we join forces" to try to push the price of the euro up, one trader said . "Perfick," the other replied. "Let's double team them."
The lesson is that, with so much money at stake, you should never underestimate how far bankers will go to game the system. Just because there'd have to be a wide-ranging conspiracy for them to pull it off doesn't mean they won't try. In fact, they almost certainly will. And that brings us to the second point: the brazenness of it at all. There's nothing too clever about colluding with other traders, especially not when you leave a written record of it. This isn't, in other words, the work of criminal masterminds. It's the work of people who think they'll never be investigated.
Now, it's obviously good news that regulators are finally cracking down and fining banks over this. But it's important to remember that these penalties are just the price of doing business for big banks—and tax-deductible ones at that .  And that's why the better news is that the Justice Department is still looking into criminal charges against some of these traders. Far too often, as Matt Taibbi has argued, the Justice Department has all too happy to have banks cut them a fat check rather than—and at the expense of—pursuing criminal charges that are hard to prove and even harder to explain to a jury. (Indeed, prosecutors lost one of the high-profile fraud cases  they did try, against two Bear Stearns hedge fund managers).
Bu sometimes it takes Old Testament-style justice—or at least jail time—to get people to pay attention. Otherwise, Wall Street will just pay their tax-deductible fines, and then go back to business as usual.

8 Women Dead After Sterilization Surgery8 Indian Women Dead, 20 Sickened After Undergoing Sterilization Surgery
 | By                                                                KATY DAIGLE

NEW DELHI (AP) — At least 11 Indian women are dead and 20 others seriously ill Wednesday after undergoing free sterilization operations, highlighting the risks women face in reproductive health in a country struggling with high population growth and widespread poverty.
A total of 83 women, all villagers under the age of 32, had the operations Saturday as part of the free sterilization campaign and were sent home that evening. But dozens later became ill and were rushed in ambulances to private hospitals in Bilaspur, a city in central Chhattisgarh state.
By Wednesday morning, at least 11 women had died, District Magistrate Siddharth Komal Pardeshi told Press Trust of India.
The apparent cause of death was either blood poisoning or hemorrhagic shock, which occurs when a person has lost too much blood, state deputy health director Amar Singh said, though the preliminary results from autopsies were expected to be released Wednesday.
About 20 others were in critical care, and the central government was rushing a team of doctors to Bilaspur to help with their treatment.
"Their condition is very serious. Blood pressure is low," said Dr. Ramesh Murty at CIMS hospital, one of the facilities where the sick women were taken. "We are now concentrating on treating them, not on what caused this."
India's government — long concerned about pervasive poverty among its rapidly growing 1.3 billion population— performs millions of free sterilizations to both women and men who want to avoid the risk and cost of having a baby. The vast majority of patients, however, are poor women — paid a one-time incentive fee to undergo the surgery of about $10-$20, or the equivalent of about a week's pay for a poor person in India. About 180 million people in the country still live on less than $1.25 a day.
India has one of the world's highest rates of sterilization among women, with about 37 percent undergoing such operations compared with 29 percent in China, according to 2006 statistics reported by the United Nations. During 2011-12, the government said 4.6 million Indian women were sterilized.
Activists blame the incentive payments, as well as sterilization quotas set by the government, for leading health authorities to pressure patients into surgery rather than advising them on other forms of contraception.
"These women have become victims because of the target-based approach to population control," said Brinda Karat of the All India Democratic Women's Association, who has demanded that the state's health minister resign.
India has one of the world's worst records on maternal health care, with 200 women dying during pregnancy or childbirth for every 100,000 patients, compared with China's 37 deaths for every 100,000 women who give birth. Its infant mortality rate — 63 of every 1,000 newborns die — also makes it one of the worst places on Earth to be born. By comparison, China records about 15 infant deaths for every 1,000 births.
The women who underwent surgery on Saturday were each paid about $10, and all 83 surgeries were performed within six hours, the state's chief medical officer, Dr. S.K. Mandal, told the Associated Press by telephone.
"That is not usual," he said, but declined to comment further until the autopsies had determined exactly what went wrong.
The state suspended four government doctors, including the surgeon who oversaw the operations and the district's chief medical officer.
"It appears the incident occurred due to negligence" by doctors, Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh said, before urging patience for the autopsy results. He also said the victims' families would each receive a compensation payment of about $6,600.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in Myanmar, where he was on an official visit, that he had spoken with Singh and urged a thorough investigation.
Meanwhile, the state's surgeons held an emergency meeting Tuesday night to discuss whether to continue with the state's sterilization schedule, with a target of 180,000 for the year ending in March set by the central government, Mandal said. They also were discussing surgery practices and guidelines, he said.
The World Health Organization advises that a patient be monitored for 48 hours after undergoing laparoscopic, or "keyhole," sterilization surgeries like those conducted in Bilaspur. The procedure is one of the most commonly performed, minimally invasive surgeries, and is usually done under local anasthetic.
A spokeswoman for the federal Health Ministry declined to confirm whether the central government was setting sterilization quotas. India's central government had said it stopped setting targets for sterilizing women in the 1990s.
India was one of the first countries to introduce family planning as a government program in the 1960s, when the country's population was less than half what it is today at about 450 million. But outrage erupted in the 1970s after Prime Minister Indira Gandhi imposed a policy of forcibly sterilizing men who had already fathered two children. Opponents at the time said the program also targeted unmarried and poor men, with doctors given bonuses for operating on low-income patients. Since then, vasectomies have been relatively unpopular in India, with only about 1 percent of men opting for the procedure.

Automakers push more with less in subcompact crossovers2
That raises another question: How many crossovers are too many? The Honda CR-V, along with the Toyota RAV4, kicked off the crossover craze in the mid- to late '90s. Some might put the Subaru Outback wagon in that class, and some may say that the Jeep Cherokee predated them all. But the vast majority of CR-V and RAV4 owners had no intention of doing double duty off road.
Off-road capability — and construction — is a big distinction in what separates a crossover from a larger sport utility vehicle. Another difference is historical, since SUVs used to be built with body-on-frame construction, same as a pickup truck, making them more durable, off-road capable, easier to fix, and longer lasting. But the ride was rougher, bulkier and stiffer than most drivers preferred, and the fuel economy was poor. The 1997 CR-V had unibody construction like that of a car and changed the trajectory of CUVs and SUVs alike, so that even midsize SUVs have gotten unibody construction in our fuel-conscious times.
"The walls have been obliterated between CUVs and SUVs," Brauer says. "There isn't much functional difference now in what they can do."
The market is flooded with quasi utility vehicles. Honda has the Pilot SUV, the CR-V and now the HR-V, which will take over the spot of the Crosstour oddity. Lexus, which carved out the upscale CUV niche with the RX350 in the late 90s, is launching the smaller, sportier NX, which comes as a turbocharged gas model or a hybrid variant. Nissan offers the full-size Armada SUV, the midsize Pathfinder SUV, the Xterra sport SUV, the Murano crossover, the Rogue compact crossover and the Juke, whose sales are having a typical dip four years into the model. Chevy offers the full-size Suburban SUV, the midsize Tahoe SUV, Traverse crossover, Equinox compact crossover and now the Trax subcompact crossover.
Despite his doubt about the HR-V, Brauer is bullish on the Trax. "It can be produced at relatively low cost, and because the Equinox is so big they can call it little brother and charge a little less," he says.
The Chevy Trax starts at $20,995, about $3,500 less than the Equinox. The Trax is 20 inches shorter than the Equinox, has only 48.4 cubic feet compared to 63.7 cubic feet in the Equinox, and gets 34 mpg highway to 32 mpg for the compact crossover. Both have available all-wheel drive and 4G LTE connectivity.
Ford is one of the few automakers content with being positioned out of the new sweet spot. The third generation of the Escape compact crossover was ushered in 2013, and sales have been good. "We've been monitoring sales between the super segment of the Escape and the Fusion, and we're very happy with the portfolio we have set up right now," says Aaron Miller, who does product communication at Ford.
Yet there is a little brother based on the Fiesta platform named the EcoSport that has been gallivanting about Asia and South America with much success. Ford's not saying anything, but all signs are pointing homeward bound.

Columns: No point hoarding dead wheatstocksGold futures price falls on global cues
After exporting about 14 million tonnes (mt) of wheat between 2012 and May 2014, India stands isolated in the world market despite having almost 17 mt (as of October 1) of excess stock in the central pool after accounting for the holding under the buffer norm, of 14 mt.
Wheat futures prices, tracked by the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT), fell by 22% in last one year, which cannot be attributed solely to supply-demand divergence or drop in crude oil values. The primary reason for this sharp reduction can be nailed to the Russian—Ukraine (Black Sea nations) conflict and the subsequent sanctions/counter-sanctions.
These two countries export about  35 mt of wheat annually against the  28-30 mt exported by the US. Ukraine alone exports 20 mt of corn. Thus, Black Sea countries are a determining factor for the price discovery of grains, thus, these have a direct bearing on the quotes at CBOT. Logically, bilateral and multilateral geo-political tensions should have curtailed these nations’ capabilities to export, while opposite has transpired.
Post-conflict financial fetters applied by the US and the EU led to 30% and 55% depreciation in the Russian and Ukrainian currencies, respectively. The entire agro complex is thus rattled by lower prices of wheat and corn which have pulled down soybean, sugar, edible oil, ethanol values. Russia and Ukraine also offer blended versions of milling and feed-grade wheat, which can be priced as low as $210-$220/mt fob.
Unless there is a considerable appreciation in the currencies or grain supplies in this region are choked due to harvest losses, drought or war, the revival of prices to the 2012-13 levels (around $350/mt fob) is not foreseen. On the contrary, a higher world output will keep the downward pressure on wheat prices. Pakistan has imposed a 20% import duty from November 5 onwards to curb imports by private traders—who fear further fall in the future values—to protect its domestic supply. The import of at least 1 mt by Pakistan from the Black Sea nations is expected in 2014-15.
The Indian government has been very quick in mopping up stocks, but has always dithered in liquidating the huge inventory. The moot point is whether India wants to remain a silent spectator of market movements or make an effort to bite into the commodity cake through proactive action. For the last 25years, various governments remained inert observers. By keeping stocks dead, the officialdom is displaying very little accountability. The pricing of stocks on a marked-to-market basis means answerability. Why not consider professional opinion on the pros and cons of hoarding dead stocks vis-a-vis a realisation of 85-90% or market-related payment?
If the government is in the business of grains, then it has to mean business and minimise erosion of public funds sunk into the procurement of grains. In this backdrop, does the WTO matters? Yes, it does. India must set aside its tough stance and hail the peace clause which insulates India till 2017 and settle the matter in the larger national interest. It will be a win—win agreement for all.
The prime minister has urged secretaries of various ministries to come up with novel ideas of good and deliverable governance. The food secretary tweeted on November 3, 2014, FCI’s stocks, detailed year-wise till October 2014, from which it can be inferred that FCI has around 6-7 mt of the 2013-14 crop of wheat. This grain will become 3-years old by April 2015, in just five months. It is incurring a carrying cost and is being stored in poor conditions. It is preferable to sell the new crop to Indian consumers while the old one can be disposed of abroad.
For increasing the profitability of the old crop, exclude taxes. Taxes are not exportable. That is the international norm. Recall that at the Heathrow airport in London, VAT is refunded. Discount the carrying cost of two years, if it doesn’t attract buyers. The old crop can be pared suitably by 10%. Match the world price under the WTO peace clause and earn $1.6-1.7 billion (R10,000 crore) by activating exports. If a similar solution is being considered for the private sugar mills, why not for publicly funded grains?
The government lost two valuable opportunities, the first one in Q4FY13, when it dithered in offloading wheat slightly below a $300/mt fob price, and again, in Q4FY14, when it failed to sell at about $270/mt fob. Any lack of action now will leave us stuck with another precipitative fall, to about $ 200/mt fob. Isn’t it better to realise $235-240/mt right now than to keep perpetuating losses by hoarding? Any temporary spikes in the prices should be taken advantage of, provided the authorities are ready with right policy frame work.
The price of internationally-tradable Indian wheat is $235/mt fob at the moment, while the government/FCI estimates it at $265-270/mt, based on current MSP and logistics costs. This underscores how urgently India must move forward.

Panel moots stiff 27% revenue-neutral Goods and Service TaxFIPB role shrinks amid easier FDI flows
A panel set up by the state governments has proposed revenue-neutral rates (RNRs) for the central and state components of the proposed goods and services tax (GST) at 12.77% and 13.91%, respectively.
Analysts said these rates are nearly the same as — if not slightly higher than — the current rates of  indirect taxes at the central and state levels. Ideally, the rates for GST, which captures a much larger tax base, ought to be significantly lower than current rates and bring concomitant additional competitive strength to the economy.
The states had in 2010 opposed a much lower GST rate of 12% (7% for state GST and 5% for central GST) proposed by a task force associated with the 13th Finance Commission, calling it too low and impractical. Some other agencies have since recommended relatively higher rates but most still lower than what the states’ panel has now suggested.
Of course, the task force assumed a much larger base of R31,25,325 crore at the then prevailing prices (given inclusion of most products including petroleum in the GST) while the states’ panel has assumed exclusion of petroleum from GST and took the values of 2011-12.
Globally, the average GST/VAT rate is around 16.4%. The average rate in Asia-Pacific is 9.88% and Canada and Nigeria have the lowest rate of 5%.
The proposed combined RNR of 26.68% for GST would mean that India won’t have any competitive advantage over most of its leading trading partners, sources said.
“The objectives of GST such as freer credit flow and removal of inefficiencies in the current system can be achieved only when the central and state GST rates taken together is less than the current central excise/service tax plus the highest VAT rate presently being levied across states,” said Bipin Sapra, partner at EY.
After a meeting of the empowered committee of state finance ministers here, its chairman and Jammu & Kashmir’s finance minister Abdul Rahim Rather said on Tuesday that states would give their views in writing on the RNRs suggested by the panel in a week.
“We have decided to refer this report to NIPFP (National Institute of Public Finance and Policy). These recommendations are based on the figures of 2011-12, the base year they have taken, which will have to be updated with the latest (2013-14) figures). After the empowered committee takes a final view on the RNR, it will be conveyed to the Centre. After the Centre and states reach a consensus on RNR rates, the proposed GST Council will ratify them.”
“Industry expected a wider tax base and a (combined) rate lower than 20% discussed earlier. At the proposed rates, although the increase may be marginal for goods that don’t enjoy concessional excise/VAT rates now, that would be rather steep for many merit goods,” said R Muralidharan, senior director at Deloitte.
Significantly, the states have said the the turnover threshold for entities to be covered under GST must be fixed at Rs 10 lakh instead of Rs 25 lakh proposed by the Centre. The idea also is to zero-rate the GST for petroleum products. This means that the states and Centre will continue to levy their separate taxes on these products while the value chains including these won’t be broken and deprive businesses of input tax credit, the key feature of GST.
“States have already said that petroleum, alcohol and tobacco should be excluded from GST. We are waiting for response from Centre,” Rather said. Meanwhile, the Centre is redrafting the GST Constitutional Amendment Bill (an earlier Bill lapsed with the dissolution of the previous Lok Sabha), as most issued have now been resolved with states. “We have not received the revised draft Bill yet,” Rather said.
Experts have long said that for GST to be a high-utility tax reform, it should have a very broad base, subsume most central and state taxes and levies and be extremely stingy about exemptions. The idea is to bring in a system that could militate against cascading of taxes in B2B transactions.

Madras HC dismisses unions petition against Chennai airport privatisationFIPB role shrinks amid easier FDI flows
The Madras High Court has dismissed a petition by the Airport’s Authority Employees’ Union challenging the privatisation of the Chennai airport, pointing out that it was neither within the domain of the court nor the scope of judicial review to embark upon an inquiry as to whether a particular public policy was wise or a better one could be evolved.
Justice MM Sundresh, while disposing the petition, said: “Nor are the courts inclined to strike down a policy at the behest of a petitioner merely because it has been urged that a different policy would have been fairer or wiser or more scientific or more logical. Wisdom and advisability of economic policy are ordinarily not amenable to judicial review. In matters relating to economic issues the government has, while taking a decision, right to trial and error as long as both trial and error are bona fide and within the limits of the authority. For testing the correctness of a policy, the appropriate forum is Parliament and not the courts.”
The Madras HC had granted an interim injunction on the union’s plea in January this year, restraining AAI and adjourned the matter for further hearing.
V Prakash, counsel for the petitioner, submitted that no formal order has been passed by the Centre by way of a policy decision. The board of AAI has not been consulted. The impugned decision was contrary to Section 9A of the Industrial Disputes Act as it would likely lead towards retrenchment. The decision would create two sets of employees, one from the proposed successful bidder and the other the existing employees, who are the members of the petitioner union, the counsel argued.
G Rajagopalan, additional solicitor general, appeared for the Centre, submitted that the writ petition was not maintainable on law and facts. The petitioner, being a union cannot question the policy decision. The interest of the petitioner has been taken into consideration in the impugned document itself. The entire process is at the threshold stage and the report of the parliamentary committee would be considered at the appropriate time. A subsequent report would not nullify the earlier decision taken.

For first time  NSE Nifty breaches 8 400-level on capitalinflowsONGC: Subsidy sharing clarity on cards?
The NSE Nifty crossed the 8,400-mark for the first time in late morning trade today and hit a new lifetime high of 8,407.35, led by a rally in auto, banking and infrastructure stocks on sustained inflow of foreign capital.
The 50-issue Nifty crossed the 8,400-level for the first time by gaining 44.70 points, or 0.53 per cent, to trade at a lifetime high of 8,407.35, surpassing its previous intra-day high of 8,383.05 touched on November 10.
Brokers said sentiments remained upbeat on continued buying by foreign funds and retail investors amid a series of economic reforms undertaken by the Narendra Modi-led government and strong earnings by blue-chip companies.
Besides, expectations of encouraging inflation data for October and IIP numbers for September also buoyed trading sentiments, they added.
Major gainers which supported the Nifty were – ICICI Bank (up 1.15 per cent to Rs 1,705), SBI (up 0.68 per cent to Rs 2,759), Punjab National Bank (up 0.31 per cent to Rs 957), Infosys (up 0.24 per cent to Rs 4,135) and Tata Consultancy Services (up 0.91 per cent to Rs 2,604.30).

Sensex up 98.84 pts  closes above 28 000-mark for first time; Nifty ends at new peak of8 383.30ONGC: Subsidy sharing clarity on cards?
The BSE Sensex today closed above the 28,000-mark for the first time and the Nifty touched 8,400-level with sustained buying by foreign funds in auto, banking, FMCG and consumer durable stocks amid hopes of easing inflation and encouraging IIP numbers.
Continuing its surge for the third day, the BSE Sensex hit fresh life-time high of 28,126.48. After paring some gains, the 30-share index settled at an all-time closing high of 28,008.90, up by 98.84 points, or 0.35 per cent, over the previous close. It surpassed the earlier record closing of 27,915.88 touched on November 5.
The gauge had gained 41.43 points in the previous two sessions.
It took 45 trading sessions from September 2 to November 12 to reach the psychological 28,000-level from 27,000.
The NSE Nifty crossed the key 8,400-mark for the first time to hit an all-time high of 8,415.05, breaching its earlier record of 8,383.05 on November 10.
However, some profit-booking at record levels trimmed part of gains but the Nifty ended at a new record high of 8,383.30, up 20.65 points. It surpassed its previous closing peak of 8,362.65 in yesterday’s trade.
A host of positive developments on domestic as well as global fronts buoyed the market and lifted key indices to new highs.
Brokers said sentiment remained positive and foreign funds continued their buying spree on the domestic bourses and retail investors enlarged positions amid strong quarterly earnings posted by blue-chip companies and hopes of further push to economic reforms by the Centre after the recent Cabinet reshuffle.
Further, expectations of encouraging economic data such as inflation for October and IIP numbers for September, to be released after market hours today, buoyed trading sentiments, they said.
Meanwhile, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) remained the main driving force behind the current bull-run. FPIs bought shares worth a net Rs 458.04 crore yesterday, according to provisional data from the stock exchanges.
Sensex components which supported the key indices to hit fresh life-time high were Axis Bank (3.02 pc), Bajaj Auto (2.10 pc), HDFC Ltd (1.12 pc), SBI (0.17 pc), ICICI Bank (1.33 pc), HDFC Bank (0.44 pc), ITC Ltd (1.55 pc), Bharti Airtel (0.64 pc), BHEL (0.88 pc), Coal India (0.10 pc), Dr Reddy (0.58 pc), Hero MotoCorp (1.50 pc), Tata Motors (1.71 pc) and TCS (0.55 pc).
Sectorwise, BSE Auto index gained the most by rising 1.18 per cent, followed by Bank index 1.12 per cent, FMCG 0.96 per cent and Consumer Durables index 0.55 per cent.
Buying activity in small and midcap also gathered momentum, with the BSE midcap index rising by 0.47 per cent and smallcap index by 0.20 per cent.
Indian shares hit record highs before CPI data
(Reuters) Indian shares touched record highs for the second time this week as rate-sensitive stocks such as Axis Bank rose on hopes easing inflation would prompt the central bank to cut interest rates earlier than expected.
Consumer inflation in October, due at 5:30 p.m. (1200 GMT), is expected to have eased to a record low of 5.80 percent, dragged by sharp drops in food and oil prices, according to a Reuters poll.
If the forecast is met, it would also make the central bank’s inflation targets – 8 percent by January 2015 and 6 percent a year later – appear more attainable.
“The market is expecting inflation to come down very fast. So if the rates are not cut then certainly some momentum will be lost,” said Vinod Nair, head of fundamental research at Geojit BNP Paribas Financial Services Ltd.
The benchmark BSE index closed 0.35 percent up, after earlier rising as much as 0.78 percent to an all-time high of 28,126.48.
The broader NSE index rose 0.25 percent after earlier gaining as much as 0.63 percent to a record high of 8,415.05.
Rate-sensitive stocks led, with Axis Bank rising 3.1 percent and ICICI Bank ending 1.3 percent higher.
Kotak Mahindra Bank rose 1.7 percent and HDFC Bank  advanced 0.4 percent.     Among non-banking lenders, Mahindra and Mahindra Financial Services Ltd surged 7.5 percent, while LIC Housing Finance ended 4.1 percent higher.
Some auto stocks also rose. Two-wheeler manufacturers Bajaj Auto gained 2 percent, Hero MotoCorp ended 1.5 percent higher, while car maker Maruti Suzuki India  gained 0.9 percent.
Tata Motors also advanced 2 percent on optimism ahead of its September-quarter earnings on Friday.
Tyre shares rose as investors expect falling crude oil and rubber price to boost companies’ margins.
Apollo Tyres gained 3.2 percent, JK Tyre and Industries rose 3.1 percent and Ceat Ltd  ended 6.6 percent higher.
Bayer CropScience ended up 10.2 percent after earlier marking its all-time high of 2,749 rupees after its September-quarter profit growth bucked the trend of weak earnings at rivals.
Among decliners, consumer goods stocks fell on worries that higher-than-expected good and services tax (GST) may restrict profit growth. Media reports on Wednesday said a government panel suggested GST rate of 27 percent.
Hindustan Unilever Ltd HLL.NS&gt; fell 0.3 percent and Marico Ltd lost 1.7 percent.

Why Many Americans Still Don t Have Internet Access  In 4 ChartsWhy Many Americans Still Don't Have Internet Access, In 4 Charts
Posted:

In some American cities, up to 40 percent of households don't have an Internet connection, according to a new analysis based on census data.
Bill Callahan, director of the digital access advocacy group Connect Your Community 2.0 , crunched numbers from the U.S. Census Bureau to find the best- and worst-connected major American cities.
More than a quarter of households in the U.S. don’t have a computer with an Internet connection, according to the 2013 American Community Survey released by the Census Bureau in September. The report was the first Community Survey to look at rates of Internet connection by detailed geographic location.
Callahan's analysis of the census data shows how dramatically these rates vary across the 176  American cities that have 50,000 households or more. Laredo, Texas, was the worst-connected big city, with 40.2 percent of households lacking Internet access, according to Callahan’s analysis. Detroit wasn’t far behind, with 39.9 percent of households offline. On the other end of the spectrum, Irvine, California and Cary, North Carolina, were the best-connected cities, with less than 5 percent of households in each city lacking an Internet connection.
All 176 cities are plotted out in our map. Later this year, the Census Bureau is expected to release data on less populated regions, which tend to be less connected than urban and suburban areas. Internet access is also stratified by age, race and household income, as shown in the charts below.
In terms of connectivity, the U.S. lags behind other wealthy countries, some of which consider Internet access a public good. A report released last month by the New America Foundation’s Open Technology Institute details just how much slower and pricier Internet connection is in American cities compared to other places in the world.

Gold price bounces back from lowerlevelsGold futures price falls on global cues
Gold price bounces back from lower levels on Wednesday, but struggling to sustain on higher levels as US dollar close to four-years highs. Holdings in SPDR Gold Trust, the world’s top Gold-backed exchange-traded fund, fell 0.12 percent to 724.46 tonnes on Tuesday – a fresh six-years low.
This is the fund’s straight six days outflows and shows investor bearish sentiment in Gold. Gold producers are feeling the pinch of lower prices and South Africa’s Anglo Gold Ashanti said that it planing staff cuts through voluntary severances.
In upcoming days, we can expect COMEX Gold December Futures prices to trade on negative note on stronger U. S. dollar as it is near four year high.
Technically, If COMEX Gold breaks the level of $1140 then it can test the levels of $1120 and $1100 on the downside. If MCX Gold December futures breaks the level of 25150 on downside then movement can be seen till the levels of 24950 and 24720.

IIT-M wants to go the Stanford wayIIT-M wants to go the Stanford way

But the Incubtion Cell at the institute will need to overcome funding hurdles
When Kishore Natarajan and his friends turned down job offers that would pocket them Rs. 60 lakh a year, it was tough convincing their relatives. But for them, it was an easier decision. As students of IIT Madras, Natarajan and his four friends had founded their start-up HyperVerge in late 2013. They developed a low-cost system for Indian Railwaysto inspect overhead lines, from which locomotives draw power.
Success in the project spurred the youngsters, aged between 22 and 24 years, to opt for entrepreneurship over a nine-to-five job. The founders are now working on an image recognition technology for taking photographs and storing them. In their short entrepreneurial journey, “IIT-M’s ecosystem has been critical,” says Natarajan.
HyperVerge is one of the 30 start-ups under the premier institute’s Incubation Cell, which came up in 2013. The Cell formalised an ecosystem that has been brewing in the IIT-M campus for the past three decades. “At least 20 start-ups, such as Desicrew and Midas Communications, came from IIT-M from 1980s to the 1990s. Since 2007, over 70 companies have been incubated”, says Tamaswati Ghosh, In-Charge of the Incubation Cell.
There is a reason for the spurt in start-ups. “Most of the students are now from middle and upper-middle-class families and don’t have financial obligations. So, instead of regular jobs, they can opt to become entrepreneurs,” says Ashok Jhunjhunwala, a Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering. He is also the Co-chairman and Faculty-in-Charge of the Cell.
As the number of start-ups increased, there was a need to build a structure that handholds the young businessmen in their initial years. The most visible aspect of the new ecosystem is the IITM Research Park. The Park hosts 24 of the 30 start-ups and also has R&D labs of leading companies such as Tata Consultancy Services and BHEL.
The start-ups, which get a seed funding of Rs. 5 lakh from the Cell, can lease office space at discounted rates. The fund and the space are critical for a start-up like Ather Energy, which is developing an electric scooter with a battery that is three times smaller and lighter than existing ones.
“We continue to be guided by the faculty and have access to labs in IIT Madras. Also, with the brand of IIT backing us, we can reach out to the alumni,” says Ather co-founder Tarun Mehta. That proved crucial for Ather’s team when an alumnus gave them a start on building a supply chain for the electric scooter.
Alumni support
Separately, the alumni have also been generous. Ather’s first angel investor was an IIT-Madras alumnus. Similarly, when two of Natarajan’s colleagues visited the US to raise funds earlier this year, they got twice the money that they needed, thanks to the alumni network.
The seniors have also come back to the campus. Senthil Nathan passed out of IIT-Madras in 1980 and co-founded two companies before selling them. Now, along with his former IIT classmate SV Ramanan, Nathan has founded RelAgent, which is based in the Research Park. “It is high time that we take IIT-Madras to the standards of Stanford and MIT,” says Nathan.

No  Regulation Is Not Keeping The Financial Industry From Making MoneyNo, Regulation Is Not Keeping Banks From Making Money
Posted:
Michael Bloomberg on Monday told a room full of bankers, traders, and investors that financial regulation was hurting their profitability and the U.S. economy. It was crowd-pleasing, but wrong.
In a speech at the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association's annual conference in New York,
Bloomberg criticized the Dodd-Frank financial reforms, saying , "if you reduce the risk, they can’t make the money, they can’t provide the financing that this country and world needs to create jobs and build infrastructure and all of those things." Bloomberg's anti-regulation comments were applauded by the crowd, BuzzFeed's Matthew Zeitlin reported .
But have banks really stopped being able to "make the money"? The answer is clearly no: As a percentage of total U.S. profits, the financial sector has bounced back remarkably well from the crisis it caused and the recession it triggered.
Banks' profits have been just under 30 percent of total corporate profits for the past few years, which is right about where they were during the mid-2000's boom. And this is still not a case of low profits elsewhere making banks' profits look relatively bigger. U.S. corporate profits have surged since the recession, and financial profits have gained back their pre-crises share. On an absolute basis, total U.S. financial profits are higher than they were before the crisis.
It might be true that, without financial reform, banks could be making even more money. But the idea that banks must make as much or more money than they currently do to help the U.S. economy grow, as Bloomberg suggested, is not supported by the facts.
For instance, JPMorgan Chase, the biggest bank in the U.S. by deposits, has been doing relatively less and less of the kind of lending that supports economic growth, precisely as its profitability has soared. In 2008, the bank lent out just under 75 cents for every dollar of deposits it took in. It is now lending out 56 cents on the dollar.
Though JPMorgan's deposits have ballooned, the most profitable investments for it to make with those deposits aren't loans, but instead things like credit derivatives . In fact, with interest rates as low as they are, more lending might mean lower bank profits.
Contrary to Bloomberg's comments, banks are making plenty of money in spite of new regulations. And they are increasingly making their profits from activities that have little to do with job creation and building infrastructure.
Reached by The Huffington Post, Bloomberg LP spokesman Ty Trippet declined to provide additional comment.

Gold firms up on seasonal demand  overseascuesSnapping a two-session downtrend, gold prices firmed up at the domestic bullion market today due to renewed buying interest from jewelery stockists as well as retailers on the back of rising wedding season demand.
Silver, on the other hand, continued to trade sluggish owing to poor buying support.
Standard gold (99.5 purity) rose by Rs 145 to finish at Rs 25,830 per 10 grams from Tuesday’s closing level of Rs 25,685.
Pure gold (99.9 purity) also hardened by a similar margin to close at Rs 25,980 per 10 grams against Rs 25,835.
Silver (.999 fineness), however moved down by Rs 50 to settle at Rs 35,890 per kg compared to Rs 35,940 yesterday.
In the international markets, yellow-metal maintained its overnight gains, but gains were capped on the back of sustained selling by bullion funds coupled with strong dollar.
Spot gold was bid higher at USD 1,161.50 an ounce in early European trade.

Sterilisation  why only womenThe gender bias in the family planning programme mirrors discriminatory social attitudes
November 12, 2014:  
“It was as if the doctors had been given a contract to kill,” wailed the husband of a woman who was among those who died in Chhattisgarh after a botched sterilisation procedure at a free family planning camp held by the State government. According to reports, over 80 such operations were done in six hours, presumably to meet the ‘target’. The result: 11 women died and over 50 are ‘critical’.
The crux of the problem, however, is the gradual shift in the government’s focus: targeting women rather than creating awareness among men. In the 70s and 80s, the family planning programme advertised on buses, autos, trains, hoardings, wall writings, television and radio commercials urged men to use contraceptives by propagating the use of ‘Nirodh’ condoms. It came from the realisation in that the onus of family planning lay with men, apart from protecting them from STD and infections. But gradually, however, the government’s population control programmes started to focus on women, and contraceptives such as copper-T and Mala-D tablets were introduced.
After the spread of HIV/AIDS in and after the 90s, the use of condoms was once again propagated by agencies such as NACO. But that too has petered out. Now, even though ‘designer’ condoms flood the market, targeting educated young men, vasectomy has not become popular as a majority of men believe their ‘virility’ will be undermined.
Consequently, female sterilisation has been rising. This is set off against targets and financial incentives to poor women, whose health is anyway fragile. According to a Bloomberg report, government-imposed quotas and financial sops for doctors in 2012 lead to the sterilisation of 4.6 million women, “many for cash payments and many in the unsanitary and rudimentary conditions.” Vasectomies accounted for just 4 per cent of all sterilisations.
India adds on average 18 million people each year. While population control does need to be taken up on a war-footing, it is time the Government did away with target-driven family planning aimed at women. They are easy prey and easily exploited, whether “it is government officials or their husbands asking them to undergo the operation,” as Human Rights Watch said in a report documenting coercion at sterilisation camps held in 2012.

Economic cheer: Sept factory output up 2.5%  inflation downConsumer Price Index-based inflation at 3-year low in Oct
New Delhi, November 12:  
Wednesday brought double delight for the economy with the retail inflation dipping to a record low of 5.52 per cent in October and factory output surging by 2.5 per cent in September.
Continuing its downward trend, Consumer Price Index-based inflation hit a new low of 5.52 per cent in October on softening prices of food items. This is the lowest since January 2012 when the new series of data for computing CPI was introduced.
Overall food and beverages inflation was 5.68 per cent in October compared to 7.67 per cent in the previous month.
This has revived expectations of a rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India, which considers CPI-based inflation its monetary policy anchor.
Powering up
Showing signs of recovery, industrial production grew 2.5 per cent in September. The index for industrial production comes with a lag of a month.
Growth in electricity generation and manufacturing pushed up the IIP. The power sector growth was 3.9 per cent while manufacturing grew at 2.5 per cent, a Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation statement said. Manufacturing accounts for a weight of over 75 per cent in the index and the power sector for 10.32 per cent.
The mining sector, which accounts 14.6 per cent in the IIP, had a relatively slower growth at 2.5 per cent.
“The upturn in industrial production underpins the perception that the growth momentum is positive for industry and the economy is showing signs of revival based on the ‘feel good’ factor and positive investor sentiment,” said Chandrajit Banerjee, Director-General of CII.
According to use-based classification, basic goods grew 5.1 per cent in September 2014, over the same month last year, while capital goods and intermediate goods posted an increase of 11.6 per cent and 1.8 per cent respectively. Consumer durables contracted by 11.3 per cent while consumer non-durables grew 1.5 per cent.

Matt Williams named Manager of the YearBy Jena McGregor November 12 Follow @jenamcgregor
(Photo by Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images)
It's a little unusual that Washington Nationals skipper Matt Williams  won the National League Manager of the Year award Tuesday night.
That's not only because it was just his first season at the helm, and that he made some post-season calls that many blamed for a stunted October run (the votes for the award are made during the regular season). It is also unusual because, as the Post's Adam Kilgore writes , it's rare that managers of teams with lofty preseason expectations get such honors. More often, the baseball writers who vote on the award pick managers who work miracles with lesser rosters.
Yet the stockpile of talent on the Nationals team is far from a reason to overlook Williams' managerial skills. He won the National League East by a 17-game lead, better than any team in baseball. He won 96 games in the regular season, a 10-game improvement on the year prior and the best in the National League. And he did all that in a year that followed a disappointing postseason , the retirement of a  well-loved veteran predecessor and a rash of injuries among players.
How Williams did it appears to be a mix of making smart adjustments  in response to those injuries, listening to his players and using his trademark attention to detail. He showed that he holds everyone on the team to the same standard when he benched Bryce Harper. As General Manager Mike Rizzo has said , he "exuded leadership and calmness."
A few pitching calls that contributed to post-season losses — one of them epic , the other a " disastrous " end to the October run — are sure to haunt Williams in the year ahead. But for a manager as intensely focused, well prepared and attuned to his players' differences  as Williams seems to be , that heartache may not last very long.

Memory foam pillow prices can be anything but a dream, so how do you know you're getting a good deal?
According to the experts, a cheap memory foam pillow can offer just as much satisfaction as an expensive one. But when it comes to something as personal as sleep, some customers swear by their pricey pillows.
Technically, "memory foam" is open-cell polyurethane-silicon plastic and is known for its "viscoelastic" properties. That means it’s super soft, absorbent and bounces back to its original shape after compression.  
First invented by NASA scientists in the 60's, the squishy material is found in shoes, motorcycle seats, helmets, wheelchair seats, mattresses and pillows—pillows in every imaginable shape and size: snuggle side pillows, dual sided, Euro style, arc shaped, side cut, anti-snoring. 
There’s even a special memory foam pillow just for naps. And they cost anywhere from $20 to more than $200. One brand, Tempur-Pedic, sells their "GrandPillow" for a whopping $399.
On average, owners paid $40 for a memory foam pillow, according to SleepLikeTheDead.com , an independent sleep product research site. A Consumer Reports buying guide found little difference between the high-end and low-end brands in terms of comfort, sleep and construction quality.
That hasn't stopped some customers from shelling out big bucks to get their sweet dreams.
Northern Virginia stay-at-home dad Brian Holoubek, who stands 6’6” tall, admits he got hooked 15 years ago on the entire foam system: bed, pillows and a knee pillow.
“I have four different styles of memory pillows just for the guest room,” said Holoubek. The total cost? North of $2000.
Other sleepers have found they're just as happy with their pillows at lower price points.
Jodi Helmer, a North Carolina-based writer, bought a cheap brand at first to see if she liked the firmness and contours.
“It was a baby step before investing in a brand name pillow,” said Helmer. She fell in love and stuck with the knock-off brand.
“It’s great so I never traded up,” she added.
Dr. Karen Erickson, a member of the American Chiropractic Association, urges consumers to think carefully about the postural effects.
“The pillow has a lot to do with how you rest so choose a pillow that is designed to fit the way you sleep,” said Erickson.
But some pillows don't seem to work no matter what the price.
When Sara Lafe bought a memory foam pillow she hoped it would be a “cherry on top of a cloud-like sleeping experience.”
After all, the health research scientist said, her memory foam mattress topper “changed my life,” so a similar pillow seemed like a no-brainer.
Lafe spent around $40 on her first foam pillow and woke up with neck pain. She upgraded to a fancy, expensive brand but found it was just as uncomfortable. 
Nowadays, she says, "I just move the pillow and sleep straight on the mattress.”

From 28k peak  market eyesmacrosONGC: Subsidy sharing clarity on cards?
Improving domestic macros, supported by a sharp plunge in crude oil prices, have fulled interest in the Indian equity markets, which is reflected in the multiple peaks scaled by the 30-share Sensex this year.
On Wednesday, the benchmark index reached another milestone, closing above 28,000 for the first time. The Sensex ended the session at 28,008.9, up 98.84 points, or 0.35%.
At a time when global commodity prices are cooling off, India provides a better growth potential than its emerging market peers, making it the preferred choice of foreign investors.
Global investment bank Macquarie draws a parallel between India and Indonesia, with both countries having seen a regime change in 2014 and enjoying a favourable structural growth potential. Investor expectations for reform delivery are, however, higher from PM Narendra Modi than Indonesian president Jokowi, it says.
“In India, the conclusive election outcome, assuring political stability, and Modi’s good track record have raised investor expectations regarding the government’s ability to undertake much-needed structural reforms,” says Macquarie.
The contours of market rally over the last few months indicate that the Street is keeping a close watch on the pace of reforms undertaken by the BJP government, and that a stronger reform directive may be required for higher FII purchases.
Between late March and early June, the Senex mopped up gains of 3,000 points in just 45 trading sessions on pre- and post-election euphoria.
However, after the Union Budget was presented in July, the rally fizzled out, with investors awaiting clarity on the policy framework.
While the market alpped up the government decisions to deregulate diesel prices and carry out fresh auctions of coal blocks, experts have stressed on the importance of sustained economic reforms.
According to Kotak Institutional Equities, India will gain from the emerging global scenario if it continues to pursue the right policy mix to improve its macros.
Deutchse Bank, which recently set a Sensex target of 29,000 for March 2015, expects aggressive reform-oriented policies to emerge as a core catalyst for markets.

Poor output forces Maharashtra soya farmers to seek govthelpGold futures price falls on global cues
Soya farmers in Maharashtra are not very happy with their crop prospects this season. Farmers, who faced a seed crunch at the start of the kharif season, are urging the government to set up procurement centres to begin purchase operations.
Farmers in Vidarbha, Akola, Nanded and Parbhani districts of the state are worst-affected and have been complaining that their seeds have not germinated in time. Mahabeej, the state seed corporation that has a 45% share in the state’s soya seed business says the delay in rains affected the crop and the seed quality cannot be blamed for the shortfall in production. According to the Soybean Processors Association of India (SOPA), productivity in Maharashtra has gone down by 15%.
Incidentally, Maharashtra ranks number one in the country in terms of productivity and produces some 1.3 tonne per hectare. In Maharashtra, the area under soybean cultivation during Kharif 2014 is 38.008 lakh hectares as compared to 38.704 lakh hectares during Kharif 2013. A yield of 808 kg per hectare and production of 30.721 lakh tonne has been estimated for Kharif 2014.
According to the SOPA spokesperson and coordinator, Maharashtra has been affected by the delay in monsoon. Last year the rains were not enough as a result of which the sizes of beans have been affected in most areas. SOPA had given an estimate of 30 lakh tonne for Maharashtra and this is likely to come down by 15%. Normally, crop production estimates for Maharashtra are around 38 lakh tonne.
Nanasaheb Patil, member, Nafed, the agency that participates in MSP operations, said the need for procurement seeds has not arisen. Prices are currently at R3,000 per quintal while MSP is at R2500 per quintal, he said.
Umakant Gawande, who looks after Quality Control at Mahabeej, says that the seeds supplied by the corporation have gone through the due diligence process and have been released in the market after proper trials. This year, the monsoons were late and farmers were in hurry to sow the seeds. Since Soya is a sensitive crop, it gets affected, he pointed out. Soybean requires about five centimetres of soil moisture to germinate, and the soil moisture was not sufficient at the time of sowing.
Another reason for crop failure, according to government agencies, is that the farmers sowed the seeds using tractors, sending the seed too deep into the soil. Normally Mahabeej suplies some 4.5 lakh quintals of Soya seeds. This year, it came down to 1.52 lakh quintals, Gawande said.
It may be mentioned here that at the start of the Kharif season, the prices of certified soyabean seeds had gone up by around one third to R70 per kg in Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, the country’s main soyabean growing states. Hailstorms that occurred early this year in Maharashtra damaged soyabean resulting in reduced availability of seeds for sowing.
The state faced a crunch of soybean seed for the coming kharif season to the tune of 200,000 tonne, according to estimates given by state government officials.
The agriculture ministry has pegged the shortage of certified and quality soyabean seeds at 69,616 tonne across the country. The total requirement of soyabean seeds for kharif is pegged at 3.43 lakh tonne, whereas the availability is estimated at 2.73 lakh tonne.
Soybean is a kharif crop (sown in June-July and harvested in September-November) and is dependent on monsoon rains. The soybean season runs from October to September.

CCI asked to step up cotton purchases fromfarmersGold futures price falls on global cues
As cotton prices have crashed by around a quarter in the last one year, the government has asked the state-run Cotton Corporation of India (CCI) to step up cotton purchases from farmers at the benchmark prices.
“CCI has been asked to raise its procurement operation by opening more centres wherever necessary,” textile minister Santosh Kumar Gangwar said on Wednesday. The move is usually aimed at preventing distress sales by
farmers.
The CCI has so far procured 250,000 bales, of 170 kg each, in the current marketing year that started on October 1. Most of the purchases were from the southern state of Andhra Pradesh.
The expectations of a bumper cotton harvest in 2014-15, coupled with subdued prices globally, have weighed on domestic rates. The Cotton Association Of India has forecast that India will pip China as the world’s largest cotton producer in 2014-15, with output expected to hit 40.55 million bales, slightly lower than the record harvest of 40.72 million bales last year.
CAI president Dhiren Sheth said the country is heading for a big procurement operation at minimum support prices this season due to plentiful
supplies.
Cotton prices in Gujarat (ICS-105 fine, 29 mm variety) were ruling at R39,900 per candy of 356 kg as of November 11, down from R42,000 and R42,600 in the beginning of April and May, respectively.
Worsening the problem, demand from China has slowed considerably in 2014-15, as the world’s top consumer has aleady piled up huge stocks and is reported to be considering trimming inventory.

Editorial: Losing GST gainsFIPB role shrinks amid easier FDI flows
Though it is encouraging to hear AR Rather, the head of the empowered committee of state finance ministers on GST, say that the 2016 deadline for rolling out GST looks possible, the intransigent attitude of various states may fritter away all possible gains. As part of the 13th Finance Commission’s mandate, NCAER had estimated the gains from implementing GST at 0.9-1.7% of the GDP every year due to various efficiency gains—for instance, trucks that spend nearly 60% of their time parked at inter-state borders can now move across faster; with logistics costs cut by 20-30%, this will also give Indian manufactured goods a cost advantage. Nothing tells the story of the opportunity being frittered like the dramatic increase in the revenue-neutral-rate of taxation, a level of tax at which neither the Centre nor the states lose any part of their annual revenues. In the original formulation, the 13th Finance Commission task force had come out with a revenue-neutral-rate of 12%, 5% for the Centre and 7% for the states; given current levels of excise/service taxes and VAT rates, this is a considerably lower tax level than that prevalent at the moment. As the states began protesting, and wanted more and more goods kept outside the purview of the GST—alcohol and petroleum products, even land transactions—the revenue-neutral rate kept rising. The latest number being put out by a panel of the state governments is a mind-boggling 27%, a number that suggests there is little to be gained by even embarking on a GST since the rate is very similar to that prevalent today.
What remains unclear is why the states want all these carve-outs. On the face of things, keeping petroleum products out of GST allows them to levy higher rates of taxation than the 12% or so that will be the median rate. Ditto for alcohol. The Centre had, however, come out with a neat formulation on this, to bring petroleum and alcohol into GST at a common rate, but to then allow the states to levy a surcharge, or a sin tax, on this. Levying a GST would mean the tax chain would remain complete and, till the time the good reached the border of the state, everyone involved in producing/trading could collect an input credit—no input credit would be available for the surcharge/sin tax. Not keeping these goods under GST, however, will mean none of the taxes paid anywhere along the value chain will qualify for a rebate. Ironically, while states are worried the central government will not give them their compensation in time—for the loss in revenues due to the introduction of GST—and in adequate quantity, keeping petroleum and alcohol outside GST only worsens matters since states will need greater levels of compensation.
While there has been some progress with both the Centre and the states leaving the threshold level of taxation—the Centre wants this to be increased to R25 lakh while the states want it to be retained at the current R10 lakh—to be decided by the GST Council, the states do need to agree to not restricting the number of goods and services under GST. Anything that increases the revenue-neutral-rate of taxation makes the GST that much less worth the wait.

Editorial: E-nabling India PostUber cab suffers as driver accused of rape in Delhi; firm accused of criminal negligence
While India’s e-commerce industry continues to gallop to a likely $32 billion by 2020, a glaring gap is their logistics infrastructure. At the same time, there is an organisation with an all-India logistics infrastructure, especially in rural India where e-commerce is at its infancy, but that organisation makes R6,000 crore of losses each year. Put the two together, and you can create magic, literally. That’s what information and technology minister Ravi Shankar Prasad is trying to do while meeting the India heads of firms like Amazon and Flipkart. Whether the move succeeds or not is to be seen—India Post tied up with banks some years ago to sell mutual funds but not too much came of it—but certainly India Post is uniquely positioned to take advantage of the marriage, should it be solemnised. It has a network of 1.6 lakh post offices, the bulk of which are in rural areas. And, once the prime minister’s Digital India plan takes off, India Post will be at the heart of the programme which will connect 2.5 lakh panchayats digitally. What makes the proposed tie up between India Post and e-commerce firms more believable is that
Alibaba has managed to do quite the same with China Post—India Post has more post offices than China Post has. China’s largest e-commerce firm successfully shares warehouses with China Post and uses its processing centres and delivery workhouses—Amazon and Flipkart can well replicate this model.
Of course, having the wherewithal and achieving goals are two different things. Let’s not forget that, had it not been for India Post’s famed inefficiency, India’s successful courier industry would never have taken off—the fact is that, given a choice, people would rather use private couriers than India Post. While India Post is best suited for financial inclusion, it remains a fact that the finance ministry vigorously opposed it applying for a bank license—while it remains to be seen whether RBI considers it as a payments bank, it remains true that the big public sector banks have not used India Post to complete their banking correspondent networks either. While it is in the interests of firms like Amazon and Flipkart to work with India Post, it is up to the latter and its 4.66 lakh postmen to make it happen. And until India Post rises to the challenge of modernising itself, it is unlikely it will get far in its quest to become a payments bank either.

Columns: Dont politicise black moneyFIPB role shrinks amid easier FDI flows
The debate on black money has both political and economic overtures. If one follows the history, the debate dates back to 2011, when renowned lawyer Ram Jethmalani filed a public interest litigation petition seeking a directive from the Supreme Court (SC) to the Centre, to initiate proceedings for repatriating the funds stashed in offshore bank accounts. While wealth escaping taxes largely form the core menace, there are other non-tax forms of violations, including those under the Foreign Exchange Management Act/Rules, Anti-Bribery legislation, etc.
In the past few years, given the global debate at various multilateral forums (G-20, OECD et al) on tax havens and enforcing transparency standards in tax matters, India, dehors the change in government, has not been distanced from the world insofar as its commitment to deal with such challenges is concerned. India has played an instrumental role, as part of the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes, since its formation in 2009, and has championed the cause by signing several tax information exchange agreements with treaty and non-treaty partners, including tax havens.
India makes  tangible progress
The incumbent government’s swift action in constituting a Special Investigation Team (SIT) was a significant step towards unearthing black money. The fact that the SIT’s mandate is not restricted to cases of tax evasion makes the agency more credible in its endeavours. The members of the SIT, apart from 2 retired judges of the SC, are members from the investigative arms of the government, such as directorate of revenue intelligence, Financial Intelligence Unit, RAW, IB, enforcement directorate, etc. The expanse of the SIT’s mandate is over and above that of the concerns of the revenue department, which continues to remain administratively responsible for dealing with tax evasion cases under the domestic legislation and bilateral agreements, including preserving the terms of convention with India’s tax treaty partners.
The recent clamour over disclosing offshore account-holders’ information has taken a twist as the finance ministry believes that parting with such information until the investigation is complete—it is concluded that the offshore account being investigated is indeed illegal—could be seen as a breach of the confidentiality clause under the tax treaties. It is believed that considerable harm will be caused to bilateral relations if such disclosures are authorised and then adequate evidence is not found to proceed against the errant tax-payers.
Incidentally, the former finance minister, P Chidambaram, held a similar view and had exchanged letters with his Swiss counterpart to the effect. It is important to note that it is judicial intervention that led India and Switzerland to speed up the signing of a revised treaty in March 2013, with material amendments to Article 26 that deals with exchange of information and provides for the detailed procedure, including safeguards against misuse of such information.
Executive cautious after SC directive
Perhaps, the government is being cautious as it doesn’t want to invite the court’s wrath; a statement made by the court, that ‘confidentiality clauses are unconstitutional under Indian law’, is becoming the bone of contention. Also, the stress here is for making effective use of information by initiating proceedings for recovery of tax etc, and not for making the information public which remains a popular demand!
Making the information public, besides breaching treaty obligation, could hamper tax recovery—and that it is a legitimate concern.
Either way, the confidentiality of the information stands protected as the SC ordered handing over the information in a sealed envelope to the SIT, thereby maintaining the sanctity of treaty. A public disclosure won’t help address the issue at hand, besides risking a botched up investigation. The government would do well to seek clarity from the apex court, highlighting that signing international conventions (treaties) is enshrined in the Constitution and confidentiality clauses are an integral part of such treaties. Unless the treaty partners explicitly agree, the breach of the confidentiality clause on matters of information exchange could mean a disregard of the principles of treaty interpretation enshrined under the Vienna Convention on Law of Treaties which requires treaties to be interpreted in good faith.
India’s role in promoting global standards for automatic information exchange is visible; though, the issue of signing agreements for automatic information exchange is getting linked to FATCA due to the Centre’s affidavit at the SC. In my view, they are independent decisions, though both deal with principles of transparency and disclosure. India’s concerns on FATCA stem from the provision for penal levy of 30% withholding tax by the US IRS on foreign financial institutions on US source payments, given the quantum of investment flows. It would be speculative to predict if India would meet the December 31 deadline for FATCA, given the affidavit.
Government buys time
Lastly, it is important to understand that the jurisdictions, including India, that have joined the group and committed to an early adoption of the standard developed by OECD and the G-20, have set out an ambitious timetable. The standard referred to is the global standard for automatic exchange of tax information that was agreed to at the G20 finance ministers meeting in February 2014. This was followed by the endorsement of the standard in the G20 finance ministers meeting in Cairns in September. At the October 29 meeting at Berlin, 51 jurisdictions signed the first ever multilateral competent-authority agreement to automatically exchange information; incidentally, the US is not part of this grouping. The only legal implication of this development is that the exchange of information would be more efficient and would supplement the mechanism for information exchange under bilateral treaties. The standard agreed by G20 (which India is party to) stands insofar as commitment to implement and begin exchanges in 2017 or end-2018.
There is no gainsaying India’s commitment to cooperate; the government’s decision to put off India’s participation at the OECD/G-20-endorsed multilateral standard for ‘automatic exchange for financial account information’ ought to be seen as a move to buy time, whilst the executive and the judiciary agree on a more convergent position. In summary, no big deal!

Columns: Indias opportunity for growthFIPB role shrinks amid easier FDI flows
The idea of human-directed material progress must be an old one, going back to settler-agriculture and domestication of animals. What has changed over time is the systemisation and scale of these processes, and the new expectation that rulers could and should help things along to the benefit of the ruled. Progress has not been smooth, with processes of conflict and destruction also being subject to scale and systemisation. The seven decades since the last global war have seen unprecedented rates of material progress, especially in East Asia. Global cooperation, a relatively peaceful world, and catch-up to a knowledge frontier, that had shifted out steadily over two centuries, made accelerated growth possible.
In my last column, I noted the signs that the exceptionally favourable economic conditions coinciding with India’s history as an independent nation are waning, and the resulting fears and challenges for countries like India that missed the boat. But I argued that there are new growth opportunities. These opportunities arise because the pace at which the global knowledge frontier is being pushed out has only accelerated. Furthermore, even if the rich world is not growing as fast as it did in the 1960s, it is still rich, and is adding members to its club, as countries like Japan, South Korea, and now China, have grown rapidly. The differences from the past are in the nature of technological progress, and in the nature of demand from rich countries.
People in rich countries are getting older, and, dare I say it, wiser. They want good health to go with longer lives, better quality food, clean air, leisure experiences they can cherish, and perhaps even the satisfaction of doing their bit to preserve the planet for future generations. These changes in wants modify demand patterns for existing goods and services, and create pressures for innovation. For example, nutrition and exercise is an ancient recipe for health, but can now be supported through scientific combinations of ingredients in foods and supplements, and in numerous new devices for monitoring the body and tracking activities. A critical aspect, though not the only one, of creating new, affordable products and services for the new consumer demands, is the pervasive use of information technology.
Finding and serving global and domestic niches in the new economy is where India’s growth opportunity lies. Just as for Japan and other predecessors in rapid growth, this does not require knowledge breakthroughs. Instead, what is needed is an understanding of wants in the marketplace, and the ability to innovate incrementally and in the direction of meeting these wants. While the rich world provides many lucrative opportunities, as I suggested in my last column, India is a big enough domestic market to allow economies of scale, and profit opportunities (if not necessarily Ambani-sized fortunes) at the bottom, middle and top of the pyramid.
I have argued in the past that the government should have a strategic vision for the economy, and this can include an understanding of emerging areas for growth. This can be important for prioritising some kinds of basic research expenditures, if they have the potential for supporting promising industries. Politicians and diplomats should also have a sense of where opportunities lie, in order to better connect Indian businesses to global markets. But it is not clear that policymakers can pick winners or potential winners. Even in the case of tax breaks to support investment and innovation, such incentives might better be aimed at the firm lifecycle, for example, early-stage start-ups and middle-stage growth, rather than preferential treatment of specific industries. Similarly, competition and bankruptcy laws, especially the former, might have special issues to tackle for industries with high fixed costs, or long investment gestation lags, but the basic principles are quite general across industries of all types.
Perhaps the most obvious place where the government needs to give its attention is in giving its citizens the initial conditions—basic health and education—required to participate in growth. Japan, South Korea and China all did this, and India has failed so far. Interestingly, the digital revolution provides opportunities for delivering low cost education and health services (especially the former) in ways that were not possible earlier. Creating a national broadband infrastructure ought to be one of the government’s highest priorities. Creating and providing students with access to local language educational content in digital form can sidestep the difficult problems of shortages of teachers and poor performance incentives. Even in basic health and education, and more so in higher education and more specialised care, it is clear that a model where there is private provision, but government standard-setting (though not necessarily of the nature of the Right to Education requirements), coupled with subsidisation of the poor, can do far more to fill existing gaps than pure public provision. The government can also support mechanisms for reducing information asymmetries that plague markets for education and health care.
There is a clear way forward for India, one that implements the slogan of “minimum government, maximum governance.” The challenges lie in India’s policymakers and policy implementers being bold enough to trust and partner with the country’s citizens, both as producers and consumers, to achieve transformational material progress.

Markets at new highs as FIIs again buy into India storyONGC: Subsidy sharing clarity on cards?
India may be an expensive market but foreign investors are willing to buy into it. Convinced the BJP-led NDA government will deliver on reforms in an economy that’s benefiting from lower crude oil prices, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) drove up Indian benchmark indices to new lifetime highs on Wednesday with the Nifty edging past the 8,400-point mark. The Sensex and Nifty have outperformed all major world indices so far in 2014 with dollar gains of 33% in a global rally fuelled by an abundance of liquidity resulting from accommodative policies of central banks.
With purchases of of a provisional $75 million on Wednesday, foreign funds have now run up a tab for the year of a shade above$15 billion. Investors believe the government will continue to usher in changes that will help jump-start growth. “We expect the Modi government to capitalise on an approaching 11-month election-free window to move ahead decisively on its reform agenda,” Deutsche Bank said in a recent report, predicting the Sensex at 29,000 by the end of the current fiscal.
India’s valuations — close to 20 time on a trailing basis — are expected to sustain as the economy recovers. “The economic growth recovery under way will likely sustain current valuations, especially as it starts manifesting in both macro and micro data points. Unlike the last three years, we expect consensus earnings growth estimates of 15%+ for FY16 and FY17 to be met, and ultimately, it is earnings momentum that drives markets,” UBS wrote in a recent report. India is now the second most expensive market among its emerging market peers.
On Wednesday, the Sensex hit an intra-day high of 28,126.48 points for the first time, closing 0.35% higher at 28,008.90 points. The broader 50-scrip Nifty closed 0.25% higher at 8,383.30 points after hitting an intra-day high of 8,415.05. According to UBS, Nifty could scale the 9,600-mark by the end of the current fiscal.
On Wednesday, most Asian markets ended higher. Japan’s Nikkei ended 0.43% higher to a seven-year high. Asian stocks advanced 0.2-1%. European stocks were trading lower.
The DAX (1.37%), CAC (-1.09%) and FTSE 100 (-0.35%) were trading in the red at 7.20 pm IST.
The rally in India had lost some steam in recent months with the Sensex gaining just 5.15% since September as against a 12% surge since the election results were announced in mid-May. Investors are expecting a fruitful session of Parliament which begins on November 24. Among the Bills that could be introduced, debated or passed are the insurance amendment Bill, the constitutional amendment Bill for GST, and amendments to the land and labour Bills.

4 Customer Comments That May Not Mean What You Thinkreddit
"Your check is in the mail" and "Don't call us; we'll call you" have become laugh-lines for comedians.  But other such comments from real customers can be a little trickier for salespeople to interpret.  Take, for example, these lines that top sales performers seldom interpret at face value.
--"We'll get back to you on that."
--"Let me give it some thought."
--"Why don't you put that in an email to me and I'll pass it on."
--"I'll need to talk to a few people around here first."
Clients and prospects can mean any number of things with these comments:
1) You haven't persuaded me yet to decide or do what you want.
2) You haven't persuaded me, and I don't want to take the time to tell you why.
3)  I'm not deciding favorably, but I fear confrontation and don't trust you so I'm stalling.
4) I don't have power to say yes and don't want to admit it.  I fear letting you go with me to the next level to make the sale.
You probably haven't been talking to the wall, and customers probably haven't had their brains turned off while you've been speaking. Translated, such comments mean your argument to take action isn't strong enough.  Things haven't been made crystal clear to them yet.
Unless all the cards are heavily stacked toward one option, it takes momentum to move people to action. So what do top sales performers do about the situation?  They:
--create a safe emotional environment to make it easy for the customer to give honest feedback and express concerns.
--make a stronger personal connection.
--give the effort their best shot the first time around, not expecting a redo.
An aide to Henry Kissinger, former National Security Adviser and Secretary of State, learned the "best shot" lesson early in his career. Kissinger brought to the Nixon White House the reputation as a demanding taskmaster.  So early in his career when a staff brought him a position paper that he'd worked hard on, Kissinger kept it a couple of days and then called the staff into his office and asked, "Is this the best you can do?"
The young staffer vowed he could improve it. He retrieved the document, cancelled his dinner plans, and worked into the wee hours on his rewrite: refining, adding information, strengthening his argument. He handed in the document again--only to have Kissinger return it to his desk the second time:  "Is THIS the best you can do?"
The frustrated staffer again reworked the paper:  Adding points, deleting information, rephrasing to make his argument crystal clear.  Two days later, he turned in the report for the third time, convinced that it was absolutely perfect.  Kissinger picked it up from his desk and held it out to him, "Is this really the best you can do?"
The staff stared at him, "Yes, that's the best I can do."
"Good. Now I'll read it."
When a sale stalls or a customer leaves for the competition, average sales professionals look outward for a "reason." Superstars look themselves in the mirror and ask, "Is THAT the best I can do?" They course correct immediately.

Free Markets 25 Years After the Berlin Wallreddit
The fall of the Berlin Wall marked the start of the march toward freer markets in the former Soviet Union and socialist countries in Eastern Europe.  The march towards liberty has not been without its detours and the regulatory threat from bureaucrats in Brussels looms large.  But, for lovers of liberty, there is much to celebrate a generation after the fall of the wall.
Socialism is antithetical to economic freedom.  Though it was impossible to measure at the time, there is little doubt that the markets in the former Eastern Bloc were repressed and standards of living were low.  Twenty five years later, markets are much freer and standards of living have improved dramatically.
The Economic Freedom of the World Annual Report measures the degree to which countries' policies support economic freedom across five broad areas: the size of government, the legal system and property rights, sound money, the freedom to trade internationally, and the degree and extent of regulation.  The index is scored from 1 to 10 with higher scores indicating greater economic freedom.
Only five Eastern European countries had enough data available to calculate a score in 1990.  They collectively averaged a 4.4.  Today, that would place them second to last in the rankings between the Republic of the Congo and Venezuela. As of 1995, the rankings included 14 countries from the region and they averaged a score of 5.0. Those same countries had improved their average to 6.2 by 2000 (today that would rank them 125th out of 152).
The number of former socialist countries with enough data available to rank them has risen to 25 over the last dozen years. Today, these countries average a score of 7.1. That's good enough to rank them 68th if they were a single country.
In fact, as a group, these countries score only 9 percent lower in economic freedom than the United States. They were fully 29 percent behind the United States in 2000.
Increased prosperity has followed the greater economic freedom. It makes little sense to compare incomes in 1990 to incomes today, because the 1990 figures were calculated at fictitious non-market prices where goods were often not available. But, real incomes in these countries have nearly quadrupled since 1995 -- from an average of about $2,400 per capita in 1995, to $9,500 today.
What are the prospects for liberty and prosperity in these countries in the future? I'm optimistic.
The European Union has been a mixed bag for these countries. Qualifying for E.U. membership has required some countries to change policies in ways that increases their economic freedom.  For other countries, like Estonia, E.U. membership means harmonizing policies and regulations with the E.U. in ways that decreases their economic freedom.
The greatest hope for the continued march towards free markets in Eastern Europe lies with the ideas of young people -- not the politicians in Brussels. A generation has grown up since the fall of the Berlin Wall. They have grown up with access to information about freedom through the Internet that dwarfs what prior generations could learn through Radio Free Europe.
A little over a year ago I stepped off a plane in Kosovo. I was not surprised that the young man who picked me up was enthusiastic about freedom -- after all he was a volunteer at the Free Market Road Show that I was speaking at. What was surprising was how knowledgeable he was about free market scholarship, both the well-known and obscure. He had found most of it, including my own work, online and through social networks.
This experience would repeat itself often while I lectured in eight countries in the following weeks.  The Free Market Road Show itself is a cause for optimism. It brings academics from the United States and Europe together with business people to travel to more than 27 cities throughout Europe (mostly Eastern) and speak about free markets.
The road show is just one of many groups spreading the knowledge about how free markets work throughout these countries. Six years ago, I was in Romania at the European Resource Bank Meeting , a gathering of free market oriented think tanks from around Europe, and I had dinner with two dozen young people who had learned about free markets from the Institutul Ludwig Von Mises Romania . Similar groups exist in other former socialist countries.
There are even bright spots for liberty in higher education. The University Donja Gorica , in Montenegro, requires all students to learn about the theories of free market economists Ludwig Von Mises and Frederick Hayek. Similarly, the University of Economics, Prague and now the Cevro Institut have promoted the study of these theories in the Czech Republic.
Perhaps most encouraging is the rapid growth of European Students for Liberty , which now attracts more than 500 young people to their annual conference and hosts many regional events throughout the year.
The former socialist countries in Europe have made a lot of progress towards freeing their markets since the fall of the Berlin Wall.  Let's hope we've only seen the beginning of much more to come.

Indian Railways allows 100 pct FDI in setting up of bio-toilets  laundry facilityFIPB role shrinks amid easier FDI flows
Indian Railways has identified toilets as one of the 17 special areas where 100 per cent foreign (foreign direct investment – FDI) and private investment can bring about major investments.
According to the guidelines approved by the government under its FDI policy, 100 per cent FDI can be utilised in facilities like cleaning up trains and installation of bio-toilets in passenger coaches and setting up of mechanised laundry facilities.
It is a step forward to invite private and foreign investment in the Railways as new areas have been identified for FDI, said a senior Railway Ministry official, adding that “total 17 areas are now thrown open under the guidelines”.
A committee constituted by Railway Ministry to finalise the policy has also suggested a set of business models to attract investments.
Besides bio-toilets, cleaning operation and mechanised laundries, the areas identified by the committee for FDI include construction, maintenance and operation facilities to supply non-conventional sources of energy to the Railways, installation and maintenance of bio-toilets in passenger trains, setting up of technical training institutes, testing facilities and laboratories and providing technological solutions to improve safety.
Earlier, the government had relaxed the FDI norms permitting 100 per cent investment in rail projects, such as high-speed trains, suburban service, dedicated freight corridors, freight and passenger terminals.
The FDI is also being permitted for rail route electrification, signalling system and logistics parks.
The committee has suggested three business models for high-speed train projects including projects where there are limits on operations and a firm wants to invest in upgrading the existing rail network for speed above 120 km per hour or semi-high speed network.
In dedicated freight lines, the Railways has permitted operations by investors, subject to certain conditions.
The government has now allowed mechanised laundry facilities to be set up on public-private partnership (PPP) basis. It also suggested some freight lines — new and doubling — that could be taken up on PPP basis.

Chart: Latin Americas diminishing CatholicismBy Adam Taylor November 13 Follow @mradamtaylor

If any region of the world is the heart of modern Catholicism, it's Latin America. Some 425 million Catholics live there , more than 40 percent of the world's total Catholic population. Plus, for the first time in history, there is a Latin American pope — and he's quite popular, if you hadn't heard.
Despite this, a new report on religion in Latin America from Pew Research Center has come to an unmistakable conclusion: Latin America, the world's most Catholic region, has become dramatically less Catholic over the past few decades.
Pew has collected data from 18 countries and one U.S. territory (Puerto Rico) across Latin America and the Caribbean. For much of the 20th century, more than nine in ten people across the region identified as Catholic. However, over the past few decades, that number has dropped significantly, to fewer than one in seven.
(Pew Research Center)
Things get even more stark when you break it down to the national levels. In less than 45 years, the report notes, some countries have seen their Catholic population fall by more than 40 percent.
(Pew Research Center)
What lies behind Latin America losing its religion? Well, as the report lays out, it often isn't really a loss. A significant number of people raised Catholic have converted to Protestant churches, usually  evangelical Pentecostal churches. In many countries, the report found, more than 50 percent of Protestants had been raised Catholic.
Their reasons for leaving one Christian church and joining another are complicated: Across the region, the report found, more than 80 percent of former Catholics who had joined the Protestant church did so because they were seeking a "personal connection with God," while 69 percent said they enjoyed the new style of worship at their new church. Fifty-eight percent said they had converted after the church reached out to them, the report noted.
Pew's report also points to a smaller, yet still considerable, number of people who don't profess a religion — the "unaffiliated." These people tend to be younger than Catholics and Protestants and don't necessarily see themselves as agnostic or atheist: Most just have "no particular religion," the report notes.
But what of Pope Francis, the Argentine pope who has charmed the world with his  cafeteria-eating , bill-paying ,  grand apartment-shunning ,  gay-embracing , evolution-accepting ways? Pew notes that its own data may not show the "Francis Effect," as he only took the papal position in March 2013. However, the report then adds:
[Former] Catholics are more skeptical about Pope Francis. Only in Argentina and Uruguay do majorities of ex-Catholics express a favorable view of the pope. In every other country in the survey, no more than roughly half of ex-Catholics view Francis favorably, and relatively few see his papacy as a major change for the Catholic Church. Many say it is too soon to have an opinion about the pope.
A look across the data also shows that Latin America's Protestants are usually more conservative on subjects such as homosexuality, abortion and divorce, while Catholics across the region are more accepting of the concept of evolution. Those ideological divides may not be a good sign for the "Francis Effect."
Pew's report makes for interesting reading for anyone wondering about the future of the Catholic Church. The selection of Jorge Mario Bergoglio (Pope Francis) to become the first leader of the church from the new world seemed likely to be a belated acknowledgement of demographics: The Catholic's Churches center of gravity was no longer Europe. But Pew's findings suggest that it might not hold sway over Latin America for much longer, either.

Amid Heightened Tensions  Israel Approves 200 New Settlement HomesIsrael Approves 200 New Settlement Homes Amid Heightened Tensions

A giant Israeli flag flies over a settlement building situated in the middle of a Palestinian neighbourhood of Al-Tur in East Jerusalem, on November 11, 2014. Recent unrest between Israelis and Palestinians has been fueled by religious tensions at the flashpoint Al-Aqsa mosque compound, as well as by moves to expand settler presence in the occupied eastern sector of the holy city. AFP PHOTO / THOMAS COEX        (Photo credit should read THOMAS COEX/AFP/Getty Images)
JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli authorities gave preliminary approval Wednesday to build 200 homes in a Jewish area of east Jerusalem, a move that threatened to push Israelis and Palestinians deeper into conflict after weeks of unrest over the city's holiest sites.
The announcement came hours before U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry was scheduled to arrive in neighboring Jordan on a mission aimed in part at restoring calm. A State Department spokeswoman said Washington was "deeply concerned" by the decision.
Much of the recent violence has stemmed from tensions surrounding Jerusalem's hilltop complex that is revered by Muslims and Jews. The collapse of U.S.-brokered peace talks, Israel's war last summer in the Gaza Strip against the Islamic militant group Hamas, and continued Israeli settlement construction in east Jerusalem have added to the distrust.
Brachie Sprung, a spokeswoman in the mayor's office, said city officials approved 200 homes in the Ramot area. Sprung said it was just a preliminary stage of the planning process — meaning construction would be years away.
She also said city officials approved an additional 174 homes for construction in an Arab neighborhood.
To Israelis, the announcement was relatively harmless. Ramot is a sprawling development already home to about 70,000 people, and most Israelis assume the area will remain part of Israel under any future peace agreement.
In the current tense climate, however, any Israeli construction for Jewish areas of east Jerusalem is potentially explosive.
Israel captured east Jerusalem in 1967 and annexed the area in a move that is not recognized internationally.
The Palestinians claim east Jerusalem as their capital. They consider all Israeli construction there to be illegal settlement activity — a position that is backed by the international community. About 200,000 Jewish Israelis live in developments like Ramot that ring east Jerusalem to help cement Israeli control.
The Israeli announcement came before Kerry's scheduled meeting in Jordan with King Abdullah II and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to discuss the situation in Jerusalem. There was no immediate plan for Kerry to travel to Israel.
"We are deeply concerned by this decision, particularly given the tense situation in Jerusalem, as well as the unequivocal and unanimous position of the United States and others in the international community opposing such construction in east Jerusalem," State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in Washington.
"These decisions to expand construction have the potential to exacerbate this difficult situation on the ground, and they will not contribute to efforts to reduce the tension," she added.
Under a longstanding arrangement, Jordan holds custodial rights over Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem, including the compound known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary. It is the third-holiest site in Islam and the most sacred place in Judaism. Jews are permitted to visit, but prayer by non-Muslims is banned.
Increased visits by Jewish worshippers to the site, which also includes the Al-Aqsa Mosque, have raised concerns among Muslims that Israel is secretly trying to take it over. The tensions have boiled over into violent demonstrations and deadly Palestinian attacks that have killed six people in recent weeks. The fatal shooting by police last weekend of an Israeli Arab protester in northern Israel as he appeared to be walking away from the officer has worsened the atmosphere.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted that Israel has no plans to change the arrangements at the holy site, but his pledges have done little to bring calm.
Abbas accused Netanyahu this week of leading the region into a "religious war." Netanyahu responded by calling Abbas a liar and accusing him of incitement.
The harsh rhetoric reflects more than personal animosity between the two leaders. Both appear to be pandering to their political bases of support at a sensitive time.
Abbas, after nearly a decade in office and several failed rounds of peace talks, has little to show for his efforts. He also is facing a challenge from Hamas.
Fiery rhetoric is an easy way to appeal to his public at a time when many Palestinians believe Israel is not serious about negotiating a peace deal that would end a half-century of Israeli military occupation and establish an independent Palestinian state.
The official Palestinian media is filled with reports about Israeli hard-liners calling for legalized prayer on the Temple Mount and visits to the compound by Jewish worshippers, as well as denials of the Jewish connection to the site.
"Our correspondent reported that settlers invaded the mosque in small groups and toured the place with leaders explaining to them mythical accounts about the alleged Temple Mount," the state-run Wafa news agency said Wednesday.
In the latest unrest, an attack Wednesday on a mosque in a West Bank village ignited a fire that destroyed its first floor. Residents blamed local Jewish settlers.
Israeli police said someone threw a Molotov cocktail at an ancient synagogue in the Israeli-Arab town of Shfaram late Tuesday night, causing light damage.
The U.S. condemned the West Bank mosque attack, Psaki said, adding: "We believe that such hateful and provocative actions against a place of worship are never justified."
Netanyahu is shoring up his hard-line credentials at a time when his coalition is looking increasingly unstable and he faces a primary in his Likud Party next year.
Economics Minister Naftali Bennett, leader of the ultranationalist Jewish Home Party and perhaps Netanyahu's most formidable rival, has accused the government of being too soft in its response to the unrest.
Housing Minister Uri Ariel, also of the Jewish home, has called for Jews to be allowed to pray inside the compound. An advocate of increased Jewish access to the site was shot and seriously wounded by a Palestinian gunman last month.
The tactics by Abbas and Netanyahu risk igniting further violence and have drawn calls for restraint.
Science Minister Yaacov Peri of the centrist Yesh Atid Party, and a former chief of the Shin Bet security agency, urged "all leaders to act responsibly by showing restraint and ending the incitement."
"We must all work intensively and genuinely to calm the current situation," he told foreign reporters.
Meanwhile, an Israeli border policeman was arrested in connection with the death of a Palestinian demonstrator near Ramallah in May, police said. Israeli security forces said they used only rubber bullets to disperse the protesters, but Israeli media reported the policeman may have used live ammunition.
Marwan Barghouti, a Palestinian leader serving a life sentence in Israel for his role in the Palestinian uprising last decade, was sentenced to a week in solitary for calling for more violence and for the Palestinian Authority to stop its security cooperation with Israel. Israeli media interpreted that as a call for a third intifada, or uprising.
Later Wednesday, Israel said it would not cooperate with a U.N. Human Rights Council investigation into the war with Hamas in Gaza this summer.
The Foreign Ministry cited what it called the Geneva-based council's "obsessive hostility toward Israel."
The decision means that the council's representatives would not be able to enter Gaza from Israel. That would force them to enter through Egypt, but the crossing has been closed because of a perilous security situation in the Sinai Desert.
Israel has often accused the Geneva-based council of bias.
The Commission of Inquiry said in a statement that its three members are on their first visit to Jordan where they are meeting with individuals, groups, victims and witnesses of alleged human rights violations. The commission didn't mention Israel's announcement but said in a statement that the members hope to visit affected areas of Gaza and Israel and have "requested the cooperation of the government of Israel in this regard."

4 Ways To Improve Your Life Todayreddit
It is easy in life to become sidetracked or distracted by things which aren't important, are out of your control, stress you out or make you unhappy. When this happens, there is the need to pause to refocus your energies and care for your own wellbeing.
Time to reflect, exercise, eat well and rest is often compromised to accommodate other things we perceive as being more important. However, reports by organizations like the National Sleep Foundation have shown that refocusing your energies on important activities like diet, exercise and sleep -- which are sometimes seen as luxuries in your busy life -- actually allows you to do more, be happier, become more successful and live longer.
Once I committed to living a more balanced life including time to think, regular exercise, eating better and getting appropriate sleep, my life flourished.
Below are four simple actions that have improved my life and will do the same for you today.
Take A Break
After you read this article, take a ten-minute break. Use the time to think, reflect, meditate, stretch, nap and clear your mind. Remember to turn your phone, smartphone and computer off.
Studies show that performance improves after a break of any duration, even 30 seconds.
Make a practice of scheduling regular breaks throughout your day. Most suggest pausing at least every 90 minutes. This time will make you more alert, focused and productive.
Taking at least a half-hour uninterrupted lunch break is also helpful to improve your performance throughout your day. For me, lunch outdoors with time to people watch or simply gaze over a beautiful view while thinking about the world re-energizes me. Personal lunches with family, friends or co-workers can also do the trick.
Meditate
You may be surprised to learn we each meditate everyday. Meditation is simply the act of deeply focusing on something.
The problem is most people meditate on the wrong things in life: worry, stress, disbelief and negativity. These themes ring over-and-over in our head as a mantra, depleting our energy, our will and our confidence.
Use one of your scheduled breaks today for positive meditation. It can be as basic as finding a quiet place to close your eyes and think of happy and positive moments in your life, or to focus on people you love. Thoughts of my 18-month and 6-year-old daughters giggling always makes me smile, feel good and improves my day.
If you need help concentrating during your meditation, try a guided meditation or relaxation recording. There are many available for free download, including instructions on how to meditate on sites like The Guided Meditation Site or by searching the web. You may also be interested in my new guided relaxation, Surrender to Your Purpose , to help you connect to your purpose in life plus build personal confidence.
A daily practice of positive meditation will clear your mind, rejuvenate you, and make you feel happier and healthier.
Exercise
Use one of your breaks today to take a walk. Getting outside is always helpful to your mental state, but walking indoors will give you the same physical benefit. If you have the time, ability and equipment, go for a run, swim or workout.
Do at least 20 minutes of physical activity everyday. Exercise has been proven to provide you more energy, reduce your stress, make you feel better about yourself and give you more confidence.
Perform An Act Of Kindness
When you do something nice for someone, your body produces oxytocin resulting in lower blood pressure. Your brain produces chemicals that increase positive thinking, making you feel good.
Take a moment to think of someone you could praise for their good work. Perhaps you can assist with someone's struggles to lighten their load. Do it now. This act of kindness will improve your day, state of mind, lower your stress and be good for your health. Something as simple as sending a nice text or email to someone to brighten his or her day makes me feel good.
Repeated acts of kindness will make you happier and improve your health. A 1979 study showed that charity workers were actually happier because of their focus on helping others. And studies show that happier people live longer.
By taking the recommended time to refocus your energies and care for your wellbeing, you will experience more happiness, health, productivity and success in your life.

5 Secrets to Millennial Happiness at Work (Hint: It s Not About Salary)reddit
Millennials are job jumpers. According to the 2015 Millennial Majority Workforce study , 58 percent of millennials expect to be in their current job for fewer than three years. This even seems conservative to me from my vantage point in Silicon Valley.
Fewer than three years? It's expensive to train up team members, only to have them leave so quickly. Why are millennials' workplace tenures diminishing compared to previous generations? Why are some millennials eschewing the traditional workplace altogether?
Well, the concept of work itself is changing. That millennials are different is to be expected -- they need to be. They are reinventing what it means to be successful in a technology-driven world where workdays are infinite, needs change on a dime and independence and flexibility are at a premium.
Beginning in 2015, millennials -- the first generation of digital natives with plenty of creativity and prized technical skills -- will be the largest generation in the U.S. workforce. Here are a few steps managers can take to court and keep this generation.
Show you care
Virtually everyone feels more loyalty to a manager who cares, but this is especially true for young people eager for mentorship and growth. Pay continuous attention to the strengths and desires of your team and think of ways to amplify these strengths. This could involve assigning stretch projects in areas they are passionate about, suggesting team members for new openings or providing thoughtful feedback designed to stimulate professional growth.
Go to lunch
What better way to connect with young team members -- and show you care -- than taking time out of the office to enjoy a meal and good conversation? Lunch is time well invested! When I invite a young team member to lunch I almost always learn something new about how to better engage their passions and interests in a way that both benefits the company and keeps them excited to work here.
Professional growth comes from experience. Share yours
Millennials are a generation of learners: 92 percent report being able to access information whenever and wherever they need. But there are some skills that only come from experience, not a quick Google search. Compared to previous generations, our study found, millennials are less adept at working on teams and less organized. Provide direct mentorship to make sure millennials are developing the valuable collaboration, organization and other skills that they can't learn elsewhere, and you'll find that your youngest workers are infinitely more engaged.
Invite fresh ideas
Millennials are known for their novel ideas, creativity, and tech savvy. What are you doing to harness that? Cultivate a culture that invites taking risks, being bold and providing unique ideas with room to grow. Just the other day in a company meeting, our CEO explicitly invited questions people "may be uncomfortable to ask." Setting the tone that fresh ideas are valued goes a long way toward making team members feel connected to the company.
Measure results, not face time in the office
My millennial daughter quit her job at a Silicon Valley startup to start a business so she could exercise the independence and flexibility that is the hallmark of her generation. But that's not to say we can't provide some of the same privileges to talented millennials in our companies.
Of course young team members need leadership and clear objectives. They should work on initiatives that genuinely move the needle, meet their deadlines and be available to solve problems during key business hours. At the same time, now that work is moving heavily online, results can be measured more easily than ever before. Because we can collaborate and communicate over the Internet, people don't have to be in the same physical office at all times to have an impact.
Granting flexibility in scheduling is a way to give millennials control over their experience. Given the evolving nature of work, there's no reason we shouldn't measure results instead of facetime in the office. It's a change in outlook, but one that millennials I know certainly appreciate.
What's your experience, either with or as a millennial? I'd love to hear what you think managers can do better to attract and retain talented, hardworking millennials who can help grow the business.

Don t Let the Buzz About Brand Experience Cloud Your Brand Ideareddit
Is traditional branding dying? Is the "big brand idea" a relic of our traditional past?
Conventional broadcast advertising (radio, print and television) is useful for verbally and visually communicating brand and product benefits, but in an era of consumer empowerment, top-down messaging -- or the passive embrace of manufacturers' wisdom -- is no longer enough. Brands need to build multidimensional connections with consumers by stimulating as many senses as possible.
"Experiential marketing" is one of many buzzwords that have proliferated in recent years. It involves anything from in-store sampling to pop-up stores to the sound emitted when a can of cola is opened. The goal of experiential marketing is to form emotional bonds between consumers and brands that reinforce loyalty. As leader of J. Walter Thompson in Asia, I try to strike a balance between encouraging the embrace of the new and advocating the power of timeless marketing principles. Carefully crafted strategies and executions--adherence to the ABCs of brand building -- will remain our lighthouse as we pioneer new ways to introduce brands into consumers' lives.
Cool kids prefer the modish expression "brand experience" to "brand idea," deeming the latter too one-dimensional and "advertising-y" relative to the interactivity and holism of the former. I beg to differ.
The term "brand idea" may sound quaint, but it's not. It implies more than an old-fashioned, static positioning statement. The brand idea is the long-term relationship between a consumer and a brand. It is dynamic and multifaceted. It breathes life into every interaction -- or "touch point" -- that connects the consumer and the brand. It is the conceptual underpinning of subsequent engagement with a brand that spurs consumers to change behavior in a way that leads to more frequent purchase and higher loyalty.
But a brand idea also is a product of classic, conceptual craftsmanship. Each experience, high- or low-tech, must reinforce a clearly defined proposition that fuses insight into consumer behavior with a unique brand offer.
Some brands have been significantly ahead of the curve in reconciling message clarity with three-dimensional experiences. The Nike+ digital ecosystem leverages technology to infuse "always on" dynamism into consumers' daily lives. "Just do it" is more than a call to participate in sports. It is an exhortation to push against convention and define oneself independent of society. Nike's spirit didn't appear out of thin air or drip from a Twitter feed. It is the exquisitely refined vision of co-founder Phil Knight, and Nike has reinforced this quasi-religious credo at every level and in every corner of the organization for 40 years.
Lego, a brand that has celebrated creativity since 1932, also understands that timeless can be new. The name Lego is derived from the Danish phrase "leg godt," which also means "I put together" in Latin. Every manifestation of Lego's brand idea, "inspiring the builders of tomorrow," strengthens brand equity. The company's award-winning retail outlets are designed with innovative displays and spaces for family "building" events and kid-friendly exploration areas. At several locations worldwide, Legoland encourages kids to open their imaginations at construction sites that dot the theme parks. To the tune of almost $500 million in global ticket sales, the 2014 film The Lego Movie is, perhaps, the most successful branded entertainment in recent years. The film pulls viewers into a tale inspired by the brand idea.
Google, the ultimate 21st-century power brand, does not really sell many of its own services. From French patisseries in New York to study-abroad programs in Japan, Google brands the services that others sell, largely through its search engine. The brand is unified by experiences that add dimension to Google's brand idea, "bringing the world together through technology." This brand idea transcends everything that Google does to create ripples of good feeling. Every piece of information generated by an online search is associated with the warm glow of Google. In the process, the company demonstrates its proprietary tools--airline status information, mapping, Street View and so on. Every technology does this, including Google Glass. The experience of using the product makes the world a smaller place.
Google's vivid relationship with consumers stands in marked contrast to erstwhile Japanese titans such as Sony, Panasonic and Hitachi. It is probably no coincidence that these brands, now tech also-rans, never had clear brand ideas. Samsung, the Korean behemoth, looks increasingly vulnerable to low-price competition from China. Samsung doesn't really have a brand idea, either.
As the digital revolution turns the advertising industry on its head, consistency and conceptual craftsmanship have become forgotten imperatives. In our zeal to crack the next big thing, we're simply latching on to the latest thing without thinking about how it links up to a brand idea. Today, the "bits"--the execution, the tactical side of things--too often overshadow the brands.
Whether high-tech or low-tech, however, beautiful brand ideas provide the gravitational force to forge order from chaos. They ensure that each experience deepens, rather than cheapens, the relationship between consumers and the brands they love.

India  US resolve impasse over food security issue at WTO: Commerce MinisterIndia, US resolve food row, signalling end to WTO impasse
Amiti Sen
WTO General Council to discuss New Delhi’s proposal in December
New Delhi, Nov 13:  
India and the US reached a compromise on issues relating to food security and trade facilitation at the World Trade Organisation (WTO), which could soon lead to a resolution of the current impasse in global trade talks.
However, neither country shared the finer details of the agreements. US Trade Representative Michael Froman said the bilateral agreements were a result of discussions between President Barack Obama and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Commerce and Industry Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, who said an agreement has been reached with the US, ducked questions on whether Washington had agreed to concessions over and above an indefinite continuation of the ‘peace clause’, which it had already agreed to last month.
“These are details that we will share with the General Council of the WTO when it meets next month. We don’t want to disclose them here,” she told reporters here on Thursday.
Subsidy caps
A peace clause is an undertaking that action won’t be taken against a member for breaching agriculture subsidy caps (fixed at 10 per cent of production) till the formula for calculating such subsidies is re-worked. The concessions, which India had been pitching for, include dropping the condition that the tool can be used only when subsidies are non-trade distortive and on submission of data.
Sitharaman made it clear that India was pleased with the compromise.
“We are extremely happy that India and the US have successfully resolved their differences relating to the issue of public stockholding for food security purposes in the WTO in a manner that addresses our concerns. This will end the impasse at the WTO and also open the way for implementation of the Trade Facilitation Agreement,” she said.
India had refused to support a protocol on trade facilitation — a pact to ease movement of goods between borders by upgrading infrastructure and improving processes — on July 31, as agreed to in Bali last December, as it wanted a better deal on food security.
For a permanent solution
New Delhi had demanded that, as a permanent solution, the subsidies should either be dropped from the list of trade-distorting subsidies, calculated on a more recent base year (as opposed to existing base year of 1986-88), or indexed to inflation.
The agreement between the US and India also sets out elements for an intensified programme of work and negotiations to arrive at such a permanent solution, the US Trade Representative’s office said in a statement.
Congress’ charge
Congress leader and former Commerce Minister Anand Sharma said: “We have not been holding any bilateral negotiations on this issue. Then, how can the Government hold a bilateral meeting and claim that issues have been resolved? It has to be discussed in a ministerial conference.” At the WTO’s Bali ministerial, Sharma had negotiated that a permanent solution should be found latest by the eleventh ministerial scheduled in 2017. “We had ensured that India’s interests will be protected. I do not think there is any change in the position,” Sharma told BusinessLine.

Mumbai, Nov 13:  
The Sensex and the Nifty ended the session marginally in the red due to profit-booking by funds and retail investors amid firm European cues.
The 30-share BSE index Sensex fell 68.26 points or 0.24 per cent to end at 27,940.64 and the 50-share NSE index Nifty ended at 8,357.85, down 25.45 points or 0.3 per cent.
Among BSE sectoral indices, oil & gas index succumbed to heavy profit-booking and was down 1.63 per cent, followed by realty 1.44 per cent, PSU 1.32 per cent and India infrastructure index 0.78 per cent.
On the other hand, IT and TECk indices were the star-performers and were up 0.99 per cent and 0.74 per cent, respectively, followed by healthcare 0.56 per cent and consumer durables 0.36 per cent.
Infosys, Dr Reddy's, Cipla, Wipro and Bharti Airtel were the top five Sensex gainers, while the major losers were SSLT, Tata Power, ONGC, GAIL and Axis Bank.
India Forex Advisors in a report said: "The consumer inflation fell to a record low for the month of October at 5.52 per cent against 6.46 per cent in September. The expectation was around 5.8 per cent for the month. The numbers were dragged down by a slow pace of increase in crude and food inflation.
Food inflation came in at 5.59 per cent in October vs 7.67 per cent in the previous month. Whereas petrol prices have been cut six times since August this year, diesel prices have been lowered twice since they were deregulated by the government. The RBI is hesitant to cut interest rates until it is confident the inflation is reduced to meet its target of 6 per cent by January 2016.''
European shares rose 0.4 per cent in the opening trade in a small rebound from falls on Wednesday, and Asian and emerging markets shares had also inched higher.
Stoxx 50 climbed 22.83 points or 0.75 at 3,070.13 and FTSE 100 was up 18.58 points or 0.28 per cent at 6,629.62.

Congress attacks PM ModiCongress President Sonia Gandhi and party Vice President Rahul Gandhi at the 125th Birth Anniversary Function of Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru at Talkatora Stadium in New Delhi on Thursday. PTI Photo
New Delhi, Nov 13:  
Ahead of the elections to Jharkhand, Jammu and Kashmir and Delhi, the Congress leadership has launched a direct attack on the Prime Minister, Narendra Modi.
Speaking at a function organised by the Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee on the 125th birth anniversary of former prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru here on Thursday, the Congress president, Sonia Gandhi accused the BJP Government of deviating from the basic foundations of the country, such as secularism and brotherhood. “Today, attempts are being made to change the basic tenets of the Nehruvian principles. Those who want to change these principles are attacking the vision and ideology of Nehru. He worked to build a secular, progressive and liberal India,” she said.
She urged the Congress workers to fight all "such ideologies, institutions and individuals" who want to demolish Nehru's concepts.
Sonia Gandhi and Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi admitted the Congress is facing one of its most difficult periods, but sought to boost the morale of its rank and file exhorting them to be united and fight the communal forces.
Rahul said the Congress believed in love and brotherhood. "Even when we fought the British, we did it with love. We never wavered from the message of love and brotherhood. We were beaten up, but we never got angry....The country today, on the other hand, is run by people who nurture anger...," he said.
"Today the very foundation of our country built on love and brotherhood is being weakened. This country is our home. One one hand, the home is being spruced up. Roads are being cleaned. Everybody is getting a photo opportunity and on the other hand poison is being spread. The foundation (of this country) is being weakened.
"Only the Congress party can fight them. Only love can overcome anger and hatred. And the only one organisation which believes in love and brotherhood and is inclusive is the Congress." Rahul said the Congress party had committed mistakes but has not wavered on its ideology and ideals.
"When the foundations get weakend, the nation's enemies benefit from it....The more united we are, the faster the country will move forward," he said.

Rahul Gandhi  Sonia accuse  angry  Modi of destroying Nehru legacyArmy, police search Jammu-Delhi Rajdhani after bomb threat
Congress party leaders President Sonia Gandhi and Vice President Rahul Gandhi accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of spreading the “poison” of communalism and asked party men to fight those out to demolish Jawaharlal Nehru’s “liberal India”, intensifying the battle over his legacy.
While both the Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi did not take the name of Modi, the reference was obvious when they spoke at a party function on the eve of the 125th birth anniversary of Nehru here.
Rahul Gandhi said that “angry” people are nowadays running the country and had a dig at Modi over the “Swachchta Abhiyan” saying “photo opportunities” are galore.
“These days, the foundation of love and brotherhood is being demolished. On one hand houses are being painted and roads are being cleaned. Photo opportunities are happening. Snaps are being taken. On the other hand, poison is being spread. The very foundations are being weakened,” Gandhi said.
In her speech made in the presence of former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and former Chief Minister Shiela Dikshit, Sonia Gandhi asked party men to be united and strengthen the organisations and connect and fight those forces out to demolish Nehru’s vision of a liberal India.
“Massive attempts are on to destroy the vision of Nehru, the way he used to look at India. The forces, which are doing this are targeting not only his persona but also his ideology, his vision, his life-long contributions and struggle,” she said.
The Congress President said that had Nehru been alive, he would have asked all Congressmen to fight communalism of all hues by becoming a “valiant secular soldier” for protecting the soul of India.
Out of power for the last six months after a crushing defeat in the Lok Sabha polls, the party is utilising the 125th birth anniversary of Nehru to rally round non-NDA parties on a platform raising the pitch of secularism.
It has organised an international meet on November 17 and 18 for which it has not invited Modi, who it accuses of appropriating the legacy of freedom movement leaders like Mahatma Gandhi, Nehru and Sardar Patel. Sonia Gandhi has extended invitations personally to leaders including Nitish Kumar and Mamata Banerjee.

Buffett s Berkshire Hathaway buys Duracell from P&GBuffett snaps up Duracell from P&G

Billionaire investor Warren Buffett is getting into the battery business. Buffett is also trimming his stock holdings, while adding to his growing holdings of operating businesses.
Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway ( BRK.A ; BRK.B ) announced Thursday that it will acquire the Duracell battery business from Procter & Gamble ( PG ). Berkshire will finance the transaction by forking over $4.7 billion in P&G shares it currently owns.
In a statement, Berkshire outlined the deal as follows: “In exchange for a recapitalized Duracell Company, which will include approximately $1.7 billion in cash at closing, P&G will receive shares of P&G’s common stock currently held by Berkshire Hathaway having a current value of approximately $4.7 billion.”
At the end of 2013, P&G was Berkshire’s seventh-biggest stock holding, according to Berkshire filings. Berkshire is the fifth biggest shareholder of P&G stock, with a 52.8 million share stake, according to Yahoo Finance data through June 30.
At Wednesday night’s closing price of $89.48 for P&G, Berkshire’s stake is an estimated $4.74 billion, which means Berkshire is basically trading all of its P&G shares for the operating  business of Duracell. By constructing the Duracell deal with the transfer of Berkshire-owned P&G shares back to P&G, Buffett’s Berkshire was able to minimize the tax hit had it liquidated its shares at a profit in the open market for cash.
“I have always been impressed by Duracell, as a consumer and as a long-term investor in P&G and Gillette,” said Buffett, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway. “Duracell is a leading global brand with top quality products, and it will fit well within Berkshire Hathaway.”
In early trading, Berkshire Hathaway A shares were up $884.06, or 0.4%, to $218,985.06. And shares of P&G were virtually unchanged, falling 2 cents to $89.46.
The transaction, which is subject to regulatory approvals, is expected to close in the second half of 2015. The deal allows Buffett to add another brand-name business to his portfolio and enables P&G to shed a non-core business.
Buffett’s use of stock to finance the deal, rather than cash, is an emerging trend, as is the shift to buying entire businesses rather than shares of stock, says Lawrence A. Cunningham, a professor at George Washington University and author of the book, Berkshire Beyond Buffett.
“The swap of $4.7 billion of stock in P&G for the Duracell assets continues the trend at Berkshire from a company whose value was mostly in stock picks Buffett made but Berkshire didn’t control — to wholly owned businesses over which Berkshire has total control. …  A similar example occurred late last year when Berkshire swapped stock in Phillips 66 (in exchange) for pipeline lubricant assets.”
Buffett, dubbed the Oracle of Omaha by Wall Street for his prescient market calls and investment acumen, is known for investing in brand-name stocks — and businesses — that are easy-to-understand, have sizable and enduring market shares and are run by solid management teams. Buffett’s major stock holdings via Berkshire Hathaway include well-known brands, such as Coca-Cola, IBM and Wal-Mart. Berkshire also owns businesses, such as ice cream seller Dairy Queen, auto insurer Geico and railroad transportation giant Burlington Northern Santa Fe.
In Berkshire’s recent third-quarter earnings filing, Buffett had this to say about the company’s acquisition strategy: “Our long-held acquisition strategy is to acquire businesses at sensible prices that have consistent earnings power, good returns on equity and able and honest management.”
And this deal, according to Buffett himself, meets that criterion.
Commenting on the deal to FOX Business Network this morning, Buffett, 84, said: “This is our kind of business. … Not very exciting but a good, solid business. I’m a Duracell guy. Always have been”
“We thank the Duracell employees for their many contributions to the business. They’ve made Duracell the global market leader in the battery category,” said A.G. Lafley, P&G’s CEO. “I’m confident this new ownership structure will provide strong support for Duracell’s future growth plans.”
The sale of Duracell is not a major surprise, as pressure has been growing on the P&G CEO to divest non-core businesses, which includes Duracell, the world’s No. 1 battery business, according to a Cincinnati Enquirer report back in June. P&G, the world’s largest consumer-products company, said last month that it would divest Duracell.
“(Duracell is) not a strategic fit for P&G – it doesn’t create any halo or synergy with their other brands,” Pete Sorrentino, a portfolio manager with Huntington Asset Advisors, told the Cincinnati Enquirer in June.
Divestitures are a proven tool for Lafley, according to the Enquirer. During his previous tenure as P&G’s CEO, he sold or spun off most of the company’s food business that included Jif peanut butter, Crisco shortening and Sunny Delight fruit drink. Duracell commands estimated annual sales of $2.6 billion.
 

Facebook rewrites its privacy policy so that humans can understand itBy Hayley Tsukayama November 13 Follow @htsuka
Screengrab of the new Data Policy screen. (Hayley Tsukayama)
Your Facebook privacy settings are about to look a little different again. On Thursday, Facebook announced that it has expanded its data use policy (most companies simply call it a privacy policy but whatever) and has also made an effort to rewrite the language in a way normal people can understand.
To do that, Facebook has taken some information on how the site itself works -- and how users can set their privacy on Facebook -- and created a new "Privacy Basics" page that walks users through its most-used privacy features. That includes step-by-step instructions on how to control who sees posts you create or items you "like."
At this point, Facebook users may be a little frustrated by just how much and how often their privacy settings have changed. But the company's chief privacy officer Erin Egan said that Facebook has to change its policy to reflect changes the company makes to its services and to make the privacy policies as clear as possible.
"This is a continued effort," Egan said. "We want to provide information to people in a clear and concise manner."
In terms of the actual policy, many of the changes are cosmetic. The data use policy will now be displayed on an interactive, colorful site aimed at making it easy to navigate.
But there are some changes to the language, as well -- again aimed at making it easier to understand. In the old policy, for example, "public information" was defined as "the information you choose to make public, as well as information that is always publicly available." In the new policy, Facebook explains it like this:
Public information is any information you share with a public audience, as well as information in your Public Profile, or content you share on a Facebook Page or another public forum.
The changes don't exactly make the policy easy reading. They do, however, get rid of some of the confusing legalese. Some of the organizational changes can make it a little more difficult to figure out how Facebook may use a particular piece of information. For example, users now have to read through two sections -- "What kinds of information do we collect?" and "How do we use this information?" -- to get a full picture of how their data are shared. But it also makes the whole thing more digestible.
Facebook is also adding some things to its data use policy to reflect changes that it's made to the site. For example, the company now accepts payments over Facebook. So the company has added an explicit section in its data policy about how it handles payment information.
One thing that went unchanged was how the company uses data for research -- despite the fact that the company faced a backlash over a mood study it conducted. Egan said that the current guidelines, which give Facebook the broad right to conduct "research," remain effective.
As per Facebook's usual way of operating, the changes are only a proposal for now. Users will have seven days to comment on the policy changes, which Facebook will then review before making the policy final. Once Facebook's announces its final changes, the policy will take effect in 30 days.
Facebook is also rolling out a tool that lets users give Facebook more information about ads they do -- or don't -- want to see on the site in Europe. This option had previously only been available in the United States. Egan said that Facebook users will also be able to apply their ad preferences, such as requests to opt out of seeing personalized ads, across mobile and desktop devices --  something that they can't do now.

Gaza is not remotely occupied (II)By Eugene Kontorovich November 13
This post continues my criticism of Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court’s tentative characterization of Israel’s relationship to Gaza as one of occupation.
Since Israel withdrew its troops and expelled its civilians from Gaza in 2005, all government functions have been performed by the local Palestinian authorities. The Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) suggests that Israel continues to occupy Gaza because it is still involved in the territory. The Prosecutor overstates the extent of Israel’s involvement, but more importantly, its analysis replaces the “effective control” test with something like a “some control” or influence” test, unknown to international law.
Consider the “competencies” rattled off by the Prosecutor to establish the existence of an occupation. Most of the activities described are simply not relevant to the question of effective control.  Israel has checkpoints at the Gaza frontier because it is its border – every country controls entry and exit via its border (as does Egypt with Gaza). Similarly the customs and taxes issues are by arrangement with the Palestinian Authority, because goods are unloaded at an Israeli port. Indeed the transfer of customs duty to Gazan authorities proves there are in fact Gazan authorities, that are not Israeli. Nor is Gaza’s use of Israeli currency any evidence of occupation. They choose to use the currency, and can use anything else if they wanted to. Several countries use the U.S. dollar and are very dependent on the U.S., but no one has ever suggested this amounts to occupation.
The argument about occasional Israeli military incursions into Gaza is even weaker. Every country reserves the right to enter a neighboring territory when militarily necessary. In an occupation, the right is reserved even when not militarily necessary. Israel does not claim to be exercising rights of belligerent occupation when entering Gaza, but rather rights of self defense. Any time there are two hostile countries near each other, this is liable to happen. Turkey enters Syria when need be. Nor is the ease with which Israel enters relevant; being a stronger power does not make one an occupier.
As for controlling airspace, the Security Council itself has made clear t hat this does not amount to occupation under the law of war.
Indeed, by the Prosecutor’s logic, Gaza occupies Israel. First, it reserves the right to enter Israel when militarily necessary, and exercises this right. Indeed, it digs tunnels directly into Israel: a direct physical occupation of territory. Moreover, it controls parts of life in Israel. It decides, for example, when school will be open in the South, and when it will be closed due to rocket fire. Indeed, Gazan authorities boast that they can shut down Israel’s airport whenever they want. Yet this just means Gaza conducts hostilities against Israel not that it is occupying it.
Indeed, by the same logic Egypt could be said to be occupying Gaza, as it controls and seals the border , and engages in incursions into Gaza when necessary. Similarly, the international community does not consider eastern Ukraine occupied by Russia, despite it being controlled by Russian-organized and armed militias, backed by Russian troops.
None of these other situations is treated as an occupation, which demonstrates how the OTP reasoning flies in the face of all international practice. Indeed, the EU has recently taken the position that Western Sahara is not occupied by Morocco, despite the latter’s total control, with actual troops, of the former. This would all be worth the OTP’s time to mention, but they skip it and any other state practice. (I discuss the EU’s Morocco policy here .)
Ironically, the ICC decision comes shortly after Sweden’s much-trumpeted decision to recognize a Palestinian state. The Swedes are sticklers for international law, and do not believe in short cuts around the objective Montivedeo criteria for recognizing new states. Thus in explaining their decision, Stockholm said  that the Palestinians do have a government , a power exercising control. It likened it to Kosovo and Croatia, where recognition occurred when the government only controlled some of its claimed territory. The Swedes did not specify which territory the Palestinian government controls (or which government), but presumably it would include Gaza and Area A.
Even aside from the issue of whether Palestine qualifies as a state, most of the world recognizes a Palestinian “government” that includes Gaza as well. A government governs, and thus has effective control. So if the Prosector is truly guided by the opinion of the international community, she has a problem, as these views are contradictory. That is the danger in departing from legal tests to political ones.

UK to recognise CBSE certificate for admission in undergraduate programme
PTI Nov 13, 2014, 08.33PM IST
(At the meeting, India also…)
NEW DELHI: In a good news for students aspiring to take admission to undergraduate programme in UK, the universities there have agreed to recognise plus-two certificates awarded by India's Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE).
HRD Minister Smriti Irani said United Kingdom has also agreed to help the students facing visa related issues.
"Till now, CBSE students faced a problem as their certificate was not being recognised by several institutes. We raised this issue with UK earlier also and I am happy to state that they have worked on our concern and all UK universities will recognise the certificates," she said.
The Minister was talking to reporters after chairing the 6th UK India Bilateral Education Forum meeting here.
Non-recognition of certificates were discouraging many students from taking admission in UK.
Institutes there insisted students clearing the CBSE exam to do an add-on course to be eligible for admission to undergraduate courses, that school education in India was a year less than the British system.
Some of them also demanded IELTS scores, which indicate a student's proficiency in English.
At the meeting, India also sought relaxation in the post-study work visa norms that allow students to work with a minimum salary threshold of 20,000 British Pounds a year.
"We have also decided to set up a working group as to how the two countries can go ahead together especially in areas of school assessment programme, school and college leadership programme and taking education to every door through ICT," Irani said.
UK's Minister of State for Universities Greg Clark said the body would also make sure that problems with the visa system can be addressed at the highest level in UK.
Both the countries have also agreed to have exchange of academics, educators and industrial partners visiting each other campuses, he said.
Irani had sought a commitment from the UK side in this regard at the meeting.
Clark, Minister said British Government had initiated a programme, under which 25,000 young people would be sent to India to study in the next five years.
The first batch of students would reach Indian shores next summer, he said.
Britain will institute a Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Lecture and India would partially fund the initiative.

The Necessary and Proper Clause: Master or servantBy Will Baude November 13
Last week, as readers of this blog surely know, the Supreme Court heard oral argument in Zivotofsky v. Kerry, which considers the validity of a law regulating the content of U.S. passports. One constitutional question potentially implicated in the case is the scope of the Necessary and Proper Clause, in particular Congress’s power to “make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution … all other powers vested by this Constitution … in any department or officer” of the federal government. (The clause is mentioned very briefly by Jack Goldsmith here ; it still leaves open the question of a different congressional power, like commerce, discussed by Eugene Kontorovich .)
When Congress is making a law “for carrying into execution” the executive power, how much does Congress get to disagree with the executive’s view about how that power should be exercised?
As it happens this is one of several issues debated in John Manning’s Foreword and my response ( linked here Monday).
Here’s are a few bits from Manning:
The Necessary and Proper Clause, however, is a kind of master clause — one that is directed explicitly at the allocation of such decisionmaking authority. Indeed, it is part of a family of such clauses that tell us both when Congress has special responsibility to implement the Constitution and which parts of the Constitution fall within that authority.
…
Indeed, the clause states that Congress has the power to implement not only its own powers, but also “all other Powers vested by this Constitution . . . in any Department or Officer” of the government. Hence, as long as Congress acts constitutionally, the clause gives it express priority over the coordinate branches as implementer-in-chief.
And
When it comes to composing the government … the Constitution is not neutral between Congress and the coordinate branches. Rather, the Necessary and Proper Clause, as noted, gives Congress power to implement not only its own powers, but also “all other Powers vested . . . in any Department or Officer” of the federal government. Hence, to put it in the Court’s terms, if the question in Morrison was whether the removal restriction was “proper” — whether it complied with the structural underpinnings of the Constitution — then it seems meaningful, to put it mildly, that the Constitution assigns that question explicitly to Congress.
And here’s me:
Manning also argues that the specification of Congress is especially relevant because the Necessary and Proper Clause “is a kind of master clause — one that is directed explicitly at the allocation of [constitutional] decisionmaking authority.” Yet one could just as easily see the clause as servant, rather than master, including only incidental powers to effectuate the others. As a “servant clause,” it would authorize Congress to implement other constitutional powers without altering the broad outline of congressional or judicial power. The historical statements about the clause being tautologous and redundant and excluding great powers seem to point to this more modest reading.
The question of whether the Necessary and Proper Clause is to be a master clause or a servant clause arises again in Manning’s supplementary textual argument about the separation of powers. The “horizontal” component of the clause authorizes Congress “to make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution . . . all other Powers vested by this Constitution . . . in any Department or Officer [of the U.S. government.]” Manning reads it this way: “as long as Congress acts constitutionally, the clause gives it express priority over the coordinate branches as implementer-in-chief.”
But, again, that is not the only reading. One can instead read the requirement that the law be “proper for carrying into execution” the executive power as a requirement that the law be in aid or support of the President’s constitutional judgment about what is proper. As Professors Sai Prakash and Michael Ramsey have put it: “Since it is derivative of the President’s power, it must be exercised in coordination with, and not in opposition to, the President.”
The text can be read to impose similar limits on the scope of Congress’s power to make laws “necessary and proper for carrying into Execution” the power of the federal courts. While the clause has long been read to establish Congress’s power to create procedural rules, the text does not seem to take a position on whether those rules can be valid when in opposition to the Supreme Court’s own judgment about how to implement the judicial power. For restrictions on the powers of lower courts, as with restrictions on the powers of statutory officers, Congress’s implementing powers might be bolstered by the fact that it is the one that creates them. Again my point is not that these more limited readings of the horizontal Necessary and Proper Clause are necessarily right. But they are plausible, and the text itself does not tell us how to choose between them.
I’ll be interested to see if the court ends up adding anything new to this debate, or if it resolves the case on other grounds.

Unemployment and Layoffs Job Reports and Statistics Job Market Unemployment Benefits Federal Reserve Unemployment Rate
WASHINGTON -- In a paradoxically good development for the U.S. economy, Americans quit their jobs in September at the fastest rate in over six years.
Other data on Thursday showed the number of new jobless claims rose last week but remained near a 14-year low, and the two readings suggested the U.S. labor market was moving toward full health.
Two percent of U.S. job-holders, or about 2.8 million workers, left their jobs under their own volition in September, the Labor Department said.
That's important for two reasons.
"Americans are quitting their jobs more, and that's a good thing" They're finding out how sweet those Obama freebies are and boom sign me up!

One, the quits rate fell during the 2007-09 recession and has been slower to recover than other labor market indicators because workers lacked confidence to leave their jobs for greener pastures. Some analysts believe this has helped keep wage gains stagnant even as the jobless rate has fallen because employers don't have to raise wages as much to retain talent when there is less employee turnover.
Second, Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen has signaled the quits rate as an indicator she is following on her “dashboard” for assessing progress in the labor market's recovery.
“It's definitely good for wages,” said Joseph LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank. “Also, the chair of the Federal Reserve is looking at it, and if she's looking at it, we have to as well.”
The Fed last month gave an upbeat view of the jobs market, saying that labor market slack was “gradually diminishing.”
Thursday's data also showed the rate of hiring, which occupies another place on Yellen's dashboard, rose in September. The job openings rate, which has already returned to the levels seen just before the recession, fell.
In a separate report, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 12,000 to 290,000 for the week ended Nov. 8.
That was a bigger increase than expected, but claims have now been below 300,000 for nine straight weeks, suggesting firms are well past a cycle of elevated layoffs that began in the recession.
“This increase is nothing to worry about,” said Ian Shepherdson, an economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. “Claims can remain close to their current trend for an extended period.”
Yields on U.S. government debt were little changed following the publication of the two Labor Department reports. 

Dollar nears seven-year peak vs yen on Japan election speculation0
Short-term Treasury yields shot higher, widening the premium paid by U.S. two-year paper to 65 basis points over bunds and near the widest since early 2007.
As a result, the dollar soared against its peers to highs not seen since March 2009. The dollar index traded at 89.357, flirting with the 2009 peak of 89.624. A break above would take the index back near decade highs.
Against the yen, the greenback hovered just below Friday's seven-year peak of 121.69. The euro, on the other hand, languished near a two-year trough of $1.2270.
Not helping sentiment for the common currency, Standard & Poor's on Friday cut Italy's sovereign credit rating to BBB-, just one notch above junk.
For some analysts, the upbeat U.S. jobs report added to the case for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner rather than later. In stark contrast, the European Central Bank is under pressure to expand its asset-buying stimulus program.
While the ECB disappointed some by its inaction last week, President Mario Draghi gave his clearest signal yet that quantitative easing may be on the cards early in 2015.
Draghi received support from fellow policy maker Ewald Nowotny on Friday even as Germany firmly maintained its opposition to buying sovereign bonds.
"EUR/USD is on its way to below 1.20 for the first time in a decade," analysts at Societe Generale wrote in a note to clients, adding the greenback "still has plenty of room to the upside, and will be supported in 2015 by a sharp divergence in monetary policy."
Indeed, investors bought the greenback against all of its peers in the wake of the payrolls report, driving it to multi-year highs versus the Canadian and Australian dollars and a 15-month high on sterling.
The Aussie dipped below 83 U.S. cents for the first time in over four years, reaching a low of $0.8288. It could face further pressure if trade data out of China, Australia's biggest export market, were to disappoint.

WASHINGTON (AP) — More people sought U.S. unemployment benefits last week, but the increase wasn't sharp enough to disrupt the job market's positive momentum.
The Labor Department said Thursday that weekly applications rose 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted 290,000. The four-week average, a less volatile measure, increased 6,000 to 285,000, up slightly from what had the lowest average in more than 14 years.
"This increase is nothing to worry about; seasonal quirks pointed clearly to an increase, and we are relieved the number was not higher," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. He projected that at the current pace of unemployment applications, the U.S. economy should add roughly 250,000 jobs net each month.
Applications are a proxy for layoffs. The four-week average has plunged 17.2 percent in the past year, a sign that businesses feel more confident about their prospects, are holding onto workers and potentially looking to amplify hiring.
Thursday's report marked the ninth straight week of applications below 300,000. That level suggests to economists that the steady gains in jobs this year should continue.
Declining layoffs have been matched by a substantial increase in hiring. Employers added 214,000 jobs last month as the unemployment rate slid to 5.8 percent from 5.9 percent, the Labor Department said last week.
Employers have added an average of 228,500 jobs a month in 2014, up from an average of 194,000 last year. Nearly as many new jobs have been created through the first 10 months of 2014 as in all of 2013.
But the job gains have yet to push up wages much, limiting the broader growth of the U.S. economy. Average hourly pay rose 3 cents in October to $24.57. That's just 2 percent above the average wage 12 months earlier and barely ahead of a 1.7 percent inflation rate.

Sunanda death: Police may sent viscera samples abroad for testingPrint
The AIIMS medical board had confirmed poisoning as the reason behind her death but did not mention the type of poison that caused her death.
By: Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: November 13, 2014 8:47 pm | Updated: November 14, 2014 7:55 am
Delhi Police are considering sending viscera samples of former union minister Shashi Tharoor’s wife Sunanda Pushkar, who was found dead in a hotel here in January, to forensic laboratories abroad to determine the type of poison that is suspected to have caused her death.
The AIIMS medical board had, in its second report submitted to police recently, confirmed poisoning as the reason behind her death but did not mention the type of poison that caused her death.
They had listed some kind of poisons most of which were radioactive isotopes that cannot be detected by labs in India.
According to a senior police official, police are now mulling sending the viscera samples to a UK-based laboratory which has facilities to test all kinds of poisons.
“With this almost clear that Sunanda died of poisoning, the biggest question which remains in the case is that the kind of poison (used) and how it reached her body. If these question can be answered, the case could head to its logical end,” the official said on condition of anonymity.
As of now, the police have asked the AIIMS panel of doctors to redo their investigation and name the poison which caused Sunanda’s death but if it fails to do so, the samples will then be sent abroad.
The three mobile phones and a laptop of the deceased have already been sent to a forensic laboratory in Gandhinagar, Gujarat, for investigations to check whether anything was deleted from the gadgets post her death.
Today too, police questioned some people who were related to the case but senior officials refused to divulge the identities of these people and what they told police.
The AIIMS panel of doctors had earlier said the police had not shared with it the photographs of scene of occurrence, statements and circumstantial evidences with them.
Police had not quizzed a single person in the last nine months nor did it try to inspect the ‘crime’ scene.
As the police try to reinvestigate the case from scratch, there are two possibilities in the case, first is that the police register a fresh FIR in the case and second it closes investigations stating that no foul play was found.
It was only after the AIIMS report that the police got suite number 345 of Leela Palace Hotel, where Pushkar was found dead, opened.
Police had also called upon the AIIMS doctors and experts from FSL to inspect the room during which fluid marks were found on Sunanda’s bed sheet, the carpet and a broken glass in the room. These articles have also been sent to forensic labs for examination.
The suite of the five star hotel, had remained sealed and was opened for the first time since the incident.

NAY PYI TAW: India and ASEAN must collaborate to tackle terrorism, drug-trafficking and gun-running, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said, citing the successful intelligence sharing between India and Malaysia.
Modi specifically mentioned the example of security intelligence sharing between India and Malaysia when he met his Malaysian counterpart Najib Razak yesterday.
He said the Indo-Malaysian model could be followed with other ASEAN member countries as well.
"There is a need for India and ASEAN to collaboratively tackle terrorism, drug-trafficking and gun-running," Modi said.
Malaysia last week deported a suspected Sikh militant wanted for the 2009 killing of Rulda Singh, president of the Rashtriya Sikh Sangat, a RSS-affiliated Sikh cultural outfit.
During his stay in the Myanmar capital, Modi also met Russia Premier Dmitry Medvedev , The Philippines President Benigno Aquino , Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and Indonesian President Joko Widodo .
Modi, who is on a 10-day three-nation tour of Myanmar, Australia and Fiji, met the leaders on the sidelines of the two back-to-back India-ASEAN and East Asia summits here.

Fortune Business Person: 3 India-born CEOs o...3 India-born CEOs on Fortune Business Person of the Year list
PTI Nov 13, 2014, 08.57PM IST
(These corporate heads "kept…)
NEW YORK: Three leading India-born CEOs, including Microsoft's Satya Nadella, who took their companies "full speed ahead" have featured in Fortune's Businessperson of the Year list topped by Google CEO Larry Page.
Mastercard CEO Ajay Banga, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Harman International Chairman Dinesh Paliwal have been named among 50 global corporate heads by Fortune Magazine in its annual 'Businessperson of the Year' compilation.
Banga is ranked 28th on the list, Nadella 38th and Paliwal 42nd.
These corporate heads "kept a steady hand on the tiller -- and took their companies full speed ahead" in a year of "tumult from volatile markets to viral outbreaks to a striking return to Cold War politics."
Page, who topped the list, has "shown himself to be the world's most daring CEO" by not only building the Internet's "most profitable franchise" but also revolutionising transportation and "upending medicine."
Fortune said Page has built his factory of the future while keeping Google's multi-billion dollar business humming and positioning the company for a dominant role in the era of wearables and Internet-connected cars and homes.
"In a world where only the paranoid survive, Page has redefined paranoia into unbounded ambition," Fortune said.
On Banga, Fortune said: "Sometimes it's about being in the right place at the right time."
For MasterCard, that very well could come in the form of Apple Pay, which may finally break the barrier between consumers and mobile payment, the magazine said.
"MasterCard and Banga could benefit from increased transactions using mobile phones. But the CEO isn't letting MasterCard rest on its laurels, as the company continues its efforts to expand in China and other parts of Asia," it said.
MasterCard's presence in the region grew by 15pc through three quarters of 2014, compared to 2013, at a time when Asian economies have begun to show some signs of weakness, it said.
Fortune said Nadella introduced a "humbler, leaner, and hipper" Microsoft in his first year as CEO.
"Nadella, who took the helm from the notoriously outspoken Steve Ballmer last February, has initiated a complete strategic overhaul at the software giant.
"His 'cloud-first' approach, embodied in Microsoft's own cloud platform Azure, is well on its way to become a USD 4- billion-a-year player, big enough to take market leaders Salesforce.com and Amazon head on," Fortune added.
Paliwal has been leading Harman since 2007, and has overseen the development of Clari-Fi, a technology that restores the nuances that get lost when music is digitally compressed.
"Strong demand from clients like Ferrari, BMW, Audi, and Chrysler has turned Harman into a Wall Street darling, beating analysts' earnings estimates seven quarters in a row.
"Business is so good that Paliwal recently announced a USD 500-million share buy-back over the next three years," Fortune said.
The list also includes Apple CEO Tim Cook on the second spot whose recent coming out made him the first openly gay CEO in the Fortune 500.
"Replacing a legend is an exercise filled with peril. Yet three years into his stewardship of Steve Jobs' company, it is becoming increasingly clear that Tim Cook knows what he is doing as CEO of Apple," Fortune said of Cook who replaced Apple co-founder Steve Jobs after he died in 2011.
With the company's stock at an all-time high, booming sales of larger iPhones and renewed enthusiasm for Mac computers, Fortune said the coming Apple Watch and the already released Apple Pay service show that "Apple remains an innovator -- even under a CEO known more for operational prowess than product savvy."
Others on the list are Walt Disney CEO Bob Iger (6), Alibaba Founder Jack Ma (10), Facebook Founder Mark Zuckerberg (13), Tesla CEO and last year's business person of the year Elon Musk (18), Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos (25), Berkshire Hathaway Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett (34) and Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz (47).

(DLF today reported a 9% increase…)
NEW DELHI: India's largest realty firm DLF today reported a 9 per cent increase in its consolidated net profit at Rs 109.06 crore for the second quarter of this fiscal on account of higher sales and lower expenses.
Its net profit stood at Rs 100.05 crore in the year-ago period.
Income from operations rose by 3 per cent to Rs 2,013.15 crore during July-September quarter from Rs 1,956.09 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year, DLF said in a filing to the BSE.
However, total income fell to Rs 2,135.59 crore for the quarter ended September 30, 2014 from Rs 2,224.61 crore in the year-ago period.
DLF's net profit rose on the back of fall in operational expenses to Rs 1,356.52 crore from Rs 1,527.22 crore in the year-ago period. Tax expenses fell to Rs 43.06 crore from Rs 85.47 crore during the period under review.
The company's share price closed at Rs 138.90 apiece on the BSE, down by 0.57 per cent from its previous close. Its market cap stood at Rs 24,751 crore. Promoters have 74.91 per cent stake in the company.
DLF is into development of housing, office and retail properties. It has a huge land bank with potential developable area of over 300 million sq ft, of which about 60 million sq ft is under construction.
"With the policy and reform initiatives taken by the Government we see early signs of GDP growth which should result in the revival of consumer demand," DLF said in a statement
"The company is fully geared up to ride the up-cycle with its inventory of finished, valued in excess of Rs 4,000 crore (approximately), unsold inventory of launched projects under construction worth Rs 13,000 crore (approximately) and future pipeline of projects worth Rs 7,000 crore(approximately), for which all approvals are in place," the statement said.
Despite tough market conditions for the sector since the global financial crisis, the company has been able to create valuable rental assets, it said.
Given the recent notifications on the REITs, it has become incumbent upon the company to re-evaluate its strategic path and options to drive sustainable, long term growth and development of the rental business, DLF said.
"The company is committed to creating one or more sizeable REIT platform either independently or in partnership with strategic/financials partners not only to harness the growth in the market but also to unlock/part monetise the company's investment," the statment added.

The Emporiyum: All-artisanal everything at Union MarketBy Lavanya Ramanathan November 13 Follow @lalamasala
The Emporiyum was first held in Baltimore in April. (Photo by Paul Kim/Courtesy of Emporiyum)
Washington’s casual home cooks, gourmands and avowed foodies might find themselves waiting in line this weekend to sample high-end Utah salami while noshing on a pork bun from the District and cooing over stylishly packaged chocolate from Brooklyn.
If the scenario sounds insufferable, well, friend, perhaps the modern artisanal food market is not for you.
But those who enjoy nothing more than thinking about, Instagramming and eating food will want to make haste for the first District edition of the Emporiyum as it descends on Union Market.
For the vendors coming from across the country, the Emporiyum is a chance to land in the pantries (and bellies) of discerning Washington food lovers, for whom, in turn, it’s an opportunity to read the artisanal tea leaves. The savvy Emporiyum-goer will be among the first to taste goods from restaurateurs soon moving into the Washington market — and a few who might be considering it.
• Five local vendors to check out at the Emporiyum
Momofuku Milk Bar, set to open in CityCenterDC next year , will be there, as will Ohio’s beloved Jeni’s Splendid Ice Creams; the growing chain has outlets in seven cities, but curiously, nothing — yet! — between New York and Charleston, S.C.
Austin’s Paul Qui, the former “Top Chef” winner and owner of the East Side King food trucks and restaurants (and the recently lauded Thai-Kun truck), will serve steamed buns and other Asian snacks. Qui is practically a local: His mom still lives in Springfield. Could he someday plant a (way, way) East Side King in Shaw, or on H Street NE? “You never know,” he said with a laugh. “I have thought about it in the past.”

With a roster of nearly 60 vendors, the Emporiyum has managed to assemble a mouthwatering lineup despite a relatively brief track record. The first Emporiyum event took place over two days in April in Baltimore’s Fells Point.
Behind the mix of handmade caramels and pour-over coffees are Mindy Schapiro and Sue-Jean Chun, friends who say they were as inspired by the millennial-driven boom in food-makers as they were by artisanal markets in Brooklyn and Los Angeles.
Both live in Baltimore, and after Schapiro visited Brooklyn’s Smorgasburg food event two years ago, she was struck by the idea to bring something like it to Charm City. A veteran event planner from New York, Schapiro had logistics down pat; Chun, a restaurant publicist, knew precisely whom to call and how to persuade chefs into taking a gamble on a first-time market.
“My first instinct was to ask the people I was working with,” Chun said. “At the time, I was working with Bryan Voltaggio, and was working with Erik [Bruner-Yang, of Toki Underground and the forthcoming Maketto]. A lot of D.C. vendors think of Baltimore as this cool, gritty, foodie city only an hour away. So we were kind of racking up our vendors.”
Publicist Sue-Jean Chun and events planner Mindy Schapiro are the creators of the Emporiyum, a food marketplace that brings in vendors of culinary trendstuffs from artisanal pasta to small-batch bitters. (Photo by Lavanya Ramanathan/The Washington Post)
But the women say the purpose of the market is not for visitors simply to walk away stuffed and happy. Of Smorgasburg, Chun said, “People love to go there as a food destination. You go for lunch and brunch. We wanted that, but we really wanted to encourage people to shop, to buy gifts, but also buy for their own pantries.”
So, in addition to food that you can eat on-site, from well-known sellers such as Shake Shack and Taco Bamba, expect tables to be stocked with bags of fresh and dried pasta from Sfoglini, an organic pasta company from Brooklyn whose rigatoni is on the menu at Rose’s Luxury ; and Black Seed Bagels, whose New York bagels don’t require the trip up the New Jersey Turnpike.
Jeni’s will bring its holiday collection of ice creams — including sweet potato with torched marshmallows and buttercup pumpkin with amaretti cookies — for sweet tooths to eat on the spot, said Jeni Britton Bauer, the chain’s founder. But for delayed gratification, customers can place orders at the Emporiyum for ice cream to be cold-shipped in time for the holidays.
Other vendors will peddle something beyond the edible: nostalgia, updated for the adult palate. Jami Curl’s fruit chews might remind you of a Starburst, texturally, but they’re made with apples, cranberries, blackberries and cherries that Curl’s Quin Candy sources from its home in Portland, Ore. “It isn’t just that we’re dumping a bunch of ingredients into a hopper and having it squirt out of a tube and be wrapped in a wrapper,” Curl said.
The candy maker, who also took part in the first Emporiyum, sees the event as a chance for the nation’s disparate food scenes to mingle.
“There was a coffee roaster there, and a person that made doughnuts, a caramel corn company and a person that does brownies,” Curl said of her experience in Baltimore. “It was fun to see even what they’re doing with packaging. Especially the local people — to see what they do and talk to them about the stores that they sell in.”
Some might grouse about having to pay admission for what amounts to a shopping event. The organizers note, however, that pulling off an indoor market with food isn’t without overhead, including rental of the space, power and other needs of the businesses. The ticket price, Chun says, allows vendors to keep every penny of what they will make this weekend.
You might even consider doubling-down on the $20 ticket price to fork over $40 for VIP access, which comes not only with early admission, but a gift bag filled with items from sponsors and vendors, cocktails and a free brunch buffet from the food-makers at Union Kitchen .
With other markets, said Britton Bauer of Jeni’s, “Sometimes you pay your admission fee, and it’s this really crowded free-for-all of eating.” What the Emporiyum is doing differently, she said, “is that that’s like an art fair. You walk up, you’re in the space, you’re sampling the fare, you’re looking at it, you’re tasting it. And then you have this option of purchasing it. It becomes an experience.”
If you go:
Where: The Maurice Electric Warehouse, 500 Penn St. NE, on the Union Market campus. Metro: NoMa-Gallaudet. Union Market won’t shutter to make room for Emporiyum shoppers this weekend, so get to the venue early if you plan to park.
When: Saturday from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.; Sunday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. VIP tickets include access at 10 a.m.
Price: $20 a day for general admission; $40 for VIP, which includes food from Union Kitchen Catering, early access to vendors, specialty cocktails and a gift bag. Advance VIP tickets are sold out, but both types of walk-up tickets will be available at the door.
Pro tips: Co-founder Sue-Jean Chun says there will be “ample samples,” meaning “plenty to eat and drink without additional money.” You should be prepared to buy more food, although she recommends a little self-control. There’s no need to get everything. Chun suggests going to the Emporiyum with a strategy. Are you there to buy things for yourself? Maybe you want to purchase items for your Thanksgiving table. (Frozen Crack Pie from Momofuku Milk Bar, anyone?) Or perhaps you’re looking to buy holiday gifts for the food lovers on your list. Setting goals will give you a sense of purpose and focus.
Make a day of it: The Emporiyum is part of Fifth Street Folly, a weekend-long street party hosted by Union Market. The other events include Thread, the market’s recurring fashion bazaar; a beer garden from Bluejacket brewery and Red Apron Butchery; and a Gilt City warehouse sale.

Dr. Oz solicits health questions on Twitter  gets attacked by trolls insteadBy Abby Phillip November 13 Follow @abbydphillip

No doubt, Mehmet Oz, the New York cardiothoracic surgeon behind the pop-health show "Dr. Oz," has entangled himself in some questionable science and even more questionable medicine. Yet he and his daytime show remain incredibly popular .
So it's probably unfair to fault him for thinking that this popularity would extend to the Internet and social media. On Wednesday, using the hashtag #OzsInbox, Oz solicited questions on Twitter that he said he would answer on his Web site at some undisclosed time.
What is your biggest question for me? Reply with #OzsInbox and I'll answer my favorites on http://t.co/8kjmALRoAd .
— Dr. Mehmet Oz (@DrOz) November 11, 2014
As often happens with these things , it didn't go well. Twitter users have been hammering Oz with a stream of sarcastic questions and attacks on his credibility as a physician.
Oz has done a lot to damage his credibility as a medical doctor over the years. He came under fire for touting "miracle" weight-loss products that turned out to be entirely discredited ; for announcing that his own children wouldn't be vaccinated (which he blamed on his wife's insistence); and for suggesting on national TV that the Ebola virus could become airborne .
His show is a magnet for people who are interested in looking younger and losing weight with the least amount of effort. But as Congress and others have pointed out, Oz features some products and advice for which there is little actual scientific evidence.
His TV viewers are likely low-information consumers of health news. But online, his solicitation put him in the cross hairs of some of his harshest critics. And they weren't at all charitable.
Here are some of the responses:

Payrolls rose by 321,000 in November, way above the 230,000 estimated, while the unemployment rate held steady at 5.8 percent, a six-year low.
The report blew past forecasts, but also raised expectations that a rate hike from the Federal Reserve may materialize sooner than previously thought.
Ronald Sanchez, chief investment officer of Fiduciary Trust Company International in New York, said the number was "unambiguously strong," though it "could mean some changes to policy recommendations with the Fed. June 2015 is back on the table for when rates could rise."
Financials <.SPSY> rose 1 percent as higher interest rates would prop up earnings in the sector. Bank of America  rose 2.7 percent to $17.68 while Goldman Sachs  was up 1.8 percent to $195.45, boosting the Dow.
Utilities <.SPLRCU>, a dividend play, fell 0.8 percent as Treasuries yields rose. Energy <.SPNY> fell 1.2 percent alongside a 1.7 percent drop in crude  prices. Most sectors ended well off their highs of the session.
"The day's market action has to be seen in the context of the recovery we've had year-to-date. Payrolls confirm the strength of the economy, but that strength is reflected in stock prices," said Sanchez, who helps oversee $16 billion in assets.
Separate data showed new orders for U.S. factory goods fell for a third straight month in October, pointing to a slowdown in manufacturing activity.
The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> rose 58.69 points, or 0.33 percent, to 17,958.79, the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 3.45 points, or 0.17 percent, to 2,075.37 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 11.32 points, or 0.24 percent, to 4,780.76.
For the week, the Dow rose 0.7 percent and the S&P rose 0.4 percent. It was the seventh straight weekly gain, a streak not seen in a year for both. The Nasdaq fell 0.2 percent on the week.
American Eagle Outfitters  fell 13.8 percent to $11.91 after the teen apparel retailer forecast a current-quarter profit below analysts' estimates and reported its fifth straight drop in quarterly income.
About 5.81 billion shares traded on all U.S. platforms, according to BATS exchange data.
NYSE advancers outnumbered decliners 1,614 to 1,480, for a 1.09-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,809 issues rose and 927 fell, for a 1.95-to-1 ratio favoring advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 98 new 52-week highs and 10 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 168 new highs and 93 new lows.

ED registers money laundering case against SaharaED registers money laundering case against Sahara Group
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: November 13, 2014  | 22:20 IST
Sahara Group chief Subrata Roy
Enforcement Directorate (ED) has registered a money laundering case against Sahara Group in connection with non-payment of crores of rupees to depositors as probed by capital markets regulator SEBI.
The criminal case was registered by the Mumbai zonal office of the agency after it got reports in this regard from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), official sources said in New Delhi.
A case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act has been registered against Sahara Group.
The investigations are in progress, they said. Emails sent to Sahara group to elicit their response in this regard did not fructify.
Sahara Group chief Subrata Roy was jailed in March amid a long-running dispute of his group with SEBI over repayment of over Rs 20,000 crore to investors. Sahara Group, however, has maintained that it has repaid over 93 per cent of the investors directly. The ED is now investigating whether these funds were laundered to create illegal assets.
The complaint has been registered by the agency based on the findings of SEBI till now, they said. Sources said the agency would initiate action to attach some assets of the group under the PMLA, depending on the findings of the probe.

MILAN: Fiat Chrysler Automobiles expects to get 2.25 billion euros ($2.81 billion) from Ferrari via transactions it will execute before it spins off the luxury sportscar unit from the group, a filing with U.S. market regulator SEC showed on Thursday.
FCA CEO Sergio Marchionne said last month he would spin off Ferrari from the group, sell a 10 percent stake via a public offering and distribute the rest of FCA's stake in the luxury sports car brand to its shareholders.
The spin-off is part of a bigger capital-raising plan that also includes a $2.5 billion convertible bond issue to help cut debt and fund an ambitious business plan at the world's seventh-largest carmaker. Marchionne said at the time that all the measures would inject a total of 4 billion euros into the group.
In the SEC filing, the company said "prior to the separation (of Ferrari from FCA) we also intend to enter into certain other transactions including distributions and transfers of cash from Ferrari to FCA currently estimated at 2.25 billion euros."

Raji Reddy Kesireddy, ET Bureau Nov 13, 2014, 09.24PM IST
(The North American market…)
HYDERABAD: Several Indian pharmaceutical firms with sizeable resources are preparing to buy global medicine brands with good sales potential in the US, as they try to offset constraints including price erosion and long gestation for product approvals that have of late dented their revenue.
Strengthening their US portfolio is key for these companies. The North American market contributes nearly half their global formulation sales and the US is the biggest segment of that. The targets for these companies are brands costing $5-10 million each.
India's second-largest drug firm, Dr Reddy's Laboratories, recently bought nicotine patch brand Habitrol from Novartis, while Lupin is scouting for a portfolio of US brands. Indian manufacturers are looking at buying brands with good sales potential in the US market, instead of acquiring the companies, said KPMG India's partner and head of life sciences practice, Utkarsh Palnitkar. "Recent moves by some of the larger companies seem to validate this. This trend is likely to help Indian companies overcome price erosion constraints and contain the impact on their revenue caused by the long gestation for product approvals."
The US market alone accounted for nearly 30% of India's medicine exports of $15 billion in the fiscal year through March 2014.Dr Reddy's, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Ranbaxy Laboratories, Lupin, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals and Aurobindo Pharma are among the top exporters of generic medicine to North America.
Indian drugmakers are stepping up shopping at a time when an increasing number of multinational drug companies are exiting non-core therapeutic segments to focus on a few core therapeutics. While the MNCs are known for their focus on brand building and brand consolidation for decades, the Indian companies, which are relatively not so focused on brands, now consider optimising spending on brands inevitable to stay afloat first and consolidate later.
According to Palnitkar, large Indian generic players are likely to be the first ones to step up their brand shopping in the US, which in turn could also imply further challenges for small and midsized players operating in the North American market. "Brand acquisition may also be a viable market entry strategy for companies who wish to establish a footprint in the US. Acquiring a successful brand would be a more risk averse, albeit an expensive, approach to increase market presence," he told ET.
Dr Reddy's chief operating officer Abhijit Mukherjee said the acquisition of Habitrol franchise from Novartis was part of the company's over-the-counter strategy. Given the client base in the US and the value the latest brand acquisition brings to the table, "it's a good deal for us", he said.
Lupin's chief financial officer, Ramesh Swaminathan, confirmed the company's plans to buy brands in the US market. "We are looking at acquiring a portfolio of brands in the US. We may close some of them or at least one before the end of the current financial year."
Lupin, the fifth largest Indian generic player in the North American market, is aiming at growing its US sales by 20-25% a year. During the last fiscal year, it posted $803 million sales, reflecting growth of 16% over the previous fiscal year.
On the preference of Indian companies for brands instead of buying companies, KPMG India's Palnitkar said strong brands would facilitate the franchisebuilding exercise of pharma companies with doctors and patients.
"The brand value of medicines is what attracts attention after the expiry of patent exclusivity and is indicative of continued product acceptance. Additionally, companies are increasingly looking at alternatives to avoid the predominant manufacturing and other risks associated with acquiring companies." Some Indian copycat drug firms blame delayed approvals from the US drug regulator for denting their US sales and hampering growth.

Were Republicans worried that attacking Obamacare would turn out DemocratsBy Philip Bump November 13 Follow @pbump
The Post's Jose DelReal explains why Affordable Care Act architect Jonathan Gruber's year-old comments about the historic law have Republicans so angry. (Jose A. DelReal and Nicki DeMarco/The Washington Post)
It's been the comments of economist Jonathan Gruber that has  vaulted talk of repealing Obamacare back into the news . Republicans have seized on Gruber's remarks as suggesting that the development of President Obama's eponymous health-care policy was tainted from the outset, reinvigorating calls to scale it back.
On the midterm campaign trail, as many outlets noted , Republicans scaled back talk about repealing Obamacare. Candidates often massaged details of the program (like state exchanges and Medicaid expansion ), while still opposing "Obamacare" at large. (Thom Tillis, whose discussion of Medicaid is the second link there, tweeted "I would vote to repeal Obamacare" when the story came out.)
The issue wasn't central, though. That's in part because candidates seized on more visceral issues, like a threat from the Islamic State or, in the last days of the cycle, fear about Ebola . What's more, passion about Obama-related issues tends to spike sporadically: Benghazi revelations and the IRS targeting tend to inspire new fevers as new e-mails about talking points or new interviews with staffers are released. The rise of what's now being called Grubergate (Woodward and Bernstein, what have you wrought?) has inspired another such spike.
But.
Republicans did well this month in part because turnout among Democrats plummeted from 2012 levels. Low turnout very nearly cost Democrats a Senate seat in Virginia . It was a campaign without a narrative, as we liked to say .
If there had been a narrative, particularly if "repeal Obamacare" had been the motivating factor behind Republican campaigns, that might not have been the case. In national  exit polling , 46 percent of respondents said the health-care law was about right or didn't go far enough; four-fifths of them voted for Democrats. Among those who said health care was the most important issue facing the country (a quarter of voters), they backed Democrats by a 20-point margin. Obamacare has always been fairly unpopular overall, but support for it is high among Democrats and relatively mixed (though negative) among independents .
This was always the value proposition for Democrats. The population of Americans with new, affordable coverage would spur enthusiasm for the party. Even in the wake of the HealthCare.gov flub, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid predicted that it would be a winner for the party this year. That wasn't the case -- but  then, no one ran on it. The debate echoes that of the president's absence from the campaign trail and prompts this question: Could Obamacare have helped his party?
At the very least, not making a big deal out of Obamacare on the campaign trail didn't hurt Republicans. Turnout among conservatives as a percentage of the electorate was down from the Tea Party wave of 2010, according to exit polls, but still trumped liberal turnout by 14 percentage points. Republicans made up more of the electorate this year than four years ago. Republican turnout, in other words, didn't need a boost by running hard against Obamacare. And Republicans certainly didn't want to give any boosts to their opponents.
Something that will be interesting to watch: How interest in "Obamacare" on Google evolves over time. The graph below shows searches over the past year -- a decent metric for gauging public interest. There were big spikes at the end of 2013 and as the sign-up deadline arrived, then a quiet period during campaign season. Then, at the end, during the week of the election, an uptick that's growing -- for now.
Republicans are happy, post-Gruber (and in an otherwise quiet political media moment) to talk about Obamacare once again. The election-season lull may not have been intentional, but it sure didn't hurt.
House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) outlined his priorities at a news conference following the midterm elections that swept many Republicans into Congress. He said the president "needs to put politics aside" in dealing with Republican lawmakers. (AP)

Conversational snow odds this evening tick up slightly north and west of BeltwayBy Jason Samenow November 13 Follow @capitalweather
HRRR model shows scattered snow showers impacting DC’s western suburbs around midnight (WeatherBell.com)
New data this morning suggest the chances of spying the season’s first flakes tonight have inched up, mainly in our colder north and west suburbs.
Modeling shows scattered rain showers likely moving into the region late this afternoon.  As the evening wears on, temperatures aloft will steadily cool, allowing rain to mix with and, possibly, change to snow – especially north and west of the Beltway.  Inside the Beltway and to the south and east, the chance of snow is low (25 percent or less), but a few flakes cannot be ruled out.
The locations with the best chance of seeing snow, and even enough to briefly whiten grassy areas, are in the higher elevations of upper Montgomery County, Frederick County, and Loudoun County.
The National Weather Service highlights the zone west of I-95 where a little snow could accumulate, primarily on grassy areas – as temperatures should remain above freezing in most areas during the event.
National Weather Service snowfall forecast for tonight (NWS)
 
It’s not completely out of the question that, if a heavier band of snow develops, a little slush could briefly build-up on the roads in this area west of town – but unlikely.  The National Weather Service says there’s a 10 percent chance of around 0.5-1 inch of accumulation and a 50-50 chance of enough to whiten the ground (again, mainly grassy areas) in these colder areas.
GFS model indicates precipitation type turning to snow between 7 p.m. and 1 a.m. tonight (WeatherBell.com)
If the snow materializes, it would most likely be in the window between 10 p.m. and 1 a.m. – first in western areas and possibly reaching areas along and I-95 after 11 p.m. before all precipitation exits to the east.  In most areas near and east of I-95, precipitation probably exits before it gets cold enough to snow.
Any areas that achieve measurable snow will do so about a month ahead of schedule.

Nats offered Desmond $107 million  seven-yearsBy Adam Kilgore November 13 Follow @adamkilgorewp
(Photo by John McDonnell/The Washington Post)
The Nationals and homegrown, franchise-bedrock shortstop Ian Desmond are expected to resume contract extension talks this winter, one year before Desmond can become a free agent. The sides will reconvene with a nine-figure starting point.
The Nationals offered Desmond a contract extension last offseason that would have paid him $107 million over seven years, according to multiple people familiar with the situation. The contract would have included the two-year, $17.5 million deal Desmond signed last January, meaning Desmond would have made $89.5 million over five would-be free agent seasons. The deal also would have included deferred money, decreasing its true value.
Drafted by the Montreal Expos in 2004, Desmond has become a slugging, all-star shortstop, a clubhouse leader and a pillar in the organization . Based on his total contribution and the difficulty of finding a shortstop with his offensive ability, the Nationals may prioritize keeping Desmond long-term over pitcher Jordan Zimmermann, the other homegrown star eligible for free agency after 2015.
While $107 constitutes a staggering sum and a significant offer from the Nationals, Desmond had cause to turn it down. In a league-wide scoring downturn, the market has rewarded players with Desmond’s ability to hit and hit for power. One industry source, affiliated with neither the Nationals nor Desmond, said Desmond would receive far more than $90 million over five years if he became a free agent after 2015 with one more average season.
Recent precedents back that up. In April 2013, Rangers shortstop Elvis Andrus signed an eight-year, $120 million contract extension at age 24, two seasons away from free agency.
Last winter, center fielder Jacoby Ellsbury – an athletic, middle-of-the-field player – signed a seven-year, $153 million deal with the Yankees at age 30, the same age Desmond will be when he’s eligible for free agency. Per FanGraphs.com, Ellsbury had collected 23.7 wins above replacement in his career before hitting free agency. With one season left, Desmond has 16.5 career WAR.
On Wednesday, 35-year-old designated hitter Victor Martinez signed a four-year, $68 million contract, another sign of how offense pays even for players with limited or no defensive ability.  And Desmond plays a premium position.
Even in a season when 183 strikeouts dropped his batting average to .255, Desmond slugged 24 home runs and drove in 91 runs, both of which led major league shortstops. He also added 24 stolen bases. Desmond has hit at least 20 homers in three straight years and won two straight Silver Slugger awards.
Regarding his contract status, Desmond made his position clear last spring. He wants to play his entire career in Washington, where he has developed ties to the community, specifically with his work for the Nationals Youth Baseball Academy. But he also wants to ensure he does not depress the market for fellow shortstops.
“There have been a lot of people that have come through this game that have sacrificed a lot for us, the players that are coming through now,” Desmond said last March in Viera, Fla. “I don’t want to sign a deal — and this isn’t to say they’ve offered me this — but I don’t want to sign a deal that is so bad that a future shortstop gets screwed because I signed a terrible deal. I’m not going to be that guy, that kink in the chain. I’m going to get a fair deal, or I’m just going to wait.”

Indian Super League: FC Goa hands Delhi Dynamos 4-1 thrashingPrint
Goa's Australian striker Tolgay Ozbey completed the rout in the 60th minute, dribbling past a series of Dynamos defenders. (Source: ISL)
By: Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: November 13, 2014 10:05 pm | Updated: November 13, 2014 10:17 pm
FC Goa got their act together after a couple of winless outings as they handed Delhi Dynamos an embarrassing 4-1 defeat, riding on Youness Bengelloun’s twin strikes in an Indian Super League encounter on Thursday.
The victory couldn’t have come at a better time as it kept them in the reckoning for a semi-final berth in the cash-rich league.
Bengelloun scored in the 18th and 48th minute while captain Robert Pires and Australian striker Tolgay Ozbey scored one apiece, in the 53rd and 60 minute respectively.
Gustavo Santos pulled one back for the hosts, when he converted from the spot in the 73rd minute, but that was just a consolation goal as was evident from the faces of the disappointed Delhi fans and players.
The victory, a very important one for FC Goa, finally put an end to the visiting side’s search for three points, their second in the tournament, while extending Dynamos’ winless run.
The Dynamos have now slipped to the bottom following four draws, three losses and a solitary win, while Goa improved a rung to move upto seventh spot with four defeats, two draws and as many wins in the eight-team franchise-based tournament.
The Goa outfit went ahead when Frenchman Bengelloun found the net almost halfway into the first half.
The second goal came as Andre Santos delivered a cross for Bengelloun, which the former Paris Saint Germain ‘B’ team defended gleefully headed home.
The visitors slammed the door on chances of a Dynamos comeback when Pires converted from the spot after Tolgay Ozbey, who was through with ball, was felled by Delhi’s giant shotstopper Kristof Van Hout.
Tolgay completed the rout in the 60th minute, dribbling past a series of Dynamos defenders before successfully finding the back of the net at the JLN Stadium, which witnessed a paltry turnout.
The about 6000-odd turnout was the worst in the tournament, which is otherwise creating new scales in in-stadia audience, when compared to other to leagues in Asia.
Bengelloun first scored off a rebound after Gregory Arnolin’s header was kept out by the tall Dynamos goalkeeper Kristof Van Hout. The initial move began with a Andre Santos corner that landed on the feet of Robert Pires, who gave it to Bikramjeet Singh to make the final cross from the right.
The Dynamos had an outside chance to equalise a few minutes later but Robert Lalthlamuana’s volley off a cross from the right narrowly misses the right side of the post.
Lalthlamuana’s approach before taking the shot though seemed a bit casual.
Besides, there was also a cross from the right by Steven Dias but Morten Skoubo could not reach the ball in time.
The Dynamos were certainly not lacking as far as build-up was concerned but, as has been their wont in the inaugural edition of the franchise-based league so far, could not make it count upfront.
A lot like in their continued…

Mizoram plans to build second airport in light of upcoming trade routePrint
By: Express News Service | Aizawl | Posted: November 13, 2014 9:21 pm
A site for Mizoram’s second airport has been identified as the state hopes to make the best use of an under-construction trade route that will link the landlocked North-East to the Bay of Bengal for the first time.
Chief Minister Lal Thanhawla said in the assembly Thursday the government has identified a site near the southern town of Lunglei and that it is waiting for a nod from the Civil Aviation Ministry before construction begins.
Responding to a starred question by opposition MLA Dr K Beichhua, Lal Thanhawla said a site has been chosen near Kawnzawl in central Mizoram that can at least be developed to cater to smaller-sized airplanes such as ATR flights although the government would prefer an airstrip large enough to accommodate larger aircraft.
Being a hilly state, it is difficult to find flat land for projects such as airports. Even the lone domestic airport at Lengpui is a tabletop airport, one of only five in the country along with those at Mangalore, Kozhikode, Kullu and Leh.
“A detailed project report of Rs 155 crores has in fact already been completed. But one hurdle we have faced is a rule that civil airports cannot be within 150 kms of each other as the crow flies. We have asked the Civil Aviation Ministry for special consideration,” Lal Thanhawla said.
The CM also explained the context in which the new airport is being considered, saying the main reason is because the Kaladan Multi-Modal Transport Transit Project (an MEA-funded road and waterway project that will link southern Lawngtlai town to Sittwe port in Myanmar’s Rakhine state) is soon to be complete.
“This project will put Mizoram on a major trade route, so we would prefer to have an airport in the southern parts of the state so that at least businessmen and officials can travel there easily,” the CM added.

Jaguar Land Rover UK staff reject pay deal, union calls for more talks
Reuters Nov 13, 2014, 08.04PM IST
(Talks between the Indian…)
LONDON: British workers at carmaker Jaguar Land Rover have voted against an offered pay rise and pension changes as Britain's biggest trade union said the firm should return to the negotiating table or face a ballot for industrial action.
Talks between the Tata-owned automaker and workers' representatives ended with no agreement in October after the union rejected a pay deal offering staff a rise of at least 3 percent in each of the next three years.
On Thursday, trade union Unite said nearly 13,000 staff had rejected the pay offer, with just under 500 accepting.
Unite national officer Roger Maddison said there were concerns over what he said were proposed reductions to pension provisions at the firm.
"With the company making a staggering 10 million pounds ($15.7 million) profit a day, it is no surprise that the workforce is angered by pension cuts and a pay offer that falls short in recognising their role in that success," he said.
Jaguar Land Rover would not comment on details of the pay or pension deal when asked by Reuters but a spokesman said the firm was very disappointed with the result of the ballot but committed to reaching a negotiated settlement.
After years in the doldrums, Jaguar Land Rover has enjoyed a new lease of life since it was bought by India's Tata group in 2008, recording a 2013/14 pre-tax profit of 2.5 billion pounds, more than doubling in three years.
Staff were offered a 3.6 percent rise in the first year plus a bonus and either 3 percent or the Retail Prices Index measure of inflation plus 0.5 percent depending on which is higher in years two and three, a trade union source told Reuters.
Last year the firm built almost one in three of Britain's 1.5 million cars and in October opened a 500 million pound engine manufacturing centre, its fifth site in Britain.

Senate GOP picks new campaign chiefBy Paul Kane November 13 Follow @pkcapitol
Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), a seven-year Senate veteran, was elected chairmen of the National Republican Senatorial Committee Thursday, defeating Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.).
Wicker, 63, now has the task of defending the new GOP majority in 2016, a year that sets up unfavorably for Republicans as they must defend six seats held by first-term senators in states that President Obama won twice.
Republicans will enter the 2016 campaign with a three- or four-seat majority, depending on the outcome of the Louisiana runoff election in December.
Wicker's first job will be raising early campaign cash -- the NRSC has raised far less than its Democratic counterpart in recent elections -- and to recruit challengers to the few Democratic incumbents up in 2016 who are potentially in electoral danger. The top target: Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.), the outgoing majority leader whose state voted for Republicans in almost every statewide office last week.
The contest came down to two senators who are back-benchers, as most of the well-known Republicans are either up for re-election in 2016 or considering running for president -- or both.

Five armymen get life sentence over Machil staged shootoutFive armymen get life sentence over staged shootout
By Indo Asian News Service | IANS India Private Limited/Yahoo India News –  Thu 13 Nov, 2014

Srinagar/New Delhi: Five armymen have been awarded life sentence for a staged shootout in 2010 in which three youths were killed in Machil area of Jammu and Kashmir's Kupwara district, army sources said.
Chief Minister Omar Abdullah, however, in a tweet said that seven army personnel were awarded life terms for the incident.
Army sources said the five men, including two officers, were sentenced by "summary general court martial" but the sentence was subject to confirmation.
The five armymen were identified as Colonel Dinesh Pathania, Captain Upendra, Havildar Devender, Lance Naik Lakhmi and Lance Naik Arun Kumar.
The sources said the army does not take such instances lightly and justice was being delivered speedily after start of the court martial proceedings.
Shezad Ahmad, Muhammad Shafi and Riyaz Ahmad, all from Nadihal village in Baramulla district, were gunned down by the armymen near the Line of Control (LoC) in Machil May 3, 2010.
The army had then claimed that the youths were Pakistan-trained guerrillas who were killed while trying to infiltrate into the Kashmir Valley.
But when pictures of the slain youths were published in newspapers, their families and relatives identified them as three missing youths who had no connection with militancy.
In the aftermath of the alleged staged shootout, protests and clashes with security forces erupted in the Kashmir Valley.
Police investigation established that two men, Abbas Hussain and Bashir Ahmad, who worked with the army, lured the three youths in the name of providing them jobs.
But they were taken to Machil and killed in cold blood.
The families of the deceased in 2010 demanded a trial in a civil court. But the army opted for a general court martial.
Abdullah welcomed the award of sentence in the case.
"The army has handed out life sentences to seven, including the CO (commanding officer), in the Machil fake encounter case of 2010. This is indeed a welcome step," the chief minister posted on Twitter.
"I hope we never see such Machil fake encounter type of incidents ever again and let this serve as a warning to those tempted to try," he added.

MAIT to organise mega ICT expo in MysoreMAIT to organise mega ICT expo in Mysore
Sangeetha Chengappa
Tweet
Bangalore, November 13:  
The Manufacturers’ Association for Information Technology (MAIT) is organising a mega ICT Expo in Mysore in February 2015, with electronics manufacturing as the larger theme.
Speaking to BusinessLine at CeBIT India, Anwar Shirpurwala, Executive Director, MAIT, said: “I see great potential for Mysore in emerging as the next big destination for ICT in India. The idea is to make more destinations popular for electronics manufacturing around the country.” 
Support to States, SMEs
The ICT Expo will invite all the States to participate with provisions for State pavilions and also provide a platform for small and medium enterprises to showcase their capabilities.  
Stating that electronics manufacturing in India is very fragmented and typically spread across Delhi-NCR, Puducherry, Sriperumbudur, Uttarakhand and Goa, Shirpurwala said: “The ICT Expo will provide great visibility to SMEs that have the capacity to solve some big problems with their innovative solutions. SMEs should know that they have a great role to play in the new Government’s ‘Make in India’ initiative and we want to play the facilitator’s role in getting SMEs to be a part of that initiative.”
MAIT has 100 member-companies of which 40 are SMEs. The industry body aims to add 1,000 SMEs to its member list over the next 12 months.
It has conducted five SME conclaves in Bangalore, Noida, Pune, Ahmedabad and Hyderabad and is conducting the next two in Thiruvananthapuram and Chennai, in November and December.

Foreign investors add stake in PSU banksForeign investors add stake in PSU banks
Vishwanath Kulkarni
But find private sector banks more favourite
Bangalore, November 13:  
A large chunk of the public sector banks have witnessed an increase in interest among the foreign institutional investors in recent quarters. The FII holdings in banks such as Bank of Baroda and SBI, among others, has risen in the past two quarters, while in banks such as Andhra Bank it has registered a decline.
Bank of Baroda leads
Analysts attribute the rising trend in FII holdings to the positive sentiment witnessed in the economy in the past few months with the change in Government at the Centre. For the quarter ended September, Bank of Baroda had the highest FII holding at 18 per cent, followed by Punjab National Bank at 17.36 per cent. State Bank of India, the largest player, had a FII holding of 11.18 per cent.
Anuj Jain of CARE Ratings said the rising FII interest in the PSBs could reflect their belief in country’s growth story. “Their belief that the banks, at some stage, may play a role in the economic revival, although performance has not been really good in the recent quarter, could be driving the trend,” Jain added.
Bank-specific interest
“The rising FII interest in the PSBs is bank-specific and is linked to the element of positivity in the economy witnessed in the past few months. It also depends on how the PSBs are positioned in terms of capital adequacy,” said Aalok Shah, Banking & Financial Services Analyst, Centrum Broking.
“Compared to a year ago, the larger concerns associated with the PSBs have largely eased now. Also, the asset quality is seen stabilising and the pace of accretion to the non-performing assets has slowed down. Further the deceleration witnessed in the return on assets has been largely arrested attracting the FII interests,” Shah said.
Though the PSBs have managed to attract the foreign investors’ interest, they are still way behind compared with their private sector counterparts. The FII holding in Axis Bank stood at 47.52 per cent during the September quarter, while it was 41.1 per cent for ICICI Bank and 33.84 per cent for HDFC Bank for the period.

SanDisk in talks with Indian phone-makers to enhance memory of devicesSanDisk in talks with Indian phone-makers to enhance memory of devices
Venkatesh Ganesh
Bangalore, November 13:  
Indian phone brands such as Micromax and Lava could soon offer devices with four times more memory.
SanDisk, a maker of memory cards that go into phones and other devices, is in talks with Indian phone companies to embed a 128-GB memory card with the devices.
Most phones in the market come with a 32-GB inbuilt memory, with the exception of brands such as iPhone, which comes with an inbuilt memory of 128 GB. With 128 GB you can store 32,000 mp3 songs or photos compared with 8,000 in a 32GB phone.
The SanDisk card will be part of the internal memory of a smartphone. “We are talking to the leading Indian companies and will make an announcement soon,” said Pankaj Mehra, Senior Fellow, SanDisk, at CeBIT India.
Vivek Tyagi, Director, Business Development, Commercial sales and support, SanDisk India, said that with usage of data storage rising, customers want cards that can store large data volumes.
SanDisk is making these moves at a time when smartphone penetration is on the rise with around 200 million smartphones sold in India last year, according to analyst estimates. This also coincides with the rise of homegrown phone-makers such as Micromax, Karbonn, LAVA, Intex and Celkon, which have together cornered a majority share of the phone market.
However, industry watchers feel flash memory cards are still too costly for entry-level phones. The price difference could be upwards of 10 per cent, they say. Indian consumers will prefer buying separate memory cards if the price is not low, said Sanchit Vir Gogia, analyst at Greyhound Research. 
But the addressable market for embedded flash memory is expected to increase from $12 billion in 2013 to $18 billion by 2020, according to analysts.

Kolkata, November 13:  
Emami Infrastructure Ltd, the realty arm of the Emami Group, has formally called off a merger proposal of its wholly-owned subsidiary Emami Realty with another listed Emami Group company Zandu Realty Ltd.
This decision was taken after the Bombay Stock Exchange disallowed its no-objection to the scheme of amalgamation in view of SEBI’s observation on the subject.
The Board of Emami Infrastucture last year had approved the scheme of amalgamation of Emami Realty Ltd with Zandu Realty Ltd with effect from April 2013.
The company’s board has now decided “not to proceed further with the proposal of amalgamation” after the SEBI observation.
The company, in a note to the profit and loss account for the second quarter, said all related proceedings now stood withdrawn.
Emami Ltd, the flagship company of the group, had acquired Zandu Pharmaceutical in 2008-09 and later hived off Zandu’s real estates in Mumbai into Zandu Realty.

Key areas are textile, auto, petrochemicals
Chennai, November 13:  
It is not cost per unit of power but quality and availability that should concern the industry, said Saurabhbhai Patel, Finance Minister of Gujarat.
Responding to a senior executive from a manufacturing unit raising a question on cost of power in Gujarat, Patel said availability of power and competitive pricing are issues to be considered as they burden consumers, especially industry.
A utility with efficient distribution, low transmission and distribution losses, and minimal cash losses will be naturally competitive. On these counts Gujarat is ahead with a power surplus — it backs down nearly 5,000 MW of generation capacity — the utility is cash positive and 24-hour quality power supply is assured.
The State also has a diverse bank of fuels for power generation including coal, solar and gas. The State has a well established grid for energy water and gas with more than 15 lakh households in cities and villages getting piped gas.
Patel was making a pitch to industry for participation in the ‘Vibrant Gujarat 2015 – The Global Business Hub’ to attract investments to the State. Gujarat will have a clutch of industry-specific policies to attract investments ahead of the event to be held between January 11 and 13.
Focus area
Key focus areas for the State are textile, automobiles and downstream petrochemical industries. These will be encouraged with a number of incentives. Service sector will be a focus area with the State set to announce an IT policy in the next few days. Also in the pipeline are policies for SMEs and start-ups in the small-scale sector, he said. Vibrant Gujarat is positioned as a platform to attract investments not just to the State but the entire country as all State governments can showcase their potential, he said.

Prasad to meet Defence Minister to resolve spectrum issuesPrasad to meet Defence Minister to resolve spectrum issues
Our Bureau
Ravi Shankar Prasad
New Delhi, November 13:  
Communications and Information Technology Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Thursday said he would soon meet the Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar to discuss outstanding issues related to getting more spectrum for mobile services.
One of the major issues is the Department of Telecom (DoT) proposal to swap spectrum in the 2100 MHz band, which is currently with the defence forces, in exchange for capacity in the 1900 MHz band. The DoT wants to get bandwidth in the 2100 MHz band for 3G mobile services.
“I have proposed to meet the defence minister shortly. I reviewed the entire spectrum issue, including spectrum availability. I have also reviewed the entire programme for auctioning and the need for certain guidelines like trading and sharing,” he told reporters here after an internal meeting with the DoT.
Telecom regulator TRAI has proposed deferring the auction till the DoT is able to get additional spectrum from the defence forces.
While the Telecom Ministry is not in favour of postponing the auction, efforts are being made to get additional spectrum vacated.
The DoT has already inked a deal to get 150 MHz from the defence forces.
However, this does not include airwaves in the 2100 MHz and 700 MHz bands, which are ideal for mobile broadband services. Some companies, including Vodafone India, said the Government should defer the next spectrum auction as operators could lose business in some circles if adequate spectrum is not put for sale.
Bansal interaction
Prasad also met Sachin Bansal, Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Flipkart, to discuss logistics and connectivity issues affecting e-commerce in the country.
“Sachin Bansal has been a great success story in e-commerce. We discussed some strategic issues like logistics and I have told him we will work them out. As far as postal (India Post) is concerned, we have already started working on it. It is led by a high-power committee headed by former Cabinet Secretary TSR Subramanian,” he added.

Norms for payment  small banks by month-endNorms for payment, small banks by month-end
Reuters
Idea is to facilitate lending to weaker sections, SMEs: Rajan
MUMBAI, Nov 13:  
Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan said it is not necessary that people open accounts only with banks, they can do so by tapping a variety of other avenues too.
He pointed out that the proposed guidelines for small finance banks and payments banks will offer such avenues.
“Account need not be only at the bank. In the weeks to come we will put out guidelines for new entities called payment banks, the basic intent of this exercise will be to offer accounts to the excluded,” Rajan added.
We visualise, Rajan said, mobile companies, firms with a large rural presence, and the postal department applying for payment bank licences.
Can take deposits
The RBI Governor also said that with the idea to facilitate small lending — to underserved people, micro, small and even medium enterprises — the RBI will come out with guidelines for small finance banks by the month-end.
Explaining the scope of small finance banks, Rajan said, such banks will be allowed to take deposits.
“This licence will also offer an avenue for successful microfinance institutions to migrate towards a banking licence without abandoning the core business of working with the small and the excluded.
“I am hopeful that we will issue the call for applications for both small finance banks and payments banks,” he added.
The guidelines are currently with the Government for comments.
Cash management
Rajan said the RBI is thinking of ways to modernise the existing cash management system.
The modernised system, he said, will also interact with the last mile usage of cash. He said while serving the bottom of the pyramid, entities must not look at more than reasonable profits.
He made this observation in the context of a few ideas which have propagated that there is “fortune” to be made by servicing those at the bottom of the pyramid.

Smriti Irani reviews regulators for education reformsUber cab suffers as driver accused of rape in Delhi; firm accused of criminal negligence
HRD Minister Smriti Irani today said that key regulators in the higher education sector, like UGC and AICTE, are being reviewed keeping in mind the challenges of the future.
“I am happy to share with you… be it UGC, be it AICTE, or the National Council for Teachers Education… We have undertaken review of most of our regulatory bodies,” Irani said.
She said that the review was essential to bring about a holistic change in the functioning of the institutions of learning and to take the education agenda ahead in the country.
Addressing the FICCI Higher Education Summit here, Irani said that as the Human Resource Development (HRD) Minister, she wants to “redefine India’s destiny” through reforms in the education sector.
Her comments came against the backdrop of her ministry setting up separate committees to review the functioning of UGC, AICTE and NCTE.
“There are many who see education in India as a challenge. I look upon it as an opportunity to redefine India’s destiny. There have been many comments… many people expressing their anguish about the need for reform.
“I am happy to share with you that in just the last six months, the government has put forth many initiatives to see how reform can be brought into the functioning of regulators,” she said in the presence of the dignitaries at the event, among whom were South Carolina Governor Nikki
Haley and UK Minister of State for Universities, Greg Clark.
The HRD Ministry has already set up a panel to restructure UGC, thus putting in motion an initiative for carrying out an overhaul of the higher education sector.
The AICTE restructuring committee will also look into the revamping of its grant distribution function to ensure timely utilisation of funds and measures for enhancing quality research in technical education.
Irani also said that the government will next year roll out the ‘Rashtriya Avishkar Abhiyan’ with a view to arresting the falling trend of learning outcomes in mathematics and science for students between Stds VI-VII and upgrade the skills of teachers in line with the needs of modern society.

Highly anticipated chip card technology won't be in most stores for the holiday shopping season.

After a spate of data breaches in the past year heightened consumers' fear of personal information being stolen and led retailers to beef up security, shoppers may not be that much safer this holiday season.
Highly anticipated chip card technology that helps make in-store transactions nearly impossible to counterfeit still isn't in most stores and won't be widely available until next year. Breaches in the past year including at Target, Kmart, Home Depot, and Walgreens led to a heightened level of security from retailers and banks when it comes to handling customer data. Though fraudsters haven't slowed down: the United States Postal Service disclosed Monday that its computers were hacked and that employee and customer data were compromised.
Post office breach: The new Cold War?
In the wake of breaches, companies pledged to speed up issuance of chip cards and adopting the readers required to process the transactions. But Walmart is the only major retailer currently accepting chip cards in stores. The cards include a microchip that creates single-use codes for every transaction instead of relying on the card number, making the data useless if it's stolen.
• Target, whose breach affected 40 million cards and up to an additional 70 million customer accounts, now has chip card terminals in all stores. But they won't be upgraded to the software that allows them to accept chip card transactions until next year. Target-branded credit and debit cards will be reissued as EMV cards in 2015. EMV stands for Europay, MasterCard, and Visa, the three companies that developed a proprietary chip card and set certain standards for the card.
• Home Depot discovered a breach in September that compromised 56 million cards and 53 million email addresses. Stores have chip card terminals but won't have the necessary software to accept chip cards until next year.
Banks are still primarily only issuing chip cards to customers whose card was lost, stolen, or expired, says Doug Johnson, senior vice president of risk management policy at American Bankers Association. Out of the 1.2 billion credit and debit cards issued in the U.S., about 100 million are expected to be EMV by the end of 2014, says Carolyn Balfany, senior vice president of product delivery and EMV at MasterCard.
But there's still a question of whether consumers care all that much about card security. While data show shoppers worry about their information being stolen, that fear may not affect purchasing decisions. A National Retail Federation holiday shopping survey of 7,500 people found that nearly 42% feel neutral when it comes to whether data breaches will affect how they shop. Less than 20% said breaches were "somewhat" or "very likely" to influence how they shop.
Greg Derderian, a pharmacist in Sellersville, Penn., continues to shop at Home Depot despite the fact that his card information may have been stolen during the recent breach. He says his bank quickly issued him a new card. The 36 year-old has had his credit card information compromised multiple times in recent years.
"It's not fun but in today's age I think it's almost turning into a norm now," he says. "Everybody's getting something stolen. It's not stopping me from going and shopping."
Consumers are ambivalent when it comes to whether data breaches will affect how they shop for the holidays, according to a National Retail Federation survey.

In the meantime, security experts stress that there are other ways of mitigating fraud besides relying on EMV technology, and that EMV shouldn't be viewed as a sweeping solution.
Rob Sadowski, director of technology solutions at information security firm RSA, says he's seen an increased investment on retailers' part in security over the past year, such as on transaction monitoring and stronger authentication technology that relies on more than a username and password for a customer to make a purchase.
Home Depot was already in the process of increasing security when its breach was discovered, says spokesperson Stephen Holmes. Though it sped up the rollout of an enhanced encryption technique that scrambles card data from the second it's swiped and keeps it encrypted as the data go through the approval process. Other encryption methods rely on encrypting data only as it lives on a retailer's network or hardware, says Mark Bower, vice president of product management at security company Voltage, which helped install Home Depot's enhanced encryption.
Many large merchants are adopting enhanced encryption, says Bower, whose company has "seen a surge of interest...particularly after the Target breach last year."
MasterCard and Visa are starting to use a method called tokenization for mobile and online payments, where chip cards are irrelevant. The process assigns a different account number, or token, to the debit and credit cards in someone's mobile wallet or online shopping account and uses that to process the transaction instead of the original card number.
"It's a layering effect," Balfany says. "Yes, EMV and chip is terrific also. But that doesn't mean we're going to stop any of these other technologies we've got integrated."
Though none of the security measures negate the fact that just as retailers may be more prepared, fraudsters are also looking forward to the busiest shopping period of the year, when more information is ripe for the taking and there's less likelihood of a breach being noticed, Sadowski says. Yet another retailer's system being hacked is likely inevitable.
"I would not be surprised," Bower says, "if we still saw a significant breach over this holiday period for an organization that hasn't taken these steps."

One-day cricket
The stylish batsman delights Eden Gardens with a welter of records
A world record 264 by India’s Rohit Sharma and a mammoth 404 for five in 50 overs was enough for India to plunge Sri Lanka to its fourth straight defeat in the fourth ODI of the Micromax Cup series here on Thursday.
Chasing a massive target at the Eden Gardens, the visiting team finished at 251 in 43.1 overs. Captain Angelo Mathews defied the Indian bowling to score a fine 75 and received support from Lahiru Thirimanne (59) and Tillakaratne Dilshan (34) in the top-order.
Riding on the confidence of scoring 142 in the tour opener for India ‘A’ at Mumbai, Rohit conjured up a brilliant double hundred — his second in ODIs. Rohit was slow to begin with. He took off in the company of skipper Virat Kohli and the two put the Lankan bowling to the sword. He fiercely pulled Eranga for a six in the first over of the batting powerplay.
With that, the 100 partnership came up. It was only a matter of time before the 27-year-old reached his century off 100 balls with 12 fours and a six. His 150 came off 125 balls with the aid of 19 boundaries and three sixes. The third-wicket produced 202 runs in 25.5 overs before Kohli (66) ran himself out going for the second run.
The Mumbai player, who scored 209 against Australia at Bengaluru last year, raced to 200 in 151 balls with 25 hits to the fence and five over it to emerge the first man to hit two double centuries in ODIs. This was the fourth double century in total, all scored by Indians.
Rohit made Lanka pay heavily for three dropped chances (on four, 201 and 222). He first went past his previous best of 209 and then Virender Sehwag’s 219. He reached 250 in 166 balls (32x4, 8x6).
He thoroughly dominated the fifth-wicket association with Robin Uthappa that produced 128 runs in less than 10 overs. He fell off the last ball of the innings, slamming Kulasekara straight to Mahela Jayawardene at long off after a monumental 264 (173b, 33x4, 9x6).
“I knew it was a good batting wicket, where 300 or 350 would be easily chaseable. Once I reached 50, I concentrated on turning my 100 to 150, then 150 to 200, and then 250,” Rohit explained.
He praised the crowd saying, “I made my Ranji and Test debuts here, got a 100 in the IPL and now this. The crowd here has been brilliant; they love the game.”
More records
Two more records fell. The team’s total of 404 surpassed the Eden Gardens’ record of 317. The previous highest individual record of 150 by Gautam Gambhir also went overboard. On this occasion, the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) announced a reward of Rs. 2,64,000 to Rohit for the stupendous effort.
Internet Desk adds
The comeback man Rohit Sharma became the first batsman to score two double centuries during the fourth ODI against Sri Lanka at Eden Gardens, Kolkata on Thursday.
In the 46th over of the innings, Rohit hit a four off Kulasekara to reach his double century.
Rohit Sharma was batting on 222, the highest score in ODIs, eclipsing Sehwag's 219, off just 155 balls with 27 fours and six huge sixes. His previous double century came at Bengaluru against Australia. India's score is 357 for 4 in 46.3 overs.
At the end of 50 overs, India scored a mammoth 404 for 5. Rohit Sharma was out off the final ball of the innings. Rohit was caught by Jayawardene off the bowling of Kulasekara for 264 off just 173 balls with 33 fours and 9 huge sixes.

Sun Pharma Q2 Profit Rises 15% But Lags EstimatesYou are here: Home Market
Sun Pharma Q2 Profit Up 15%; Cipla Down on Slowing Exports
Reuters | Updated On: November 13, 2014 23:12 (IST)
Buy UltraTech Cement, Sell TCS Today: Sanjeev Bhasin
Mumbai: Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, India's largest drugmaker by revenue, on Thursday posted a 15 per cent rise in quarterly net profit, roughly in line with expectations, helped by strong growth in sales in the domestic market.
Sun Pharma's smaller rival Cipla, however, reported a 16 per cent drop in its quarterly profit, hit by sluggish growth in income from exports, which accounts for more than half of its revenue.
India's $15 billion pharmaceutical industry makes more than half its sales in the United States, where a slowdown in new generic drug approvals is expected to weigh on sales of the local companies for at least couple of quarters.
Cipla's sales from export of finished drugs rose 0.4 per cent in the quarter to end-September from a year ago, while those from exports of drug ingredients fell 34 percent.
Cipla, India's fourth-largest drugmaker by revenue, posted profit of Rs 299 crore ($48.63 million) in the quarter to end-September, while analysts on average expected Rs 351crore, according to Thomson Reuters data.
Sun Pharma reported a profit of Rs 1,572 crore for the same quarter, nearly meeting estimates of Rs 1,588 crore.
Sun Pharma, in the process of acquiring rival drugmaker Ranbaxy Laboratories, said it was working on getting approvals for the deal from India and US antitrust regulators.
There may be "minor delays" in closing the deal if approvals do not come in time, Sun Pharma's Managing Director Dilip Shanghvi said in a post-earnings call with analysts. The company had earlier said it expected to close the deal by December.
Sun Pharma agreed in April to buy Ranbaxy for $3.2 billion, betting it could help Ranbaxy fix quality control issues that led to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) banning its India-based plants.
However, Sun Pharma has itself faced regulatory scrutiny recently. The FDA banned exports to the United States from its Karkhadi plant in western India in March due to its failure to maintain complete test data records and inadequate staff training.
On Thursday, Shanghvi said that during the quarter the FDA also inspected the company's Halol drug manufacturing plant in western India, and made certain "observations", and the company was taking corrective measures to fix the issues.

Study: DOD could save up to $4.4 billion a year by shaking up retirement pay 
(AP/Charles Dharapak)
A new study of how to shrink the high costs of benefits for retired military servicemembers says the Defense Department could save $1.8 billion to $4.4 billion a year partly by boosting benefits earlier in their careers instead of when they retire.
But overall compensation at retirement would go down, a study released Wednesday by the Rand Corporation says.
The study more or less mirrors potential changes the Defense Department has laid out to overhaul military retirement as a panel of nine officials reviews end-of-career packages, health-care and other benefits with the goal of reducing personnel costs.
The current retirement system has changed little in 70 years. Servicemembers vest in a defined-benefit pension only at 20 years of service, which is no longer an ideal for armed forces that are downsizing after the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“The current military system is inefficient because it places too much compensation in the form of deferred payments, despite the fact that the typical service member is young and would prefer to receive higher pay as they serve, rather than a higher annuity once they complete 20 years of service,” the study says. The result is that retirement costs are higher than they need to be for the government.
Rand researchers conclude that the military still needs a traditional pension. But the pension would be smaller, and servicemembers should be able to vest much earlier. The Defense Department should add a so-called defined contribution plan similar to 401K plans in the civilian world, which the military would pay into. Some mid-career servicemembers would get incentives to stay; those who leave before 20 years would be able to get lump-sum separation pay.
The study recommends that any new rules would apply to new servicemembers; those in the current system be grandfathered in so their benefits don’t change in the middle of their careers.
RELATED: Toward Meaningful Military Compensation Reform: Research in Support of DoD’s Review of Military Compensation
The Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission is reviewing retirement packages and other benefits. It’s expected to issue a report to Defense officials in February. James Graybeal, the commission spokesman, declined comment on the Rand study.
Congress would approve any changes to military benefits, which have proven to be sacred cows politically even as the Pentagon faces spiraling personnel costs. In a budget agreement last year, lawmakers authorized a reduction in cost-of-living raises for military retirees younger than 62 who go onto civilian jobs, only to repeal the change after veterans groups protested.
 

Hindalco s Q2 profit down 78 per cent on one-time provisionsUpdated: November 14, 2014 19:04 IST
Higher provisioning hits Hindalco’s Q2 profit
Our Bureau
business (general)
Hindalco, the flagship company of the Aditya Birla group, reported a drop of 78 per cent in its net profit for the second quarter of 2014-15 at Rs.79 crore owing to one-time provisions for additional levy relating to the allocation of coal mines.
In September 2014, the Supreme Court had declared all allocations of the coal blocks made since 1993 as illegal and had quashed the allocation of 204 coal blocks. A statement from Hindalco said these coal blocks include Talabira-I block held and operated by the company and three other coal blocks namely Mahan, Tubed and Talabira II & III allocated to the company jointly with others. These were being developed by respective joint venture companies established for that purpose.
According to a company statement, the exceptional items include liability provision of Rs.563 crore towards additional levy of Rs.295 per tonne of coal extracted by Hindalco from the commencement of the production of coal from Talabira I mine in 2013-14 up to September 2014 in compliance with the Supreme Court order and a provision of Rs.258 crore towards diminution in carrying value of investment in Aditya Birla Minerals, Australia, a subsidiary of the company, on significant decline in value of the company’s investment therein as reflected in decline in its quoted share price over a considerable period of time.
However, the company’s net sales rose 36 per cent to Rs.8,554 crore, which the company attributed to higher volume and realisations. The operating profit too was up 37 per cent at Rs.1,120 crore, ‘despite a sharp surge in the cost of coal’, the company statement said.
Indian Oil
Indian Oil Corporation reported a net loss of Rs.898.46 crore in the second quarter ended September 30, 2014, against a net profit of Rs. 1,683.92 crore in the same period in the previous year. The loss was due to a drop in international oil rates which led to massive inventory loss of Rs. 4,272 crore in the second quarter as compared to an inventory gain of Rs.4,635 crore,” according to B. Ashok, Chairman, IOC said. This was because global oil prices slumped from $111 per barrel to $95. IOC lost $1.95 on converting every barrel of crude oil into fuel as compared to a positive margin of $7.43 per barrel, he said.
Sales were up 4.5 per cent to 17.126 million tonne while pipeline throughput rose 5.9 per cent to 19.039 million tonne.
BPCL
Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) has reported a 50 per cent drop in net profit at Rs. 464.20 crore in the second quarter ended September 30, 2014, as refining margin dipped on slumping international oil prices. The net profit was Rs. 931.13 crore in the same period in the previous year. The turnover was marginally higher at Rs.62,025.16 crore in the second quarter as compared to Rs.61,784.51 crore in the year-ago period. Sales rose to 17.13 million tonne when compared to 16.38 million tonne.
Sun Pharma
Sun Pharma said its consolidated net profit rose by 15 per cent to Rs.1,572 crore for the second quarter ended September 30, 2014, against Rs.1,362 crore during the same period in the previous year.. Net sales increased by 13 per cent to Rs.4,751 crore. “Our Q2 performance was strong and continued to achieve high level of profitable growth, in-line with our expectations,” Sun Pharma Managing Director Dilip Shanghvi said. In a separate filing, the company said its board has approved merger of Sun Pharma Global Inc, a wholly owned foreign subsidiary of the company, with itself, from January 1, 2015.
Orchid Chemicals
Orchid Chemicals & Pharmaceuticals has posted a turnover of Rs.175 crore during the second quarter ended September 30, 2014 against Rs.380.47 crore registered during the corresponding period last year.
The company posted a net profit of Rs.272 crore compared to loss of Rs.200.34 crore for the year-ago period.
According to a release, during the second quarter, Orchid implemented the Business Transfer Agreement (BTA) with Hospira Healthcare India Private Ltd., for the sale and transfer of its Penicillin, Penem API business, API facility in Aurangabad and the corresponding R&D infrastructure in Chennai. Extra ordinary items – gain (net of tax of Rs.93.41 crore) represented profit on sale of the undertaking.
Orchid Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals Managing Director K. Raghavendra Rao, said: “With the implementation of the approved Corporate Debt Restructuring package and the completion of business transfer to Hospira, the operations are getting streamlined with the infusion of working capital into the system. We are confident of the rebuilding process and hope to generate value to the stakeholders in the ensuing quarters.”
The company also extended its current financial and accounting year by six months to March 31, 2015.
Capital First
Capital First has reported a sharp rise in its net profit at Rs. 27.05 crore in the quarter ended September 30, 2014, against Rs. 7.16 crore in the same period in the previous year. The growth in income was primarily driven by higher NII and fee income, which together grew 51 per cent to 154.84 crore from Rs. 102.40 crore in the year-ago period. The company’s assets under management grew 34 per cent to Rs.11,047 crore as on September 30, 2014, up from Rs.8,244 crore as on September 30, 2013.

petrol
After six consecutive cuts in petrol prices and two in diesel, the government on Thursday hiked the excise duty on petrol and diesel by Rs.1.50 per litre each.
But, the hike is not expected to burden consumers as oil companies plan to adjust the excise hike with a reduction in retail rates that was due this weekend.
“As of now oil companies will be absorbing the hikes...we won’t be passing these on to the consumers,” Indian Oil Corporation spokesperson Siddharth Mukherjee told The Hindu.
The government hiked the excise duty on unbranded petrol from Rs.1.20 per litre to Rs.2.70 per litre, while that on unbranded diesel was hiked from Rs.1.46 a litre to Rs.2.96.

No let up in appetite for gold, demand surges 39 % in Q3

gold and precious material
In contrast to global demand for gold which declined by 2 per cent in the third quarter of calendar 2014, India’s appetite for the yellow metal surged 39 per cent during the same period in volume terms to 225.1 tonnes.
Although this was on a low base last year, when the government restrictions on gold were introduced, gold jewellery demand surged 60 per cent to 182.9 tonnes, according to figures released by World Gold Council (WGC). However, investment demand in India over the same period declined 10 per cent to 42.2 tonnes. There was a marked decline in gold recycled during the period at 18.2 tonnes (53 tonnes).
In value terms, India’s demand for gold rose 31 per cent at Rs 56,219.3 crore with jewellery demand up 51 per cent at Rs 45,681.6 crore and investment demand down 16 per cent at 10,547.7 crore.
"The figures indicate the intrinsic demand for gold in India," Somasundaram P.R., MD, India WGC told this correspondent. "While the low base of Q3 2013 was due to the duty increases and restrictions on import of gold, the demand for gold around Diwali reflects the general optimism in India around the economy." He said part of higher jewellery demand was the preference over gold coins and bars.
In the nine month period (January-September 2014), India’s gold demand declined 23 per cent to Rs 155,636.6 crore in value while volumes were down 18 per cent to 619.5 tonnes. Mr. Somasundaram said that gold demand for the full year 2014 was likely to be 850-950 tonnes. "Unless there are any significant changes in the macro economy, there are no factors to drive demand significantly up or down. As regards restrictions, there should be a vision instead of regulatory arbitrage and we must have structurally enabling measures."
Globally, gold demand declined 2 per cent to 929 tonnes during the quarter. Central banks were net buyers of gold for the 15th consecutive quarter, buying 93 tonnes (101 tonnes) during Q3FY14. The Swiss government is to hold a referendum in end-November to mandate the holding of 20 per cent of their reserves in gold as against 8 per cent levels. If passed, Switzerland would need to buy around 1500 tonnes of gold over five years for a stronger gold-backed currency. "The holding of a referendum is in itself an affirmation of the increasing importance of gold globally," Mr. Somasundaram said.

Anand cannot afford to be defensive

TOPICS
A third of the world chess championship is over.
Looking at the 2-2 score, there is nothing to choose between Magnus Carlsen and Viswanathan Anand.
Going beyond the score, Carlsen is upset with the quality of his play in the last two games and conversely, he notices how upbeat Anand is with the comeback win in Game 3. Further, Carlsen has not missed Anand’s preparedness to proceed in an equal position, as seen in Game 4.
The confidence of having won with white in Game 3 will work to Anand’s advantage. He has no reason to switch from the queen-pawn opening. The key will again be getting a dynamic, double-edged position with several tactical possibilities as the game goes deep into the middle-game.
Carlsen, yet to get over the fact that he was caught in Anand’s preparation leading to a frustrating loss in Game 3, can be expected to meet fire with fire.
Playing black in Game 1, Carlsen chose the Grunfeld Defence but could not prevent Anand from emerging better out of the opening.
In Game 3, Carlsen responded with Queen’s Gambit Declined and Anand readily tightened the screws and levelled the match-score.
To Team Anand’s credit, it has made Carlsen search for suitable responses to the queen-pawn opening. Anand does hold the option of surprising Carlsen by going back to his favourite king-pawn opening but given the current status of the match, there is no need for it.
If Carlsen is seen to be a little defensive in Game 5 and plays for a draw, the approach should not surprise anyone. After all, a draw with black will be some solace for his defeat with black in Game 3.
In addition, the prospect of playing white in Game 6 and Game 7, should justify Carlsen’s conservative strategy on Friday. However, Anand cannot afford to give Carlsen any reason to be confident.
As Carlsen admitted after Game 4 that he was not playing well by his standard, it was an indication that he could well be vulnerable in his desperate search for form.
So far, in the 14 world championship games involving Carlsen, the only time Anand managed to bring the youngster under pressure was on Tuesday and the result was there for the world to see.
Carlsen is known to bounce back from defeats. In fact, he has a tremendous record of hitting back strongly in the second half of the contests.
In Chennai, Anand never brought Carlsen under serious pressure and regretted it for a long time. A second chance is what Anand had hoped for and succeeded in creating.
So far, Anand has managed to worry the Norwegian. Another defeat, which is a distinct possibility, can shake Carlsen’s plans like never before.
However, Anand should guard against his tendency to be defensive in an equal position.
This could seriously backfire against a player of Carlsen’s calibre, though Anand got away with it on Thursday.
In general, a draw is not a bad result, but each time Anand is made to fight long for a draw, his diminishing stamina could well become a factor in the battles ahead.

John Cook leaves The Intercept  returns to Gawker MediaJohn Cook, editor-in-chief of The Intercept , the digital magazine of Pierre Omidyar’s First Look Media, is leaving his post and returning to Gawker Media, according to tweets from Vanity Fair contributing editor Sarah Ellison.
Confirmed. @johnjcook leaving @intercept to return to @Gawker . Please DM or email me any news or tips.
— Sarah Ellison (@Sarahlellison) November 13, 2014
That was quick. Cook in March announced he’d be joining First Look Media as editor-in-chief of The Intercept, the national security/privacy-oriented publication whose reportorial anchor is Glenn Greenwald of the Snowden disclosures. Though Cook is returning to Nick Denton’s Gawker Media empire, he’s not going back to the same job he left, as Gawker.com’s top editor. Instead, he’ll guide investigations across Gawker Media Group’s network of sites — for example, working with J.K. Trotter at Gawker, Jason Schreier at Kotaku and Anna Merlan at Jezebel, according to sources at Gawker Media.
Cook’s move back to Gawker Media is a surprise only to those who never read a recent story bylined by him and others at The Intercept . Titled “THE INSIDE STORY OF MATT TAIBBI’S DEPARTURE FROM FIRST LOOK MEDIA,” the story provided a critical look at the dysfunction at First Look Media, an enterprise bankrolled by eBay founder Omidyar in the amount of $250 million. Taibbi, a much-admired writer for Rolling Stone magazine, left First Look after all manner of disputes over his management style and the direction of The Racket, another First Look digital title. Cook & Co. wrote:
Those conflicts were rooted in a larger and more fundamental culture clash that has plagued the project from the start: A collision between the First Look executives, who by and large come from a highly structured Silicon Valley corporate environment, and the fiercely independent journalists who view corporate cultures and management-speak with disdain. That divide is a regular feature in many newsrooms, but it was exacerbated by First Look’s avowed strategy of hiring exactly those journalists who had cultivated reputations as anti-authoritarian iconoclasts.
That’s a candid self-assessment. From the start, First Look Media’s hires have spoken wistfully about a new style of newsroom organization, a horizontal one in which decisions would be made by consensus. First Looker Jeremy Scahill captured the idea in a 2013 interview : “We’re not just trying to fill positions with people. We’re trying to bring people on board based on [a] proven track record of great journalism and trying to create a space for them where they can do that journalism without being hindered by bureaucratic institutions or processes.”
Asked about the free-flowing management culture at First Look, Cook in March told the Erik Wemple Blog , “Obviously Laura [Poitras] and Glenn and Jeremy’s names are on it and they’re the founders and they have a sort of sweat and name equity invested in it and they hired me because I’m simpatico with where they’re coming from and will work consultatively with them, but I’m the editor in chief.”
A confederacy of equal and obstinate journalists at First Look predictably produced gridlock and infighting. What was supposed to be a family of wide-ranging digital titles remains just The Intercept. Still, Cook & Co. in their analysis of the Taibbi departure signaled that they’d worked through the kinks: “The Intercept, through months of disagreements and negotiations with First Look over the summer, was able to resolve most of these conflicts; as a result, it now has a sizable budget, operational autonomy, and a team of talented journalists, editors, research specialists, and technologists working collaboratively and freely in the manner its founders always envisioned,” wrote Cook et alia.
Now they’ll do all that without Cook, who is a towering editorial talent. “I think that he’s the best at what does,” says Tom Scocca, features editor at Gawker. “I don’t know of anyone else who is as tenacious an investigator while also having such a high-quality governor.”
In chronicling the departure of Taibbi, The Intercept may have established a difficult precedent for itself. Does it now proceed to do likewise with Cook? Or leave this one to the people with the Stanford University Hasso Plattner Institute of Design who are studying management practices at First Look ?

Coaches to tinker with D-lineBy Mike Jones November 13 Follow @mikejoneswapo
Nose tackle Chris Baker, left, sacks Tennessee quarterback Charlie Whitehurst. (John McDonnell/The Washington Post)
Barry Cofield this week is making his comeback from the short-term injured reserve list, but Chris Baker will remain
the starting nose tackle for now, and instead, Cofield will take on a different role.
Coach Jay Gruden said on Wednesday afternoon that defensive coordinator Jim Haslett and defensive line coach Jacob Burney are currently tinkering with the line, and that they don’t feel inclined to move Baker from nose tackle, where he has started the past eight games. Cofield has taken snaps at left end behind Jarvis Jenkins in recent practices and will likely toggle back and forth between end and nose depending on situations.
“He’ll just be in a rotation with [Baker] and [Jenkins] and all those guys up front,” Gruden said. “So it’s just a matter of finding out his niche and getting him in there slowly but surely and making sure we don’t overdo it. Obviously he’s a very solid nose guard, but [Baker] has done a great job in his place. Both of them can be very beneficial to us.”
Baker ended the 2013 season at right end when Stephen Bowen suffered a season-ending knee surgery. But during the offseason program and in training camp, he beat out Jenkins for the left end position, and free-agent acquisition Jason Hatcher took over at right end. Baker slid over from left end to nose tackle when Cofield left the season opener with a groin injury and high ankle sprain. Jenkins, meanwhile, moved into the starting left end spot.
Washington’s defensive line depth has increased significantly in the past few weeks. First, Bowen returned from the regular-season PUP list, and has played behind Hatcher. Now Cofield joins the mix. He, Bowen, Kedric Golston and Frank Kearse will vie for spots in the rotation.
Cofield, who said he looks forward to the newfound flexibility and the opportunities it presents, will also likely see time as a tackle in Washington’s nickel packages, which feature more of a 4-3 alignment. Cofield spent the first five seasons of his career as a 4-3 tackle with the New York Giants before moving to nose tackle after signing with Washington in 2011.
The versatility and boost in depth should help a defensive line that has done well against the run, but has struggled to generate an impact against the pass.
“The coaches will rotate us out as needed. If he needs to play end or needs to play nose, the coaches make that decision,” Baker said, speaking on Cofield’s return. “It helps a lot because the defensive coordinator can plug in anybody, and don’t have to worry about what kind of call you have to make. you know the player you have in there can make any play, so to have players that can play multiple positions always helps.”

Blackmoney: Dabur s Burman gets bail  barred from leaving IndiaFIPB role shrinks amid easier FDI flows
Pradip Burman, one of the Dabur India promoters, whose name has figured in the list given by the Centre to the Supreme Court in the blackmoney issue, has been granted bail but barred from leaving the country by a Delhi court in an alleged tax evasion case.
Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Devender Kumar Sharma granted the relief to Burman, who appeared before him, but directed that he will not leave the country without its prior permission after the Income Tax (IT) department argued that there was a likelihood that accused may leave the country to avoid his prosecution in the case.
“Having heard the submission on behalf of the parties, the present case being a complaint case, accused Pradip Burman is admitted to bail subject to furnishing of personal bond in a sum of Rs 25,000 and a surety of like amount.
“Further the accused is hereby directed not to leave the country without prior intimation and prior permission from this court during the pending trial,” the court said.
According to IT department’s complaint, Burman was holding foreign bank accounts but he did not disclose about it in his income tax returns and there were undisclosed deposits in those two accounts.
Advocate Brijesh Garg, appearing for IT department, said when Burman was questioned, he denied having any account in foreign bank but later on, when he was confronted with several documents, he admitted having bank accounts abroad.
A case was registered against Burman under the Income Tax Act for the offences relating to concealment of income and tax evasion.
The court, after taking cognisance of the complaint by the IT department, had summoned Burman as accused in the case.
Burman appeared in the court in pursuance to summons issued against him and he was supplied with the copy of the complaint and other documents.
The court has now fixed the matter for December 3 for pre­charge evidence and all the witnesses have been summoned for that day.
Seeking bail, Burman’s counsel submitted that it was a complaint case and his client was ready to abide by any terms and conditions imposed by the court.
IT department’s counsel Garg submitted that the complaint was filed against Burman for evasion of tax and for furnishing false information/verification.
“The present case is out of several cases in respect to black money for which investigation is going on by the and under the supervision of Special Investigation Team (SIT) constituted by the Supreme Court of India,” Garg said.
He said the court should impose condition upon him not to go outside the country as there was every likelihood that he may leave the country to avoid his prosecution.
The Centre on October 27 has disclosed before the apex court eight more names including that of Burman, a bullion trader and Goa miners against whom it has started prosecution for allegedly stashing black money in foreign banks.
Rajkot-based bullion trader Pankaj Chimanlal Lodhya and Goa-based mining company Timblo Private Limited and its five directors were among the names that figured in the list which was filed in the Supreme Court by the government.
While Burman’s name was received from French authorities, the names of Lodhia and others have been received from “other countries”.
Shortly after the disclosure in the Supreme Court, Dabur India promoter family, Burmans had said the account complied with all legal requirements.
“We wish to state that this account was opened when he (Pradip) was an NRI, and was legally allowed to open this account,” a Dabur spokesperson had said in a statement.

Magnus Carlsen still favourite to beat Vishwanathan Anand  claim expertsPrint

Playing in the new role of a challenger, five times world champion Viswanathan Anand is sitting pretty ahead of the fifth game of the World Chess Championship against Magnus Carlsen.
With one victory, one loss and two draws, the match is currently tied 2-2, but a big trend seem to be favouring Anand compared to the last match at Chennai, which the Indian had lost badly last year.
At Chennai, too, the scores were tied after four games but the big difference was that Carlsen had started to trouble
Anand and the discomfiture for the Indian was evident as he lost game five and six, which effectively sealed the match in Carlsen favour.
This time around, it’s almost the opposite. It was a tentative start for Anand in the first game, in which he got the complexities on the board but misplayed and suffered a bit before drawing the game.
In the second game things turned for the worst for Anand, as yet again Carlsen established a position to his liking and outplayed him in all departments of the game to go one up in the match.
As per the match schedule there is a rest day after every two games and that break changed things completely for Anand.
Contrary to popular belief, the Indian bounced back in style, showcasing deep preparation and caught Carlsen in a long analysed variation after which there was no reprieve for the Norwegian.
The scores were then levelled and in the fourth game Carlsen, despite getting that nagging advantage he is famous for, could do very little, even as Anand matched him move for move to force a draw.
Now in the fifth game scheduled for tomorrow, Anand will again play with white pieces and is likely to push for victory yet again.
Carlsen, meanwhile, looked a bit demoralised at the fourth game press conference, even though he put up a brave front.
With just eight games to go, the pundits are not ruling out a tied result and a subsequent tiebreaker, which will happen if the scores are level after 12 games in this million Euros match.
While Anand will definitely try to catch Carlsen in another preparation, the Norwegian will definitely try to avoid it.
The success for Anand will mostly depend on a successful opening by him.
At the moment, the trend might be in favour of the Indian but Carlsen still stays the favourite to retain the crown, according to many regarded players.

“Today is the kind of day I can tell my kids I was there (and watched Rohit bat). I don’t think this record is getting broken anytime soon.”
Rohit shared a 202-run stand with Kohli on way to his mammoth knock.
“I was glad I was batting with him. There was a time when Rohit will admit runs were not coming easily, and I just asked him to take his time. Once he gets to 70-80, he is almost unstoppable,” said Kohli.
India lead 4-0 in the series, having hardly being troubled by the opposition.
Asked he felt captaining the side in the absence of MS Dhoni, Kohli said: “I am quite happy as of now as captain. I have had more wins than losses, but your character is tested only in bad times. That time will come sooner than later.”
Kohli has no plans to take it easy in the fifth and final ODI in Ranchi.
“No we don’t want to let up. That’s what we are looking to develop as a team culture. We will continue to be ruthless,” he added.
Kohli’s counterpart Angelo Mathews said it is embarrassing that his team is not able to compete against India.
“It is embarrassing that we are not even competing,” said Mathews.
“We lost our way in the last 20 overs. It is not acceptable. Our bowlers didn’t have any answers for them. To score 290 in the last 25 is unbelievable. Nothing can be taken away from Rohit, though. Our fielding was terrible again. We need to fix our problems. We need to get everything – batting, bowling and fielding – right,” he said.

At the Express Adda on Friday: Kejriwal  second bidPrint

He is the one man who can stand in the way of the BJP wresting total control over the corridors of power in Delhi. His Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) grew from a national movement to a formidable political party, and then a government in little over a year. And now, as Delhi goes to polls again, former Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal will be a guest at the Express Adda in Mumbai on Friday.
The Express Adda is a series of interactions with people at the centre of change. It has earlier featured actor Shah Rukh Khan, world chess champion Vishwanathan Anand, Financial Times commentator Martin Woolf, and most recently Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, among others.
At a little over 46, Kejriwal is younger than most of his political contemporaries, but his story is perhaps unique. He was first  an officer in the Indian Revenue Service, before giving up his job and turning into an anti-corruption crusader. A Magsaysay awardee, Kejriwal shot to national prominence when he was part of the India Against Corruption movement that shook the country for 13 days in August 2012, as Anna Hazare fasted at Ramlila Maidan for the Jan Lokpal Bill. He later split from Hazare and formed the AAP, which caught popular imagination. Riding on an anti-corruption wave, the AAP won 28 seats in the Delhi assembly in December 2013.
For 49 days, in a tenuous arrangement with the Congress that drew flak from several quarters, Kejriwal was Chief Minister of Delhi. Those days too were far from ordinary. He told citizens of Delhi to sting police officers and government officials, brought a controversial power and water subsidy, and even slept in the middle of the road on a winter night to protest against the central government. As eventful as the sojourn was, it was shortlived, a disagreement with the Congress on the passage of the Lokpal Bill becoming the breaking point.
A year later, Kejriwal faces another election, but the challenges have mounted. He faces a buoyant BJP, fresh from its success in Haryana and Maharashtra, and with the Narendra Modi government at the Centre. In Delhi itself, the AAP has faced the ire of its supporters for having quit the government. And there are questions for Kejriwal from within as well, with some alleging a lack of democracy in the party.

A day before Childrens Day  Odisha boy loses arm working in maize factoryPrint

A day before the nation celebrates Children’s Day, a 12-year-old boy in Nabrangpur district lost his left arm while working in a maize processing factory.
Debi Singh Gouda, a Std VI student of Pujariguda upper primary school in Kasagumuda block of Nabarangpur, had skipped school to work at a maize processing mill in his village Nandpani for a wage of Rs 50. A day before Children’s Day, Orissa boy loses left arm while working in maize factory.
While deseeding corn, the boy’s left hand was sucked inside the machine leaving him seriously injured. He was first rushed to the district headquarters hospital at Nabarangpur and then shifted to the district headquarters hospital at Koraput. Though doctors could save his life, they had to amputate his arm. “It was too mutilated. We had no other option. But he is out of danger now,” said a doctor in Koraput.
Labour minister Prafulla Mallick said a three-member team, headed by sub-collector Parikshit Sethi, has been asked to file a report on the incident. The team on Thursday visited the school and held discussions with the boy’s family members. The district administration also lodged an FIR against the mill owner Lalan Mehta. Mallick assured that strict action would be taken against the guilty.
The district administration gave an ex-gratia of Rs 10,000 from the district Red Cross fund and Rs 5,000 from the chief minister’s relief fund to the family members of the boy.
Officials in Nabrangpur said the boy lost his father while he was a toddler. He has an elder brother and a mother. His brother and mother work as coolies, while Gouda often worked at the maize processing mill to supplement his family income.
Former Nabarangpur Congress MP Pradip Majhi demanded that the government should bear all the expenses for treatment of the boy and
immediately release Rs 5 lakh as assistance to the child’s family. He also demanded inclusion of the boy’s family under the various welfare schemes of the government and allot them a house.
In June this year, a 16-year-old boy’s right hand had to be amputated when it came in contact with a live electric wire while working as a labourer in Pradhan Mantri Grama Sadak Yojana. Yakub of MV-31 village under Kurukunda block of Malkangri district was working under a contractor in Pradhan Mantri Grama Sadak Yojana when a six-feet long aluminium rod that he was holding came in contact with the live electric wire. Yakub was first admitted to a private hospital in Vishakhpatnam by the contractor. The boy who studied in a school, worked in the road construction project during summer vacation to buy a pair of uniform.

Indian Super League: FC Goa hand Delhi Dynamos 4-1 thrashingPrint

FC Goa got their act together after a couple of winless outings as they handed Delhi Dynamos an embarrassing 4-1 defeat, riding on Youness Bengelloun’s twin strikes in an Indian Super League encounter on Thursday.
The victory couldn’t have come at a better time as it kept them in the reckoning for a semi-final berth in the cash-rich league.
Bengelloun scored in the 18th and 48th minute while captain Robert Pires and Australian striker Tolgay Ozbey scored one apiece, in the 53rd and 60 minute respectively.
Gustavo Santos pulled one back for the hosts, when he converted from the spot in the 73rd minute, but that was just a consolation goal as was evident from the faces of the disappointed Delhi fans and players.
The victory, a very important one for FC Goa, finally put an end to the visiting side’s search for three points, their second in the tournament, while extending Dynamos’ winless run.
The Dynamos have now slipped to the bottom following four draws, three losses and a solitary win, while Goa improved a rung to move upto seventh spot with four defeats, two draws and as many wins in the eight-team franchise-based tournament.
The Goa outfit went ahead when Frenchman Bengelloun found the net almost halfway into the first half.
The second goal came as Andre Santos delivered a cross for Bengelloun, which the former Paris Saint Germain ‘B’ team defended gleefully headed home.
The visitors slammed the door on chances of a Dynamos comeback when Pires converted from the spot after Tolgay Ozbey, who was through with ball, was felled by Delhi’s giant shotstopper Kristof Van Hout.
Tolgay completed the rout in the 60th minute, dribbling past a series of Dynamos defenders before successfully finding the back of the net at the JLN Stadium, which witnessed a paltry turnout.
The about 6000-odd turnout was the worst in the tournament, which is otherwise creating new scales in in-stadia audience, when compared to other to leagues in Asia.
Bengelloun first scored off a rebound after Gregory Arnolin’s header was kept out by the tall Dynamos goalkeeper Kristof Van Hout. The initial move began with a Andre Santos corner that landed on the feet of Robert Pires, who gave it to Bikramjeet Singh to make the final cross from the right.
The Dynamos had an outside chance to equalise a few minutes later but Robert Lalthlamuana’s volley off a cross from the right narrowly misses the right side of the post.
Lalthlamuana’s approach before taking the shot though seemed a bit casual.
Besides, there was also a cross from the right by Steven Dias but Morten Skoubo could not reach the ball in time.
The Dynamos were certainly not lacking as far as build-up was concerned but, as has been their wont in the inaugural edition of the franchise-based league so far, could not make it count upfront.
A lot like in their continued…

Warren Buffett s Berkshire Hathaway to buy Procter & Gamble s DuracellWarren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway to buy Procter & Gamble's Duracell

(P&G, whose brands include…)
Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc said it would buy Procter & Gamble Co's Duracell battery business in exchange for its $4.7 billion stake in the world's No. 1 household products maker.
P&G, in the midst of selling about half of its slow-growing brands, said it would pump in about $1.8 billion in cash into Duracell before the transaction.
"It is a good thing that P&G is moving swiftly to divest its non-core brands," Sanford Bernstein analyst Ali Dibadj said. "However, I don't take it as a good sign that Buffett would rather own Duracell than P&G."
Shares of P&G, which also reiterated its full-year 2015 organic sales and core earnings forecasts, fell about 1 per cent in early trading.
"I have always been impressed by Duracell, as a consumer and as a long-term investor in P&G and Gillette ," Berkshire Hathaway Chief Executive Buffett said in a statement.
"This is our kind of business... Not very exciting but a good, solid business," Buffett told FOX Business Network.
Buffett became a P&G shareholder in 2005 when the company, bought Gillette, Duracell's owner at the time. Buffett was Gillette's largest shareholder, owning its shares for over a decade, and once sat on its board.
P&G, whose brands include Pampers diapers and Tide detergent, said on Thursday the deal would be tax efficient for the company and maximizes Duracell's after-tax value.
The company said in August it would focus on faster-growing businesses by selling slow-growing brands. P&G said last month it wanted to split off Duracell.
Demand for Duracell's mainstay non-rechargeable alkaline batteries has waned as electronic devices has increased demand for re-chargeable batteries.
Berkshire owned about 52.8 million P&G shares as of June 30, or a stake of about 1.9 per cent worth $4.7 billion as of P&G's Wednesday close.
P&G said it would take a non-cash charge of about 28 cents per share in the current-quarter and expects to close the deal in the second half of next year.
Goldman Sachs & Co is P&G's financial adviser and Jones Day acted is its legal adviser.

MUMBAI: Private sector lender ICICI Bank today raised 600 million yuans from the Chinese debt market (Dim Sum bonds) or a little over $ 95 million, at a coupon of 4 per cent, merchant banking sources said here this evening.
This is the fourth time that the city-based lender has tapped the Dim sum bond market and has so far raised 2,050 million yuans.
According to merchant bankers, the three-year money has been raised by ICICI's Bahrain branch and will be listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange . The issue is part of the bank's $ 7.5 billion medium term note programme.
Dim sum bonds are denominated in the Chinese currency and are issued in the Hong Kong market, and therefore resident Chinese investors cannot subscribe to these instruments.
When contacted an ICICI bank spokesman refused to comment.
It can be noted that the Chanda Kochhar-led bank first tapped the Chinese debt market in 2012 and raised 1,000 million yuans in two tranches. The bank again went to this market last year last year and raised 650 million yuans.
The current issuance was arranged by StanChart and Mitsubishi UFG.
Meanwhile, the international rating agency Moody's in a note from Singapore, said it has assigned Baa2 to these senior unsecured notes.
Assigning the Baa2 rating Moody's said the rating is anchored on the bank's Baa3 baseline credit assessment and the high likelihood of systemic support in the event of a crisis.
It further said the Baa2 rating is at the same level as the foreign currency debt ceiling for India. The bank's foreign currency deposit ratings of Baa3/P-3 are constrained by the sovereign ceiling.

Most cyber attacks on India show Chinese IP ...Most cyber attacks on India show Chinese IP address: NTRO

(Government's cyber security…)
NEW DELHI: Cyber attacks have grown nearly five times in the last three years and most of them have been found to be originating from the IP addresses located in China.
"Most of the cyber attacks that we have tracked show IP addresses located in China but we are unable to establish if the attacker is from China. We need international cooperation for handling such crimes," NTRO Director of Cyber Security Operations Alok Vijayant said at Ground Zero Summit.
Government's cyber security arm Computer Emergency Response Team-India (CERT-In) reported 62,189 cyber security incidents in the first five months of the current calendar year.
These attacks have been found to be originating from the cyber space of a number of countries including the US, Europe, Brazil, Turkey, China, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Algeria and the UAE, according to the official report.
The National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO) Director said that foreign countries are investing heavily in cyber espionage to gather crucial data and India needs to seriously consider a strategy to counter this strategy.
"Indian has a dearth of talent. In most of the cases Indians find cyber security loophole quickly with its solution but people may get tempted with high price paid in under ground market. Payment per exploit is as good as 15,000 euros and higher than that," Vijayant said.
Cyber security expert Greg Walton showed his research on an attack mounted on Tibetan government in exile which showed its origin in Chengdu city of China.
"The attacker hacked e-mail id of a senior minister of Tibetan government in exile in Dharamshala and through that id they even attacked India's ministry of external affairs," Walton said.
India has seen increase in cyber attacks from about 13,000 in 2011 to 62,000 till mid-2014. The country has been unable to identify cyber criminals in majority of the case due to absence of international cooperation on the issue.

Democrats just lost big. Today they will reelect every one of their party leaders. HuhBy Chris Cillizza November 13 Follow @thefix

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh)
Nine days ago, Democrats lost (at least) eight of their seats and their majority in the Senate.  On the House side, the party dipped to at their lowest level -- in terms of raw number of seats held -- since World War II. How did the party react to this rejection from the American public? By preparing to re-elect every single one of their top Congressional leaders, of course!
If this makes no sense to you, it's because you are a thinking human being.  The way life traditionally works is that if something goes really badly or even worse than expected, the top guy (or gal) takes the fall.  CEO of a company who pushes a new product that flops? Bye bye. Manager of a baseball team that has a load of talent but misses the playoffs? See ya!
Inherent in that reality is the fact that, no, it's not all the CEO or manager's fault. Lots of factors go into why anyone or anything fails and putting someone out as a the scapegoat/sacrificial lamb/fall guy takes a complex equation and drastically oversimplifies it. Of course, the same thing happens when a CEO or manager succeeds.  Credit accrues to them when, in fact, it probably should be spread far wider around.
All of which brings me back to soon-to-be Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid and still-House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi -- both of whom either have or will shortly be chosen (by acclamation even!) as the leaders of their party in the Senate and House, respectively.
Here's what Pelosi had to say when asked about whether she felt odd staying on amid Democratic losses last Tuesday: "I’m here as long as my members want me to be here, as long as there’s a reason to be here." S he has previously told Politico in an interview earlier this week that "it’s always time for fresh leadership but my members have asked me to stay."
And, while the Politico piece did note some grumblings among some House Democratic members that it might be time for Pelosi to move on, there is no question that she can have the top job as long as she wants it.  The losses Democrats have incurred in the 2010 and 2014 elections have made the House caucus much more liberal -- and hence even more pro-Pelosi. And, as she said in the Politico interview, no one can raise money like she can.
Reid has faced slightly more public protestation about his decision to run again.  Most notably, Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill told reporters Thursday she would not vote for the Nevadan as leader. (It's worth noting two things about that: 1) There is no actual "vote" unless someone demands one and 2) McCaskill's move to publicly break from Reid is almost certainly less about him and more about her positioning to run for another term in conservative Missouri in 2018.) McCaskill aside, however, there has been little clamoring to replace Reid -- despite the fact that he helped architect the " let's make this election all about the Koch Brothers " strategy and oversaw the loss of eight and potentially nine seats last Tuesday.
All of which is decidedly strange.  Democrats -- from President Obama on down -- seem entirely comfortable with essentially writing off the results of the last election and continuing on as though either a) nothing has happened or b) what happened was a total fluke that was out of anyone's control. That's a mistake.
Boston Globe columnist Scot Lehigh , in a piece calling for Reid and Pelosi to step aside , put it well:
Both Reid and Pelosi need to face a harsh reality of politics in an era of syncopated partisanship and polarization: After a certain period, congressional leaders’ caricatured images get so ingrained that they become electoral liabilities for their parties...
....Some will no doubt protest that the midterm losses weren’t Pelosi’s or Reid’s fault, and that therefore they shouldn’t bear the consequences. But this isn’t about blame. Rather, it’s about giving the Democrats an opportunity to offer fresh faces, different voices, new approaches.
Lehigh's right.  Pelosi's argument has long been -- behind closed doors -- that if she left, House Democrats would struggle to come anywhere near the $400 million she has raised for the party and its candidates since 2002.  Absolutely true.  No one this side of Barack Obama can raise money as well as Pelosi. But, simply staying on in perpetuity -- it's hard to imagine (though not impossible) Democrats having a serious shot at the House majority until the 2022 national redistricting process -- doesn't solve that problem.
If Pelosi left, someone(s) would fill the void. Politics abhors a vacuum after all. Would they do the job as well as Pelosi? Probably not. Might they grow into the job? Yes.  The only way to ensure the next generation of Pelosis never step forward is to not let them try.
Ditto for Reid, who has the added challenge of dealing with what looks to be a very reelection race in 2016. And, unlike Pelosi's situation in the House, there is a Reid successor waiting in the wings: New York Sen. Chuck Schumer.
None of the above means that Pelosi or Reid have been ineffective leaders. Both have done wonders to keep their caucuses united amid confrontations with Republicans and clashes with the Democratic-controlled White House. But, Democrats lost -- and lost badly -- in the recently concluded election.  When that happens, the best way to show people that you heard the message they were sending is to do something other than just shuffle the leadership chairs. ( Elizabeth Warren is in leadership now! ) Is it fair? Not entirely, no. Welcome to politics.

Five local vendors to check out at the EmporiyumBy Becky Krystal November 13 Follow @BeckyKrystal
The two-day Emporiyum event features dozens of vendors from across the country who need no introduction, including such big names as Momofuku Milk Bar and Jeni’s Splendid Ice Creams . But the Emporiyum also provides an opportunity to sample the wares of local vendors you may not otherwise procure so effortlessly in one place.

Hilary Tomeny sells her gluten-free baked goods online, with the hope that she can open a storefront next year. She began pursuing wheatless baking in earnest during her furlough last year from the Department of Defense. Unlike many other gluten-free treats, Tomeny’s don’t contain brown rice flour. Instead, she makes her own gluten-free flour blend, baking with potato flour, tapioca starch and cornstarch. Her repertoire includes such nostalgic treats as chocolate chip cookies and oatmeal cream pies, as well as a more contemporary salted caramel cream brownie sandwich. As a nod to fall, she expects to bring some pumpkin-spiced doughnuts to the Emporiyum.
Magpie Cookshop
The Emporiyum marks the debut of this collaboration between New York-based cookbook author Louisa Shafia and Washington lawyer Sabahat Chaudhary. The two have designed a “line of sustainable and fashionable kitchen textiles,” Shafia says, including an apron, tea towel, produce bags and food-preserver bowl toppers. The textiles are colored with natural dyes; materials include a cotton-hemp blend and recycled polyester blend. The products are handmade in Washington and, other than at the Emporiyum, are available only online for now. The pair hopes to expand with a pop-up or brick-and-mortar store, and partner with shops in New York and Washington to carry their products.

The pop-up biscuit shop recently found a more permanent home on weekends at Union Market . The Emporiyum, though, is where the brand will introduce its line of retail products, says chief executive Ayeshah Abuelhiga. She and her team perceived demand for frozen biscuits; those vacuum-packed biscuits probably will be available in packs of six or 12. They aren’t baked and will require a brief thawing before going into the oven. By way of endorsement, Abuelhiga is convinced that the baked-from-frozen biscuits are better than when they’re baked from fresh dough. Also available: preserves, such as cranberry or citrus spreads.

Pastry chef Heather Roth, currently on staff at L’Academie de Cuisine, has worked at such Washington establishments as Hook and Equinox. When she was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2010, she took time off to focus on her health and looked to baking for solace. Now she’s going into business for herself, considering the Emporiyum her launch date. “After five years cancer-free, I’ve gotta do this. What am I waiting for?” she says. She’s working to place her sweet treats at local shops but hopes to one day open at a place like Union Market. At the Emporiyum, expect to see desserts along the lines of decorated sugar cookies, cupcakes and macaroons. Roth will also be taking orders for Thanksgiving and Christmas cookie wreaths.
Udderly Nuts
This year-old business is based out of culinary incubator Union Kitchen. Ryan Keating started making his own almond milk when he was on the Paleo diet. Except for a version that includes honey for a touch of sweetness, Udderly Nuts contains only two ingredients: almonds and filtered water. “People say, ‘Wow, this really tastes like almonds.’ They’re not used to that,” Keating says. The almond milk, which Keating compares in consistency to one-percent cow’s milk, comes in 32-ounce plastic bottles, which are sold in a handful of locations in the District. Smaller bottles are under consideration and may be available at the Emporiyum.

Mark Turgeon explains his sorority house selfieBy Dan Steinberg November 13 Follow @dcsportsbog
(Via @CoachTurgeon)
“Are you a star? You must be a star,” a customer at the Route 1 Ledo Pizza said to Mark Turgeon Wednesday afternoon.
“Hey, Mark Turgeon,” the Maryland coach said, introducing himself and reaching out his hand.
“Oh yeah,” the woman said. “You’re the basketball man.”
“Have you been seated?” Turgeon asked.
QOTD: "Better I serve YOU than you serve ME!!!" (Coach Turgeon to @UMPD ) @umterps @UMD_OCE pic.twitter.com/yO6wOewExv
— Lisa Church Breeden (@lcbreeden) November 12, 2014
The coach was ostensibly at Ledo as a guest waiter, part of the annual College Park Dream Team fundraiser . And sure, Turgeon carried a few pizzas to patrons, and balanced a few glasses of water on a waiter’s tray while wearing his Ledo apron. But the restaurant was well-staffed, and Turgeon wasn’t visiting a pizza restaurant to stand in a corner and wait for more customers to arrive.
“Obviously they don’t trust me to serve,” he joked at one point. “So I’m just gonna walk around and talk to people.”
Which he did, making small talk with college kids and middle-aged couples who told him that he’s doing a great job with the Terps, because when a college coach in a red apron is hanging out at your lunch table, that’s what you say. Turgeon might not always look happy on the sidelines at
Comcast
Xfinity Center, but this was a smiling Turgeon, grabbing every hand in sight.
“I’d rather do this than go do an interview at Comcast SportsNet or The Washington Post,” Turgeon admitted. “You get more out of it, you meet more people, and you want people to get to know you a little bit. Sure, they’re not really getting to know you — you’re delivering a pizza, you might say a few words to ‘em — but every little bit helps.”
 
(Via @umterps)
Which also helps explain Turgeon’s recent visits to more than a dozen Maryland fraternities and sororities. These visits weren’t that much more in depth than his pizza spiel — he had a three-to-four minute stump speech, which he delivered, with slight variations, to about 16 Greek organizations.
“I like getting around younger people,” Turgeon said. “Just kind of the energy they give you is tremendous. And I know it means a lot to them. So just to go into their house and talk to them for [a couple] minutes is a lot of fun, to be honest with you. And they’re important to us. To have a great program I think you have to have great support. When you have great student support, the crowd can get pretty loud. So I’m just letting them know how important they are to us, and that we’d love to have them around as much as they can.”
Turgeon admitted that he never notices the home crowd after a game’s opening tip. But he said when he enters
Comcast
Xfinity Center, the first thing he looks at every time is the Terps student section.
“I don’t ever look again, but right when I walk out, I want to see how many students are there,” Turgeon said. “Because they’re a big part of Maryland and what we’re trying to do. So I just like getting out and being around them.”
 
(via @umterps)
Turgeon couldn’t get any of his players to accompany him to the frats, but two volunteered to go with him to the sororities. (“Isn’t that amazing?” he deadpanned.) At one frat house, a student celebrating his 21st birthday was doing shots throughout his visit. (The student offered Turgeon a shot. “A dark one,” the coach remembered. He politely declined.) At one sorority house, he took a selfie, and it was filled with smiles.
“And I screwed up, I didn’t do that until towards the end,” Turgeon recalled of his selfie. “I should have done that at every house.”
Turgeon sometimes goes into the Stamp Student Union for lunch and will visit with students there. He said he wishes there were an organized way he could drop into on-campus dorms and meet with students, stop by the Commons and talk to a crowd. He doesn’t know exactly what the Greek kids thought about his visits — which he’s also done at previous coaching stops — but every little bit helps.
“I think some of them enjoy it, and some of them are like ‘Oh man, what’s this old guy doing here talking to us,’ ” Turgeon said. “But when I leave there, I’m energized. I feel good. I feel like I’m a part of the student body.”

Mike Rizzo on the Nationals payrollBy James Wagner November 13 Follow @jameswagnerwp
Washington Nationals managing partner, Ed Cohen (L) talks with GM Mike Rizzo during spring training. (Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)
On opening day in April, principal owner Mark Lerner declared the Nationals were “beyond topped out” with a franchise-record payroll $135 million and the ownership group would be careful about spending in the future. Without making a single change to the roster, the Nationals’ 2015 projected payroll is expected to jump to $147 million because of raises in contracts and through arbitration . That projected payroll trails only the Dodgers, Yankees and Angels in size, according to MLBTradeRumors.com’s projections.
Nationals ownership can go many directions from here. They can allow the payroll to increase, which would let the front office add a few players to bolster the roster or ink long-term extensions with current players. Or the front office may have to be creative to make tweaks to improve a team in the middle of its contending window.
“There’s nothing off the table,” General Manager Mike Rizzo said on Wednesday at the GM Meetings in Phoenix. “There’s no restrictions. We’re going to make good prudent baseball moves regardless of payroll.”
The Nationals have $93 million committed to nine players next season. While they have a lot of arbitration-eligible players who are due raises, there is some flexibility there because they’re not long-term contracts. Those 11 arbitration-eligible players could cost around $50 million. (The Nationals have 10 players who could be free agents next winter and payroll could shrink dramatically then anyway.) The Nationals aren’t expected to be big spenders in the free agent market this winter, so their relative ranking in the league could drop down.
If the payroll doesn’t increase much and the Nationals go the free agent route to fill the second base void, they could create a little bit of financial wiggle room by non-tendering arbitration-eligible players or making trades. The Nationals have good pitching depth and could trade, for example, Ross Detwiler, who saw his role diminish last season and is likely due about $3.3 million in arbitration next season.
“[Payroll implications] are internal decisions that we make that map out of the direction of the franchise,” Rizzo said. “We have a direction in mind. We’re going to put the best team on the field that we can within the parameters that we’re given.”
The Nationals are in a fascinating position. Their window to contend with this talented roster is shrinking. Much of their roster was built through trades and the draft. Those young players grew up together and are nearing free agency. The Nationals have tried to lock up Jordan Zimmermann, Ian Desmond and Doug Fister to long-term deals. It is near impossible to keep all of them — and if they can manage to keep two of them, it would likely come with a spike in payroll. And beyond even those three players, the Nationals have to consider the long-term futures of Stephen Strasburg and Bryce Harper.
“We have a long-term outlook and long-term plan for the franchise and the organization,” Rizzo said. “Definitely thought about who and how and what players we should look into extending and we have our plans in place to do what we need to do to protect the longevity and success of the franchise.”
The Nationals are in a position to make long-term commitments. Their projected financial commitments are expected to drop to nearly $48 million in 2016, according to Baseball-Reference.com, and shrink again in 2017. The team plays in a publicly-funded stadium. The Lerner family bought the team in 2006 for $450 million and Forbes magazine valued the Nationals at $700 million last March. Ted Lerner, the patriarch of the Nationals’ ownership group, has a net worth of $4 billion, according to the magazine, which makes him the second-wealthiest owner in baseball. Nationals Park drew 2.58 million fans in 2014, 12th in the majors.
The Lerner family could dip into their fortune to increase payroll. When they bought the team, they called the franchise “a public trust” and said the family would not take profit out of the business for 10 years. Lerner’s comments last spring showed the owners will be cautious with spending.
The long-standing MASN dispute creates some uncertainty for the Nationals. If MLB’s arbitration ruling holds  up in a court case that may end next March,  MASN would owe the Nationals  $42.25 million in back pay for 2012 and 2013 and an additional $25.35 million for this season. That’s a substantial amount of money that, if allowed by ownership, could be spent on the baseball side.
Asked how the MASN dilemma affected payroll and baseball decisions, Rizzo declined to elaborate.
“We factor in all revenue stream in regards to what the revenues are and what the expenditures are and we have to make plans accordingly,” he said.
James Wagner joined the Post in August 2010 and, prior to covering the Nationals, covered high school sports across the region.

Tata Steel Q2 Profit Rises 37% on One-Off GainsBuying Iron Ore for First Time in History, Says Tata Steel
Mumbai: Tata Steel reported a 37 per cent rise in quarterly profit on Wednesday, beating market estimates, helped by one-off gains from sale of assets.
The company's consolidated net profit was Rs 1,254 crore for the second quarter ended September 30, from Rs 917 crore a year earlier, Tata Steel said in a statement.
One-off gains for the quarter were Rs1,145 crore, Tata Steel said. Consolidated net sales for the quarter fell 2.4 per cent from a year earlier to Rs 35,503 crore.
Analysts on average expected the country's largest steel producer by market value to report a net profit of Rs 738 crore, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Consumer Inflation Falls to Record Low of 5.52% in October, Rate Cut Hopes Rise
NDTV | Updated On: November 14, 2014 12:23 (IST)
More Steps to Rationalise Subsidies on Anvil: Arun Jaitley
Consumer inflation fell to a record low of 5.52 per cent in October, dragged down by sharp drops in food and oil prices. This is the slowest pace of price rise since retail inflation numbers were first published in January 2012.
In another positive development on the economic front, industrial production in September jumped 2.5 per cent compared to 0.4 per cent in August, government data showed on Wednesday. In September, consumer or retail inflation was at 6.46 per cent.
Food price inflation, under a new series published by the government, eased to 5.59 per cent in October from 7.67 per cent in September. Petrol prices have been cut six times since August while diesel prices have been lowered twice since its decontrol last month.
With consumer inflation coming below the Reserve Bank of India's target level of 6 per cent, and global oil prices hovering near 4-year lows, expectations are high that the central bank could cut rates.
But economists see little chances of a rate cut by the RBI in its next policy review due on December 2. "The RBI will keep a close watch on the global oil prices, the trend in vegetable prices and the government's fiscal situation given that the divestment programme has not yet kicked off," said Jayesh Mehta, country treasurer at Bank of America.
Sajjid Chinoy, India economist at JP Morgan, said, "I think only when the RBI is convinced that inflation will come down to 6 per cent and stay there, it would be inclined to cut rates. I think markets, on the rate cut front are getting a little ahead of themselves."
The RBI had sent a strong signal in September that it would hold off cutting interest rates until it was confident that consumer inflation could be reduced to a target of 6 per cent by January 2016.
But economists are hopeful of rate cuts later next year. Mr Mehta of Bank of America sees RBI cutting rates in the next six months. (With Agency Inputs)

New RBI norms to structurally strengthen NBFCs  say analystsUpdated: November 12, 2014 21:35 IST
New RBI norms to structurally strengthen NBFCs, say analysts
PTI
economy (general)
The latest RBI norms for non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) are a step towards convergence of regulations between banks and large NBFCs, which would increase transparency through better disclosures, though profitability would be hit in the short-to-medium term, analysts said.
While profitability of NBFCs is likely to be significantly impacted in the transition phase, long-term effects are likely to be moderate, as the 90-day past due (DPD) NPA recognition norms and the minimum tier 1 capital of 10 per cent would reduce prevailing regulatory arbitrage between banks and NBFCs for a similar set of assets, India Ratings said in a note issued on Wednesday.
Meanwhile, another rating agency Care said that such measures may lead to a jump in NPAs over the short-term which would impact profitability due to higher provisioning requirement with increase in NPAs and interest reversals.
India Ratings said that 10 per cent coverage on incremental NPAs and 20 per cent loan growth, would see their profitability impacted by around 15 bps on an on-going basis.
However, the impact is likely to be higher in the transition period till FY18 (up to 30 basis points) as incremental provision would also have to be taken on the stock of portfolio in addition to loan growth.
Care Ratings said that over the years, the NBFC sector has become systemically important with rise in assets under management from around 11 per cent of bank assets in 2009, to 13 per cent of bank assets in 2013.
To better address business risk, enhance regulatory coverage, standardise regulations and improve governance standards, the RBI revised regulatory guidelines for NBFCs on Tuesday, which are to be implemented over the next three financial years.

Factory output grows 2.5 % in September
National Bureau
economy (general)
Higher output in mining & manufacturing segments
September has brought some cheer on the economic front as industrial production grew at three-month high of 2.5 per cent in September this year, on account of higher output in mining and manufacturing output and larger purchase of capital goods, according to IIP (index of industrial production) estimates released by Central Statistical Office of Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation on Wednesday.
During April-September 2014 period, IIP grew by 2.8 per cent as against 0.5 per cent in the same period previous fiscal.
The mining sector production grew by 0.7 per cent in September as against of 3.6 per cent a year ago. During April-September, the growth was by 2.1 per cent as against a contraction of 2.5 per cent in the same period last fiscal. The production of capital goods grew by 11.6 per cent in September, against 6.6 per cent decline in same month of last year.
During April-September period, the output of capital goods grew by 5.8 per cent as against a dip in production by 0.6 per cent. Overall, 15 of the 22 industry groups in manufacturing showed positive growth in September.
Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), in a statement, said that it hoped that the tentative signs of revival would transform into a firm recovery. “A disaggregated analysis shows a robust growth in capital goods sector, indicating some pick up in investment as companies are contemplating expansion as business environment has turned positive. However, consumer durables are still in the red as high interest rates has stymied demand,” the CII said in a statement. It welcomed the drop in inflation based on consumer price index, and hoped that this would propel the RBI to reduce policy rates in its forthcoming monetary policy.

India  Only Major Economy  to See Improved Momentum: OECDMore Steps to Rationalise Subsidies on Anvil: Arun Jaitley
London: India is the "only major economy" that is projected to see a pick-up in growth momentum whereas mixed trends are predicted for the developed world, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said on Wednesday.
Most of the major economies - developed and developing - including the United States, Brazil, China and Russia are expected to witness stable growth momentum.
The Paris-based think tank said indicators point to weak growth in Europe.
The readings, for the month of September, are based on Composite Leading Indicators (CLI) that are designed to anticipate turning points in economic activity relative to trend.
"India is the only major economy where the CLI points to a pick-up in growth momentum," OECD said in a statement.
In September, CLI for India touched 99.1, the highest since May this year when it stood at 98.6. In August, the same was at 99.
Last month, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank projected a growth rate of 5.6 per cent for India this year, citing renewed confidence in the market due to a series of economic reforms pursued by the new government.
India's economic growth was below 5 per cent in the last two financial years. Recently, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) forecast Indian economy to grow at 5.5 per cent in 2014-15 and at 6.3 per cent in next financial year (2015-16).
During April-August 2014, industrial output growth as measured by Index of Industrial Production (IIP) was at 2.8 per cent, as against flat production in same period of the previous fiscal year.
Earlier this week, Minister of State for Finance Jayant Sinha expressed confidence that the country's GDP growth would cross 6 per cent in fiscal year 2015-16.
OECD said that CLI points to growth losing traction in Japan even though such a trend may be related to one-off factors.
"Within the Euro area, the CLI continues to point to a loss of growth momentum, with stronger signals of a slowdown in the case of Germany and Italy," it said.
"In France, however, the outlook continues to suggest stable growth momentum."

Indian Pharma Firms Well Positioned for Global Growth: S&PGovernment May Make PAN Must for Registering Charitable Trusts
New Delhi/Singapore: As countries are increasingly focusing on affordable healthcare, Indian pharmaceutical firms are well positioned for global growth, according to a report by global rating agency Standard & Poor's (S&P).
The report, titled 'Indian Pharmaceutical Companies Have A Global Opportunity, If They Conquer Compliance Issues', by S&P Ratings Services published on Wednesday, however, said failure to comply with the stringent quality requirements in developed markets is a key factor.
"Expansion into developed markets, especially the US, is positive for the credit profiles of Indian pharmaceutical companies. The market's size and the absence of price controls are likely to support the revenue growth and profitability," S&P credit analyst Vishal Kulkarni said.
Growth prospects are particularly high for Indian companies in the specialty and complex generics segment in the US, the report said.
However, failure on compliance with regulations could seriously hurt creditworthiness. It could lead to disruptions in production, import bans, remediation costs, and above all reputational and litigation risks, it added.
While the largest 10 Indian pharmaceutical companies are much smaller in terms of revenue than their global generics peers, they make up for it by their robust product pipeline, the report said.
"What the Indian companies lack in size is largely offset by their strong product pipeline, presence in emerging markets, and conservatively maintained financial health," Mr Kulkarni said in the report.

AP Canadian-Israeli documentary film-maker and writer Simcha Jacobovici, right, and religious studies professor Barrie Wilson, the authors of "The Lost Gospel" pose for photographs after giving a press conference with a copy of an ancient manuscript at the British Library in London, Wednesday.
TOPICS
christianity
The Lost Gospel is based on written evidence from third century
“What the Vatican feared — and Dan Brown only suspected — has come true,” Simcha Jacobovici and Barrie A. Wilson, authors of The Lost Gospel write in their preface: “There is now written evidence that Jesus was married to Mary the Magdalene and that they had children together.”
At a press conference at the British Library, the authors — Mr. Jacobovici is a Canadian-Israeli film director, award-winning journalist, and writer; Professor Wilson teaches religious studies at York University, Toronto — presented the evidence, morsels of which had already been fed into the press over the last few days.
The authors claim that an ancient Syriac manuscript called Joseph and Aseneth, which found its way to the British Library on 11 November 1847 from a monastery in Egypt, is a lost gospel that fills in the gaps in the narrative about the life of Jesus, showing him as a human being who courted and then married his wife, had children, and even survived an attempt on his life.
The manuscript is already known to experts in the field of early Christianity, the authors claim, albeit only in the later Latin and Greek translations. They claim to be the first to work with a Syriac version, which they have translated and “decoded” to reach their conclusions.
The manuscript, the authors claim, is dated to roughly the third century. Its content was a direct threat to the authority of the Christian establishment and canonical literature, which by then had succeeded in sanitising Jesus, obliterating evidence of his family life and portraying Mary the Magdalene, who was actually his wife, as a prostitute.
The manuscript, they claim, is accompanied by letters from the person who authorised the translation into Syriac. This person was allegedly aware that the writers were taking a great risk by undertaking this task.
“The manuscript helps fill the 30-year gap in Jesus’s resume,” Professor Barrie said, i.e. from his circumcision at the age of eight, to his early 30”s. “It shows what happened to him and the importance of family, love, sex and political ambition.” It also restores the role of Mary the Magdelene – who was airbrushed out of history, the writers claim -- as Jesus’s wife and “co-deity.”
The story, exciting and ground-breaking as it may sound, is however based on the authors’ reading or “decoding” of the manuscript.
Because of fears of possible repression by the Church, the writers of the manuscript wrote in code in which names were changed and identities concealed. Thus the “Joseph” of the book is actually Jesus, and “Aseneth” is Mary the Magdelene, the authors argue. The book provides their arguments on the logic of their method of decipherment, but clearly this is ground on which they are weakest.
Mr. Jacobovichi dismissed some of the hostile responses the book has received as “theological bullying”.
It remains to be seen if the book emerges unscathed from serious academic scrutiny, but till then, it promises riches that even Dan Brown could not offer -- a lost text in ancient encrypted Syriac recovered and decoded by two intrepid writers to reveal the love, life and times of one of the most influential figures of the ancient world. No wonder there was a film producer in the audience.

RINL to ramp up production in a week
Santosh Patnaik
Andhra Pradesh
Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited has achieved nearly 90 per cent capacity at most of the production zones of Visakhapatnam Steel Plant.
The company is gearing up to ramp up the production in another week. The Hudhud-hit VSP had shutdown its operations on October 12 in the aftermath of Cyclone Hudhud. Four days after the cyclone ravaged the coast, it launched re-start operation at its Thermal Power Plant.
Some of the units have already reached 90 per cent of the present capacity in the power plant, raw material handling plant and coke ovens, while blast furnaces and steel melt shop are at 60 per cent of the capacity and it will shortly reach to rated capacities.
RINL has successfully restored its captive power generation to around 225 MW currently thereby reducing dependence on the State Grid, RINL Chairman-cum-Managing Director P. Madhusudan said on Thursday.
He said all the rolling mills including the new wire rod mill-2 have commenced production and the products have started reaching the market in various parts of the country. All the necessary steps are being put in place to ramp up the production and reach the full capacities in steel melt shop and blast furnaces within next one week time, he added.

Mamta Kulkarni  partner held for drug trafficking in KenyaComments
Social media is abuzz with rumours that a former Bollywood actor may have been detained for questioning in connection with a drug bust in Kenya. HT could not independently confirm if actor Mamta Kulkarni was in any way involved in the case.
The rumours could possibly have followed a report and photograph in a Kenyan newspaper, The Daily Nation, that a Vijaygiri Anandgiri Goswami and three others had been arrested and 98 packets of heroin seized from them.
Social media identified this man as Vicky Goswami, rumoured to be Mamta’s husband. Mamta, who has on several occasions denied that she is married to Vicky Goswami, could not be contacted.
The arrest that took place on Sunday last week was the result of a top-secret joint operation by the United States Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) and the Mombasa Police department, the newspaper said.
A Central Bureau of Investigation spokesperson said, “We are yet to receive any confirmation.” Vicky Goswami does not have any cases registered against him in India, and hence is not on the Interpol list of wanted criminals. Top police officials at the Mumbai crime branch said they had no concrete information either.

Wipro Secures $143 Million Outsourcing Deal from Levi Strauss
Press Trust of India | Updated On: November 13, 2014 16:52 (IST)
Buying Iron Ore for First Time in History, Says Tata Steel
New York/New Delhi: Wipro has bagged a $143 million 5-year outsourcing deal from Levi Strauss as the US-based denim apparel maker looks to cut 500 jobs in a restructuring exercise.
The move, first announced in March 2014, is expected to generate net annualised cost savings of $175-200 million once fully implemented.
Levi Strauss & Co has entered into a Master Services Agreement with India's third-largest software services firm to outsource "certain global business service activities within the functional areas of information technology, finance, human resources, customer service and consumer relations."
"The initial term of the agreement is five years with activation of certain components of the Outsourced Services commencing during the first quarter of 2015. The company has the right to renew and extend the agreement for up to two additional one-year periods.
"The company will pay Wipro for the services through a combination of fixed and variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on the company's actual need for such services. The company expects to pay Wipro a minimum of approximately $143 million over the initial term of the agreement," Levi said in a regulatory filing to the US SEC.
Earlier this week, Levi had said that its next phase of the global initiative includes "elimination" of around 500 positions primarily reflecting the Outsourced Services as well as a further reduction of management layers, an increase in spans of control, the removal of duplicative roles and other structural changes.
"The company anticipates the elimination of positions will be substantially completed within the US within the second half of fiscal 2015 to accommodate the transition of Outsourced Services to Wipro.
"The Final estimates for headcount, timing and charges in certain areas of the international business are subject to completion of applicable local works counsel and other consultative processes."
The San Francisco-based jeans maker said it expects to incur restructuring and related charges in the range of $45-55 million, the majority of which will be recognised in the fourth quarter of 2014.
The charges consist of cash expenditures principally related to severance benefits, retention bonuses and consulting fees.
In a statement, Levi said: "In this next phase of the productivity initiative, approximately 500 positions will be eliminated, primarily due to the decision to partner with Wipro."
Wipro will provide support for certain business services within information technology, finance, human resources, customer service and consumer relations, it added.

J.D. Power survey says Quicken still on topNote to lenders: First-time home buyers don't understand what you're saying
Quicken nabs top spot in mortgage satisfaction survey
Quicken Loans topped an annual national ranking of customer satisfaction with primary mortgage lenders for a fifth consecutive year.
While that's good news for the Detroit-based online lender and other companies that fared well in J.D. Power's survey, there's a separate, troubling finding for the mortgage lending industry as a whole: Plenty of consumers remain confused by the process of securing a mortgage, a discouraging sign given the dearth of first-time buyers in the housing market.
  Open link
Some 35 percent of those who participated in J.D. Power's study of primary mortgage origination satisfaction, people who bought a home or refinanced a mortgage in a 12-month period, said they didn't completely understand the process.
Among first-time buyers, the confusion was even greater. More than half of them said they didn't fully understand the various types of loans available and only 41 percent said their loan officer completely explained the intricacies attached to mortgage loans such as loan terms, fees and how they might reduce their down payments.

Once I got to 50  I had to convert it into a big scorePrint

Having scored a world record 264 in India’s 153 run win against Sri Lanka, Rohit Sharma feels he has a lot more to achieve in the game and an odd failure will not stop his progress.
(Also Read: Rohit Sharma takes over Twitter )
“Not relieved I would say. I still have a lot more to do. When I was young and wanted to play International cricket, I never thought this would happen,” said Rohit when asked about his breathtaking innings in the post-match presser.
(Photos: Rohit Sharma: His bat didn’t just talk, it screamed its lungs out against Sri Lanka )
“All the records happen along the way. I probably need to work harder and from here on the expectation would be more. I feel I have a lot of responsibilities on my shoulders,” said the Indian, who also became the first man to score two ODI double hundreds.
(Stats: Rohit Sharma’s 264 takes him to the top of individual scores in ODIs)
Rohit, who played his first international game on Thursday after an injury lay-off, had struggled against pace bowling in South Africa. He said couple of failures cannot stop his progress.
“You have to accept the failure and success and you keep moving on. That’s what I’ve done. A couple of overseas failures will not stop my cricket. My cricket and my hard work will still remain on the track. I will keep working hard as ever.”
Rohit started his record-breaking innings slowly as he conceded a maiden to Angelo Mathews before stepping on the gas. The Indian opener gave credit to his partner Ajinkya Rahane for his quickfire 24-ball 28 that took pressure off him.
Admitting that he was struggling in the beginning, Rohit said: “Playing after two months from an injury layoff, I was feeling little out of place, I should accept that. The strikebreaking was not happening as naturally as it used to be. I wanted to get stuck in the middle that required a lot of dedication and determination. I had to build the innings. Initial 10-15 overs was not easy.
“I kept telling myself, no matter what, I need to stay there. Luckily the quickfire innings by Rahane really helped me settle down. I needed to stay there because I knew I can make up any time. I just wanted to make it count. I wanted to make this game special one for me and the team. Getting two double hundreds was really special.”
He also gave credit to BCCI physio Vaibhav Daga for working overtime with him.
“I am sure he will be a really happy man today. It was A very difficult two months. I would like to thank the BCCI physio Mr Vaibhav Daga. For both of us it was a big challenge, he really worked hard with me.”
Asked whether he had Sehwag’s record 219 in mind when he completed the double ton, Rohit said: “The last continued…

Im an Elvis impersonator: Ask me anythingBy Amy Argetsinger November 13 Follow @AmyArgetsinger
If you read the story about the surprisingly competitive world of Elvis Tribute Artists , your head is probably swimming with questions about the men who channel the King for a living. So was mine, during my reporting trip to the Ocean City Elvis Festival last month. I learned so much about the lives of Elvii that I couldn’t include in the main story. But here are some answers to your hunka-hunka burning questions, plus videos of a few of the best ETAs in concert.
 
Tim Hendry checks his appearance one more time in a mirror before his first round performance at the 2014 Elvis festival in Ocean City, Md. (Jay Westcott for The Washington Post)
What made you decide to become Elvis?
Tim Hendry, five-time competitor in the Ultimate Elvis Tribute Contest: “I was a drummer in a hard-rock band, and I had my hair down to here. But I was always listening to Elvis.” Twelve years ago, he accompanied his father, a longtime Presley fan, to the Collingwood (Ontario) Elvis Festival on Lake Huron. He had just cut his hair, “short and spiky, and I didn’t know what to do with it.” When he combed it into a pompadour, everyone saw a resemblance. Suddenly, it clicked. “I said, ‘Let’s do this.’” He started entering competitions and winning.
 
Knowing the effect Elvis Presley had on women, you must get a lot of, uh, interesting attention from fans, huh?
Hendry: “I do. [Long discreet pause.] Most of it is very respectful.”
 
Uh, how do you deal with that?
Ben Portsmouth, 2012 Ultimate champion: “I don’t use my Elvis-ness to get women in bed, if that’s what you mean.”
 
How am I doing my Elvis impression wrong? 
Doug Church, winner of the 2014 Portage (Ind.) Elvis FANtasy Festival: “A lot of guys are slurring the words too much. Singing too far back in the throat. . .  People began doing an impression of an impression.”
 
What annoys you most about other Elvis tribute artists?
Shawn Klush, 2007 Ultimate champion: “Adding their own twists to something he never did. If you’re going to do that, don’t say you’re a tribute artist. [Or doing non-Elvis songs] The fans don’t want to hear what it would sound like, Elvis singing ‘Here Comes the Sun.’ They want to hear ‘Hound Dog’ like it was done. . . There are some [tribute artists] who can’t afford certain suits and they go out and do their own thing, and that’s okay — but if you’re going to get down to the heart of the matter, do it right.”
 
Where do they get those suits anyway?
We can’t speak for all ETAs, but many of the costumes are identical to those sold by B&K Enterprises , which boasts permission rights to the designs created for Elvis by his original stylists. The most expensive jumpsuits run as high as $4,400. We saw the spectacular Sundial Suit on Ocean City’s second-place finisher David Lee. Hendry wore the Chain Suit with Macrame Belt during the preliminaries (see above) and the Dragon Suit for the finals, while Church wore the ruby-and-gold-encrusted Eyelet Suit and the Aloha Suit (below).
Doug Church, of Mishawaka, Ind., performs during finals of the 2014 Ocean City Elvis Festival. (Jay Westcott for The Washington Post)
 
What do most people get wrong about Elvis impersonators?
Klush: “They have a preconceived notion that it’s a fat guy in a suit eating a peanut butter sandwich talking about doing a lot of opiates.”
 
You’ve already passed your Elvis Year — age 42, when he died. In a field devoted to being as true to the King as possible, how much longer can you keep doing this?
Hendry: “As long as I can.” (If he gets too old, he says he might become a promoter and run his own Elvis Tribute contests.)
Klush: “Rick Saucedo is probably 62 years old, and he’s still doing it.” (Saucedo, one of the longest-working Elvis tribute artists, is 58, according to his bio .)
 
Do you have any qualms about the fact that you’ve made your career as an artist taking on someone else’s persona, instead of showcasing your own?
Hendry: “I did my own thing for many years. I love Elvis. I’m lucky and blessed to be able to do something so fun.”
 

Celebs get the Fight Night party going early this yearBy Helena Andrews November 13 Follow @helena_andrews

Hey isn’t that … A cabal of celebs hanging with Under Armour billionaire Kevin Plank at the W Hotel on Wednesday night? Plank and his VIP friends, including Football Hall of Famer Dan Marino and “CSI Miami” actor Omar Miller, noshed on Kobe beef, oysters, whiskey and a whole lot of bacon. (Yeah, we’re sad we missed it too.)
Wednesday’s invite-only fete was the luxe pre-game party for tonight’s 25th annual Fight Night, the boys club-esque fundraiser for which Plank took over as co-chair in 2013.
Our tipster tells us there was lots of chatter about Washington’s 2024 Olympic bid among the sports-minded crowd, which included Raul Fernandez, vice chairman of Monumental Sports and Entertainment, the company that owns and operates the Wizards, Capitals and Mystics.
“People like to be around winners,” Plank, 42, told the Reliable Source last year by way of explaining his revamp of the quarter century old fundraiser. “That’s a fact. Winners attract winners, because they want to be around one another, and they feed off of one another’s energy.”

Bungled Burma policyBy Jennifer Rubin November 13 Follow @JRubinBlogger
You can add Burma (also known as Myanmar) to the list of President Obama’s foreign policy failures. The Associated Press reports :

In Myanmar’s remote capital, President Barack Obama is confronting a nation backsliding in its pledges to enact economic and political reforms that were rewarded with U.S. sanctions relief and made the long-isolated country a darling of Obama’s efforts to stake out a legacy in Asia. The optimism over Myanmar’s unexpected shift from military rule has subsided as reforms slow. The country’s pro-democracy hero Aung San Suu Kyi remains ineligible for next year’s presidential elections because of constitutional rules designed to block her. And Myanmar’s minority Rohingya Muslims face escalated attacks and persecution in the largely Buddhist nation.
Obama insists that he has always been realistic, but his visit (a diplomatic coup for the government) and his disinclination to re-impose sanctions suggest otherwise. Adept Obama watchers suspect that he is too embarrassed to admit failure and reverse course. His preference for the false stability of dictators over solidarity with oppressed peoples has been a hallmark of his presidency. In Burma, that means he is now at odds with the (deserving) Nobel Peace Prize winner Suu Kyi :
Suu Kyi told reporters on Wednesday she believed Washington and other powers were serious about wanting reforms. But the 69-year-old democracy campaigner added: “We do think there have been times when the United States government has been overly optimistic about the reform process.”
“If they really study the situation in this country they would know that this reform process started stalling early last year,” she added. “In fact, I would like to challenge those who talk so much about the reform process, what significant reform steps have been taken within the last 24 months?”
Pro-freedom lawmakers are troubled by the lack of concern about Burma’s deteriorating human rights situation. “The Obama Administration gave up its leverage for real reform too quickly when it rewarded the Burmese government by lifting sanctions and engaging in a number of high-level visits. The result has been backsliding on key human rights issues such as the detention of journalists and mistreatment of the Rohingyas,” Sen. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.) tells Right Turn. “President Obama needs to reaffirm his commitment to real reform in Burma by supporting democratic institutions and by speaking out against the discrimination of the Rohingyas.” But there is little evidence that the administration sees reason to review and adjust its policy.
At a briefing this week, Ben Rhodes, deputy national security adviser, needed 10 paragraphs to answer how he reacted to human rights groups complaints about the slow pace of progress in Burma. A small sample of the double talk :
The opening of a country that had been completely closed off for decades, the opening of some political space, the release of Aung San Suu Kyi, the release of political prisoners, and the initiation, really, of a kind of politics in Burma that just didn’t exist several years ago.  But it’s a country with enormous challenges and enormous needs.  It has a lot to do.
And you don’t complete those types of transitions quickly or easily.  This is going to take years to work through all the different issues that have to be addressed inside of Burma.  However, I think we need to be practical about the timelines associated with those transitions.  When we look at, for instance, Indonesia, the President met with the newly elected President of Indonesia yesterday.  It took many years for them to work through elections and constitutional reforms and dealing with different ethnic groups in the country.  So we’re taking a view here in Burma that this is enormous opportunity for the people inside the country, enormous opportunity for democratization.  However, I think that we are concerned about areas where we do not see progress and where we see significant challenges.  And I think there are really three broad categories that we’re going to be focused on heading into this visit.  One is the ongoing process of political reform in the country.
Sigh.
The president’s attempt to coax Burma away from its despotic behavior was a reasonable one, but the results have been disappointing, to put it mildly. If he wants to maintain what little credibility he has on the matter, he and his aides would do better to directly confront the abuses and explain in no uncertain terms what reforms must happen if sanctions relief is to continue.

Killings by cops apparently going upFrom USA Today :
The number of felony suspects fatally shot by police last year — 461— was the most in two decades, according to a new FBI report.
The justifiable homicide count, contained in the FBI’s annual Uniform Crime Report, has become increasingly scrutinized in recent months as questions continue to be raised about the use of lethal force by law enforcement.
It’s the third straight year we’ve seen an increase. If you’ve been reading The Watch regularly, you’ll know that we hit that figure in the same year that killings of police officers reached a 50-year low . Last year also saw a drop in violent crime. There are about eight to nine killings by cops for every killing of a cop. ( The FBI reported 48 felonious deaths of police officers in 2012, the last year for which data were available.)
The article also mentions another problem we’ve discussed here: It’s difficult to say just how much the figure is rising because police departments are historically bad at actually reporting this data.
University of Nebraska criminologist Samuel Walker said the incomplete nature of the data renders the recent spike in such deaths even more difficult to explain.
“It could be as simple as more departments are reporting,” Walker said.
The Nebraska criminologist has been among the most vocal advocates calling for an all-inclusive national database to closely track deadly force incidents involving police.
“It is irresponsible that we don’t have a complete set of numbers,” Walker said. “Whether the numbers are up, down or stable, this (national database) needs to be done. … This is a scandal.”
University of South Carolina criminologist Geoff Alpert, who has long studied police use of deadly force, said the latest number of justifiable homicides, while increasing, still likely represents a significant under-counting.
He said most major agencies have strongly supported close tracking of deadly force incidents. But he said the majority of police agencies in the country are small — with fewer than 50 officers — and their reporting practices involving such cases are not always uniform.
As FiveThirtyEight points out , unofficial attempts to compile a more thorough count of killings by police have put the figure much, much higher —as many as 1,700 since May 2013, and more than 900 so far in 2014.
Of course, one way to look at this story is to conclude that the cops are killing lots of bad guys, and that’s why both general violent crime and killings of cops are falling. That’s a convenient argument, because it justifies the use of lethal force by police whether they’re doing it more or less often, and whether crime is rising or falling.
One other point: This figure counts “justifiable homicides” committed by police officers. As we’ve seen from recent news reports, opinions of a justifiable killing will vary widely from person to person and from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Moreover — and this part is important — the fact that a shooting was legally justified does not mean that killing the person was necessarily the right thing to do. It only means it wasn’t criminal. The police, for example, may have unnecessarily escalated a situation until the suspect lashed out, at which point it became justifiable to use lethal force. That doesn’t mean escalating the situation was the proper course of action. Police killings of people carrying small knives or holding objects that look vaguely like guns, or quick shots at people holding toy guns have also generally been found to be justified. That doesn’t mean we can’t implement policies that require cops to take the time to assess a situation before firing. A shooting could be justified under the law and still be wrong according to policy. It could even be justified under an agency’s policies, but the policies could be bad. And of course, we also need better data so that we can have this discussion on more certain assumptions.
Bottom line: We should want cops killing people less often. Instead, they seem to be killing people more, even as the threat to cops is diminishing, and society itself is getting safer. And it’s simply unacceptable that we get precise data about cops killed on the job, but only sloppy, incomplete data about who, when and how many cops kill.

Pakistan court issues arrest warrants for protest leaders Imran Khan and cleric Tahir ul-Qadri
Reuters Nov 13, 2014, 10.35PM IST
(Thousands of protesters…)
ISLAMABAD: Pakistani opposition leaders reacted with outrage on Thursday after a court issued arrest warrants for a top politician and a firebrand cleric who led protests in the capital of Islamabad aiming to topple the government.
An anti-terrorism court issued the arrest warrants for opposition leader and former cricketer Imran Khan and cleric Tahir ul-Qadri late on Wednesday. The warrants accused their supporters of storming parliament and the state television building on Sept 1.
The warrants may provoke fresh unrest at a time when the country is struggling to rebuild its image.
Thousands of protesters led by Khan and Qadri demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif over allegations of corruption and vote-rigging in the May 2013 polls.
The rallies turned deadly in September when demonstrators clashed with police in a central area near government buildings and embassies. Three people were killed.
"I have just heard the good news about my arrest warrant," Khan said, addressing protesters late on Wednesday. "It will be easy for me to live in jail ... but I tell you, Nawaz Sharif, that you will have to pay a heavy price for my arrest."
The anti-terrorism court also issued warrants against 33 others for storming parliament and trying to take over the Pakistan Television building, taking it off air and beating up the station's journalists.
"The anti-terror court is meant for trial of terrorists, not politicians," Khan's spokesman, Shireen Mazari, said. "Imran Khan's party will not allow police to arrest him."
Anti-terrorism courts are often used in Pakistan for non-terrorism related cases because they are faster and more efficient than regular courts.
"This is a politically motivated, vengeful case against us," Qadri's party leader, Raheeq Abbasi, said. "The whole world knows that the PTV attack was a set-up."
The demonstrations came at a difficult time for Pakistan, already plagued by an Islamist insurgency, sectarian tension and recurrent power shortages, with many people deeply unhappy with the government's performance since it came to power.
Khan wants Sharif to step down because he believes the prime minister rigged the election. Sharif, who denies the charge, won the vote by a landslide, taking 190 of the 342 seats in the first democratic transfer of power in Pakistan's history.
The demonstrations in the capital eventually ended in late October after numbers shrank and Khan and Qadri said they would go on nationwide tours to drum up support.

Enforcement Directorate registers money laundering case against Sahara

(The criminal case was registered…)
NEW DELHI: Enforcement Directorate (ED) has registered a money laundering case against Sahara group in connection with non-payment of crores of rupees to depositors as probed by capital markets regulator SEBI.
The criminal case was registered by the Mumbai zonal office of the agency after it got reports in this regard from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), official sources said here.
"A case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act has been registered against Sahara group. The investigations are in progress," they said.
Emails sent to Sahara group to elicit their response in this regard did not fructify.
Sahara group chief Subrata Roy was jailed in March amid a long-running dispute of his group with SEBI over repayment of over Rs 20,000 crore to investors.
Sahara group, however, has maintained that it has repaid over 93 per cent of the investors directly.
The ED is now investigating whether these funds were laundered to create illegal assets.
The complaint has been registered by the agency based on the findings of SEBI till now, they said.
Sources said the agency would initiate action to attach some assets of the group under the PMLA, depending on the findings of the probe.

Jaguar Land Rover UK staff reject pay deal, union calls for more talks
Reuters Nov 13, 2014, 08.04PM IST
(Talks between the Indian…)
LONDON: British workers at carmaker Jaguar Land Rover have voted against an offered pay rise and pension changes as Britain's biggest trade union said the firm should return to the negotiating table or face a ballot for industrial action.
Talks between the Tata-owned automaker and workers' representatives ended with no agreement in October after the union rejected a pay deal offering staff a rise of at least 3 percent in each of the next three years.
On Thursday, trade union Unite said nearly 13,000 staff had rejected the pay offer, with just under 500 accepting.
Unite national officer Roger Maddison said there were concerns over what he said were proposed reductions to pension provisions at the firm.
"With the company making a staggering 10 million pounds ($15.7 million) profit a day, it is no surprise that the workforce is angered by pension cuts and a pay offer that falls short in recognising their role in that success," he said.
Jaguar Land Rover would not comment on details of the pay or pension deal when asked by Reuters but a spokesman said the firm was very disappointed with the result of the ballot but committed to reaching a negotiated settlement.
After years in the doldrums, Jaguar Land Rover has enjoyed a new lease of life since it was bought by India's Tata group in 2008, recording a 2013/14 pre-tax profit of 2.5 billion pounds, more than doubling in three years.
Staff were offered a 3.6 percent rise in the first year plus a bonus and either 3 percent or the Retail Prices Index measure of inflation plus 0.5 percent depending on which is higher in years two and three, a trade union source told Reuters.
Last year the firm built almost one in three of Britain's 1.5 million cars and in October opened a 500 million pound engine manufacturing centre, its fifth site in Britain.

Massachusetts towns hearing on proposed tobacco ban ends abruptly after crowd gets rowdyThe scene at Westminster Elementary School on Wednesday, moments before the Westminster Board of Health meeting on a proposed tobacco ban was shut down. (Steve Lanava/Worcester Telegram & Gazette via AP)
Westminster, Mass. — a town about 52 miles from Boston — might make history.
Or … it might not, if a public hearing was any indication .
The community of less than 8,000 residents is considering prohibiting the sale of tobacco products, which would apparently be the first such ban in the nation . Westminster residents gathered on Wednesday night to discuss the proposal, which would ban the sale of items such as cigarettes, chewing tobacco and electronic cigarettes.
The crowd grew so unruly that Andrea Crete, the town's Board of Health chairwoman, abruptly ended the event, according to the Boston Herald . Just four people spoke, and opponents of the measure sang as the hearing shut down. Crete left with a police escort, newspapers reported.
"Nobody's respecting the ground rules,” Crete said, according to the Herald . "We have to close it. The clapping. Everybody talking. Nobody is showing any respect to the board or to other people when they're talking. We cannot have that. It’s going to spin out of control."
The Herald reported that those who spoke all voiced opposition to the proposal. The speakers included one merchant, who said he was concerned about losing business, the Boston Globe reported .
"We need to keep Westminster dollars being spent in Westminster, not going to the next town over," said Brian Vincent, the owner of Vincent's Country Store.
Another local official, selectman Wayne Walker, told the board he couldn't "support such a unilateral and radical proposal," which he said he felt wasn't in the town's best interests, according to reports.
"This is about freedom; it’s my body and it's my choice to smoke," Nate Johnson, a Westminster farmer and auto body worker, told the Globe , which reported he was smoking a cigarette at a rally before the hearing.
According to the Globe:
When one resident loudly pronounced himself "disgusted" that the board would make a proposal that infringed on personal choice, the crowd roared with approval.
After several failed attempts to bring the hearing to order, chairwoman Andrea Crete gaveled the session to an end. As police shadowed Crete out of the building, many in the audience broke out in a verse of "God Bless America." Opponents also collected signatures on a petition to recall the three elected board members.
The American Lung Association has said that Westminster's ban would be the first in the nation, according to the Associated Press .
Westminster, Mass., is considering becoming the first municipality in the U.S. to ban sales of all tobacco products within town lines. (AP)
"They should be paying attention to salaries of others, overtime for police and other things, not worrying about this," ban supporter David Sepplin told the Herald.
"They're confused. They’re confused about civics. The Board of Health is voting to protect the safety of the clients, the people here. They’re protecting them and they’re upset about it."

Virgin America IPO comes Friday
The Big Climate Deal: What It Is  and What It Isntreddit
1) It is historic. John Kerry was right to use the phrase in his New York Times oped announcing the deal: for the first time a developing nation has agreed to eventually limit its emissions, which has become a necessity for advancing international climate negotiations.
2) It isn't binding in any way. In effect President Obama is writing an IOU to be cashed by future presidents and Congresses (and Xi is doing the same for future Politburos). If they take the actions to meet the targets, then it's meaningful, but for now it's a paper promise. And since physics is uninterested in spin, all the hard work lies ahead.
3) It is proof, if any more was needed, that renewable energy is ready to go. The Chinese say they'll be using clean sources to get 20 percent of their energy by 2030 -- which is not just possible, it should be easy. Which they know because they've revolutionized the production of solar energy, driving down the cost of panels by 90 percent or more in the last decade.
4) It is not remotely enough to keep us out of climate trouble. We've increased the temperature less than a degree and that's been enough to melt enormous quantities of ice, not to mention set the weather on berserk. So this plan to let the increase more than double is folly -- though it is good to see that the two sides have at least agreed not to undermine that two degrees target, the one tiny achievement of the Copenhagen conference fiasco.
5) It is a good way to put pressure on other nations. I've just come back from India, which has worked hard to avoid any targets of any sort. But the lesson from this pact is, actual world leaders at least need to demonstrate they're talking about climate; it makes the lead-up to the global negotiations in Paris next year more interesting.
6) It isn't a way for Obama to get off the hook on things like the Keystone pipeline. If he's serious about meeting these kinds of targets, then we need serious steps; the surest sign this is a talking point, not a serious commitment, would be to approve new pipelines or authorize new drilling. If you pledge sobriety and then buy a keg of beer, people are going to wonder.
7) It is a good reminder that fossil fuel investors should continue their flight to safety -- the burgeoning divestment movement has been arguing not just on moral grounds, but also making the point that the future will inevitably lead to a downsloping curve for the old energies. This is another warning -- for anyone who looks more than a few quarters out, the writing is on the wall.
8) It's not, in any way, a stretch goal. These numbers are easy -- if you were really being cynical, you could say they're trying to put a floor under the retreat from carbon, to manage a retreat from fossil fuels instead of really putting carbon on the run. The Germans, for instance, will be moving in on 60 percent of their energy from clean sources by the mid-2020s, when we'll still be cutting carbon emissions by small increments.
9) It is -- and this is the real key -- a reminder that movements work. President Obama first endorsed the 80 percent by 2050 goal he enshrined in this pact when he was running for president in 2007, a week after 1,400 demonstrations around the nation demanded that goal . This comes seven weeks after by far the largest global climate demonstrations in history , and amidst ongoing unrest in China about the filthy air in its cities.
10) It isn't, in other words, a reason to slack off a bit in the ongoing fight for a livable climate, a fight our civilizations are in great danger of losing. If we want this to be a start, and not a finish, we've got to build even bigger and more powerful movements that push the successors of these gentlemen to meet what science demands. Today's an achievement for everyone who's held a banner, signed a petition, and gone to jail -- and a call for many more to join us going forward!

Kansas GOP s Right-Wing Budget Disaster Gets WorseOfficials: Kansas Faces $279M Budget Gap By July
 | By                                                                JOHN HANNA
reddit
TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) — Kansas will face a $279 million budget shortfall by July, far worse than state officials had thought before a new revenue forecast Monday that will force Gov. Sam Brownback and legislators to consider spending cuts.
The state will also be required to close an even bigger additional gap — $436 million — during the following 12 months, according to the new forecast.
Aides to the Republican governor, who narrowly won re-election last week, said his administration will work in the next weeks to find savings while trying to protect funding for schools and core programs. But a Democratic leader called the new projections "devastating."
Brownback and many Republicans in the GOP-dominated Legislature are not publicly rethinking aggressive cuts in personal income taxes enacted in 2012 and 2013 to stimulate the economy. The state cut its top rate 26 percent and exempted the owners of 191,000 businesses from income taxes altogether, and further reductions are promised, including a decrease in the top rate next year.
"I would say the economy's growing — when you look at wages, when you look at jobs from new and expanded businesses, when you look at small business income," Shawn Sullivan, the governor's budget director, said during a Statehouse news conference announcing the new forecast. "We continue to cut taxes every year, which is a great thing."
The new forecast revised previous revenue projections made in April for the current budget year, which began in July, dropping the prediction for total general revenues by $206 million, to less than $5.8 billion. The state also faces previously unanticipated costs for social services, public schools, and public employee pensions, driving up the figure for its spending commitments past $6.4 billion.
After eating through $380 million in cash reserves, the state still would have to close a 4.3 percent budget gap by July. An unofficial projection previously put the shortfall at $14 million.
The new forecast followed short-of-the-mark tax collections in the spring, summer and fall.
The forecast also made the first revenue projections for the fiscal years beginning in July 2015 and July 2016.
For the next fiscal year, the new projection was $5.8 billion in revenues — short of the nearly $6.2 billion that legislative researchers had been assuming in their unofficial forecasts. The projected shortfall of $436 million is about 7 percent, and higher than the $282 million gap estimated unofficially.
The new revenue projection for the fiscal year beginning in July 2016 is a little less than $5.9 billion — again, short of the nearly $6.4 billion legislative researchers had assumed. But the new forecast assumes that spending by that time will be in line with the lower revenues.
The projections also assume Kansas will continue to see modest economic growth, said Raney Gilliland, director of the nonpartisan Kansas Legislative Research Department.
During the governor's race, Democratic challenger Paul Davis argued the tax cuts championed by Brownback were wrecking the state's finances. Senate Minority Leader Anthony Hensley, a Topeka Democrat, predicted the state will have to cut spending on schools and social services and divert money from highway projects.
"There is absolutely no good way out of this," Hensley said. "You can't find enough efficiencies or growth to make up these devastating numbers."
The new forecast was drafted by legislative researchers, members of Brownback's budget staff, Department of Revenue officials and university economists. Governors and legislators must use the "consensus" numbers in budgeting.

By Lisa Richwine, Reuters
Concert promoter Live Nation Entertainment and youth media company Vice have formed a joint venture to launch a digital platform that delivers live music, documentaries and other programming to online and mobile audiences, the companies said on Wednesday.
The platform will roll out in 2015, a statement from the companies said.

Vice Chief Executive Officer Shane Smith said the companies aimed to provide music-related programming that will appeal to young audiences. Online and mobile research shows younger audiences are passionate about music but dissatisfied with programming options, he said.
"We see this as a tremendous opportunity to make groundbreaking content," Smith said at a briefing with reporters.
Vice has built an audience of younger news viewers with a mix of hard-hitting reporting out of Syria and Ukraine and other world hot spots along with lighter coverage of culture and entertainment. Investors in Vice include A+E Networks, which is jointly owned by Walt Disney Co and Hearst Corp, and Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox.
The new music platform will include hundreds of hours of original content including long- and short-form video series, live music and other programming as well as ticket sales. The programming will be supported by ads.
The content will include stories of artists returning to their hometowns or the experiences of fans at music festivals. "There are so many stories to be told before and after the show," Live Nation CEO Michael Rapino said.

What Black Thursday Protesters Have Gotten Completely Wrongreddit
Black Thursday is more commonly known as Thanksgiving, a day when families -- dysfunctional and otherwise -- gather to over-eat and give gratitude that they are able to. While the day after Thanksgiving has long been the traditional kickoff of the holiday shopping season, the starting bell has been ringing earlier and earlier each year. Years ago, stores opened on Friday at 6 a.m. That became 5 a.m., then 4 a.m., and then even midnight. Continuing that rollback, some stores now open their doors on Thanksgiving Day -- an event that ties some people's knickers in a knot.
Just to be clear, this is not your local supermarket staying open on your big cooking day, bailing you out when you burn the pies or realize you forgot the cranberry sauce. This is Walmart, Best Buy, Macy's and Target attempting to lure you away from your family with discounts on big-screen TVs and headphones.
The anti-Black Thursday forces have been beating their collective chests over the unfairness of making these stores' low-wage workers leave their families and pie plates to staff the registers so that we may shop on Thanksgiving Day. They also chide those customers who want to shop, because, as logic would have it, the stores wouldn't open (or need people to work) if no one came to spend. There's a Change.org petition demanding that we "Stop retailers from ruining peoples [sic] Thanksgiving" and a Facebook page with more than 75,000 likes that urges people to "Boycott Black Thursday."
There's just one problem: Who made them the boss of us? How do these people actually know that the guy who is working the register at Target doesn't appreciate the money? How can they be so certain that the gal gift-wrapping your packages at Macy's even has a family she wants to spend Thanksgiving with? Not everyone does, you know. Some people dread the holiday and are more than happy to spend it earning some money.
And as for criticizing those who would shop on Thanksgiving: Same deal. Maybe it's fun. Maybe it's better than watching Uncle Bob get drunk. Maybe it's something that the whole family does together instead of lapsing into a turkey coma. Or maybe they do both, coma then shop?
But who are you -- Black Thursday protesters -- to tell us that you know what's best for us? I don't recall electing you, and yet you want to impose your values on me. Thanks, but we already have enough politicians and Facebook friends trying to do that.
Personally, I hate crowds and you couldn't drag me by the hair into a store when I can shop with my fingertips online. I'm also morally opposed to spending money foolishly, which is what a lot of the Black Thursday-Friday-Cyber Monday madness is about. I suffer PTSD from losing my job in the recession and still pick up pennies when I see them on the street. I preach from the Bible of Savings. Maybe you've heard my favorite Psalm: "Thou shall not spend money on foolishness if thou hopes to retire one day." May I hear a chorus of "Amen?"
So no, you won't catch me near a store on Black Thursday or any other day that I can avoid it. I'm quite content with what I have as long as I have my kids happy and healthy. I will be someone who spends Thanksgiving with her family, around a table laden with food. Some friends will likely join us and we also likely will spend some time -- again as a family -- helping to serve meals to the homeless. I could probably be the poster girl for the Black Thursday opposition forces, celebrating the day just the way they think everyone should.
The difference is this: While I may question the sanity of those people who camp out in the Walmart parking lot waiting for the store to open so they could save a few bucks on holiday toys for their kids, I wouldn't dream of imposing my will or my values on them.
Thanksgiving happiness doesn't just come in one shape. Shop or don't shop, that's your choice. But don't make Thanksgiving a holiday about labor rights when you ignore it the other 364 days a year. And while I'm on the soapbox, don't make  Christmas the one day a year you pay attention to the homeless and hungry either.
Social activism? Folks, it's a 365-day-a-year commitment, although you'll probably want to take off on Thanksgiving.

Why the Dutch tradition of blackface ahead of Christmas wont go awayBy Ishaan Tharoor November 13 Follow @ishaantharoor
In this Nov. 16, 2013 file photo the Dutch version of Santa Claus, Sinterklaas, or Saint Nicholas, and his sidekicks known as "Zwarte Piet," or Black Pete, arrive by steamboat in Hoorn, northwestern Netherlands. (Peter Dejong/AP)
On the face of it, it's obvious why many outsiders find the Dutch Christmas-time figure of "Zwarte Piet" -- or Black Pete -- to be shockingly racist. Here's a tradition, after all, in which white people don minstrel-like clothes, wear frizzy wigs, paint their mouths a garish red and blacken their faces. It echoes all the worst iconography of America's troubled racial past.
But many in the Netherlands don't see it that way. Generations of Dutch children frolic and dress up in the days ahead of Dec. 5, which is the eve of the feast day of St. Nicholas. But the Dutch forerunner to Santa Claus doesn't show up with elves and reindeer in tow.
Sinterklaas, according to a popular 19th century Dutch story (and pictured above), is said to arrive on steamship accompanied by a pack of swarthy Piets, trickster figures who amuse crowds of children with candy and japes. Sinterklaas is due to officially "arrive"  this Saturday in the Dutch city of Gouda.
The racial overtones seem clear: the Netherlands was once an imperial power, a possessor of overseas colonies teeming with plantations, and one of the major early drivers of the African slave trade. The Zwarte Piets disembarking off a steamship can't just be mythical creatures of fancy.
On Wednesday, though, the highest administrative court in the Netherlands  overturned  the progressive opinion that a lower court laid down earlier this year. That ruling  had advised that permits for festivities involving Zwarte Piet in Amsterdam should be up for review because it led to "negative stereotyping of black people."
Jaap Polak, the president of the top court known as the Council of State, said Amsterdam's mayor didn't have the power to ban people from dressing up as Zwarte Piet. To the ire of those who back and oppose the tradition, Polak also side-stepped making a judgment on whether it was racist or not. The AP reports :
That ruling means that the Council of State "cannot and will not answer the question" of whether Black Pete breaches Dutch anti-discrimination law, Polak told a packed courtroom.
That leaves the matter still very much up to debate. And there's quite a lot to be discussed in a country that's in many other regards one of the most liberal societies in the West.
What's curious is the incredulity of many Dutch people when asked to confront the apparent racism of their beloved Christmas-time figure. Here's how a writer at Slate summed up the experience in 2011:
Trying to tell a Dutch person why this image disturbs you will often result in anger and frustration. Otherwise mature and liberal-minded adults may recoil from the topic and offer a rote list of reasons why Zwarte Piet should not offend anybody. "He is not even a black man," many will tell you. “He is just black because he came down the chimney.” Then, you may reply, why aren’t his clothes dirty?
This week, a Dutch radio station published a YouTube video of the reactions two Dutch filmmakers received when they dressed up as Zwarte Piet and walked in a London park. Many of the locals they encountered were outraged by the costume.
It doesn't help either that figures as polarizing as far-right nationalist politician Geert Wilders have come out in defense of the tradition. Wilders' anti-immigrant PVV party drew up legislation earlier this year aimed at preserving the black-face figure at Christmas celebrations. "We want to protect our culture," Wilders said in September, and suggested that making Zwarte Piet into a figure of racism was "too ridiculous for words." In 2013, he tweeted that he'd rather eliminate the U.N. than Zwarte Piet.
But the push-back against the tradition has been led by an increasingly vocal group of minorities, as my colleague Anthony Faiola reported last year when discussing Dutch attitudes toward Zwarte Piet.
“This is showing us the truth about racism in a place where some people had convinced themselves it didn’t exist,” said Quinsy Gario, a poet and radio commentator who was born in Curacao and is among the second- and third-generation Afro-Caribbean immigrants here who have largely pushed the opposition campaign. In 2011, he was detained by police for disturbing the peace at a holiday parade, where he held a sign and wore a shirt that said “Black Pete Is Racist.”
“They keep saying this is their tradition, but Black Pete is basically a Dutch Sambo,” he said.
In recent years, proponents of the tradition have tried to clean up the act -- advising, for example, the use of a variety of wigs rather than a mock Afro and dropping the Surinamese accent that used to accompany the antics of Zwarte Piets. Some ethnic minorities have even endorsed the tradition themselves.
But as the voices of dissent grow, it's going to become harder and harder for those patting their faces black every year to keep convincing themselves this is just a children's fantasy.

Truckers Strike at L.A. Port for Workers Rightsreddit
More than 40 percent of the goods that come into the United States from overseas come through the twin ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.  That fact alone gives thousands of truck drivers who haul those goods from the ports to warehouses considerable leverage with big companies (like Walmart, Cosco, and Home Depot) whose goods are mostly made in Asia as well as with the shipping companies, the municipal Harbor Commission which oversees the port, and the trucking companies who employ the drivers.
If the truckers shut down the port, they can disrupt a huge part of the U.S. economy that depends on global trade. That's particularly true during this time of year, when more cargo arrives at the ports in anticipation of the gift-buying holidays.
The trucking companies routinely put profits over people. For example, the Harbor Trucking Association (HTA), which represent the companies, is asking the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) to relax the safety rules that dictate the amount of sleep truckers must have. The HTA wants to lift the requirements so that employers can extend drivers' hours to accommodate the increased shipping loads prior to the holidays.
No worker wants to go on strike, but several major trucking companies at these L.A. and Long Beach ports have made working conditions so miserable that many drivers believe they have no choice. So the drivers will be out of their trucks and onto the picket lines this week.
In July, drivers went on strike to protest the companies' chronic unfair labor practices.  After five days of picketing that dramatically impacted port operations and garnered international media attention, Los Angeles Mayor Eric  Garcetti brokered a "cooling off" period that included an agreement by three trucking firms -- Total Transportation Services (TTSI), Pacific 9 Transportation (Pac 9), and Green Fleet Systems --  to accept all drivers back to work without retaliation.  But the trucking companies went back on their pledge to Garcetti. They continued retaliating against drivers who have complained about unfair conditions and who want a stronger voice in their workplaces. They even fired several of the most outspoken truckers.
So now the drivers are ready to go back on the picket lines and to shift their protests from the offices of the trucking companies to the dockside terminals where longshore workers move containers from ships to trucks. Their actions could be compounded if, the dock workers also withhold their labor.  About 20,000 longshoreman at 29 West Coast ports, who have been working without a union contract since July 1, are poised to go on strike in a dispute with the shipping companies.
The drivers claim that the trucking companies have been misclassifying them as "independent contractors" in order to make it impossible, under federal labor laws, to unionize. The companies routinely deduct huge amounts from drivers' paychecks for fuel, parking, insurance and other expenses, a practice that the drivers say is wage theft. After drivers pay for the cost of renting and maintaining their trucks, their pay is often below the minimum wage.
"The companies treat us like regular employees but compensate us like independent contractors," drivers said in a joint statement.
Several times in the past year the California Division of Labor Standards Enforcement (DLSE) sided with the drivers, finding that they are actually employees rather than independent contractors because the trucking companies establish all the conditions of their work.  Since February 2013,  DLSE has ruled against one of the firms, TTSI, in 17 cases awarding the drivers over $1.2 million in the form of unpaid wages and reimbursements for expenses paid by workers. DLSE admonished the trucking firms to stop retaliating against drivers who raise these issues, but the retaliations have continued.
Last summer, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) issued a consolidated complaint alleging that GFS has committed more than 50 egregious labor law violations. And last  month, a Federal Judge issued an injunction against Green Fleet Systems (GFS), ordered the company to immediately re-hire two drivers who were fired illegally, and stop other  illegal labor activities or face contempt of court.  The court found that in January 2014 that GFS misclassified drivers Mateo Mares and Amilcar Cardona as independent contractors and then fired them for openly supporting GFS' drivers' efforts to unionize with the Teamsters and for refusing to withdraw their wage and hour claims for illegal deductions.
"This is a great victory not just for me and Mateo," said Amilcar Cardona. "It is a great victory for all drivers serving the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach and across the country. The majority of U.S. port drivers are misclassified as "independent contractors" and with this decision, we are beginning to see that the law is on our side and that we all have rights as employees to form our union."
But despite these rulings by the DLSE, the NLRB, and a federal court, the trucking companies have continued to break the law and try to intimidate the drivers, leading to the latest showdown on the docks.
The drivers have appealed to the Harbor Commission, a municipal agency that oversees port operations, to take steps to reign in the rogue companies.  If the dockers walk off their jobs in solidarity with the truckers, port activity would come to a halt, but the truckers alone have sufficient clout to have a significant economic impact if they strike.
According to Harbor Commissioner Patricia Castellanos, "these trucking companies' behavior is outrageous. After all these deductions, some drivers are barely getting paid anything."
Castellanos expressed sympathy for the drivers' plight and their decision to resume their strike.
"It is very clear  that the actions that their employers are taking is what's causing them to take even further action," she said.

At the Express Adda on Friday: Kejriwal  secondbidPrint
AAP has faced the ire of its supporters for having quit the government. (Source: PTI photo)
By: Express News Service | New Delhi | Posted: November 14, 2014 12:05 am | Updated: November 14, 2014 2:23 am
He is the one man who can stand in the way of the BJP wresting total control over the corridors of power in Delhi. His Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) grew from a national movement to a formidable political party, and then a government in little over a year. And now, as Delhi goes to polls again, former Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal will be a guest at the Express Adda in Mumbai on Friday.
The Express Adda is a series of interactions with people at the centre of change. It has earlier featured actor Shah Rukh Khan, world chess champion Vishwanathan Anand, Financial Times commentator Martin Woolf, and most recently Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, among others.
At a little over 46, Kejriwal is younger than most of his political contemporaries, but his story is perhaps unique. He was first  an officer in the Indian Revenue Service, before giving up his job and turning into an anti-corruption crusader. A Magsaysay awardee, Kejriwal shot to national prominence when he was part of the India Against Corruption movement that shook the country for 13 days in August 2012, as Anna Hazare fasted at Ramlila Maidan for the Jan Lokpal Bill. He later split from Hazare and formed the AAP, which caught popular imagination. Riding on an anti-corruption wave, the AAP won 28 seats in the Delhi assembly in December 2013.
For 49 days, in a tenuous arrangement with the Congress that drew flak from several quarters, Kejriwal was Chief Minister of Delhi. Those days too were far from ordinary. He told citizens of Delhi to sting police officers and government officials, brought a controversial power and water subsidy, and even slept in the middle of the road on a winter night to protest against the central government. As eventful as the sojourn was, it was shortlived, a disagreement with the Congress on the passage of the Lokpal Bill becoming the breaking point.
A year later, Kejriwal faces another election, but the challenges have mounted. He faces a buoyant BJP, fresh from its success in Haryana and Maharashtra, and with the Narendra Modi government at the Centre. In Delhi itself, the AAP has faced the ire of its supporters for having quit the government. And there are questions for Kejriwal from within as well, with some alleging a lack of democracy in the party.

Maryland goes after 131 000 people who didnt pay tolls 
(Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)
Have you been zipping past Maryland toll booths without paying, hoping nobody would notice? You may be among 131,000 Maryland drivers about to get a “courtesy-reminder notice” that it’s time to pay up.
They will be sent out next week by the Maryland Transportation Authority (MDTA) to Marylanders who have skipped through tolls at the state’s eight toll facilities with a reminder that they will face suspension or non-renewal of their vehicle registrations in January.
An additional 93,000 out-of-state registered owners will have their toll debt referred to Maryland’s Central Collection Unit in January, the MDTA said.

Hows the Rosetta lander doing Heres everything we know.By Rachel Feltman November 13 Follow @rachelfeltman
Philae's first panorama, with the lander's position illustrated. (ESA/Rosetta/Philae/CIVA)
On Wednesday, European Space Agency and NASA scientists made history when they had a successful soft landing on a comet. The Philae lander definitely landed (well done, you), and it's delivering data back home.
That's great, but the landing wasn't perfect -- and it's not clear how long Philae will last under the circumstances.
Here's the rundown: Philae is a 220-pound robot, but the comet it landed on has a very uneven surface -- and one that's totally alien to us. Scientists on the Rosetta team said beforehand that they really couldn't be sure how hard or soft the ground would be. The comet also has minimal gravity.
Philae was supposed to shoot out a set of harpoons to anchor it into the ground. This is pretty crucial to Philae's long-term functionality. Because gravity is low, an un-anchored probe might end up bouncing around. And while Philae can do a whole bunch of impressive forensic analysis, it can't turn itself back upright if it lands upside down.
The European Space Agency says harpoons designed to anchor the Rosetta mission's Philae lander to a comet "were not fired," but that the vehicle appears stable and ready to begin experiments. (Reuters)
ESA scientists now report that Philae's harpoons never fired. They considered re-firing them, but it doesn't seem that they have -- they may be waiting to know more about Philae's position and the terrain around it. They don't want to knock the lander on its back, after all -- or even hurl it off the comet.
According to updated landing data, the lander bounced a couple times before settling down:
Hello! An update on life on #67P - Yesterday was exhausting! I actually performed 3 landings,15:33, 17:26 & 17:33 UTC. Stay tuned for more
— Philae Lander (@Philae2014) November 13, 2014
The big question now isn't just whether Philae can stand still -- it's whether the part of the comet it's on is a good place to be. The lander sent back the first image from the comet, but the orientation seems a bit wonky. That could mean that Philae bounced from its intended landing spot to the rim of a large crater (which was considered as a landing spot, but later rejected).
One concern is that Philae's solar panels might not be properly illuminated at the moment because of its position. The BBC reports that the lander is only getting one-and-a-half hours of sunlight for every 12-hour rotation the comet makes, which isn't enough to keep the lander operational.
The mission team is working on getting a better idea of the lander's position, which could conceivably shift back to something more favorable on its own. The team could also try to figure out a way to re-position the probe, but with the batteries dying they may end up racing against the clock.
For now, Philae is transmitting scientific data back to Earth. Every hour it stays functional is an hour that it's teaching scientists something new. Comets, the Rosetta team has said , probably contain the elements present in the earliest days of the solar system, frozen in time. By digging into the mysterious ice, Philae is helping us learn more about the origins of our own planet. So even if the lander 0nly lasts another few days (it left Earth with a 60-hour charge), it's been a great success.
The lander's best case scenario is a lifespan of about four months: In March, the comet will be so close to the sun that high temperatures will mess with Philae's systems. The Rosetta spacecraft will keep operating (and following the comet to collect information) until at least December of next year, so Philae's demise is no great tragedy.
But it would be pretty disappointing if that short life was cut even shorter by some malfunctioning harpoons.

Nevada group turns in twice as many signatures as needed to get pot legalization on ballotBy Niraj Chokshi November 13 Follow @NirajC

A group of marijuana legalization advocates in Nevada says it has turned in 200,000 signatures to get the issue on the 2016 ballot, nearly twice the number required by the state.
The Coalition to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol submitted the signatures to Clark County officials on Wednesday morning, according to the Associated Press , though the state will still have to sort through them to certify which are valid and which are not. Nevada  requires 101,667 valid signatures. split equally among four petition districts.
The signatures were submitted by Democratic state Sen. Richard “Tick” Segerblom and Joe Brezny, the executive director of the Nevada Cannabis Industry Association and of the coalition. If approved, the measure will either be reviewed in the state legislature when it reconvenes next year or will automatically qualify for the 2016 ballot should lawmakers fail to act. Although both chambers are Republican-led, NCIA Chairman Leslie Bocskor sees an argument for them to pass it.
“If they were to pass it, that would be something that would take it away from the Democrats being able to use it to drive out the vote,” he says. Voter-turnout concerns aside, he added, the state is unique in that it relies so heavily on tourism and legalization would provide one more incentive for tourists inclined to visit Sin City. In other words, legalization could be good for business.
Nevada is among the five states where the Marijuana Policy Project, which helped usher in legalization in Colorado, has worked to establish committees to push ballot measures in 2016. The others are Arizona, California, Maine and Massachusetts. An independent Democratic activist in Mississippi is also working to get legalization on that state’s 2016 ballot. MPP also has its eyes on another handful of states — Rhode Island, Vermont, New Hampshire, Delaware, Hawaii, and Maryland — where it hopes legalization can, for the first time, be approved legislatively.

You should never underestimate how far bankers will go to game the systemBy Matt O'Brien November 13 Follow @ObsoleteDogma
(Spencer Platt/Getty Images)
This time, it's a $4.2 billion fine . That's how much UBS, HSBC, Citibank, JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, and the Royal Bank of Scotland are collectively paying to U.S., U.K., and Swiss regulators for rigging the foreign-exchange, or FX, market.
Just another day on Wall Street.
This latest malfeasance was something regulators hadn't worried about before, because they didn't think it was possible. The $5.3 trillion FX market, you see, should be far, far too big for any one bank to profitably manipulate it or front-run their clients. And it is. The problem, though, is that big banks have just colluded instead for the past decade. Traders at supposedly competing firms worked together to rig the benchmark FX rates in their favor. They deliberately triggered clients' stop-loss orders—the price they'd automatically sell at to limit losses—to boost their own profits. Along with revealing what trades their customers were about to make, which would let them all make it first.
And, of course, the bankers set up chatrooms charmingly named things like "the 3 musketeers" where they planned all this out in semi-grammatical English. "I'd prefer we join forces" to try to push the price of the euro up, one trader said . "Perfick," the other replied. "Let's double team them."
The lesson is that, with so much money at stake, you should never underestimate how far bankers will go to game the system. Just because there'd have to be a wide-ranging conspiracy for them to pull it off doesn't mean they won't try. In fact, they almost certainly will. And that brings us to the second point: the brazenness of it at all. There's nothing too clever about colluding with other traders, especially not when you leave a written record of it. This isn't, in other words, the work of criminal masterminds. It's the work of people who think they'll never be investigated.
Now, it's obviously good news that regulators are finally cracking down and fining banks over this. But it's important to remember that these penalties are just the price of doing business for big banks—and tax-deductible ones at that .  And that's why the better news is that the Justice Department is still looking into criminal charges against some of these traders. Far too often, as Matt Taibbi has argued, the Justice Department has all too happy to have banks cut them a fat check rather than—and at the expense of—pursuing criminal charges that are hard to prove and even harder to explain to a jury. (Indeed, prosecutors lost one of the high-profile fraud cases  they did try, against two Bear Stearns hedge fund managers).
Bu sometimes it takes Old Testament-style justice—or at least jail time—to get people to pay attention. Otherwise, Wall Street will just pay their tax-deductible fines, and then go back to business as usual.

Boehner: If Obama acts on immigration we are going to fight itBy Ed O'Keefe November 13 Follow @edatpost
House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) said on Thursday that House Republicans will fight President Obama if he goes through with signing an executive order on immigration, saying his actions are "the wrong way to govern." (AP)
House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) assured his colleagues on Thursday morning that he will work with them to formulate some kind of a congressional response if President Obama uses his executive authority to revamp the nation's immigration laws.
What that response might look like remains the focus of ongoing debate among Republicans on both sides of the U.S. Capitol. Several dozen conservatives are hoping to include language in an upcoming spending bill to block Obama from granting temporary status to millions of undocumented immigrants. Others are floating the idea of passing a short-term spending bill that would allow Congress to respond once Obama acts, instead of the full-year spending measure currently favored by most top congressional leaders.
During his first closed-door huddle with colleagues since the Nov. 4 midterms, Boehner said he's heard his colleagues' frustrations and recounted last week's contentious White House luncheon with Obama and congressional leaders.
"I told the president last week directly: If you proceed with executive amnesty, not only can you forget about getting immigration reform enacted during your presidency, you can also expect it to jeopardize other issues as well," Boehner told the group, according to an aide in the room. "We don’t know when exactly he’ll do it or how exactly he’ll do it. But if he proceeds, we are going to fight it."
Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), who is in line to chair the Senate Budget Committee next year, said Wednesday that Republicans should use the power of the purse to block Obama's "unlawful amnesty" for undocumented immigrants, starting with a bill to fund the government past Dec. 11.
Sessions said Republican should refuse to approve a plan to fund the government through the end of September and instead pass a short-term measure that would give Congress a better shot at cutting spending for immigration programs early next year.
Senate Democrats "shouldn't be entitled to bind the country next year when we've got a new Congress," Sessions said, adding that a short-term government funding bill "would be smart for a lot of reasons."
That view puts Sessions at odds with Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and other top Republicans, who are eager to pass a full-year funding bill that eliminates any threat of a government shutdown until at least next fall.
Meanwhile, more than 50 House Republicans have signed a letter saying the new spending bill should include language blocking Obama from acting unilaterally on immigration, according to the Wall Street Journal .

Record-setting cold continues for another day on Thursday in the Central U.S., where frigid temperatures are hovering to 45 degrees below average.
Casper, Wyo., fell to a low temperature of minus 27 degrees on Wednesday night, which breaks the record for all-time November low temperature of minus 21 degrees, set in 1985.
Overnight lows in Denver, Colo., plummeted to 14 degrees below zero, which ties the record for second coldest temperature in November. The low fell just four degrees short of the all-time November record of minus 18 degrees, which was set in 1877.
Highs on Thursday are forecast to be around 15 degrees in Denver and Casper, though the wind chill will stay sub-zero through the afternoon.

Sub-zero low temperatures stretched from Montana through Wyoming and Colorado, but lows were also well below the freezing mark as far south as central Texas, where just three days ago on Monday, temperatures had surged into the mid-80s.
Flights were impacted by icy conditions at the Denver airport on Wednesday, but airport officials are hoping Thursday will be more favorable for air travel, writes CBS Denver :
Flights were delayed throughout the day on Wednesday and the snowy, cold conditions also led to about 50 canceled flights.
“It sort of felt like we were ice skating into the tarmac,” said Bridget Park, who was among those affected on Wednesday.
A CBS4 crew caught up with Park while she was in the airport’s Jeppesen Terminal and dealing with a flight delay. She said she was holding her breath during her plane’s landing in Denver.

Nancy Pelosi says she doesnt know who Jonathan Gruber is. She touted his work in 2009.By Aaron Blake November 13 Follow @aaronblakewp
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said Thursday that she didn't know who Jonathan Gruber is, but she spoke about him in 2009 in footage surfaced by CSPAN. (CSPAN)
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said Thursday that, not only did Jonathan Gruber not play a significant role in drafting Obamacare, but that she doesn't even "know who he is."
Pelosi on Gruber: "I don't know who he is. He didn't help write our bill."
— Sean Sullivan (@WaPoSean) November 13, 2014
Many have pointed out since then that Pelosi's office has cited Gruber's work in the past . That's notable, but it's very unlikely Pelosi herself wrote those press releases herself or even participated in their drafting.
But then there's this: Pelosi herself has also mentioned Gruber and his work -- back in November 2009, at the height of the Obamacare debate.
Here's the transcript, via Nexis:
Q: As you know, the Republicans released their health- care bill this week. And I wanted to get your comment on the bill, and specifically on the CBO analysis that it would cost significantly less than the Democratic plan and that it would lower premiums.
PELOSI: Let me just say this. Anything you need to know about the difference between the Democratic bill and the Republican bill is that the Republicans do not end the health insurance companies' discrimination against people with preexisting conditions. They let that stand. That's scandalous, the fact that it exists. I don't understand why they have not heard the American people, who have said preexisting conditions should not be a source of discrimination.
And secondly, the Republican plan ensures about 3 million more people than now, and ours does 36 million people. So that's a very big difference in that.
We're not finished getting all of our reports back from CBO, but we'll have a side by side to compare. But our bill brings down rates. I don't know if you have seen Jonathan Gruber of MIT's analysis of what the comparison is to the status quo versus what will happen in our bill for those who seek insurance within the exchange. And our bill takes down those costs, even some now, and much less preventing the upward spiral.
So again, we're confident about what we set out to do in the bill: middle class affordability, security for our seniors, and accountability to our children.
Pelosi's office told the Washington Post that the minority leader meant that she didn't know Gruber personally.
"She said she doesn’t 'know who he is,' not that she’s never heard of him," Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill said.
Hammill added: "We've cited the work of dozens upon dozens of economists over the years. As the leader said today, Mr. Gruber played no role in drafting our bill."
Pelosi clearly wants to distance herself and Obamacare from Gruber, given Gruber's controversial comments about " the stupidity of the American voter ," and Democrats are going to argue that Gruber wasn't instrumental in the bill. But, as an architect of the Massachusetts health-care law and a consultant to the White House on Obamacare, he's been regularly cited by Democrats as an authority on this issue -- including, apparently, by Pelosi.

8 things to do in the D.C. area on the weekend of Nov. 14-16By Going Out Guide staff November 13
The weekend’s best in nightlife, music and art.

Through Sunday: The finest museum gift shops unite to offer you a chance to explore their merchandise in one location. The Kennedy Center, Phillips Collection, Imagination Stage and National Geographic Museum are just a few of the 20 institutions that are taking part in the annual Museum Shop Around , with toys, jewelry, hand-crafted items and more. Get your holiday shopping done before the oncoming rush Friday and Saturday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the Mansion at Strathmore. Admission is $9; be sure to bring plenty of cash (admission is cash/check only).
Through Dec. 21: Celebrated playwright Tony Kushner is no stranger to pushing theater into bold and vast places, and the 2009 play “ The Intelligent Homosexual’s Guide to Capitalism and Socialism With a Key to the Scriptures ” -- which saw its own fair share of drama in its circuitous route to the stage -- proves he remains as ambitious as ever. An aged Marxist longshoreman is ready to die, but first he brings his children together for an intense reunion. The epic saga, running 210 minutes with nearly a dozen actors, is a passionate frenzy of ideas and emotions. The show runs at Theater J; tickets are $20-$65. Read: Tony Kushner's Civil War
Friday: There were days this week when you might have sworn it was spring, but a wintry wind is blowing this way, holiday markets are kicking off and the National Gallery of Art's skating rink is opening for the season on Friday -- is there a surer sign that winter is on its way?  Hours are Monday-Thursday 10 a.m. to 9 p.m., Friday and Saturday 10 a.m. to 11 p.m. and Sunday 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. It's $8 to skate for a two-hour session, and $7 for ages 50 and older, 12 and younger and students with valid ID. Skate rental is $3.
Friday: For its return to Washington, famed storytelling showcase The Moth focuses on Africa, bringing in advocates from around the world to share their knowledge and history. This event, titled "Vital Signs," will include such topics as education in Uganda, farming in Africa and protecting the environment. The opportunity to hear revealing personal tales about the joys and struggles of daily life should make for an enlightening evening. The 7:30 p.m. show at Woolly Mammoth Theatre is sold out.
Friday-Dec.28: “Five Guys Named Moe,” a high-energy Laurence Olivier Award-winning musical, is set to rock Arena Stage. With a book written by "The Wire" actor Clarke Peters (who played Detective Freamon on the cult favorite), this period piece shows a heartbroken man imagining a group of stylish characters who appear from his radio to jolt him back to life. The show is a love letter to Louis Jordan, a musician whose distinct take on jazz helped inspire stars like James Brown, B.B. King and Elvis Presley. As Jordan's songs explode from the speakers, the cast will shake the floorboards and turn the blues into bliss. Tickets for the show are $50-$127.
Saturday-Sunday: With a roster of nearly 60 vendors, the Emporiyum has managed to assemble a mouthwatering lineup despite a relatively brief track record (the first one was held in Baltimore this spring). But the purpose of the market is not for visitors simply to walk away stuffed and happy, but also snag gifts and goods for your pantries. The Emporiyum is part of Fifth Street Folly, a weekend-long street party hosted by Union Market. The other events include Thread, the market’s recurring fashion bazaar; a beer garden from Bluejacket brewery and Red Apron Butchery; and a Gilt City warehouse sale. The event, Saturday and Sunday at 500 Penn St. NE, on the Union Market campus, is $20 a day for general admission; $40 for VIP, which includes food from Union Kitchen Catering, early access to vendors, specialty cocktails and a gift bag.
Saturday: The National Championship of Lady Arm Wrestlers takes place Saturday night, right here in D.C. It promises to be an excellent use of your discretionary income, as all proceeds from the event will go to Miriam’s Kitchen, which works to alleviate the plight of D.C.’s homeless. The competition – four rounds, in which 16 women go arm-to-arm until a champion emerges – is very much for real, but the atmosphere is humorously theatrical. Each competitor adopts a persona (for instance, D.C.’s own representative will be “Jackie O’Nasty”) and brings an entourage, who are there both to add to the fun and the fund-raising. The event will be held at H Street Atlas Theater. Doors open at 7 p.m. and the arm-wrestling starts at 8 p.m. Tickets are $20 in advance and $25 at the door.
Sunday: The dropping temperatures make this the perfect time for some chilling electronic music. Brighton, England's Gazelle Twin has proved to be an exciting new entity: Elizabeth Bernholz's voice easily shifts from angelic to demonic, but the music stays sinister. Her intensely compelling new album, "Unflesh," continues her journey into musically unsettling territory. The show Sunday gets going at  8 p.m. at the Black Cat; tickets are $12.

Jerry Blevins did not bring his amazing cat sweater to Japan(Kyodo News/AP)
It’s been an exciting few weeks for Jerry Blevins and his 22,000 Twitter followers.
First, the Nationals reliever was named to Sports Illustrated’s Twitter 100 . Then he shared an amazing photo of a cat sweater , with Peruvian buttons, purchased at the Mall of America. And then he went to Japan with fellow major leaguers to play in the Japan All-Star Series.
Before he left, Blevins chatted with the Nationals’ Amanda Comak about his previous trip to Japan with the A’s in 2012, preparing to pitch competitively in November and, of course, his sweater.
This is the only thing I bought on a trip to mall of america. For real. Remember @DanaEveland ? pic.twitter.com/o2LxrMNu4g
— Jerry Blevins (@JerryBlevins_13) November 5, 2014
“I will not be bringing it to Japan,” Blevins said. “It’s a purchase that I’m proud of and I break it out probably once a year. The back of it has little paw prints so it’s pretty nice. I don’t know if you can tell, there are yarn balls the little cats are playing it. The string that connects that is an actual string.”
I had not noticed the string. Anyway, Blevins worked one inning in the MLB All-Stars’ 8-7 win over Hanshin-Yomiuri in an exhibition game Tuesday that preceded the five-game all-star series. Blevins walked one, struck out one and allowed one run. He did not pitch in Game 1 of the series on Wednesday in Osaka.
Thursday was a travel day for Blevins and his teammates, who took a side trip to Kyoto before heading to Tokyo for Game 2. Blevins, who has been tweeting throughout the trip, said he enjoyed the best ramen of his life in Osaka.

Bucs McCoy: Williams one of NFLs bestBy Mike Jones November 13 Follow @mikejoneswapo

Left tackle Trent Williams will see a familiar face on the other side of the ball on Sunday as he and his teammates face his former college teammate, defensive tackle Gerald McCoy and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers .
Tampa Bay drafted McCoy out of Oklahoma with the third overall pick of the 2010 draft , and Washington took Williams with the very next pick.
Both have established themselves as two of the better players at their respective positions, each making the Pro Bowl both in 2012 and 2013.
McCoy says in his eyes, Williams is more than just one of the most talented left tackles in the league, however.
“Well, I personally believe that Trent is not just one of the best left tackles, but one of the best overall linemen in the NFL on both sides of the ball,” McCoy said on conference call with Redskins reporters. “Even though I think he weighed in at 318, 320 or something like that and ran a 4.81 [40-yard dash]. I mean, that’s rare athleticism and he is stronger than people think and he is a very smart guy. So when you face him, you know you’ve got to bring it all game because he can hurt you in many ways. I’ve watched him since college when we went together. I mean he played center, guard and tackle, so with a guy with experience like that, he can definitely be scary for an opposing defensive lineman.”

McCoy said he learned early in his college career that Williams was not your typical offensive lineman.
“First time I found out Trent was faster than me, we were all freshman and Trent was a bigger guy before he started losing weight and I didn’t know he could run like that. So all the linemen got out there – all the smaller guys did a little race, it was quick, like 20 yards – so all the lineman got out there and Trent beat everybody and everybody was like, ‘Come on, man.’ And I kept on like, ‘No, no, y’all are cheating me.” And then we got out there and did it again and he won again and I was like, ‘Man, maybe this dude is fast.’ Then we ran our 40s and his time was faster than mine. I said, ‘Yeah, he just can run.” He is one of those rare athletic big guys from Texas and that’s what his trademark is – his speed.”

5 minutes with LL Cool JBy Helena Andrews November 13 Follow @helena_andrews

When he struts onto the stage Wednesday night, the polite clapping quickly turns up a few decibels. Did someone just faint in her in floor-length gown? Now, folks are screaming. We’re talking the type of high-pitched  squeals you’d hear at a One Direction concert, not at a black tie gala for a well-respected scholarship fund.
Then again the man standing at the podium in the tailored tux and black flat cap is LL Cool J, the rapper slash actor as famous for his legendary lyrics as he is for licking his lips at just the right moment.
LL (real name James Todd Smith), host of the Thurgood Marshall College Fund’s annual fundraiser at the Washington Hilton, took the surround sound in stride. Throughout the night, which raised $4.1 million, LL — or is it Mr. Cool J? – seemed to play coy with his celebrity (it’s about the kids!), so much so that we almost couldn’t get him to agree to an interview.
You’ve hosted the Grammys twice now. Why was it important to be here, in front a decidedly much smaller crowd, tonight? 
The great equalizer, not only in this country but in the world, is education, right? It really does separate the saints from the ‘aints. Yet some kids don’t see college as a possibility, you know what I mean? I had to support something like that.
You talked about being a “corner kid” on Long Island with the baggy pants and the whole nine.
You have kids on the corner, and people think that they’re hopeless, that they’ll never make it, that they’ll never amount to anything, that they can never take their lives to the next level simply because of their environment, their circumstances and their history. But these are the kinds of organizations that prove that to be a myth.
And if you had gone to college instead of landing a record deal at 16, what would you have majored in?
You know my life…I’m a life-long learner. I guess you can call me like an autodidact. I just keep learning over and over  again. But for kids out there one of the most important things for them to learn is history. History gives you the ability to identify the patterns that exist in society and navigate through.
So… history?
I think history would have been a big part of it. I don’t know if it would’ve been [my] major though, it’d probably have been minor. [He licks his lips, we temporarily black out] But I did get an honorary doctorate from Northeastern, so that’s pretty good — Dr. LL Cool J.
That brings me to my next question. What exactly should people call you, LL, Mr. Cool, Dr. J?
People call me LL. Dr. J’s already taken. It’s been a minute,  but it’s still taken. It’s like a number getting retired, you know what I mean?
Last month you tweeted that you might be starring in a new Marvel Comics movie. Will your next title be Captain Something or Other? Can you tell we don’t read comic books?
You know… we’ll see.
