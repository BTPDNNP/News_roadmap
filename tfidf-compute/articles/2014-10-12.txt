One-day cricket
West Indies will look to repeat Kochi performance where it raised memories of glory days
After the exploits of Kochi, they must have rekindled some fond memories among the gray-haired fans of West Indies cricket from the 60s and 70s.
‘Caribbean charmers’ was a flawed description of what, at best, was a destructive force. Oppositions were crushed and crushed consistently.
Yet, West Indies was the most sought after team, commanding a high fee, ruling world cricket with its aggressive brand of cricket, entertaining when not bowling, giving the game a new dimension and direction.
Shades of that old world charm, not the romance that marked the cricket of the three Ws (Worrell, Weekes and Walcott), but the sheer professionalism that the likes of Gary Sobers, Clive Lloyd and Viv Richards brought to the middle, were noticed in the thunderous victory in the first ODI of the current series.
Embarrassed
The complacent Indians were swept off their feet and left deeply embarrassed, something they have come to encounter and absorb quite frequently in recent times.
Nothing worked for India; neither the home conditions, nor the tumultuous state of the opposition, scalded by long-standing pay related issues. The West Indians remained remarkably impervious to the extraneous challenges that confronted them on the eve of the series.
Someone they trusted seemed to have let them down but the players stayed calm and channelised their strength to their advantage.
The team found its hero in Marlon Samuels, who had his heroes in Lloyd and Richards. And India suffered, as it would when Lloyd and Richards, top draw stroke-makers, flayed them mercilessly nearly three decades ago.
West Indies is often described as an unpredictable side, capable of frittering away winning positions.
The best teams can experience such low moments that occur more in limited-over cricket. Not that India was in a position to dictate in the last contest at Kochi but there was a distinct lethargy and shocking indifference in the manner in which some batsmen got out, Ambati Rayudu in particular.
The bowlers were no different as they sprayed the ball and pursued a poor line of attack. Mohit Sharma, Amit Mishra and Mohammad Shami were clobbered by Samuels, whose domineering knock exposed the Indian attack. And not for the first time!
The stiff target then bared the lack of depth in the batting camp with Virat Kohli a sore sight, perishing in a style so starkly close to his dismissals on the English tour this summer.
When Sunil Gavaskar reckons he has some technical issues that beg rectification, then Kohli is on a difficult pitch.
Playing at home may be a comforting thought for this talented run-getter, but he needs to match the faith reposed in him with deeds that justify his reputation in world cricket.
His list of failures is a serious cause of concern for the Indian camp in view of the upcoming World Cup.
The Kotla is likely to present a run-feast on Saturday if one believes the curator.
Old-timers in the galleries would remember one shot that Richards produced on a cold December day in a Test, only his second, here in 1974.
The ball was dispatched to the adjacent Ambedkar Stadium as he stepped out majestically to a spinner.
The audience stood enraptured, for Richards had produced a one-day-like knock (192 not out) in a five-day contest. Those were the heady days of West Indies cricket.
Kochi saw snatches of them. And West Indies did not even miss Chris Gayle and Sunil Narine, the two most appealing characters of contemporary world cricket.

Public funds and image-buildinggovernment
The use of government advertising as a tool for political propaganda, especially during election time, has been a key concern in many democracies. Given the role of the state in India as a controller of the fortunes of many publications dependent on advertising revenue, it is inevitable that in the name of disseminating information about government performance and programmes, many a regime makes use of official advertising to drive home politically loaded messages, focus on personalities and give the impression that huge allocations of budgetary resources and framing of policies and schemes are solely because of particular leaders. The lack of guidelines relating to the content of government advertisements works against the public interest in two ways: firstly, public funds could be misused by releasing information and announcements in a politically partisan way so that the gains of publicity rebound to the ruling party or a reigning leader; secondly, the generous use of advertisements as an incentive to select media houses in return for favourable coverage. While in normal circumstances ruling parties tend to use advertising as a site for self-glorification, in the run-up to elections it could be a form of electioneering that is free of cost. The Supreme Court, which appointed a three-member committee last April to frame appropriate guidelines, will soon consider the panel’s report. As an institution that has been keeping a close watch on the purity of the election process, the court is making a serious effort to ensure that public funds are not used for partisan ends.
In its short but meaningful report, the panel, comprising jurist N.R. Madhava Menon, former Lok Sabha Secretary-General T.K. Viswanathan, and senior advocate Ranjit Kumar, has recommended that advertisement material be objective and not directed at promoting the ruling party’s interests. The recommended guidelines bar lapses in political neutrality and the projection of a positive impression of the party in power or negative impression of those critical of the government. The panel has counselled against mentioning the party in power by name and attacks against the views of the opposition. It seeks to prohibit party symbols, logos or flags, or any links to websites of political parties and politicians. The panel disfavours use of government advertising aimed at favourable coverage for the party or person in power. If these guidelines are accepted by the Supreme Court and laid down as law, they could serve as effective curbs on the misuse of the government’s advertisement machinery. That day will mark one more step in preventing the misuse of public office for partisan ends, as well as in protecting the purity of the electoral process.

Shiv Sena MPs boycott launch of Saansad Adarsh Gram YojanaShiv Sena MPs boycott launch of Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana
Sanjay Jog | Mumbai Oct 11, 2014 09:27 PM IST
All 18 Lok Sabha members of the Shiv Sena on Saturday skipped the launch of Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana (SAGY) by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
This was the first official function after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on September 25 broke its 25-year-old alliance with the Sena over sharing of seats in the Assembly elections. The Sena has not yet asked its lone minister Anant Geete to resign from the Modi ministry. Besides, Uddhav has declared that the Sena won’t leave the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) unilaterally, citing it had worked hard for the landmark success in the Lok Sabha polls.
A Sena leader, who did not want to be named, told Business Standard: “We are hurt after the BJP ditched us. Alliance between the Sena and BJP was based on Hindutva. There was no point in party MPs attending the function when relations have become bitter between the two parties. Besides, all MPs are busy in campaign in their respective constituencies.''  He said the rapprochement won't be possible so soon, especially when the BJP severed its ties thinking that the Sena is weak.
The leader said party chief Uddhav Thackeray has already ruled out the possibility of a post-poll alliance with the BJP, in the event of fractured mandate.
The boycott happened at a time when Thackeray is stepping up his attack on Modi on the issue of Maharashtra's bifurcation. He attacked Modi for focusing on Maharashtra polls, when the country is facing crisis at the borders. Thackeray's barbs forced Modi to clarify that he won’t allow division of the state till the time he is the prime minister.
On cross border attacks, Modi said the issue should not be politicised, as the Indian army was giving a befitting reply to Pakistan.
Further, Uddhav blasted BJP president Amit Shah for equating the Sena with a rat. Uddhav said that foreign attackers always mistook people of Maharashtra to mice and they always proved wrong.
“We made a tiger out of a rat and that tiger is now trying to scare us. But now we need to show these rats their place,” Shah had said at a party rally. However, Uddhav taunted Shah that even Afzal Khan had called Chhatrapati Shivaji a ‘rat’, when he attacked Maharashtra in 17th century. “Someone had called us a rat. Even Khan had come with large number of soldiers. Let me remind that despite all that, Shivaji killed him,” Uddhav added.

Pakistan Taliban condemns awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to Malala YousufzaiPakistan Taliban condemns awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to Malala Yousufzai
IANS | Islamabad Oct 11, 2014 11:52 AM IST
Members of Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan's (TTP) offshoot Jamat-ul-Ahrar has condemned the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to Malala Yousufzai, calling her an 'agent of kuffar (disbelievers)'.
Jamat-ul-Ahrar's spokesman Ehsanullah Ehsan and other members together Friday posted comments on Twitter about Malala and the award, stating that she did not represent Islam, Dawn online said.
Ehsanullah threatened that fighters would continue to strike people who took what to them was anti-Islamic positions.
Pakistani girl child education campaigner Malala Yousufzai and Indian child rights activist Kailash Satyarthi were awarded the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize by the Norwegian Nobel Committee for their struggle against the suppression of children and young people and for the right of all children to education.
Malala, 17, was shot in the head by Taliban militants in October 2012 in her home town in Swat district due to her defiance of the Taliban's ban on girls' education.
The Pakistani Army announced last month that a group of ten Taliban militants, who were allegedly involved in attacking Malala Yousufzai, had been arrested by the security forces.
The arrested militants admitted that TTP chief Mullah Fazlullah plotted the attack on Malala.

MNS candidate could have committed rape after polls: RR Patil'MNS candidate could've committed rape after polls'
Yogesh Joshi , Hindustan Times  Pune, October 11, 2014

Comments
The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader and former home minister RR Patil while commenting on rival MNS candidate's criminal background said he should have committed rape at least after elections.
Patil's comments, caught on camera, sparked a major controversy with rivals lapping it up to turn the heat against Patil and NCP.
Patil has been facing a bitter electoral battle from Kawathe-Mahankal assembly constituency with BJP nominee Ajit Ghorpade posing a major challenge.
The controversial remarks made the by former home minister came on Thursday while he was addressing a public meeting in Kawathe-Ekand, in Sangli district.
In the meeting, Patil narrated morning's incident about his meeting with the supporters of Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) candidate Sudhakar Khade.
According to Patil, these supporters had come to extend their support as Khade was behind the bars facing rape and molestation charges.
Addressing the crowd, Patil said, "Supporters of MNS candidate had come to meet me to extend their support since their own candidate is behind bars. I told them, if he wanted to contest elections to become a legislator, he should have committed rape at least after the elections."
Realizing that his remarks may cause immense damage especially when assembly elections are just four days away, Patil expressed regrets. "My comments were of satirical nature. I regret if anyone feels hurt. I have no intentions to insult women."
Patil added saying his comments were directed at MNS candidate who has criminal background. Khade, a history sheeter is contesting elections on MNS ticket though he was previously with Shiv Sena. Khade was first accused of rape in 2007. In 2011, he was charged in another rape and molestation case.
Criticizing Patil, Sanjay Patil, a BJP MP from Sangli said, "People like Patil have always taken names of Shahu-Phule-Ambedkar. Today they have been exposed before the society."
Found cornered over party nominee's criminal background, MNS leader Bala Nandgaonkar said, "Person at stature of RR Patil should have thought twice while commenting against MNS candidate who has been falsely implicated in criminal cases."
Previously too Patil was surrounded by controversy when his remarks in the aftermath of 26/11 Mumbai drew severe criticism. Patil was accused of downplaying the severity of attacks saying, "In big cities like this, small things do happen." His comments attracted flack eventually forcing him to resign as home minister.

Naomi Campbell congratulates  malaria  for Nobel Peace PrizeNaomi Campbell congratulates 'malaria' for Nobel Peace Prize

print
English supermodel Naomi Campbell's tweet congratulating 'malaria' for winning the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize has gone viral on social media.
Campbell was apparently meaning to wish Pakistani girls' education activist Malala Yousafzai, but the message backfired when she wrote the word 'malaria' instead of Malala, Dawn online reported Saturday.
According to the report, Campbell had originally posted the message on her Instagram Saturday, but it also automatically went to her Twitter account.
She also misspelt Nobel as 'noble' but that could be an error due to the auto-correct feature available in smartphones.
While people were quick to notice the slip-up, Campbell had apparently not noticed for hours after posting her message as the mistake was not corrected.
"Naomi Campbell calls Malala, malaria. Maybe because she comes from the SWAT region in Pak," tweeted @ajith27.

Om Prakash Chautala surrenders at Tihar jailComments
Former Haryana chief minister and INLD chief Om Prakash Chautala on Saturday surrendered at Tihar jail a day after the Delhi High Court asked him to do so for misusing bail conditions by campaigning for assembly polls in Haryana.
Chautala, who was on bail, surrendered around 8:40 pm and was sent to jail number two where he was earlier lodged.
The Delhi High Court had on Friday ordered him to surrender by Saturday, making it clear that it would not entertain any plea on extension of time for surrender.
A top Tihar official said 7 pm is the “lock out time” and as Chautala arrived almost one-and-a-half hours after the deadline, the authorities will report the matter to the court. The INLD leader went to jail on a white SUV accompanied by a number of supporters.
Chautala was granted bail on medical grounds on May 21, 2013. Since then he has been out by extending the bail on the same ground.
Addressing the media earlier, Chautala alleged that the haste in sending him to prison was the BJP’s ploy and a result of the party’s insecurity about the coming assembly elections in Haryana.
 “The BJP was scared that people will vote in our favour if I campaign in the state. This is why they wanted me back in jail before the elections. However, this has irritated the people even more,” said Chautala.
A special CBI court had on January 22, 2013 convicted and sentenced Chautala, his son Ajay and eight others to 10-year jail term each for illegally recruiting 3,206 junior teachers in 2000. His appeal against the verdict is pending in the high court.

Modi by side  industrialists promise the moon for MPModi by side, industrialists promise the moon for MP
Manoj Ahuja , Hindustan Times  Indore, October 09, 2014
First Published: 15:34 IST(9/10/2014) | Last Updated: 20:49 IST(9/10/2014)
Comments
Some of India’s biggest companies pledged billions of dollars to build new power, telecoms and agro businesses in Madhya Pradesh on Thursday, an apparent vote of confidence in a state seeking to boost private investments to emerge from decades of poverty.
Responding to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call for investments, industry bigwigs Mukesh and Anil Ambani, Gautam Adani and Essar’s Shashi Ruia announced ambitious plans that could help create thousands of jobs for the youth in the state.
Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani not only promised to invest Rs. 20,000 crore, mostly in coal bed methane and retail projects in Madhya Pradesh by 2016, but also said the state would soon become the digital capital of India.
"By the middle of 2015, in 10 months from now, you can look forward to Madhya Pradesh being the digital capital of India," he said on the second day of the fourth Global Investors Summit (GIS) in Indore.
"I firmly believe that in today’s world to change our education, healthcare, government services, and financial infrastructure, digitisation is a prerequisite and to my mind digitisation also creates more jobs. So we look forward to working with people and small businesses of Madhya Pradesh."
Long held back by chronic poverty and lack of infrastructure, Madhya Pradesh is now India's fastest growing state with the government making efforts to improve ease of doing business. Besides building better infrastructure, the state is also moving to cut red tape.
But Madhya Pradesh has not realised all the past investment pledges at similar summits. At the last summit in 2012, investment pledges worth more than 3.77 lakh crore were made but less than half of that amount materialised, government figures showed.
Prime Minister Modi’s presence this year, though, appeared to deliver a shot in the arm for the state.
"This time around, the state government is focusing on creating the right environment for attracting investments and has only invited expression of intent (EoI) in different sectors," state chief secretary Anthony DeSa told Hindustan Times.
"The final figure of EoIs received during the three-day summit will be released on Friday, the concluding day of the summit."
Speaking on the occasion, ADAG chairman Anil Ambani too said his company had already invested Rs. 30,000 crore in Madhya Pradesh in coal, power, cement and telecoms business and aimed to take that investment to Rs. 60,000 crore by 2020.
Industrialist Gautam Adani too pledged to invest Rs. 20,000 crore in the state over the next five years in building world-class grain storage houses and power projects.
The Essar group, which has already invested in power, steel and BPO operations in the state, will invest an additional Rs. 4,000 crore in coal bed methane exploration, its chief Shashi Ruia said.
Welspun India promised an in investment of Rs. 5,000 crore in renewable power sector.
Talking to HT, Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) DG Chandrajit Banerjee said, "Today, what is more important is the way the Madhya Pradesh government has conducted this GIS. Unlike in the past, the companies have come and talked about hard investments and employment generation. So, this is much more concrete and definitive."

Rajan: We have political will to undertake financial reformsComments
Underscoring the need for financial sector reforms, Reserve Bank of India governor Raghuram Rajan has stressed that the “time to deliver begins now” and there is political will to undertake reforms and improve India’s economic growth.
“Financial reform is not difficult — we have the political will to improve,” the Indian Consulate here tweeted the RBI governor as saying during an event on Wednesday.
“Time to deliver begins now. We need to focus on deliverables,” another tweet quoting Rajan said.
The head of central bank addressed a select gathering of prominent and influential Indian-American businessmen from the finance and investment banking sector at an event organised by the Consulate General in collaboration with the India-America Chamber of Commerce.
Outlining the major areas that require change and immediate implementation, Rajan said it is a good time to invest in the Indian economy now.
Developing infrastructure, improving quality of human capital, optimum regulation for good business and extensive financial sector reform should be the next steps for improvement and development of the Indian economy, according a press statement issued by the Consulate.
Rajan encouraged the Indian-American business community to get involved in the “nitty gritty of the implementation process,” saying such involvement was not difficult especially since the Indian government has the political will to reform.
Rajan emphasised on the need to convert talk about change into delivering and implementing reforms, the statement said.
He also said stalled projects need to get back on track and “clearance should be from capital and on ground.”

Gaza war: Hints of change appear in Israel  ...You are here: Home > Collections > Israel
In wake of Gaza war, hints of change appear between Israel and Hamas
AP Oct 11, 2014, 06.34AM IST

Egypt
(Each side ends up more or…)
The wars between Israel and Hamas tend to be futile and frustrating for all. Each side ends up more or less where it began, having learned little, entrenched in its position, preparing for the next pointless, deadly round.
Cynicism seems reasonable in the Middle East, but this summer's Gaza war may prove an exception. Neither side seems able to dislodge the other, yet the situation is even more unbearable than before.
The shared need for change has nudged along a series of compromises that set the stage for a conference on Sunday in Cairo where world donors are expected to fork over billions of dollars for reconstruction in Gaza.
Hamas seems concerned about its standing with the people in Gaza, however cowed by authoritarian rule they might be. Thousands died in a war that started with the usual cycle of violent escalation and mutual recrimination but was certainly prolonged by the militant rulers of Gaza - and there is little to show for the sacrifice.
For Israel it's about world opinion, where a storm is brewing. Beyond horror at the devastation in Gaza there is growing impatience with the wider Israeli-Palestinian wrangle, a vexation made worse by Israel's continued settlement-building in the West Bank, in stark defiance of global opposition.
It's a rare confluence of interests that also draws in Western-backed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who needs to reverse the humiliating 2007 loss of the Gaza Strip, where his forces were expelled by Hamas militants with unbecoming ease.
After nine months of US-led peace talks with Israel collapsed earlier this year, Abbas set up a ``unity government'' with Hamas, linking Gaza with the West Bank autonomy enclaves set up in the 1990s. A nimbler Israeli leadership might have welcomed that move: Many had previously argued, logically enough, that concessions to Abbas were dangerous since he didn't speak for all Palestinians. Instead, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took to the airwaves calling on world leaders to shun the moderate Abbas for having allied himself with terrorists.
With the unity government blocked by Israel, its members unable to travel to Gaza, frustration grew. After a series of violent events in the West Bank and an Israeli arrest sweep of Hamas activists there, Hamas launched rocket attacks on Israel from Gaza. And despite several cease-fires, these did not stop until Israeli strikes left more than 2,100 Gazans dead, at least half and maybe more of them civilians. The seaside strip was in smoldering ruins.
Both sides claimed victory: Israel got the rockets to stop, and Hamas survived in power against an enemy whose army is one of the top forces in the world.
But no one is content with the situation.
Hamas is running out of money, has tens of thousands of homeless on its hands, and runs a territory not only blockaded by Israel from the land, sea and air, but also on the south by Egypt, whose new President Abdel-Fattah El-Sissi abhors the Muslim Brotherhood that spawned Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas seems lucky to be in power at all: The first Brotherhood offshoot to gain any power, it has seen sister movements rise all over the region during the Arab Spring only to be undone by a backlash.
  Israel, its economy slowed by the war, faces possible war crimes investigations. It says the military was as careful as possible given the need to stop rockets being fired from civilian areas. But that logic has trouble competing with the predicament of Gazans ruled by Islamic extremists they can hardly overthrow, under blistering air attacks.
Chastened, Netanyahu has unofficially but rather clearly backed off his opposition to the ``unity government.'' After all, Israel itself negotiated indirectly with Hamas in Cairo for weeks leading up to the cease-fire that finally took hold in late August.
Hamas, for its part, has understood that the world will not let it run the Gaza reconstruction. Too great is the fear that money will be diverted to line pockets and purchase more rockets. Hamas has agreed to give Abbas' West Bank-based government a real say in running the border crossings with the outside world and in seeing the aid to its ultimate destination.
The startling image of the week was the Abbas-appointed prime minister and his Cabinet colleagues, allowed to travel from West Bank to Gaza by Israel, touring areas where once they dared not tread, surrounded by Hamas security men linking arms to protect them. It was symbolic but somehow convincing: Thursday's inaugural meeting of the Palestinian unity government in Gaza.
Donors needed to see such images ahead of Sunday's aid conference in Cairo, where the Palestinians are hoping to raise $4 billion - the price tag Abbas' government has set on even minimally setting things right. There is a sense that world donors, from the West and from the Gulf, will largely come through.

Mukesh Ambani's twin kids Isha & Akash made directors of Reliance Jio Infocomm & Reliance Retail Ventures

(Ambani's twin kids Isha…)
MUMBAI: Gen Next is taking charge at Reliance Industries (RIL), India's biggest private company. Isha Ambani, 23, and twin brother Akash, the children of Nita and Mukesh Ambani , are joining the boards of Reliance Jio Infocomm and Reliance Retail Ventures, a wholly-owned subsidiary of RIL, as directors.
Older by seven minutes to his sister, Akash completed his undergrad studies from Brown University. Isha, once ranked by Forbes as among the world's top heiresses, studied at Yale and has a double major in psychology and South Asian studies. Until recently, she was a business analyst at McKinsey & Company's New York office. That stint was intended as preparation for an eventual role in RIL, especially their consumer businesses.
The timing of the inductions is interesting as RIL has been working towards a 2015 launch for its 4G telecom service and may invest as much as Rs 70,000 crore towards this end. Akash has already been associated with the telecom venture, involved in the development of products and digital applications.
Similarly, RIL's retail unit, which posted its first annual profit in the last fiscal year, has been focussing on improving profitability now that revenue growth has stabilized. As part of its efforts to boost margins, Reliance Retail Ltd shut "low-performing" stores across its different formats, the company told analysts post its last quarterly earnings release in July.
Reliance Retail's revenue grew 15% in the quarter ended June 30. During the quarter ended 30 June, Reliance Retail closed 137 stores under its so-called value format. It, however, opened 169 stores in high-margin or scalable categories. The net addition to stores during the quarter stood at 32.

One-day cricket
Delight for Mohammad Shami, heartbreak for Dwayne Smith
A purposeful chase by West Indies gave India some anxious moments, but Dwayne Bravo’s men lost direction and presented the match to the opposition in the second One-Day International at the Ferozeshah Kotla here on Saturday.
In a contest it dominated for a major part, West Indies suffered a 48-run defeat that left the series level at 1-1.
Confronted with a slow pitch and a disciplined attack, India managed a total that was hardly going to serve as a fighting target. That it became one was more due to West Indies’ generosity. Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina and M.S. Dhoni never took charge when it mattered and the lack of purpose in India’s batting stood out sorely.
But the West Indian response was sloppy and the result went much against the run of play.
From a sound position of 170 for two, in pursuit of 264 to win, West Indies contrived to lose the last eight wickets for a mere 45 runs as India, propelled by Mohammad Shami’s four wickets, hung in desperately in the middle overs.
Dhoni was at it with frequent bowling changes that kept the batsmen under pressure. It worked well as the batsmen generously gifted wickets away, the one that hurt most was opener Dwayne Smith falling three short of what would have been his second century in a 12-year career.
The Indian bowlers excelled in controlling the flow of runs while the West Indians played their part by indulging in some shockingly poor strokes.
The brilliant effort by Smith was wasted as he was let down by his colleagues and West Indies once again demonstrated the unpredictable aspect of its cricket. For the home team, the 105-run stand between Kohli and Raina for the fourth wicket provided an inspiring momentum.
Kohli and Raina have little in common when garnering runs. Aggression may mark their intuitive desire to dominate, but Kohli comes across as much-matured and assured in conditions that don’t test his skills outside the off-stump.
It was this flaw that hurt his reputation in England when the moving ball and the seaming one caused cheap downfalls in eight Test innings. This was not the platform that would elicit a comparison but it was a burden that weighed on his shoulders. His failures had begun to invite criticism, some of it carping, and it was time for him to step out and take charge.
Kotla, his home turf, was an ideal stage. The team management convinced Kohli to drop down the order. The move elevated his form to the extent that he scored a half-century, not fluent all the time, but certainly bearing the stamp of concentration. Curtailing his penchant for compulsive strokeplay, he came to terms with his game in the company of Raina, who has been enjoying a good run with the bat.
Raina was into his stride quickly but Kohli played the waiting game. He had no choice really. He had to play to his potential and eventually he did.
On a slow pitch strokemaking was always going to be an arduous job. The perils of playing a bit early meant the batsmen had to be judicious. Raina had no such issues but Kohli was in a different state. The move to bat a slot lower allowed him the chance to not only study the game but also face an older ball in the 13th over.
It helped. Kohli regained some confidence, watched Raina thrive at the other end, and joined him in a constructive stand that resurrected the Indian innings. But the pace suffered once Raina fell to an ambitiously lofted shot, the catch taken on the line.
Then Kohli’s dismissal dried the run-flow even as Dhoni made an effort. But this was not a pitch that encouraged strokes on the rise and both Raina and Kohli paid for the indiscretion. Dhoni adapted and made runs that counted. In the end they did as West Indies frittered the game away.

ITIs
(Apart from these, the Labour ministry,…)
NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi will launch a host of welfare schemes for the workers including portable PF account and a unified web portal for inspection of firms related to labour laws compliance on October 16.
"Prime Minister will preside over a function on October 16 to launch various facilities for workers including Universal Account Number (UAN) for EPFO subscribers and a web portal for centralised inspection of firms," a senior Labour Ministry official said.
Apart from these, the Labour ministry, in a bid to promote Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs), would felicitate some individuals who have passed out from these institutions and are holding some top positions in various companies.
Since the ITIs don't have branding, the ministry has identified them as brand ambassadors of the ITIs, the official said, adding this would give a positive branding of ITIs so that more people enroll themselves and take it as their first option.
Presently, engineering aspirants keep ITIs as their last choice after IITs, NITs, and various private engineering colleges.
The official said UAN will give the facility of collation of accounts, viewing of updated accounts as well as downloading the same and collation of pensionable service.
The UAN would be portable throughout the working career of members and can be used anywhere in India. Thus, workers in organised sector would not need to apply for transfer of PF account claim on changing jobs.
The EPFO is in the process of making UAN operational for its 4.17 crore contributing subscribers by October 15.
The EPFO had started the process of seeding the 4.17 crore UANs with subscribers bank account numbers, PAN, Aadhaar and other Know-your-Customers (KYC) details to improve the delivery of its services in July this year.
Besides this, the government will launch unified web portal LIN (Labour Identification Number) for simplifying business regulations and bring in transparency and accountability in labour inspections by various agencies and bodies under the administrative control of Labour Ministry.
The unified LIN web portal will operate through a unique LIN (Shram Pehchan Sankhya) for each employer. This web portal will provide for filing of single harmonised annual returns by the employers.
The employers will be allotted LIN after registration on web portal. The enforcement agency will upload the data of inspection on the web portal which will be updated periodically.
This portal would provide online reporting of harmonised inspection report by labour inspectors and inspecting officers of other bodies like EPFO administered by Labour Ministry. It will also provide for online grievance redressal system.
The Labour ministry will have a "Recognition of Prior Learning" scheme in which if somebody is somewhat skilled, but does not have any certificate, then the ministry will do a short gap analysis, take his test and he give the worker certification. This will be done for various sector workers, the official said.

Over two lakh evacuated in Andhra  Odisha as cyclone Hudhud intensifiesComments
Cyclone Hudhud is surging toward Visakhapatnam at 180 kmph and is expected to hit the coast at noon,  said officials on Sunday as thousands in Andhra Pradesh and Orissa braced for the tropical storm.
Heavy winds lashed Visakhapatnam coast as Hudhud lay 110 km southwest of the port city. “Pre-cyclonic conditions are quite active six hours before the landfall. Heavy winds are lashing Visakhapatnam and surrounding areas. Wind speed can go up to 200 kmph when it hits the land,” said director of the Cyclone Warning Centre Ramachandra Rao.
Andhra Pradesh and Odisha on Saturday started evacuating thousands of people as Hudhud barrelled towards the east coast states, furiously picking up pace. By Sunday morning, hours before it makes landfall in Visakhapatnam, it would have attained its top speed of 195kmph, the weather office warned.

Around 1.1 lakh people in Andhra and more than 26,000 in Odisha were evacuated on Saturday as it started raining heavily and the seas turned choppy. All fishing operations were suspended in six districts of Andhra and four of Odisha.
On Saturday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi chaired a high level emergency meeting to review preparedness. The National Crisis Management Committee also met after discussions with the chief secretaries of the two states.

Over two lakh people living in and around the vulnerable coastal districts of Andhra Pradesh and Odisha have been evacuated.
In Andhra, 370 relief camps have been opened in five districts - Srikakulam, Vizianagaram, Visakhapatnam, East Godavari and West Godavari - where 396 villages are likely to be affected.
In Odisha, officials have evacuated 360 members of the endangered Bonda tribe from their habitat in the Bonda Hills in Malkangiri district. The state government began evacuating people from vulnerable areas to minimise casualties even as two flights and 39 trains on the route were cancelled.
Odisha administration officials visited seaside villages urging people to move but many stayed put. The police did not force them on to buses heading towards some 300-odd storm shelters, unlike during Cyclone Phailin last year, which left close to 30 dead and displaced 400,000.
 
Cyclone Hudhud: Evacuation begins in Andhra, Odisha
Keeping in mind the safety of the passengers, several flights to and from Visakhapatnam to Bhubaneswar, Banglore, Hyderabad and Kolkata were cancelled on Saturday due to strong winds.
Railways have cancelled the movement of about 40 trains between Bhubaneswar and Visakhapatnam and diverted many trains to other routes for safety.
Tirupati-Bhubaneswar Express, Bangalore-Bhubaneswar Premium Special, Jagadalpur-Howrah Samaleswari Express, Bhubaneswar Junagarh Express, Visakhapatnam-Secunderabad Express, Visakhapatnam-Guntur Express and Tirupati-Visakhapatnam Express are some of the trains which have been cancelled as a precautionary measure, said a senior Railway Ministry official.

East Coast Railway has made elaborate arrangements to meet the situtation that could arise out of the cyclonic storm and heavy rains.
Hudhud is forecasted to maintain its intensity for up to six hours after landfall before gradually weakening into a cyclonic storm while moving across southern interior Odisha and Chhattisgarh, the Met said. It will bring heavy rain to west and east Godavari, Visakhapatnam, Vizianagaram and Srikakulam districts of Andhra and Ganjam, Gajapati, Koraput, Rayagada, Nabarangpur, Malkangiri, Kalahandi and Phulbani in Odisha in the next 48 hours. In addition, south Chhattisgarh and north Telangana will also receive rain.

The Centre has stationed 39 National Disaster Response Force teams comprising more than 1,680 rescuers along with 199 inflatable rubber boats in the two states and deployed 20 army rescue and engineering teams. The air force, navy and Coast Guard are also on standby.

Day after  Kailash Satyarthis NGO goes after child traffickerComments
As Nobel Peace Prize winner Kailash Satyarthi spent a busy Saturday meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi and giving interviews to the media, his Bachpan Bachao Andolan (BBA) was done celebrating and was back on the job, in hot pursuit of a big-time child trafficker from Jharkhand.

They’d already put off the planned raid by a day — having joined the 60-year-old in celebrating his joint Nobel with Pakistani teen and fellow child rights champion Malala Yousafzai — and couldn’t wait any more. On Saturday, they got in touch with the Delhi Police crime branch to make arrangements for the raid.
Read: Activists hope Nobel win will help put focus on child rights
HT is withholding the name of the trafficker and other related details to ensure the raid isn’t hampered in any way.
Activists with BBA believe taking him down will lead to more arrests, and to more minors being rescued. “The celebrations will continue but we can’t forget our basic work for which we have got the Nobel.
 This arrest might end up exposing a big racket and we are assisting the police to arrest him at the earliest,” said one activist.
The trafficking racket in Delhi is a steadily growing menace with victims — mostly minors and women — brought in from states like Jharkhand and West Bengal. Once in the city, they are pushed into child labour, illegal domestic work or prostitution by unscrupulous placement agencies.
“This particular trafficker is wanted in several cases of child trafficking,” a police officer said, adding that they got to know of him after the recent arrest of a former Jharkhand minister under the arms act. “The ex-minister was apparently hiding in his house and there is a possibility that traffickers are linked to a number of politicians,” the officer said.
Read: Modi felicitates Nobel winner Satyarthi
Other officers revealed the trafficker and his wife, who run an illegal placement agency in west Delhi, brought in minors on the pretext of getting them jobs and education. The couple’s name figured in a list provided by the Jharkhand CID last year of 240 illegal agents suspected of trafficking young girls from the state.
Sources said BBA had provided details of possible hideouts to the police, and would assist in the raid along with members of another NGO, Shakti Vahini.
“Met Nobel laureate Kailash Satyarthi ji & congratulated him,” Modi tweeted after the meeting. The BBA founder also received a call earlier in the day from BJP patriarch LK Advani.

MNS candidate could have committed rape after polls'MNS candidate could've committed rape after polls'
Yogesh Joshi , Hindustan Times  Pune, October 11, 2014
First Published: 16:05 IST(11/10/2014) | Last Updated: 00:58 IST(12/10/2014)
Comments
The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader and former home minister RR Patil while commenting on rival MNS candidate's criminal background said he should have committed rape at least after elections.
Patil's comments, caught on camera, sparked a major controversy with rivals lapping it up to turn the heat against Patil and NCP.
Patil has been facing a bitter electoral battle from Kawathe-Mahankal assembly constituency with BJP nominee Ajit Ghorpade posing a major challenge.
The controversial remarks made the by former home minister came on Thursday while he was addressing a public meeting in Kawathe-Ekand, in Sangli district.
In the meeting, Patil narrated morning's incident about his meeting with the supporters of Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) candidate Sudhakar Khade.
According to Patil, these supporters had come to extend their support as Khade was behind the bars facing rape and molestation charges.
Addressing the crowd, Patil said, "Supporters of MNS candidate had come to meet me to extend their support since their own candidate is behind bars. I told them, if he wanted to contest elections to become a legislator, he should have committed rape at least after the elections."
Realizing that his remarks may cause immense damage especially when assembly elections are just four days away, Patil expressed regrets. "My comments were of satirical nature. I regret if anyone feels hurt. I have no intentions to insult women."
Patil added saying his comments were directed at MNS candidate who has criminal background. Khade, a history sheeter is contesting elections on MNS ticket though he was previously with Shiv Sena. Khade was first accused of rape in 2007. In 2011, he was charged in another rape and molestation case.
Criticizing Patil, Sanjay Patil, a BJP MP from Sangli said, "People like Patil have always taken names of Shahu-Phule-Ambedkar. Today they have been exposed before the society."
Found cornered over party nominee's criminal background, MNS leader Bala Nandgaonkar said, "Person at stature of RR Patil should have thought twice while commenting against MNS candidate who has been falsely implicated in criminal cases."
Previously too Patil was surrounded by controversy when his remarks in the aftermath of 26/11 Mumbai drew severe criticism. Patil was accused of downplaying the severity of attacks saying, "In big cities like this, small things do happen." His comments attracted flack eventually forcing him to resign as home minister.

unrest, conflicts and war
Shattering two days of calm, firing resumed between Indian and Pakistani soldiers on Saturday along the LoC in Poonch district. According to Army officials, Pakistani troops started firing on forward posts in the Banwat area in Poonch around 1.15 p.m. “We retaliated heavily after our posts were attacked,” an Army officer told The Hindu. “There was no loss of life on our side.”
The official said the firing continued for five hours and lasted till about 6 p.m.
The firing was intended to abet infiltration into the Kashmir Valley before the winter snow rendered the borders inaccessible, he added.
Cross-border shelling over the past week has left eight persons dead and 90 wounded. More than 32,000 people have fled to relief camps.
The United Jihad Council, an umbrella body of 13 militant organisations in J&K, called for a unilateral ceasefire two weeks ago following the massive floods that devastated Srinagar and southern districts of the State. No major militant attacks have taken place since the ceasefire.

One-day cricket
Delight for Mohammad Shami, heartbreak for Dwayne Smith
A purposeful chase by West Indies gave India some anxious moments, but Dwayne Bravo’s men lost direction and presented the match to the opposition in the second One-Day International at the Ferozeshah Kotla here on Saturday.
In a contest it dominated for a major part, West Indies suffered a 48-run defeat that left the series level at 1-1.
Confronted with a slow pitch and a disciplined attack, India managed a total that was hardly going to serve as a fighting target. That it became one was more due to West Indies’ generosity. Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina and M.S. Dhoni never took charge when it mattered and the lack of purpose in India’s batting stood out sorely.
But the West Indian response was sloppy and the result went much against the run of play.
From a sound position of 170 for two, in pursuit of 264 to win, West Indies contrived to lose the last eight wickets for a mere 45 runs as India, propelled by Mohammad Shami’s four wickets, hung in desperately in the middle overs.
Dhoni was at it with frequent bowling changes that kept the batsmen under pressure. It worked well as the batsmen generously gifted wickets away, the one that hurt most was opener Dwayne Smith falling three short of what would have been his second century in a 12-year career.
The Indian bowlers excelled in controlling the flow of runs while the West Indians played their part by indulging in some shockingly poor strokes.

World s largest economies determined to sustain recoveryFinance ministers from the world's largest economies determined to sustain recovery
AP Oct 11, 2014, 10.26PM IST

G-20
(UK's George Osborne said…)
WASHINGTON: Finance ministers from the world's largest economies conveyed their determination Saturday to pursue policies that will prevent a slide into another global recession but at the same time expressed frustration that not all nations were pursuing the correct approaches.
Speaking to the policy-setting panel of the 188-nation International Monetary Fund , British Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne took note of the recent downgrades to global growth forecasts and said there was a need ``for further progress by policymakers to deliver a strong and sustainable global recovery.''
Brazil's Finance Minister, Guido Mantega , told the IMF group that the global recovery ``continues to create a sense of disillusionment,'' and he said the IMF had demonstrated ``an entrenched propensity to overstate prospects'' for growth in the world's largest economies.
In his remarks, US Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew pointedly complained that governments in Europe, Japan and China were failing to deliver needed support.
``European leaders should focus on recalibrating policies to address persistent demand weakness,'' Lew said.
The IMF panel and the steering committee of the World Bank were both scheduled to wrap up their discussions Saturday. Both groups were expected to address the growth slowdown as well as the Ebola crisis in West Africa.
Lew said Japan's outlook was uncertain with growth projected to remain weak this year and next. He said Japanese officials needed to carefully calibrate budget reductions and ``move decisively to implement requisite growth-boosting structural reforms.''
Lew said China's economy remained strong but risks had risen and the country needed to put more emphasis on consumption-led growth.
Lew did not mention Germany by name, but it was clear that his remarks on Europe focused on that nation's reluctance to do more to stimulate growth. ``Countries with external surpluses and fiscal flexibility'' needed to do more to boost growth, he said. Germany, Europe's largest economy, ran a large trade surplus last year.
Even some of Germany's European partners have said countries in the 18-nation eurozone should shift away from the deficit-cutting policies Germany has championed and boost investment spending to avoid being stuck in Japanese-style stagnation.
It was against that background that G-20 finance ministers and central bank presidents met for two days of talks that wrapped up Friday in advance of the IMF-World Bank meetings.
After those discussions, the ministers unveiled plans for a global initiative to build roads, ports, railways and other infrastructure projects to help boost world growth by $2 trillion over the next five years and create millions of jobs.
The Group of 20 was being led this year by Australia, which was scheduled to host a leader's summit next month in Brisbane. Australian Treasurer Joe Hockey , who chaired the finance discussions, told reporters that the plan the G-20 developed involved more than 900 individual initiatives with the potential to lift growth by 1.8 percent over the next five years. He said details would be disclosed at the leaders' summit.
While developing the five-year plan for infrastructure projects, the G-20 financial officials were less successful in their efforts to deal with immediate threats from slowdowns in Europe, Latin America and China. The group did not issue a communique, but individual ministers said economic problems were discussed in the G-20 sessions.
``We as a group do not want to settle for mediocre growth,'' Canadian Finance Minister Joe Oliver told reporters after the end of the G-20 sessions. ``We don't think we have to.''

The INLD chief has been sent to jail number two where he was lodged earlier.
INLD chief and former Haryana Chief Minster Om Prakash Chautala on Saturday surrendered at Tihar jail a day after the Delhi High Court asked him to do so for misusing bail conditions by campaigning for Assembly polls in the State.
Chautala, who was on bail, surrendered at 8.40 p.m. IST and was sent to jail number two where he was lodged earlier.
On Friday, the Delhi High Court had ordered him to surrender by Saturday, making it clear that it would not entertain any plea on extension of time for surrender.
A top Tihar official said 7 p.m. IST is the “lock out time” and as Chautala came almost one and half hours after the deadline, the authorities will report the matter to the court. The INLD leader came to the jail on a white SUV accompanied by a number of supporters.
Chautala was granted bail on medical grounds on May 21, 2013 and since then he has been out by extending it on the same ground.
A special CBI court had on January 22, 2013 convicted and sentenced Chautala, his son Ajay Chautala and eight others to 10 years in jail each for illegally recruiting 3,206 junior teachers in 2000. His appeal against the verdict is pending in the High Court.
A trial court had on Friday rejected Chautala’s plea seeking exemption from personal appearance and permission to take part in ongoing Haryana election campaign.
Among other convicts, 44 were sentenced to four years in jail and one given a five-year jail term.
All of them were held guilty of cheating, forgery, using fake documents as genuine, conspiracy under IPC and of abusing their official position under Prevention of Corruption Act.

Financial markets have been priced for a perfect mix of steady economic growth and strong profits. And this week, the world economy looked far from perfect.
That was the unnerving reality behind a whipsaw week on Wall Street that caused drastic swings in the global markets for stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities like oil. The pattern continued Friday with a 1.2 percent decline in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, with all the losses concentrated in the last two hours of the trading day.
The overall results for the week were hardly disastrous: The S&P closed the week down only 3.1 percent, and it is still up for the year. Oil prices closed the week at a four-year low, which, if anything, should prove welcome news for U.S. consumers. A measure of how much stock market volatility investors expect in the future is still below its January level.
But the week's zigs and zags were a reminder that, after several years of strong gains, the prices for stocks and a wide range of other assets, like junk bonds and commercial real estate, are at the high end of their historical levels, relative to fundamentals. Those valuations will prove justified only as long as the global economy continues to improve steadily. And the week was filled with suggestions that it may not, especially outside the United States.
Evidence that the global economy may be stalling has jarred prominent economists and policymakers gathered in Washington for the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. At a conference Thursday, Lawrence H. Summers, the former U.S. Treasury secretary who now teaches at Harvard, highlighted this concern.
"The defining challenge of our time, economically, is secular stagnation," he said. "It is the risk of inadequate growth, leading to inadequate potential, leading to inadequate growth."
Perhaps the most disconcerting aspect of the turbulence in the markets is that it was not driven by some single piece of surprising news but rather by a slow gathering of evidence that the global economic outlook was gloomier than it had seemed.
The IMF this week marked down its forecast for economic growth and said there was an increased chance of a European recession during the next year. The fund sharply lowered its projection for 2014 economic growth in Japan, the world's third-largest economy, from July's estimate. And German industrial production fell 4 percent in August, the biggest monthly drop in five years, according to data released this week.
"When you get such subpar growth, it doesn't take much to push individual economies - and the global economy - back into a downturn," said Stephen S. Roach of the Jackson Institute for Global Affairs at Yale. "That's what investors are grappling with right now."
The situation that seems to concern investors the most is the threat of deflation - falling prices - which central banks are still struggling to avert after years of extraordinary efforts to grease the wheels of global commerce. While many of the headlines this week focused on the ups and downs of the stock market, the real action was in a wide range of indicators that pointed to falling prices and weakening demand.
On commodity markets, the selling was furious for much of the week. Oil is now 19 percent cheaper than on June 30 and corn is down 35 percent since the spring. U.S. Treasury bonds now yield a mere 2.3 percent, down from 3 percent at the start of the year - even though the Federal Reserve is winding down its program of buying trillions of dollars in bonds and intends to raise interest rates next year.
Based on bond prices, investors now expect inflation in the U.S. of only 1.6 percent annually over the next five years. German inflation is now priced in at only 0.4 percent. Both are well below the target of about 2 percent that central bankers on both sides of the Atlantic aim for.
It is a reversal of the problems that have haunted the world economy over decades past.
After years of economic policy focused on ensuring that inflation and budget deficits did not become too high, policymakers now are grappling with a situation in which they are at risk of becoming too low.
  Central banks, after years of ultralow interest rates, are finding themselves with limited tools to do much to encourage higher inflation. This week, the leaders of both the IMF and of the European Central Bank, known for their commitment to fiscal caution, encouraged Germany and other countries with the room to do so to spend more money to help encourage growth.
In part thanks to the efforts of the global central banks, prices for stocks and other financial assets have been on an upward tear for more than five years, with the S&P 500 index up 182 percent since March 2009. But valuations of many assets are now relatively high, even as the global economy remains somewhat shaky.

Without RIL s wealth  I wouldn t have been able to pursue my passion: Nita Ambani(Without the wealth I would…)
Nita Ambani talks about her pet ventures. Excerpts from an interview with ET Magazine:
On the interest in sports, first cricket and then football:
I will be honest. I got involved (in football) only three months back. I lost my father recently. The first meeting on the football league was on the 13th day. Now everywhere I am surrounded by it. You know, honestly, I realized I didn't know anything about cricket when we started Mumbai Indians . I learnt by mistakes. In football too, we have a long journey ahead, the goal being that India plays the 2026 World Cup.
On her penchant for getting into details of projects:
I do get involved in a lot of detailing and I have learnt this from my husband Mukesh. It can have positives as well as negatives. Attention to detail can sometimes slow us down. For example, sometimes people ask me why aren't we building 15 Dhirubhai Ambani International Schools across the country. But while looking into detail, I like to empower our teams to take the decisions. And as Mukesh says, one needs to have both floodlights (for the big-picture view) and spotlights (for the nitty-gritty).
On what she has learnt from Mukesh Ambani and Dhirubhai:
From Mukesh, I have learnt two things: that we should not be afraid to make mistakes. You never get it right the first time, but you have to accept the mistake, work harder and move on. The second thing is you should never sacrifice quality. One more thing that I learnt from him is to respect every human being. I was 21 when I got married, and there was so much inspiration in my house from my father-in-law Dhirubhai Ambani and husband Mukesh. Living in the same house as my father-in-law, I could learn so many things. The main thing was positivity. He used to say that if you can keep your attitude positive, small issues will disappear.
On how her philanthropic focus juxtaposes with the wealth-creation machine that Reliance is:
Without the wealth I would not be able to pursue my passion (for philanthropy). And a big part of wealth creation is also creation of jobs — we (Reliance) are creating 1,25,000 jobs. Now with me on the board, where I represent the CSR part of Reliance, we are looking at how to lend scale to the CSR activities. I want to speed up the foundation work. Education can be scaled up. With Reliance Jio coming in, we can somehow make healthcare available on the phone.

Ebola News Guide: Deaths keep rising; world reactsmedical conditions
American Marines scrambled to add Ebola treatment beds in Liberia on Friday, while the U.S. and Britain readied new disease screenings for passengers arriving at their airports from West Africa. Doctors tried out experimental drugs in a global battle against the deadly sickness.
The U.N. said nations must all work together and fast or “the world will have to live with the Ebola virus forever.”
The death toll in West Africa passed 4,000 for the first time in the World Health Organization’s count of confirmed and suspected Ebola cases.
As worry ricocheted around the globe, medical records obtained by The Associated Press underscored questions about the United States’ front-line defenses. The Dallas hospital that initially missed the nation’s first Ebola diagnosis put a Liberian man through a battery of tests and CT scans for appendicitis, stroke and other serious ailments before sending him home, the records show.
Before he was released, Thomas Eric Duncan’s fever spiked to 103 degrees, he reported severe pain and told a nurse that he’d recently come from Africa. But doctors didn’t think of Ebola until he returned to the hospital two days later by ambulance. On Wednesday, Duncan became the first person to die of Ebola in the United States.
Questions linger about the readiness of the medical system in Spain, too.
Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy’s motorcade was jeered by health care workers when he made a surprise visit Friday to the Madrid hospital where a nursing assistant is lying sick with Ebola, which she apparently caught while treating a patient infected in West Africa. Unions and opposition politicians said the national health care system didn’t give medical workers the proper training and protective gear.
At the United Nations, the focus was on the three countries where the virus is multiplying out of control Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.
“As long as there is one case of Ebola in any one of these countries, no country is safe from the dangers posed by this deadly virus,” said Anthony Banbury, who heads the new United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response.
A guide to development around the globe —
On the ground
The U.S. military is rushing to set up a 25-bed hospital in Liberia for health workers who catch the disease. Because Ebola is spread by bodily fluids such as blood and urine, West African doctors and nurses are especially vulnerable to infection at a moment when their nations need them desperately.
Rear Adm. Scott Giberson, the acting U.S. deputy surgeon general, said the facility would be ready within weeks.
“We have experience deploying in lots of medical settings,” Mr. Giberson said. “However, this is unique.”
In addition to the hospital, a vanguard of Marines brought aircraft this week that will help ferry construction supplies for 17 treatment units with 100 beds each, to be finished by the end of November.
The total American forces responding to the crisis may reach 4,000, U.S. officials said.
At big U.S. airports
New York’s Kennedy International was slated to begin checking some arriving passengers on Saturday for fever, which could be a sign of Ebola but also is common with many other illnesses.
Passengers travelling from Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea are to be screened using no-touch thermometers. Over the next week, the screenings will expand to Newark Liberty, Washington Dulles, Chicago O’Hare and Hartsfield-Jackson in Atlanta. Together, those airports receive more than 90 percent of passengers from the three nations.
A U.S. citizen who presents a heightened risk of disease upon arrival at the United States has a legal right to re-enter the country and be safely quarantined, said Lawrence Gostin, a public health law expert at Georgetown University. That same guarantee would not apply to non-U.S. citizens, but as a practical matter, giving them immediate treatment might be safer than putting them on a plane back home.
British authorities announced their own plans to impose enhanced screening at Heathrow and Gatwick airports, as well as Eurostar rail terminals. Prime Minister David Cameron’s office said passengers arriving from West Africa would be questioned about their travels and contacts.
The hunt for a cure
Texas Presbyterian, the Dallas hospital where Duncan died, said he became the first Ebola patient to receive the investigative antiviral drug Brincidofovir.
In Spain, nursing assistant Teresa Romero was to be treated with the experimental drug ZMapp, which is in extraordinarily short supply worldwide, a spokeswoman for Madrid’s regional health agency said.
Meanwhile, a possible Ebola vaccine developed by the U.S. government is being tested on up to 40 medical workers in the West African nation of Mali, which shares a border with Guinea. If safety tests go well, larger trials could be done in the outbreak zone early next year. The vaccine also is being safety tested in the United States and Britain.
A group of leading doctors published a letter in the journal Lancet on Friday, arguing that promising Ebola drugs should be tried in West Africa without randomized trials in which one group of patients receives a new drug or vaccine and another group receives standard care or a placebo so the results can be compared.
“We accept that RCTs (randomized controlled trials) can generate strong evidence in ordinary circumstances; not, however in the midst of the worst Ebola epidemic in history,” wrote the authors, including Dr. Peter Piot, director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.
The scientists propose different approaches to testing in this emergency, such as trying different experimental treatments at the same time at different sites.
A plea for faster action
The number of Ebola cases is probably doubling every three-to-four weeks, says the U.N. special envoy on Ebola, David Nabarro.
Without a mass mobilization of nations and relief groups to help West Africa, he told the U.N. General Assembly, “it will be impossible to get this disease quickly under control, and the world will have to live with the Ebola virus forever.”
The world’s response needs to be 20 times greater than it is now, Nabarro said.
Yet he said the United Nations is committed to rallying the response necessary to stop Ebola “within a matter of months a few months.”
Flying the nervous skies
Some joke.
A man on a flight from Philadelphia to the Dominican Republic apparently spoiled his own vacation by declaring aloud before the plane landed that he was sick with Ebola.
Video taken by passengers on Wednesday shows him being led off the plane by officials in blue hazmat suits.
The man, whose name was not released, was checked at the airport infirmary in the resort city of Punta Cana, Dominican officials said. Once it was determined that he didn’t have Ebola, the passenger was put on a plane back to the United States.

Guns remain silent on India-Pakistan borderdefence
An uneasy calm prevailed along the 192-km long International Border (IB) in Jammu region on Saturday as there has been no ceasefire violation by Pakistani troops since Thursday night.
Eight persons have been killed and nearly 90 others injured in mortar shelling and firing by Pakistan troops from October 1-9 along the IB in Jammu, Samba and Kathua districts forcing over 32,000 people from 113 border hamlets to flee.
“There have been no ceasefire violation from across the border along IB in Jammu region since Thursday night”, Divisional Commissioner, Jammu division, Shant Manu told PTI.
Mr. Manu said there was no firing and shelling by Pakistan along the borderline in Kathua, Samba and Jammu districts and there is peace along the border.
The last ceasefire violation took place on Thursday night when there was brief firing by Pakistan on four border out posts in Hiranagar sector of Kathua district.
“It was peaceful overnight after long spell of shelling and firing,” he said.
However, “people who have fled their homes in border areas will remain in shelter camps for the next few days until we are sure about prospects of peace along the border,” he said.
“We are watching the situation along the IB carefully”, a senior BSF officer said, adding a round-the-clock vigil is being maintained.
“We cannot read what is in the mind of Pakistan. Border people will have stay back in camps. We cannot trust people across”, District Magistrate, Jammu, Ajeet Kumar Sahu said.
Residents of border villages in Jammu, who were displaced due to the recent Pakistani shelling, say they are too scared to return home despite the guns falling silent.
“We don’t trust Pakistan anymore. They have killed innocent civilians by targeting villages. Who knows... This decline in shelling from their side might be a ploy to cause maximum damage after people return to their houses,” Ravinder Kumar, a resident of Abdullian village which is situated along the International Border, said.
“Returning to our houses right now means risking our lives. We don’t trust the Pakistani side anymore,” said Tarsem Singh, a resident of Arnia who shifted to Jammu city.

Pressure mounts on Casillas after latest blunderPressure mounts on Spain's Casillas after latest blunder
Reuters –  Fri 10 Oct, 2014

Iker Casillas takes his seat on the bench before Spanish first division soccer match …
MADRID (Reuters) - Once lauded as a goalkeeper who could do no wrong, Spain captain Iker Casillas's tarnished reputation suffered another blow when his error helped Slovakia claim a shock 2-1 win in Euro 2016 qualifying on Thursday.
Holders Spain had been looking to continue a rebuilding process after their failure at the World Cup finals in Brazil, where Casillas made a series of howlers.
However, they were undone in Zilina by a battling Slovakia side, who patiently waited their chance and struck on the counter attack three minutes from time.
Casillas, who led Spain to continental titles in 2008 and 2012 with a debut World Cup triumph in between, gifted the Eastern Europeans a 17th-minute lead when he flapped at Juraj Kucka's swerving free kick.
Despite dominating possession in customary fashion, Spain did not manage to breach the massed Slovakian lines until the 82nd minute through Paco Alcacer but were ultimately scuppered by Miroslav Stoch's late header.
It was La Roja's first defeat in a qualifier for the European Championship or World Cup since they were beaten by Sweden in October 2006.
It would be harsh to place the blame solely on the shoulders of Spain's most capped player for the defeat, particularly since he pulled off a brilliant one-handed save early on.
However, the captain's problems appear to be part of a wider malaise in a team that swept all before them under coach Vicente del Bosque over the past six years.
They looked toothless and predictable going forward, with Diego Costa, enjoying prolific form for Chelsea, again failing to score. The Brazil-born forward has yet to find the net for his adopted country in six appearances.
Questions may also be asked as to why Spain committed so many players forward after Alcacer's leveller, leaving themselves exposed at the back, rather than settling for the point they probably deserved.
Del Bosque decided to stay on as coach after the humiliation in Brazil and has brought in several new faces but the impression remains that he needs to do more if Spain are to return to the kind of form that made them close to unbeatable.
The former Real Madrid coach predictably defended Casillas but calls will grow for young pretender David De Gea, who has performed well for Manchester United, to be handed the gloves.
"He (Casillas) saved us from a possible Slovakia goal," Del Bosque told a news conference after the Group C defeat.
"I didn't see the goal all that well but the ball definitely did something strange and deceived the keeper."
Slovakia's victory, which prompted wild celebrations among their players and fans, put them top of the group with a maximum six points from two matches, with Spain, Ukraine and Macedonia all on three in joint second.
Spain's next match is in Luxembourg on Sunday and three points would put them back on track as they seek to secure a place in the tournament in France in two years' time.
"We are only at the second matchday and there is nothing decided yet," Del Bosque noted.
"Slovakia are top of the group but there are plenty of matches left to turn the situation around," he added.

CHENNAI: An end to the 38-day old strike by contract workers of Neyveli Lignite Corporation remained elusive as talks held here today between the representatives of unions and top management to break the impasse failed to yeild any positive result.
The talks between the mangement and the 11 associated unions were held in the presence of NLC Chairman and Managing Director Surendar Mohan for several hours here, Union sources said.
Emerging from the meeting, Shanmugam , Leader of Labour Progressing Front , said, "the unions staged a walkout as the management offered an increase of Rs 100 per day per labourer. We have clearly told them that it is not acceptable".
"The talks were held for several hours. But, the management is not ready to accept the demands by the workers," he said.
However, NLC's General Manager, Balaji said the management has made the best offer for the workers.
"According to us, We have made the best offer to them. It is a very good package offered to them. Earlier the package (for the contract labourers was Rs 370. We have said it will be increased to Rs 470. Apart from that we have also informed them that we will give paid holiday for the labourers," he told reporters.

MUMBAI: Gen Next is taking charge at Reliance Industries (RIL), India's biggest private company. Isha Ambani, 23, and twin brother Akash, the children of Nita and Mukesh Ambani , are joining the boards of Reliance Jio Infocomm and Reliance Retail Ventures, a wholly-owned subsidiary of RIL, as directors.
Older by seven minutes to his sister, Akash completed his undergrad studies from Brown University. Isha, once ranked by Forbes as among the world's top heiresses, studied at Yale and has a double major in psychology and South Asian studies. Until recently, she was a business analyst at McKinsey & Company's New York office. That stint was intended as preparation for an eventual role in RIL, especially their consumer businesses.
The timing of the inductions is interesting as RIL has been working towards a 2015 launch for its 4G telecom service and may invest as much as Rs 70,000 crore towards this end. Akash has already been associated with the telecom venture, involved in the development of products and digital applications.
Similarly, RIL's retail unit, which posted its first annual profit in the last fiscal year, has been focussing on improving profitability now that revenue growth has stabilized. As part of its efforts to boost margins, Reliance Retail Ltd shut "low-performing" stores across its different formats, the company told analysts post its last quarterly earnings release in July.
Reliance Retail's revenue grew 15% in the quarter ended June 30. During the quarter ended 30 June, Reliance Retail closed 137 stores under its so-called value format. It, however, opened 169 stores in high-margin or scalable categories. The net addition to stores during the quarter stood at 32.

BEIJING: Chinese smartphone manufacturer Xiaomi today refuted Apple's allegation of stealing iPhone technology, saying one can only judge its products after using them.
Responding to Apple's design head Jony Ive's accusation that Xiaomi has stolen iPhone technology, President Lin Bin said Ive should use a Xiamomi phone to know the difference between the two gadgets.
"Xiaomi is a very open company, which would never force anyone to use its products. However, one can only judge Xiaomi's gadgets after he or she has used them," Lin was quoted as saying by the state-run China News Service today.
"I'm very willing to give a Xiaomi cell phone to him [Jony Ive] as present, and I look forward to hearing his remarks after he uses it," Lin said.
While responding to a question in San Francisco on Thursday about common features between the two phones, Ive said, "I don't see it as flattery. I see it as theft, and it's lazy. I don't think it's ok at all".
Xiaomi surpassed Samsung and Apple to become the biggest smartphone maker in China in the second quarter of this year, according to a report from Canalys.
Lin said the biggest challenge for Xiaomi currently was to increase its productivity.
In the first half of the year, Xiaomi produced 26 million cell phones and is expected to cross a total of over 60 million this year.
"At present, we can produce 6 to 7 million cell phones each month, and we will continuously improve that," Lin said.
Lei Jun , Xiaomi's founder, said yesterday that Xiaomi would not go public in the next five years.

NEW DELHI: In an emergency high-level meeting to review preparedness for cyclone Hudhud , Prime Minister Narendra Modi today asked officials to ensure that rescue and relief operations proceed smoothly and people are informed about the cyclone on a real-time basis.
Modi also asked Home Minister Rajnath Singh to be in touch with the Chief Ministers of the states likely to be affected by it, an official statement said.
"He instructed senior officers of the union government to maintain close contact and coordination with officers of the affected states to ensure that relief and rescue operations proceed smoothly.He said suitable arrangements should be made to inform people about the cyclone on a real-time basis," it said.
The meeting was attended by the Cabinet Secretary, the Principal Secretary to the PM, the Home Secretary, the Defence Secretary and other senior officials from the Indian Meteorological Departmentand and the PMO.
Modi was briefed on evacuation and other precautionary and preparatory measures being undertaken for coping with the cyclone.
The measures include deployment of teams from the armed forces and NDRF , depletion of reservoirs to accommodate cyclonic rainwater, positioning of boats, swimmers and relief camps and standby systems to restore power and telecom services, the statement said.
Over two lakh people living in and around the vulnerable coastal districts of Andhra Pradesh and Odisha have been evacuated with cyclone 'Hudhud' set to hit the two states on Sunday with winds gusting up to 195 kmph.

150 000 evacuated as cyclone Hudhud picks up speedIndia evacuates 150,000 as cyclone Hudhud intensifies
By By Jatindra Dash | Reuters –  Sat 11 Oct, 2014

By Jatindra Dash
PUDIMADAKA (Reuters) - About 150,000 people were evacuated on India's eastern seaboard on Saturday as cyclone Hudhud bore down and grew in sheer force, threatening to devastate farmland and fishing villages when it hits the coast on Sunday morning.
The India Meteorological Department (IMD) rated Hudhud as a very severe cyclonic storm that could pack gusts of 195 km/h and dump more than 24.5 cm of rain when it makes landfall.
The Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System (GDACS), run by the United Nations and the European Commission, forecast even higher peak wind speeds of 212 km/h. That would make Hudhud a Category 4 storm capable of inflicting "catastrophic" damage.
Around 150,000 people have been evacuated in Andhra Pradesh to high-rise buildings, shelters and relief centres, said senior disaster management official Hymabati. A further 50,000 may still be moved to safety, she added.
Authorities further north in Odisha said they were monitoring the situation and would, if necessary, move 300,000 people most at risk to nearby shelters.
"We have already shifted about 10,000 people from low-lying areas and plan to evacuate 14,000 more," N. Yubaraj, administrative chief of the coastal district of Visakhapatnam, told Reuters.
Visakhapatnam, also known as Vizag, is the largest city in Andhra Pradesh and hosts a major Indian naval base.
In Pudimadaka, a coastal village where many are fishermen, locals have been reluctant to leave.
"People are adamant. They are not willing to go. For the past three days we have been convincing them. Thank God. Now they agreed," Vasantha Rayudu, a local administrative officer, said while supervising the evacuation work.
"We convinced the people after holding a series of discussions with the village elders," said Rayudu, sitting in a small room with dozens of officials and policemen as huge waves crashed on the coast few metres away.
As a man beat a small drum and urged people by a loudspeaker to board nearby buses, tea seller V. Varalakshmi said she had packed her bags, but did not want to go.
"For the past 14 years, I have been selling tea here, the sea has never caused any harm to us," the 52-year-old woman said as she served a customer.
In New Delhi, the Crisis Management Committee met to review readiness for the onslaught from Hudhud.
"All the central agencies are fully geared up to provide necessary assistance," the government said in a statement, adding that 39 National Disaster Response Force teams had been deployed to the two states.
Cyclones in the Bay of Bengal are common at this time of year. These often cause deaths, mass evacuations of coastal villages, disruption of power and phone services as well as damage to crops and property in eastern India and Bangladesh.
HUMANITARIAN IMPACT
Hudhud was tracking west-northwest, 250 km southeast of Vizag at 2:30 pm on Saturday afternoon (1000 GMT), the IMD said.
The cyclone was strong enough to have a "high humanitarian impact" on more than 7 million people, the GDACS said in an updated bulletin.
The system also forecast a storm surge of 1.7 metres. The IMD said this could result in flooding of low-lying coastal areas around Visakhapatnam, Vijayanagaram and Srikakulam.
The evacuation effort was comparable in scale to the one that preceded Cyclone Phailin exactly a year ago, and which was credited with minimising the fatalities to 53. When a huge storm hit the same area 15 years ago, 10,000 people died.
"Hudhud is now the size of Phailin, though not yet as strong," said Eric Holthaus, a U.S.-based meteorologist at online magazine Slate.
"It's strengthened overnight, and most computer models are intent on bringing it up to nearly the same strength as Phailin was at landfall.
"It's worrying that international agencies are rating Hudhud's current strength higher than IMD's peak forecast, but we can only hope that the evacuations under way are sufficient to protect those in the storm's path," Holthaus said.
Authorities have been stocking cyclone shelters with dry rations, water purification tablets and generators. They have opened up 24-hour emergency control rooms and dispatched satellite phones to officials in charge of vulnerable districts.

Banks accept derivatives rule change from Ja...Banks accept derivatives rule change to end 'too big to fail' scenario
By Reuters | 12 Oct, 2014, 03.22AM IST
The $700 trillion financial derivatives industry has agreed to a fundamental rule change from January to help regulators to wind down failed banks without destabilising markets.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
LONDON: The $700 trillion financial derivatives industry has agreed to a fundamental rule change from January to help regulators to wind down failed banks without destabilising markets.
The International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) and 18 major banks that dominate the market will now allow financial watchdogs to apply temporary stays to prevent a rush to close derivatives contracts if a bank runs into trouble, the ISDA said on Saturday.
A delay would give regulators time to ensure that critical parts of a bank, such as customer accounts, continue smoothly while the rest is wound down or sold off in an orderly way.
That would help to avoid the type of market chaos sparked by the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 and also end the problem of banks being considered too big to fail.
The Financial Stability Board (FSB), a regulatory task force for the Group of 20 economies ( G20 ), had asked the ISDA to make the changes with the aim of ending the too-big-to-fail scenario in which banks are propped up with taxpayer money to avoid market disruption.
Under the new contract terms, default clauses in derivatives contracts such as interest rate or credit default swaps would be suspended for a maximum of 48 hours.
'EVOLUTIONARY PROCESS'
"Ending too-big-to-fail is going to be an evolutionary process, but the agreement of the first wave of banks to sign the protocol is a big step forward," ISDA Chief Executive Scott O'Malia said.
The ISDA template for millions of derivatives trades will now include the possibility of stays on both new and existing contracts, with the 18 leading players - including the likes of Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs Group - agreeing to change their contracts from January. Many derivatives are traded among banks.

RBI governor Raghuram Rajan calm on prospect of US rate riseRBI governor Raghuram Rajan calm on prospect of US rate rise

(Rajan said there would…)
WASHINGTON: RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan has said there would be some volatility in emerging markets once the US Federal Reserve decided to raise interest rates, but India is well prepared deal with market volatility.
"My hope is that after the initial volatility there will be differentiation, and the financial investors would try to see where there is some macro-stability," Rajan said here.
He was here for International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank fall meetings.
It is expected that the Fed Reserve may raise interest rates from next year as the US economy is showing signs of improvement.
He also said that interest rate hike may not have much impact on India as "we have got plenty of reserves relative to where we were last year...We have got inflation coming down in a substantial way".
If Fed hikes the rates there could be outward flow of capital from India which may in turn put pressure on India's forex reserves and subsequently on forex.
Falling for the fourth week in a row, India's foreign exchange reserves went down by USD 1.415 billion to USD 314.181 billion in the week to September 26 on account of a hefty drop in non-US currency assets.
Earlier Rajan had described the fall in reserves as dip in valuation with appreciation of dollar against other currencies.
"In the recent weeks the dollar has been appreciating against the other currencies. Therefore, when we look at our reserves in dollar terms, they have been coming down," Rajan had said.
Rajan had hoped that inflation will moderate to acceptable level of 6 per cent by January 2016 and maintained that the GDP growth in the current fiscal will be 5.5 per cent, same as projected earlier.

Meet liquor baron Kishore Chhabria: What sets the owner of Allied Blenders apartChhabria’s story is inevitably linked with that of two other men — United Spirits chairman Vijay Mallya and Chhabria’s elder brother, the late Manu Chhabria.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
Kishore Rajaram Chhabria, 59, loves being driven across the United States. In September, Chhabria along with wife Bina travelled more than 500 km between two small American towns, Barnard in Vermont and Bedford in Pennsylvania, staying in hotels for several days in both towns. Empty roads and lonely towns inspire Chhabria.
The sense of emptiness helps him "strategize", he says. Though a frequent visitor to the US, Chhabria does not own a house there and prefers hiring chauffeur-driven cars. Left-hand-drives confuse him. For Chhabria — the businessman — this is the right time for strategizing. A lot is at stake. His company Allied Blenders and Distillers (ABD), which owns Officer's Choice, the world's largest selling whiskey brand by volume, has blueprinted an aggressive growth plan. It includes the buyout of a competing brand, acquisition of distilleries and bottling units, heavy borrowing to fuel this binge, and finally, a public issue of shares in two years.
Chhabria's story is inevitably linked with that of two other men — United Spirits chairman Vijay Mallya and Chhabria's elder brother, the late Manu Chhabria. The trio has over the last three decades joined hands and fallen out many times (see The Liquor Wars). Manu Chhabria passed away in 2002, and his family sold the liquor business to Mallya. Mallya has since handed over management control of his liquor business to Diageo and is struggling to hold on to his board seat and chairmanship. Only Kishore Chhabria , with Officer's Choice, which accounts for 75% of ABD's sales by volume, has the luxury to plan growth or take time off in never-heard-of towns in the US, which are almost cathartic for him.
Old-World Style
In India, Chhabria seems to have wrapped himself up in familiarity and tradition. Chhabria loves to be unconventional, in an industry where flamboyance is the convention. At home, which is Casa Grande on Little Gibbs Road, near south Mumbai's Hanging Gardens, Chhabria prefers an old-world style. His office is in the same building as his residence, and he is surrounded by a group of old faithful and some anachronisms like CCTV cameras monitoring every room in the office with the monitor placed directly in front of his table. The office decor is anything but modern, and the drapes and chandeliers may even qualify as opulent.
"I have married only once. Bala (VR Balakrishnan), my secretary, was earlier my father's secretary. My cook has been around for 36 years and my driver for 27 years. Once I grab hold of a person I rarely let go," Chhabria says. Chhabria's company ABD is the third largest maker of Indian-made foreign liquor (IMFL, the rather curious contraction used by governments to differentiate liquor made in the organised sector from indigenous hooch). An 8% market share in IMFL makes ABD one of the largest Indian-owned liquor businesses. The corporate office is at Lower Parel, in a spanking new building, where the company's CEO Deepak Roy sits. Roy, an industry veteran who has also worked with Mallya in the past, has been allotted 5% sweat equity in the company by Chhabria, who owns the rest. Chhabria's son-in-law Jeetu Hemdev, who is married to his elder daughter, works under Roy.
Chhabria confesses that he never encouraged either of his two daughters to take an interest in his business. "In hindsight, I can admit I was wrong. I thought liquor was not a good business for women," he offers.

Cult personality or cultivated loyalty: What explains outpouring of grief for JayalalithaaJayalalithaa
(Tamil Nadu saw more self-immolation…)
In the mad frenzy that greeted the incarceration of J Jayalalithaa — who was forced to step down immediately as Tamil Nadu chief minister — on an emotionally charged afternoon on September 27 at her Poes Garden residence in Chennai, two incidents almost went unnoticed. Petty shop owner and smalltime AIADMK worker Karpagam gave up an entire day's earnings and spent time outside Amma's (as Jayalalithaa is popularly known) house without food or water. Ravi, another party loyalist, had to be doused with buckets of water after he tried to immolate himself.
Nonetheless, these incidents set the mood for the days to come. Tamil Nadu saw more self-immolation bids and heartattacks, all of which were attributed to the jailing of Jayalalithaa in a corruption case. There were reports of people sitting in makeshift prison cells and cadres starving themselves to express solidarity. There were bizarre acts too — display of half-tonsured heads, eating food placed on the road (a ritual usually performed in temple premises called 'man sor') — all in the name of 'Amma'. These incidents were largely received with a sense of bewilderment, even disbelief, in India and abroad.
Jayalalithaa is hardly the first politician to be put behind bars. But given that such incidents typically lead to nothing more than bouts of violence and public mischief, the outpouring of grief that pervaded the days after her incarceration is certainly a first in India, if not the world. No doubt Jayalalithaa is at the peak of her popularity, thanks to a raft of welfare schemes she launched in this tenure as chief minister. That still doesn't explain the events that have and are unfolding in Tamil Nadu. It also leads to the question: is this a spontaneous or a mobilized show of support? Politicians after all have long shown a knack of 'drumming up' support for their rallies.
The Amma Cult
In Jayalalithaa's case, there are no easy answers — opinion is divided. Some experts say the cult called 'Amma' has been carefully crafted over the years. Others say the emotional outburst is indeed a spontaneous show of support by loyalists. Recalling events during the end of her first term as chief minister, C Lakshmanan of the Madras Institute of Development studies, who has researched personality cults in Tamil Nadu politics, said back then posters were put up across the state depicting Jayalalithaa as a goddess. This was aimed at projecting a larger-than-life Jayalalithaa.
"It was not for the first time though. The seeds were sown long back in Dravidian politics in Tamil Nadu. While DMK leader M Karunanidhi used the idea of developing a personality cult, ADMK leader MG Ramachandran took it to another level. Subsequently when Jayalalithaa came into the picture, it was a transfer of the cult image from MGR to her,'' Lakshmanan said. "Ideological difference has blurred between the DMK and the AIADMK and what exists are only images that are thoughtfully manufactured. The voting and following is based on how much the voter is taken in by the personality.'' No doubt, political awareness has eluded a large section of people in the state over the years. The government's activities and the simple arithmetic of money flow is not what the people are told. What is being fed to them is literature and drama with high-pitched emotional rhetoric from atop a stage. This is carefully done to project the leader as some sort of legend who commands her or his cadres' loyalty, according to Lakshmanan.
"As this feeling is being thrust into the cadres over the years, when adverse situations arise they want to do something. Those who can afford it print and paste posters on the wall hailing their leaders as Gods and martyrs while the poor who has nothing else to offer tries to self-immolate,'' Lakshmanan said.
Tirunelveli-based sociologist Perumal Manikandan offered a different view. "What is coming out is not a mad frenzy or a cult following, but a show of loyalty and a hope for future recognition," he said.
  Certain Recognition
The AIADMK has not only recognized representatives with MP and MLA posts but has also rewarded lakhs of AIADMK cadres with posts within the party and in local bodies. Even smalltime workers have begun to nurture hopes that someday they will be chosen for a higher responsibility,'' said Manikandan.

Why India has few critically insightful biog...Why India has few critically insightful biographies and autobiographies
By ET Bureau | 12 Oct, 2014, 04.00AM IST

Share More
A widely regarded perception is that Indian readers, much like Hindi cinema viewers, prefer fables and parables to complicated tales or nuanced characters
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
By Harish Nambiar
This Gandhi Jayanti saw a propitious clash of Vishal Bhardwaj's cinematic experiments with truth with the ghost of Manmohan Desai, that genius storyteller who never let plausibility wander into his film set. Hrithik Roshan's Bang Bang raked in the moolah, to be sure, but Bhardwaj's Haider stood as an equal and opposite force at the box office.
For those into the precious business of loading symbolic meanings onto recent happenings, this is a great indicator. Haider has its own die-hard supporters just as Bang Bang has its.
These two are examples of old, even ancient debates. What is worth celebrating is that serious engagement with storytelling is finally finding muscle enough to fight the more escapist and less challenging forms.
And storytelling always started from the page.
And then one day, Hindi film's greatest living actor with the possible exception of Dilip Kumar , Naseeruddin Shah , wrote his memoirs. As he calculated, no hell broke loose, though the interest in the book might have taken the actor by surprise. Always a distinct voice in the incestuous and cornily uniform-sounding film fraternity, Naseer's memoirs have been hailed, of all things, for candour.
By all accounts and extracts, it is less candid than cautiously truthful, but told with the humour and self-deprecation of an educated adult. Naseer is 64, and his memoirs are about his life till 30. And yet, it is closer to adult than "young adult", as the trade segment for readership based on age goes.
Why Look Back On Your Life?
Despite India being the second biggest market for English readership in the world, Indian publishing industry's highest performing segment is the young adult one, flooded with bad English and worse stories of teens who preen themselves, and of young engineers learning firsthand that their biology is severely interfering with their psychology.
But that d
oes not explain a seemingly cultural resistance to intelligent, adult books. Last week, the veteran leftist leader AB Bardhan, of the Communist Party of India, gave his reasons on why he does not plan to pen his memoirs. For an illustrious career that straddles the entire time-span of independent India's politics, even when seen from a precious and less popular political alternative position, that was surprising.
He refused to write because he thought it better to fade away unrecorded than write all those "hurtful truths." He said, "Biographies are being written by all and sundry, which anyway is an exercise in self-congratulation and meant to blame others. I will not write."
A great counterpoint to Indian celebrities' coyness or apocalyptic fears about penning memoirs is news from France. President Francois Hollande's ex-girlfriend, Valerie Trierweiler , has just written a widely reviled book, Thank You for This Moment, that has been near-universally judged to be so bad it is good. For beginners, one report says it outsold Fifty Shades of Grey in France in September, the month of its release. It is an account of her affair with Hollande, written after its unhappy ending.
Naseer has been at pains to underline in his various interviews that he wanted to make sure he did not hurt anybody and that might have extended the time he took to finish his manuscript. Maybe, living in contemporary India, it was a dopey's doff to Dinanath Batra and the cottage industry of offence that is the biggest employers of the terminally unemployable.
A widely regarded perception is that Indian readers, much like Hindi cinema viewers, prefer fables and parables to complicated tales or nuanced characters. This, when married to an easy love for sanitised history, has kept Indians from engaging with the most interesting and significant contemporary lives.
India remains severely under-served by critical appraisals of so many worthy men and women whose lives would be as much an inspiration as a guide. And celebrity biographies are hagiographies made with the sole reason of feeding fan frenzy. Now that several generations of Indians have grown up in an independent country, a more robust conversation with the country's past should be a worthwhile enterprise. And well-researched, sympathetic and critically insightful biographies play a major role in such an engagement.

New rules for ATM usage from November: How to bypass themNew rules for ATM usage from November!
By Adhil Shetty | Bankbazaar.com –  Wed 3 Sep, 2014 4:31 AM IST
Print
 
Many people have a habit of withdrawing small amounts of money from the ATM to curb spending tendencies, but often end up with a high frequency of withdrawals. There are some others who are reluctant to use net banking or mobile banking facilities and depend on ATMs for checking account balance. If you happen to fall into any of these categories, it’s time to change your habit for good as RBI has issued new rules and guidelines limiting the number of times you use your ATM in a month. The new ATM transaction rules issued by the Reserve Bank of India is applicable to all ATM transactions including withdrawing cash, checking account balance or getting a mini account statement.
New RBI ATM Transaction Rules:
According to the new RBI guidelines that come into effect from 1st November 2014, savings bank account holders in metropolitan cities would be allowed only three transactions from ATMs of other banks and five from the same bank in a month. For any ATM transaction above the stipulated limit, a transaction fee of Rs. 20 would be charged to the account holder. The new transaction fee is applicable only for people living in six metropolitan cities including Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad and Kolkata. People living in smaller towns and other centers would continue to enjoy five free monthly transactions per month from the ATM of other banks and the charges for them include Rs. 20 for each cash withdrawal and Rs 9 for non-cash transactions. Account holders of zero balance and other no-frills accounts in non metros are exempted from such transaction charges as of now.
What new Rules Mean for Bank Customers:
The transaction fee has been increased from the earlier limit of Rs. 15 and the number of free transactions decreased from five to three for ATMs of other banks. Another important change in the new RBI guideline policy for ATM transaction fee is the fact that all ATM transactions including cash withdrawal, balance enquiry and changing of PIN number etc would be considered as an ATM transaction unlike in the past when balance enquiry was not considered a transaction as such!
A Case for Capping ATM Transaction Limit:
While capping the charges for ATM usage may be an unpopular decision taken by the Reserve Bank of India, the limit in free transactions is justified by the apex body considering high expenses for managing ATMs across the country. With an increasing number of robbery attempts on various ATMs especially in isolated areas and in semi urban and rural areas, the banks have been forced to shell out funds to install a security mechanism apart from using CCTVs and manual security guards wherever possible.
With the Reserve Bank of India laying down strict security guidelines not to leave any ATM unmanned or without security cameras and other measures, banks are facing higher overheads to manage the ATMs.
The inter banking fee charged by various banks through ATM services will also increase since banks are using the fee as an incentive to install more number of ATM machines. While all the above reasons have played their role in the decision to some extent the game clincher has been Reserve Bank of India’s long term plan to promote the use of e-transfers and cashless transactions as much as possible to avoid the use of any black money in the system. The rise in ATM transaction fee is largely seen by financial experts as a sum culmination of all of the above factors.
Tips to bypass ATM Usage Limit:
Since the new RBI rules on ATM transaction limits are likely to affect a vast majority of people, here are some tips individual account holders can use to avoid the fee hike.
Avoid cash transactions whenever possible:  If you are one of those individuals using cash transactions for every purchase and other financial transactions, it is time to explore other ways. The use of electronic funds transfer, credit and debit cards, cheques and demand drafts must be explored for financial transactions than using cash all the time.
Change the habit of withdrawing smaller amounts:  With an increase in the ATM transaction fee make sure you avoid withdrawing small multiple amounts.
Visit bank branch for cash withdrawals: If withdrawing large amount of cash, you are better off visiting the bank branch rather than the ATM. Visiting the bank branch may be slightly inconvenient,  but it is a good idea to visit the bank branch to avoid the ATM transaction fee. Having said that, if this type of transaction happens once in a while, no harm in paying the charge versus waiting for your turn at the bank, if that is indeed the case.
Use online banking for statement: A lot of people use ATMs for checking their account statement or to get a print of recent transactions or mini statement.  Since ATM transactions count the number of visits even if it was for checking of account statement and not cash withdrawal, it is a good idea to use the internet banking facility for checking of account statement rather than the ATM machine.

Less than 12 hours for cyclone Hudhud to make landfall; lakhs evacuated in AP  OdishaComments
Cyclone Hudhud is surging toward Visakhapatnam at 180 kmph and is expected to hit the coast at noon,  said officials on Sunday as thousands in Andhra Pradesh and Orissa braced for the tropical storm.
Heavy winds lashed Visakhapatnam coast as Hudhud lay 110 km southwest of the port city. “Pre-cyclonic conditions are quite active six hours before the landfall. Heavy winds are lashing Visakhapatnam and surrounding areas. Wind speed can go up to 200 kmph when it hits the land,” said director of the Cyclone Warning Centre Ramachandra Rao.
Andhra Pradesh and Odisha on Saturday started evacuating thousands of people as Hudhud barrelled towards the east coast states, furiously picking up pace. By Sunday morning, hours before it makes landfall in Visakhapatnam, it would have attained its top speed of 195kmph, the weather office warned.
Live Blog Cyclone Hudhud
 
 
Around 1.1 lakh people in Andhra and more than 26,000 in Odisha were evacuated on Saturday as it started raining heavily and the seas turned choppy. All fishing operations were suspended in six districts of Andhra and four of Odisha.
On Saturday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi chaired a high level emergency meeting to review preparedness. The National Crisis Management Committee also met after discussions with the chief secretaries of the two states.

Over two lakh people living in and around the vulnerable coastal districts of Andhra Pradesh and Odisha have been evacuated.
In Andhra, 370 relief camps have been opened in five districts - Srikakulam, Vizianagaram, Visakhapatnam, East Godavari and West Godavari - where 396 villages are likely to be affected.
In Odisha, officials have evacuated 360 members of the endangered Bonda tribe from their habitat in the Bonda Hills in Malkangiri district. The state government began evacuating people from vulnerable areas to minimise casualties even as two flights and 39 trains on the route were cancelled.
Odisha administration officials visited seaside villages urging people to move but many stayed put. The police did not force them on to buses heading towards some 300-odd storm shelters, unlike during Cyclone Phailin last year, which left close to 30 dead and displaced 400,000.
 
Cyclone Hudhud: Evacuation begins in Andhra, Odisha
Keeping in mind the safety of the passengers, several flights to and from Visakhapatnam to Bhubaneswar, Banglore, Hyderabad and Kolkata were cancelled on Saturday due to strong winds.
Railways have cancelled the movement of about 40 trains between Bhubaneswar and Visakhapatnam and diverted many trains to other routes for safety.
Tirupati-Bhubaneswar Express, Bangalore-Bhubaneswar Premium Special, Jagadalpur-Howrah Samaleswari Express, Bhubaneswar Junagarh Express, Visakhapatnam-Secunderabad Express, Visakhapatnam-Guntur Express and Tirupati-Visakhapatnam Express are some of the trains which have been cancelled as a precautionary measure, said a senior Railway Ministry official.

East Coast Railway has made elaborate arrangements to meet the situtation that could arise out of the cyclonic storm and heavy rains.
Hudhud is forecasted to maintain its intensity for up to six hours after landfall before gradually weakening into a cyclonic storm while moving across southern interior Odisha and Chhattisgarh, the Met said. It will bring heavy rain to west and east Godavari, Visakhapatnam, Vizianagaram and Srikakulam districts of Andhra and Ganjam, Gajapati, Koraput, Rayagada, Nabarangpur, Malkangiri, Kalahandi and Phulbani in Odisha in the next 48 hours. In addition, south Chhattisgarh and north Telangana will also receive rain.

The Centre has stationed 39 National Disaster Response Force teams comprising more than 1,680 rescuers along with 199 inflatable rubber boats in the two states and deployed 20 army rescue and engineering teams. The air force, navy and Coast Guard are also on standby.

Fed say global slowdown could push back US r...Federal Reserve officials say global slowdown could push back US rate hike
By Reuters | 12 Oct, 2014, 07.09AM IST
Federal Reserve officials took stock of a slowdown in the global economy and said it could delay an increase in US interest rates if serious enough.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
WASHINGTON: Federal Reserve officials on Saturday took stock of a slowdown in the global economy and said it could delay an increase in US interest rates if serious enough.
Most notably, Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer said the effort to finally normalize US monetary policy after years of extraordinary stimulus may be hampered by the global outlook.
"If foreign growth is weaker than anticipated, the consequences for the US economy could lead the Fed to remove accommodation more slowly than otherwise," he said at an event sponsored by International Monetary Fund.
Nevertheless, he said betting in financial markets on the timing of a US rate hike appeared "roughly" on the mark given the Fed's current expectations on how the economy's recovery would unfold.
The IMF trimmed its global growth forecast ahead of its fall meetings this weekend, where discussions focused on ways to stimulate global demand and prevent the euro zone from slipping back into recession.
"I am worried about growth around the world, there are more downside risks than upside risks," Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo said at a conference the Institute of International Finance sponsored on the sidelines. "This is obviously something we have to think about in our own policies."
Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Evans said a strengthening of the dollar and weak growth abroad could mean slower inflation in the United States, and less justification for the US central bank to raise rates.
The renewed concerns about Europe could represent a serious complication for the Fed, which had been expected to begin bumping up benchmark borrowing costs in the middle of next year.
Fischer spoke in part to calm concerns among developing nations about a potential tightening in US monetary policy, saying the Fed would only move rates higher if the US economy was ready for it. Overall, he said, rising borrowing costs in the United States were unlikely to disrupt flows of capital and investment around the world.

Richards lauds 'perfect reply' from West Indies

Former West Indies captain Viv Richards is relieved that the threat of a players strike ahead of the first ODI against India did not materialise. Speaking to ESPNcricinfo from Hambantota where he is serving as technical director for the West Indies A team, Richards said the highlight of the entire situation for him was that in the end, "good sense did prevail."
"The first thought that came to mind was well here we go again," he said. "I am proud of them (the team). When I say good sense, if for some reason things didn't work out the way they would have liked with WIPA's president Wavell Hinds, they have gone about it in the best way possible. With all this stuff going on, I think it was just a marvelous performance. That was the perfect way to reply, beating the defending champions on their home soil in such a convincing manner."

Matters came to head between the West Indies team and the West Indies Players Association (WIPA) led by former opening batsman Wavell Hinds, in the lead up to the opening game at Kochi.
The captain Dwayne Bravo shot off an angry letter to Hinds, claiming he "hoodwinked" the players and did not take their inputs while signing a new memorandum of understanding with the WICB last month, under which the players would suffer a significant pay cut. Bravo went on to threaten that the players will not hesitate to take "appropriate action"; something that was widely feared would include a boycott of the series opener. Richards reckons the situation came to pass because "someone dropped the ball somewhere."
"You would expect the players association to be looking after the interests of the players and also for the development of young cricketers in the region. I think there was some argument in the players' association about how things should be panned out in the future. I also believe it shouldn't have gone this far, especially with the guys coming on tour knowing that at some point you had to sign a contract to do so. To play out the way it did wasn't in the best interests of the West Indies moving forward."
In his second letter to Hinds after deciding to play the game, Bravo made it clear that the players had lost confidence in Hinds and informed the WICB not to correspond with WIPA until an "interim measure" acceptable to all was put in place. Richards agreed that in the current circumstances, Hinds' position as the head of WIPA was "untenable."
"How much did this individual (Hinds) know before they came on tour because that is the topic that is going to be of interest," Richards said. "To be fair, some may say it sounds a little bit much for players to be getting such huge fees but at some point you need to have an understanding about what I am coming on tour for. It wasn't in the best interests of the players that represent us for this to be played out in such a manner, especially in India where they are going to be playing against the defending champions in the 50-over format. Wavell Hinds may have some explaining to do when they get home."
Richards is also of the view that the WICB may have some "housekeeping" to do to ensure such disputes do not take place in the future. "Some players who come on tour, I am hearing that they get their contracts the day before they leave," he said."That to me needs some brushing up with the board. They need to get their act together, giving guys ample time to let their legal advisors have a look at what's happening so at least everything can be okay when on tour."
Richards believes that West Indies now have a side with the "potential to be winners again" if the off-field disputes are resolved amicably. "When you look at the all-round ability of that team, if they play to their full potential, I believe they can be winners," he said.
"With all this stuff that's going on, with the guys deciding to play, it's the sort of step we need to move forward with and hopefully when they do get home and meet with the players' representatives, things can be ironed out in such a way that the guys can be focused. I believe this is one of the great opportunities for the West Indies to do well at the World Cup."

Pak. Rangers term border firing a small-scale warA soldier guards a road near the LoC which links Poonch district of Jammu and Kashmir wiith Rawalakot area of POK. File photo

India-Pakistan
The Pakistan Rangers have termed the Indian firing at the Sialkot border a “small-scale war” between the two countries.
“India is not just violating ceasefire but fighting a small-scale war with Pakistan,” Director General Rangers Major General Tahir Javaid Khan told journalists here.
“It appears a political agenda...,” he said.
Gen. Khan claimed that the Indian Border Security Force used small firearms on the working boundary between 2010 and 2014.
“More than 30,000 mortar shells have also been fired during the last four years,” he said, noting such a large amount is not even used in a “full-scale war.”
“On October 6, alone, 51,000 small arms were fired across the boundary, while on October 7, more than 4,000 mortar shells were fired,” he claimed.

Live: Less than 5 hours for cyclone Hudhud to make landfall; lakhs evacuatedComments
Cyclone Hudhud is surging toward Visakhapatnam at 180 kmph and is expected to hit the coast at noon,  said officials on Sunday as thousands in Andhra Pradesh and Orissa braced for the tropical storm.
Heavy winds lashed Visakhapatnam coast as Hudhud lay 110 km southwest of the port city. “Pre-cyclonic conditions are quite active six hours before the landfall. Heavy winds are lashing Visakhapatnam and surrounding areas. Wind speed can go up to 200 kmph when it hits the land,” said director of the Cyclone Warning Centre Ramachandra Rao.
Andhra Pradesh and Odisha on Saturday started evacuating thousands of people as Hudhud barrelled towards the east coast states, furiously picking up pace. By Sunday morning, hours before it makes landfall in Visakhapatnam, it would have attained its top speed of 195kmph, the weather office warned.

Around 1.1 lakh people in Andhra and more than 26,000 in Odisha were evacuated on Saturday as it started raining heavily and the seas turned choppy. All fishing operations were suspended in six districts of Andhra and four of Odisha.
On Saturday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi chaired a high level emergency meeting to review preparedness. The National Crisis Management Committee also met after discussions with the chief secretaries of the two states.

Over two lakh people living in and around the vulnerable coastal districts of Andhra Pradesh and Odisha have been evacuated.
In Andhra, 370 relief camps have been opened in five districts - Srikakulam, Vizianagaram, Visakhapatnam, East Godavari and West Godavari - where 396 villages are likely to be affected.
In Odisha, officials have evacuated 360 members of the endangered Bonda tribe from their habitat in the Bonda Hills in Malkangiri district. The state government began evacuating people from vulnerable areas to minimise casualties even as two flights and 39 trains on the route were cancelled.
Odisha administration officials visited seaside villages urging people to move but many stayed put. The police did not force them on to buses heading towards some 300-odd storm shelters, unlike during Cyclone Phailin last year, which left close to 30 dead and displaced 400,000.
 
Cyclone Hudhud: Evacuation begins in Andhra, Odisha
Keeping in mind the safety of the passengers, several flights to and from Visakhapatnam to Bhubaneswar, Banglore, Hyderabad and Kolkata were cancelled on Saturday due to strong winds.
Railways have cancelled the movement of about 40 trains between Bhubaneswar and Visakhapatnam and diverted many trains to other routes for safety.
Tirupati-Bhubaneswar Express, Bangalore-Bhubaneswar Premium Special, Jagadalpur-Howrah Samaleswari Express, Bhubaneswar Junagarh Express, Visakhapatnam-Secunderabad Express, Visakhapatnam-Guntur Express and Tirupati-Visakhapatnam Express are some of the trains which have been cancelled as a precautionary measure, said a senior Railway Ministry official.

East Coast Railway has made elaborate arrangements to meet the situtation that could arise out of the cyclonic storm and heavy rains.
Hudhud is forecasted to maintain its intensity for up to six hours after landfall before gradually weakening into a cyclonic storm while moving across southern interior Odisha and Chhattisgarh, the Met said. It will bring heavy rain to west and east Godavari, Visakhapatnam, Vizianagaram and Srikakulam districts of Andhra and Ganjam, Gajapati, Koraput, Rayagada, Nabarangpur, Malkangiri, Kalahandi and Phulbani in Odisha in the next 48 hours. In addition, south Chhattisgarh and north Telangana will also receive rain.

The Centre has stationed 39 National Disaster Response Force teams comprising more than 1,680 rescuers along with 199 inflatable rubber boats in the two states and deployed 20 army rescue and engineering teams. The air force, navy and Coast Guard are also on standby.

Amitabh & Rekha s unfortunate love storyTruth Behind the Unfortunate Love Story of Amitabh and Rekha
Bollywoodshaadis.com –  Fri 10 Oct, 2014 10:17 PM IST
Share 0
Amitabh and Rekha's love story is one of the most talked about affairs of Bollywood even till date. Yet, this much-talked about love story always remained a mystery as both the actors never accepted their relationship in public. While the two themselves have said very little, everyone else seems more than certain about the affair.
Amitabh and Rekha- the two legends of our film industry, how did it all begin and how it ended? Here is unfolding the secret behind this love story.
An unsuccessful love-story of one of the most successful romantic pairs of Bollywood
Their love story began on the sets of film Do Anjaane (1976). During the initial days of their relationship, the couple used to meet in a bungalow that belonged to Rekha's friend. Everything was a smooth sail until an incident happened.

During the shoots of Ganga Ki Saugandh (1978), Big B reportedly lost his temper on a co-actor who was misbehaving with Rekha. After this, their affair came in the limelight and grabbed the media attention. 
The gossip mills started churning out stories of Rekha-Amitabh's affair. They even made headlines saying that Rekha and Amitabh have got secretly married. And, these speculations caught more fire when Rekha turned up at Rishi Kapoor and Neetu Singh's wedding wearing sindoor and mangalsutra. Many questions about this jodi’s affair were answered with this bold step taken by Rekha.

In an interview given to Filmfare magazine in 1984, Rekha spoke about Amitabh’s denial of their relationship. She said, "Why should he have not done it? He did it to protect his image, his family, his children. Why should the public know of my love for him or his love for me? I love him and he loves me- that’s it! If he’d reacted that ways towards me in private, I would have been very disappointed.” She further added, “Mr. Bachchan is still old-fashioned. He doesn’t want to hurt anybody so why hurt his wife?”
Amitabh Bachchan despite the superfluous love for Rekha, never admitted it in public. On the other hand, Rekha boldly admitted her love for him. Silsila was this enigmatic couple's last film together.

In an interview with BBC, director Yash Chopra said that Rekha and Amitabh were very much in a relationship before Silsila. Chopra said, "I was always on tenterhooks and scared (during Silsila) because it was real life coming into reel life. Jaya is his wife and Rekha is his girlfriend and the same story is going on (in real life). Anything could have happened because they are working together."

After the shoot of Silsila, Amitabh-Rekha’s relationship began to fade. Rekha wanted to marry Amitabh and did not want to settle down with the tag of the 'other woman' in Amitabh's life. She realised she has no future in this relationship. With this, their passionate love story came to an end, both on and off screen.

Post-Silsila, Amitabh is said to have ignored Rekha altogether. Though the two would be starring together in R Balki’s Shamitabh, it is still not confirmed whether they will be sharing any screen space together or not? This shows that the wounds may have healed with time, the scars never disappeared. Rekha's lonely life has seen many rumours and some truth. Even her marriage to Delhi-based businessman Mukesh Aggarwal did not last long. But whatever the circumstances had been for their breakup, the heavy aura of this sad love-story still lingers on!

Ask Matt: Should I invest in TeslaUSA TODAY
Q: Should I invest in Tesla?
A: Tesla (TSLA) is one of those stocks investors are electrified by. But such enthusiasm makes this a stock for speculators willing to endure a shock.
Tesla is a leader in the movement to power cars using electricity rather than fossil fuels. The company has won market acceptance — leading many investors to pile into the stock seeing it as the next big thing. But while the company’s prospects might be promising, that doesn’t mean the stock’s future is equally bright. In fact, shares drove themselves off a cliff after Tesla didn’t announce a self driving car.
Analysts currently have a $268.84 a share price target on the stock for the next 18 months, says S&P Capital IQ. That’s just 13% higher than current levels, which might not be enough of a premium to justify the stock’s extreme volatility. The stock is down more than 17% since peaking in early September of this year.
Much hinges on everything going as planned. The company is expected to post a profit on an official accounting basis  of 29 cents a share in the fourth quarter, says S&P Capital IQ. That’s quite a leap for the company, which lost 62 cents a share on that basis last year. And even investors bullish on the company are guarded on the stock. Brian Johnson, analyst at Barclays, applauded the company’s product announcements this week. But even so, his price target is $220, or 7% below current levels.

Tata Investment s Mehrab Irani s mad money j...Mad Money Journey: Tata Investment's Mehrab Irani wants to ensure financial literacy through his book
By Rahul Sachitanand , ET Bureau | 12 Oct, 2014, 04.00AM IST

Share More
“If you speak to people connected to the stock market, they will ask for a tip — a tip is not for the stock market, it is for waiters,” says Irani. 
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
As a one-and-a-half decade veteran in the field of finance — and a chartered accountant and company secretary by training — there are few financial missteps that miss his eagle eye. In his south Mumbai office, Mehrab N Irani helps manage the investments of Tata Investment Corp , part of the $100-billion Tata Group , in listed and unlisted group firms and other companies. Outside, however, Irani is rather sought-after for much more personal reasons — to help an assorted bunch of family, friends and colleagues manage their money.
The outspoken Irani, who recently launched his second book Mad Money Journey: A Financial Adventure, minces no words about the state of affairs with most people's finances. "Everyone wants to have money and be rich, butfew go about it the right way," he says. "If you speak to people connected to the stock market, they will ask for a tip — a tip is not for the stock market, it is for waiters." Rather than work for money, he contends, people should make money work for them.
Think Long Term
Instead of scrambling to earn extra money by following the latest investment fad — a complex financial product, a real estate bubble or some short-term stock market surge — people need to think long term. They must make focused asset allocation plans to make their money talk. "People go after the next hot investment like the next big stock or real estate; a simple plan, instead, is to invest in an index fund. Over the last 100 years, passively managed index funds have gotten better returns than actively managed ones," he claims. The other advantage of making this investment is that it steers gullible investors from investing in what they hope is the next big money-making machine.
Most people lose money to what Irani calls financial predators — income-tax for example — and end up prisoners of their own finances. "People become wage slaves of employers, tax slaves of the government and loan slaves of banks," he says. Part of the problem, Irani adds, is lack of training in personal finance. "Everyone should have a minimal knowledge of finance and how to manage and grow one's money," he says.
People don't know because most people are quickly turned off by tedious books on personal finance. There have been reams of preachy writing on the subject. Some of these books try to seed bold ambition into its readers, others aim to rescue those at the point of financial ruin, or preach a tough-love mantra to fix your battered finances. "People are turned away from such books because they are drab," Irani says. Ironically, his first book too was a self-help one, though he claims it is doing reasonably well in the market.
Even as he seeks to continue his mission of financial literacy, he is now changing his format. His second book is what he calls finance fiction. Rather than preach to a clueless congregation, he is hoping to make a more personal connect. The protagonist in this book is seemingly on a strong footing — professionally and (seemingly) personally secure — but with his accounts in a shambles. In such bad shape, that he considers ending his life. "The protagonist, Dr John Pinto , typifies the struggles of most people with money," says Irani. "He is earning plenty of money, has a happy family, but is a slave to his money."
Keeping it Simple
Rather than wear down the reader with a prescriptive method of straightening out the finances, the author sends Pinto on a worldwide journey of financial redemption. He travels the world, meets people and is told stories of personal stumbles with finance and the long road to redemption. "My hope is that this book is entertaining, thrilling and suspenseful and through the pages, the principles of personal finance will emerge," he says. True to his word, the book is a breezy read, less than 300 pages and each chapter is short. While some characters and settings are sometimes a stretch — flying into Kabul and hanging out with a reformed terrorist seem hard to believe — he does steer away from burdening the reader with too much financial jargon. Instead, the book periodically turns part-travelogue to keep the reader going. Details of the area, food and people emerge along with the person Pinto has travelled to meet.
Irani comes across as rather obsessed about money — he repeatedly uses phrases such as financial slavery to make his point. "People confuse saving and investing. Today, savers are losers. What you save continuously depreciates due to inflation and income tax."
Part of the challenge for people, according to Irani, is to find ways and means of investing, rather than just saving. While asset allocation may sound simple, practically most people struggle with this concept. This is especially because of the temptation of investing in the latest getrich-quick schemes, but few people have the financial knowledge to manage these hype cycles. Irani notes that financial instruments have become very complicated and most of them are for brokers, distributors and analysts to make money, not the common man. "If your driver or paanwaala can't understand the product, there is something wrong," he sums up.

Day after Nobel  Kailash Satyarthis NGO goes after child traffickerComments
As Nobel Peace Prize winner Kailash Satyarthi spent a busy Saturday meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi and giving interviews to the media, his Bachpan Bachao Andolan (BBA) was done celebrating and was back on the job, in hot pursuit of a big-time child trafficker from Jharkhand.

They’d already put off the planned raid by a day — having joined the 60-year-old in celebrating his joint Nobel with Pakistani teen and fellow child rights champion Malala Yousafzai — and couldn’t wait any more. On Saturday, they got in touch with the Delhi Police crime branch to make arrangements for the raid.
Read: Activists hope Nobel win will help put focus on child rights
HT is withholding the name of the trafficker and other related details to ensure the raid isn’t hampered in any way.
Activists with BBA believe taking him down will lead to more arrests, and to more minors being rescued. “The celebrations will continue but we can’t forget our basic work for which we have got the Nobel.
 This arrest might end up exposing a big racket and we are assisting the police to arrest him at the earliest,” said one activist.
The trafficking racket in Delhi is a steadily growing menace with victims — mostly minors and women — brought in from states like Jharkhand and West Bengal. Once in the city, they are pushed into child labour, illegal domestic work or prostitution by unscrupulous placement agencies.
“This particular trafficker is wanted in several cases of child trafficking,” a police officer said, adding that they got to know of him after the recent arrest of a former Jharkhand minister under the arms act. “The ex-minister was apparently hiding in his house and there is a possibility that traffickers are linked to a number of politicians,” the officer said.

Other officers revealed the trafficker and his wife, who run an illegal placement agency in west Delhi, brought in minors on the pretext of getting them jobs and education. The couple’s name figured in a list provided by the Jharkhand CID last year of 240 illegal agents suspected of trafficking young girls from the state.
Sources said BBA had provided details of possible hideouts to the police, and would assist in the raid along with members of another NGO, Shakti Vahini.
“Met Nobel laureate Kailash Satyarthi ji & congratulated him,” Modi tweeted after the meeting. The BBA founder also received a call earlier in the day from BJP patriarch LK Advani.

Ceasefire violation: How India is misreading  suicidal logic  of Pakistani armyIndia
(Although Pakistan may be…)
The week-long exchange of heavy artillery and machine-gun fire between the armies of India and Pakistan, causing 30 civilian deaths and displacing tens of thousands of petrified people, has rewound the clock to habitual animosity and fear. Craters and blown-up roofs of homes have erased the euphoria about positive vibes between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Pakistani counterpart, Nawaz Sharif, in May this year. The sparring and poking that historically govern bilateral relations have sadly reasserted themselves.
Despite the plethora of Pakistan watchers in India and India experts in Pakistan, the tragedy of the latest flare-up along the Line of Control (LoC) and the international border (IB) is that neither party knows which factors are really driving the other side to behave so fiercely.
DK Pathak, director general of the Border Security Force (BSF), has expressed puzzlement to The Times of India as follows: "We have inflicted heavy damage on them, but they keep firing. I do not understand why." In a mirror image, the Pakistani major general commanding the forces, Javed Khan, is quoted by the BBC as saying, "I just want to know the reason from the other side. We are not finding the answer."
Whenever the ceasefire agreement of 2003 is battered by an uptick in cross-border firing, India and Pakistan resort to boilerplates for explaining the violence. Pakistan connects our belligerence with domestic elections and the competitive patriotism of ruling and opposition parties in India. We focus on the civil-military balance of power in Pakistan and believe that its mighty armed forces use periodic confrontations with India to straighten elected politicians who may stray in quest of amity.
Indeed, the last few months have witnessed a steady erosion of Nawaz Sharif's authority under the pressure of so-called civil disobedience campaigns of opposition parties of Imran Khan and Tahir ul Qadri, both of whom enjoy tacit blessings of the Pakistani military. By relying on the Army for securing critical state institutions against the protesters' threats of physical takeover, Sharif conceded that the military is Pakistan's ultimate arbiter and saviour.
To use a perceptive classification of the Pakistani intellectual Babar Sattar, the "de facto system" that struts in khakis has taught a lesson to the "de jure system" of Parliament and the elected prime minister. Raising the tempo at the LoC and IB, with Nawaz Sharif donning an embarrassed silence, is a way of reconfirming that Pakistan's India policy will not be allowed to transfer from the military headquarters in Rawalpindi to the prime minister in Islamabad.
Here, it is imperative to recall the psyche of the Pakistani military. Georgetown University's Christine Fair's recent book, Fighting to the End: The Pakistan Army's Way of War, argues that its strategic culture is a Kamikaze-like will to weaken "Hindu-dominated" India, come what may. Fair writes, "Pakistan will suffer any number of military defeats in its efforts to do so, but it will not acquiesce to India." For the Generals, any accommodation with India is "genuine and total defeat."
Warnings by India's leadership in the wake of the border clashes — that "times have changed" and that we would raise the costs of Pakistani adventurism to "unaffordable" levels by hitting back strongly — misread the suicidal logic of the Pakistani army. Pakistan is certainly inferior in conventional military terms and economically broke vis-a-vis a rising India, but expecting the former to respect this power disparity and back off from provocations is to forget former Pakistani Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto's dictum: "Even if we have to eat grass, we will make nuclear bombs" to match India.
If the Pakistani state is not guided by rational costbenefit thinking, the belief that we can somehow pummel and compel it to become benign is misguided.
Even Israel, which enjoys massive advantages over Hamas and Hezbollah in conventional military means, has not succeeded in silencing the guns of its rivals by means of disproportionate force. Be it Pakistan or combatants in the Middle East, the death-defying jihadist mindset is not cowed down by conventional superiority of the opponent.
So, what might actually produce the "credible deterrence" from attacks that Indian defence minister Arun Jaitley is touting? It has to be a mix of unconventional covert missions that blunt hardline Islamists and their allies in the Pakistani military, combined with routine political dialogue.
Much of the bad blood at the LoC is linked to infiltration of jihadists into India from Pakistani terrain under the cover of official army shelling. India has to take the battle to the launching points and supply-chain trail of these mujahideen inside Pakistani territory.
This would entail a westward shift of the point of kinetic action away from the LoC and IB, sparing innocent civilians in precarious border areas who are presently bearing the brunt of the two armies.
Simultaneously, dialogue channels with Sharif and some sections of the Pakistani military are essential, even if no solution or settlement is likely. Negotiation with intractable and camouflaged foes is necessary to glean valuable insights into bargaining tactics, bottom lines and authority structures of the adversary. As winter sets into Kashmir, the high-calibre weapons will head for their seasonal rest. The intelligence operations and diplomacy must go on.
FEATURED ARTICLES

When the state is more mature than the liberalsprint
A doctor who stops in his stride to deliver memorable lines, usually to someone behind him; his wife, who like many wives, is not that into her husband; and their adorable son who polishes his father’s shoes and sniffs the fragrance on the nape of his youthful mother. They are a somewhat happy family, but their happiness is a foreboding because they live in Kashmir in the nineties. They are doomed for another reason--they are inside a re-telling of Shakespeare’s Hamlet.
That Vishal Bhardwaj bases some of his films on Shakespearean dramas often elicits the dull question, ‘Why?’ To this he has dull answers. The appropriate question is, 'So?'
The most unremarkable fact about Bhardwaj's Haider is that it is an adaptation of a lowbrow Elizabethan play whose vaunted timelessness is in reality an exaggeration of tribute. Nothing is timeless, literature especially. Like science, the art of the story is a ceaseless collective human progression, and there are excellent reasons why the ancient is not new. Yet Bhardwaj persists with adaptations. Amusing then that a filmmaker in the know should tell me that Bhardwaj is not the kind of man who reads Shakespeare. He reads the abridged versions, if at all. I could not verify this but there is crucial evidence to support the hypothesis. It can be empirically proved that no person in this age who reads Shakespeare, (or for that matter who employs the word ‘metaphor’) has made great Hindi cinema. And Bhardwaj has made exceptional movies.
Haider is more inextricably, and profitably, set in Kashmir than Hamlet is in Denmark. Bhardwaj shows a Kashmir where India is an illegal occupier, which it still is; and a brutal oppressor, which it once was. Bhardwaj shows soldiers pulling out the nails of terror suspects, electrocuting them and carrying out extra-judicial killings. It is unprecedented for a mainstream Indian film to portray this. That the State cleared Haider for public viewing, notwithstanding the many cuts enforced by its censors, is extraordinary. What can explain this uncharacteristic generosity? Could it be that the State has demonstrated that it is finally willing to experiment with maturity? Or, is it just that India has no choice anymore but to resemble a true, major democracy?
Is it time then for the fellowship of paraliberals, too, to come of age and shed their allegiance to their cabal? The Fellowship is a network of writers, documentary filmmakers and academics, with a uniform set of values. The Fellowship’s community mind finds it morally aesthetic and appealing to all its constituents to promote the point of view that Kashmir is and will be in a state of perennial unrest until India miraculously quits the place.
It is a view that is dear to a section of Kashmir’s elite, and its diaspora--to be precise, people who have the means to get on with their lives. But, in a changed Kashmir flanked by a transformed Indian economy and deteriorating Pakistan, the poor and the villagers speak of an aspiration that is very different. Their priority is a decent life, which is usually about things that make very bad poetry--jobs, education, roads, electricity. They have contempt for India but they also wish Kashmir's economy to move on. This, a section of Kashmir’s relative rich and the Fellowship they are a part of, find repulsive. Because they have the luxury to find it repulsive.
They couch all their arguments as the fight of the oppressed against the oppressor, but fall mute about the rights of Kashmir’s Hindus, who were forced to flee their homes at the height of the insurgency, to return. In the wounded spectral space of Kashmir, the encroached are encroachers too.
Unlike the State, the Fellowship does not have the power to ban or censor journalistic or literary works or statements that it deems offensive. If it had the powers it would have, but as it doesn’t it resorts to sustained defamation of those whom it does not agree with. As it has done to Shah Faesal, who in 2009 became the only Kashmiri to be ranked first in the civil services exam. Faesal, whose father was once assaulted by the Indian army and forced to chant, “Ram, Ram”, and later killed by ‘unidentified gunmen’, told me in 2012 that the period of calm in the Valley in the preceding months was proof that, “Common sense is finally winning.”
He faced severe abuse on the social media for the comment, chiefly from non-resident Kashmiris because from the safety and comfort of distance, they found peace in Kashmir offensive.
On his Facebook page, Faesal said about the long-distance lovers of Kashmir: ‘…the crop of burger-fed, Armani-attired pseudo-revolutionaries has actually harmed Kashmir, more than anyone else.’
Among Kashmir’s modern educated youth of modest means, who live in Kashmir and hence have a direct stake in peace, there are many who can see how the arrival of stability and as a consequence corporations can transform their lives, but they speak of this discreetly because they fear the abuse of the apparent patriots.
About two years ago I had interviewed two such young men, who worked for Aircel in Srinagar, and had presented their views in this paragraph: They say what many educated young people in Kashmir say — can we move on? Can we have development first instead of waiting forever for the Kashmir issue to be solved? We want industries to come here, we want MNCs and malls. We want to watch a cricket match in Srinagar. “We want KFC,” one of them says, and they burst out laughing.
At the time of the interview I had tried to persuade them to allow me to identify them because I had imagined that what they had said was innocuous, even obvious. But the outrage that followed the publication of the article informed me why they wished to be discreet. Faesal’s “burger-fed pseudo-revolutionaries” framed the story as though it had suggested that KFC would solve the Kashmir problem. Ideology, it appears, greatly impedes reading comprehension.
The two young men were considering a move to Bangalore in search of prospects. There was only so much you could do in Kashmir if you did not write poetry. The years were rolling by, and they wanted to make something of their lives. India did occupy their home, but it was economics that was going to evict them.

Gen-next Ambanis get board seat at RelianceGen-next Ambanis get board seat at Reliance
BS Reporter | Mumbai Oct 11, 2014 10:30 PM IST
Five months after their mother Nita Ambani became a director of Reliance Industries Limited (RIL), daughter Isha and son Akash are following her footsteps.
While Isha, 22, has been inducted into the board of Reliance Jio Infocomm, her twin brother Akash has joined the Reliance Retail board.
Adil Zainulbhai, an independent director of RIL, has also been appointed on the board of Reliance Retail.
Isha, who graduated from Yale University with double majors in Psychology and South Asian Studies in 2013, had this April joined McKinsey & Company's New York office as a business analyst.
Akash - according to his father Mukesh Ambani is the family's tech guy - is already involved in the development of products and digital services applications in Reliance Jio. He graduated from Brown University with major in Economics.
Among Mukesh and Nita's three children, Akash is the eldest, while Anant, the second son, is the youngest.
Their cousin, Jai Anmol, the eldest son of Reliance Group Chairman Anil Ambani, is also not far behind. Jai Anmol, who has joined Reliance Capital, is expected to play a larger role in the group. Jai Anmol has a degree from Warwick Business School in the UK and his younger brother, Jai Anshul, is pursuing higher studies in the US. Both Mukesh and Anil had joined RIL in the early 1980s after completing their education.
RIL's telecom venture, Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited, plans to launch internet connectivity on a pan-Indian basis and offer end-to-end solutions across digital services in domains of national interest, such as education, health care, security, financial services, government-citizen interfaces and entertainment.

Emkay flash crash: Sebi censures NSEEmkay flash crash: Sebi censures NSE
BS Reporter | Mumbai Oct 11, 2014 12:09 AM IST
Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) on Friday passed an order against the National Stock Exchange (NSE), censuring it for lapses in the 2012 flash crash, triggered by punching of erroneous orders by brokerage Emkay Global.
Sebi, in a 40-page order, said the exchange lacked proper risk management systems in place that a single error brought the entire system to a halt.
The regulator directed NSE to set up an independent review to check for system robustness and suggest ways for its improvement.
In October 2012, the benchmark NSE Nifty had crashed 920 points after the dealer erroneously punched a wrong order worth Rs 650 crore.
Prima facie, NSE was found failing to meet Sebi requirements, as the trading didn't halt at the 10 per cent circuit limit, the order said.
Sebi had issued a show-cause notice to the exchange in April last year for violations of the Sebi Act.
The market regulator had alleged that the bourse had failed to implement market-wide circuit breaker; there was inadequate risk management at the level of exchange and stock broker and had failed to implement coordinated trading halt in equity and derivatives segment nationwide.
"Trading halt for two hours was also not coordinated in all equity and equity derivatives markets nationwide as required in terms of the Sebi Act," the order said.
Sebi had also criticised the exchange for putting the entire onus on the broker for the flash crash when the exchange should hold equal responsibility. The Sebi order has also found that the counter parties to the trades of Emkay Global had collateral that was less than five per cent of the total buy value.
NSE had rebutted the allegations by saying that it was a "one off incident".
"However, I do not agree with this submission. The technological systems in a stock exchange should be robust enough to anticipate and prevent such events from happening," said Prashant Saran, a whole-time member, Sebi.
Industry players say NSE has increased checks and balances following the Emkay incident to prevent a repeat.

See further decline in Nifty if it slips below 7820-7830: Mitesh ThackerHPCL
("If the price starts breaking…)
In an interview with ET Now, Mitesh Thacker , Technical Analyst, miteshthacker.com , shares his views on the markets and some stocks. Excerpts:
ET Now: The pressure continued in Friday's session. Do you think it extends into early Monday and possibly even Tuesday?
Mitesh Thacker: That is a possibility. One thing is sure that it has been a very choppy ride. While the week was truncated and the decline was only about 1% or so, the overall movement in the Nifty was much bigger and we saw swings happening in both directions.
There has been some kind of momentum breakdown on the medium-term charts. So, if the price starts breaking down, which is below 7820-7830 on closing basis, I would be slightly more negative and look at further declines. The possibility of this correction to the levels of about 7700 and below would be very strong.
ET Now: What is your reading of the entire IT pack and the way Infosys lifted the entire IT sector on Friday, any trading opportunities there?
Mitesh Thacker: Infosys was the one which lifted the entire IT sector and, therefore, that should be the number one trading opportunity. It had a very strong price and volume action. So technically it was quite positive. The news flow is over and extended on the positive side with significantly stronger buy signals being generated. Also, the stock managed to get past earlier highs and swing levels of 3830-3840.
So, the overall setup should be in favour of Infosys. I do expect this stock to head towards the levels of 3950-4000 in the next few days to come by and from a trading point of view, it will be a good buy with a stop below 3830. The other one, which could be interesting, is HCL Tech. 1750 is an important level on the charts for the stock. Once it manages to get past that, 1820-1825 would be a good short-term target.
ET Now: What do you think on the way Cairn has corrected and the way some of the OMCs have behaved, how do you expect the next week to be?
Mitesh Thacker: Apart from giving crude signals of underperformance, Cairn clearly had some kind of downtrend. If you look at the last few years of data and chart, it has had some strong support around the 270 mark. So maybe it will head towards 270 and then try to do some kind of bottom fishing. But if it starts breaking below 270, I would be looking at targets of sub-250 over here.
So the overall structure remains negative and again on rallies, 295-296 would be good levels to initiate fresh short positions. Coming to the OMC pack, I do like some of the stocks over here. HPCL made a fresh high and then it was sideways for Thursday andFriday, but the structure is quite positive. This one can still go up to the levels of 535-540 in the short term. Similarly, BPCL is a stock which has been more of sideways, but if it starts breaking above 685-690, you might see some kind of uptrend development.
ET Now: Give us your recommendations for the next week.
Mitesh Thacker: I have a buy on VIP, with a stop below 115, look for targets of 130 plus, and a sell on Motherson Sumi, with a stop at 380 for targets of around 345.

3-year-old boy mauled by jaguars after falling into enclosure in US zooA 3-year-old boy who was mauled by jaguars after falling into their exhibit at a zoo in Arkansas on Friday is in critical condition, a hospital spokesperson said.
 
The incident revived chilling memories of a similar incident at the Delhi zoo on September 23 when a youth was killed by a white Bengal tiger after he slipped into the big cat’s enclosure.
 
Little Rock police quoted the child’s father and grandfather as saying the toddler was seized at the neck by one of two jaguars and at the foot by the second cat after falling 15 feet (4.5 metres) into the enclosure.
Both the adults were present when the incident happened.
 
The boy suffered extensive scalp lacerations, a depressed skull fracture and several puncture wounds, the police report quoted a doctor at Arkansas Children’s Hospital at Little Rock as saying.
 
The wounds did not appear to be life-threatening, the police report added.
 
The boy's father and grandfather said they threw a camera bag and an empty water hose spool at the animals, causing them to drop the child.
 
When zoo personnel arrived they entered the exhibit and used fire extinguishers to keep the jaguars at bay until the rescue was completed.
 
Authorities said they were trying to establish how the child fell into the open-air exhibit at the zoo, one of the state’s most popular attractions.
 
A hospital spokesman declined to identify the child, citing the family’s request for privacy and the age of the patient.
 
The child's family lives in Maumelle, a Little Rock suburb, according to the police report.
 
The jaguar exhibit has been closed to the public pending further review of the incident, a zoo spokeswoman said.

Delhi: Three men open fire at policemen in Connaught PlaceComments
Gunshots rang out in the heart of the Capital at Connaught Place Saturday evening following an armed confrontation between the police and three alleged criminals from Uttar Pradesh.
The shootout occurred around 8.30pm behind an old Coca Cola factory in Shankar Market — a stone’s throw from a bustling weekend crowd in the inner circle area, police said.
The confrontation began when two constables, Prateek and Sandeep, patrolling the area on their motorcycles, came across three men and asked them who they were, said joint commissioner of police MK Meena.

“Suddenly, the three began manhandling the policemen. One of them whipped out a pistol and fired four shots at them. A constable then fired a warning shot in the air before overpowering one of them,” Meena added.
The police said the overpowered man, in his 40s, was taken to the hospital for treatment. His other two accomplices have fled.
“They were apparently involved in a crime in UP’s Muradnagar recently; we are identifying the accused and tracing his associates,” Meena said.

Durables firms to petition govt over e-commerce discountsDurables firms to petition govt over e-commerce discounts
Viveat Susan Pinto | Mumbai Oct 11, 2014 11:05 PM IST
The country's top consumer durables companies like LG, Samsung, Sony and Videocon are in the process of writing to Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman against deep discounts being offered by e-commerce companies. The letter, to be routed through industry body Consumer Electronics and Appliances Manufacturers Association (CEAMA), will articulate their concerns over "predatory pricing" that e-tailers are practising.
This will be the first formal attempt by these companies to register their protest. Earlier, LG, Samsung and Sony had complained that the October 6 flash sales by Flipkart and Snapdeal made their products available at discounts as steep as 30-40 per cent to the market operating price (MOP). This, they said, upset offline retailers, which typically give discounts of 10-15 per cent on MOP.
MOP, the actual price at which a company makes a product available to a retailer, is slightly less than maximum retail price (MRP). So, if an Apple iPhone's MRP, for example, is Rs 50,000, its MOP will be about Rs 45,000.
During Diwali sale or other big shopping events, offline retailers typically bring down the price (MOP) by 10-15 per cent to attract buyers. With e-tailers (Flipkart and Snapdeal) discounting way below that accepted practice on October 6, industry sources said, offline retailers like regional players, as well as modern and traditional traders, were furious.
Kishore Biyani, chief executive of Future Group, which operates the eZone chain of consumer electronics stores, said: "Let e-commerce sell products without offering discounts and then compete. They are surviving only because of these discounts. As long as e-commerce companies are funded, they will be able to give such discounts. The moment the funding stops, there will be no discounts."
The CEAMA letter, according to the body's secretary-general, Amit Chadha, will highlight the issue of deep discounts and press for this practice to be regulated. "Not very long ago, the e-tailing channel accounted for only about five per cent of industry sales. Thanks to these flash sales by e-commerce majors, their customer base has increased. According to our assessment, the e-tailing channel today constitutes 15-20 per cent of industry sales. And, if the practice of deep discounting is not regulated, we will see the customer base for online platforms going up. Brick-and-mortar retailers are badly affected by this. Shops are empty because consumers wait for these attractive offers online. There has to be a price parity," says Chadha.
LG, India's largest consumer durables company, issued an advisory on October 6, saying it had not authorised any e-commerce company to sell its products in India. It could not vouch for genuineness of the products sold online and, the company said, it retained the right of not extending additional services and warranties on such products.
Chadha says the second issue that will figure prominently in CEAMA’s letter will be the sourcing methods of online platforms. “We have raised this issue in the past and propose to bring it up again in our letter to the commerce minister. How is it that a product finds it way online when the company producing it has not authorised its sale. Who are these companies tapping,” Chadha asks.
According to industry sources, small dealers (with networks of a few stores) that procure products from companies are to blame; they offload these products to online marketplaces to ensure sales. “The practice has gained traction lately, with shopping online as a habit picking up. E-commerce companies assure these small dealers that their products will be sold. The dealers are happy to get a small margin in sales of these products,” says the chief executive of a top consumer durables company who does not wish to be named, given the sensitivity of the matter.
PREDATORY PRICING?
What the firms' letter to the commerce ministry will say
Regulation: Regulate e-commerce companies, as their discounts are affecting offline channel partners' business
 
Fair means: Ensure e-commerce companies have fair business practices
 
Sourcing: Consumer durables and electronics companies are also complaining that online marketplaces source from the small direct dealers that assure them of sales
 
Small cut: What direct dealers get in return for these sourcing deals is a small percentage of sales proceeds

Firing resumes in Poonch

TOPICS
unrest, conflicts and war
Shattering two days of calm, firing resumed between Indian and Pakistani soldiers on Saturday along the LoC in Poonch district. According to Army officials, Pakistani troops started firing on forward posts in the Banwat area in Poonch around 1.15 p.m. “We retaliated heavily after our posts were attacked,” an Army officer told The Hindu. “There was no loss of life on our side.”
The official said the firing continued for five hours and lasted till about 6 p.m.
The firing was intended to abet infiltration into the Kashmir Valley before the winter snow rendered the borders inaccessible, he added.
Cross-border shelling over the past week has left eight persons dead and 90 wounded. More than 32,000 people have fled to relief camps.
The United Jihad Council, an umbrella body of 13 militant organisations in J&K, called for a unilateral ceasefire two weeks ago following the massive floods that devastated Srinagar and southern districts of the State. No major militant attacks have taken place since the ceasefire.

So what if you haven t heard of Patrick Modi...Why Patrick Modiano winning the Nobel in Literature would exasperate some

By picking the French writer for the Literature Nobel, the Swedish Academy wants us to choose something on the menu most of us haven’t tried before
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
Patrick Modiano. Blank. Patrick Modiano. Blank again after which a Google search follows.
With some basic information about this year's Nobel laureate in Literature under your belt, you make an obligatory crack about the surname of the Nobel Prizewinning French writer 'whom no one has heard of' linking it to that of our prime minister. A few of you may make the connection of 'Modiano' with a great Italian artist famous for his portraits of women with elongated, swan-like necks. But that you keep to yourself because airing it would only make you come across as an arty-farty smart-assed twat.
At least unlike Tomas Transtromer, the Swedish poet who won the Lit Nob in 2011 — whose name you can vaguely remember (wrongly) because you had watched the film Transformers in 2007 — Modiano is easy to remember.
But the choice of Patrick Modiano as Nobel laureate once again exasperates and befuddles you at the same time. Why has the Nobel Academy , again, gone 'art house' and chosen someone that 'no one has heard of '? Especially when the bookies this year provided the option of the muchtranslated-into-English, much-distributed, muchsold and much-loved Haruki Murakami as a favourite, along with the Kenyan Booker International prizewinning Ngugi wa Thiong'o, whom the media via the bookies (or is it always the other way round?) made wellknown as a Nobel contender before...
...Patrick Modiano closed the deal on Thursday.
So what tender mischief is the Swedish Academy up to each year? If it was consistently an "obscure" writer who got the Lit Nob every year, at least you would have figured out by now that the gong is something they give "obscure" writers — the way most of you would look at, say, Sahitya Akademi Award winners. That is, writers whom you have 'never heard of'.
But no. The Lit Nob does get all 'normal' from time to time. As if deciding to rub shoulders with "normal literary readers" some years, it decides to award folks you 'know': Alice Munro (2013), Mario Vargas Llosa (2010), Doris Lessing (2007, the year of the first Transformers movie), Orhan Pamuk (2006), Harold Pinter (2005), JM Coetzee (2003) and VS Naipaul (2001), if you stick to the 21st century. The chances of you following the writing career of 2000 laureate Gao Xingjian or 2004 winner Elfriede Jelinek are slim.
India, Too
Trying to find out the algorithm that picks Lit Nob winners being impossible, you stick to more certain things. Like knowing the books on the Booker Prize long list, and then the books on the Booker Prize short list, and finally knowing the book that wins the Booker.
Ditto, to a lesser extent, with the Pulitzer and homegrown book awards such as the Crossword Book Awards and The Hindu Best Fiction Award — even as the Sahitya Akademi Awards go into a blind spot because the language-specificity of the award categories make the prizes smack of 'quota' even though there is plenty of quality. (2013 awards for Hindi, Punjabi and Tamil literature went to Mridula Garg, Manmohan and RN Joe D'Cruz, names even more 'nobody has heard of' in India than Patrick Modiano.)
But why does the Nobel going to someone 'nobody has heard of' feel so much more irksome than when someone 'nobody has heard of' gets a Sahitya Akademi Award, or, for that matter, even a Nobel in Chemistry?
It's because of two things: One, our expectations and understanding of the Nobel Prize in Literature.
Two, our inability to think of deserving writers beyond the ambit of books available in the English language. ( Just imagine if 1999 Lit Nob laureate Gunter Grass was not translated into English.)
First, the Literature Nobel category itself. Along with the Peace Prize (simply note the ruckus over the Satyarthi-Malala 'Indo-Pak' prize) everyone and their donkey have an opinion about who should and shouldn't get the Lit Nob — quite unlike the lack of interest or speculative knowledge about who should win the Nobel for Physics, Chemistry, Medicine and Economics. Only taste marks the quality of the reader-as-a-Lit Nob punter, not domain knowledge.
But then, this is how the Lit Nob Prize winner is distilled and chosen: The Swedish Academy (motto: 'Talent and Taste') comprises 18 members, all of whom are Swedish. These 18 people of refined literary taste choose five writers among those nominated by members of various literature academies (along with the Swedish Academy itself ) and societies across the world (including the Sahitya Akademi), literature and language professors, former Nobel winners and presidents of writers' organizations.

Six bullets that the Modi Government must biteprint
At a recent investors summit, PM Narendra Modi spoke about how investment worth $100 billion was waiting to come in from the US, Japan and China. It is for the states to seize this opportunity, he said at that meeting.
Since becoming PM, Modi has tried to talk up confidence among investors and business — by announcing the “Make In India” campaign; by interacting with CEOs on his trips to Japan and the US; and by affirming how he is committed to getting India’s economy back on track. These sound bites do send out the right signals to local and foreign investors but if Modi wants to spur investments, boost growth and create jobs, his government will have to bite some bullets, many of them not sugarcoated.
Business lobbies have a laundry list of the policies they want changed — that’s pretty much everything since Independence! Here is a shorter to-do list that may be more pragmatic to hope for but still fraught with risks.
Resetting diesel prices. Instead of subsidising oil companies, the government should use the latest fall in global crude oil prices to let the market decide diesel pricing. That would slash subsidies, help reduce the fiscal deficit and align fuel prices with global levels. Risk: When crude oil prices rise, market-linked pricing would mean higher costs for consumers and even stoke inflation — not an ideal situation for winning elections.
Privatising key PSUs. If Modi really believes that the government has no business being in business, he should walk the talk by privatising both Air India and Coal India — the former is a bleeding mess (accumulated losses: Rs. 30,000 crore) that has consistently lost market-share; and the latter, a near monopoly, is run badly and delivers poor-quality coal. Selling them off, especially a big stake in Coal India, can go a long way in bridging the fiscal gap. Risk: Finding a buyer for the battered airline won’t be easy; and the coal conglomerate’s strong trade unions may be a showstopper.
Fixing a faulty PDS. India’s public distribution system for food-grain and other essentials is a leaky mess. Intended to benefit the poor (a third of the population is below the poverty line), it ends up being exploited by the unscrupulous. If the government wants to ensure that the right people get the benefit of the Food Security Act, it should implement a direct cash transfer system that is foolproof. Risk: None really, because the Aadhar ID network and the Jan Dhan banking scheme can combine to ensure that benefits reach the poor.
Revising gas prices. Natural gas prices (around $4 a unit) have not been revised since 2004 and a move to double the rate is stuck in litigation. India’s oil and gas import bill last year was $145 billion. While India is oil-deficit, it has gas reserves that could meet demand for the next 25 years. But investors in gas production would want prices that are worth it; at $4 they aren’t. Risk: Higher gas prices will push up fertiliser prices and gas-based power tariffs, dealing a dual blow — a bigger subsidy bill for the government and higher inflation.
Simplifying land buying. Large projects that can generate employment get mired in land acquisition laws. Poor compensation, ambiguous title deeds, environment issues and social concerns are hurdles faced by industry. Simpler, yet equitable and environment-friendly land buying rules can ease such impediments. Risk: It is a formidable task to ensure simplicity, equity and environmental balance and can turn into a political battlefield between the Centre and the states.
Making it one market. The Goods and Services Tax, which would make India a common market by doing away with varying rates of local tax, is the single-biggest indirect tax reform that can make things easier for business. Risk: Can’t happen without a consensus among states, which fear it will rob them of their powers to control their exchequers.
Those are just six bullets. There are plenty more. But biting these could be a beginning.

Overnight firing by Pak in Jammu s Arnia sector  15 BSF posts hitPak targets 15 posts in Jammu, seeks UN help
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  Jammu, October 12, 2014

Pakistan heavily shelled 15 border outposts and hamlets in Arnia sector of Jammu and Kashmir early Sunday even as it wrote to UN chief Ban Ki-moon blaming India for the escalation in border clashes and sought UN intervention on Kashmir.
The shelling, the first since Thursday, injured three people and ends a pause in fighting that has already killed 19 civilians in the two countries in the worst skirmishes in a decade.

In the letter to Ban, foreign affairs adviser to Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif, Sartaj Aziz, accused India of ‘deliberate and unprovoked violations of the ceasefire agreement and cross-border firing’. He also appealed for UN’s assistance in resolving the dispute with India over the status of Kashmir.
Though there was no formal reaction from New Delhi, India has long maintained that disputes between it and Pakistan should be resolved bilaterally under the framework of the Shimla agreement and Lahore declaration.
 India also considers the UN observer group on Kashmir to have outlived its utility and has criticised Pakistan for depending on a ‘tool of a bygone era’ to address the problems of the present.

The latest round of shelling  by Pakistan comes a week after five people were killed in Arnia.
“Flat trajectory weaponry fire started at 8.10pm (Saturday) on three border posts in Arnia and continued till early morning,” a BSF spokesperson said.
The fresh firing has forced authorities to drop any moves to allow the nearly 30,000 people living in government relief camps to return to their homes.

Sensex down on global clues; FIIs get bearishGlobal cues making Sensex move, and FIIs getting bearish: A worry?
Kshitij Anand, ECONOMICTIMES.COM Oct 10, 2014, 04.01PM IST
(FIIs, which were largely…)
NEW DELHI: Foreign institutional investors (FIIs), which were largely responsible for over 25 per cent rally seen in the BSE Sensex so far in the year 2014, have become net sellers of Indian equities in the last ten trading sessions.
As per provisional data, FIIs have sold net of Rs -6157.49 crore in the last ten trading sessions, while DIIs or domestic institutional investors remain net buyers with investments to the tune of Rs 4670.19 crore.
In line with other Asian as well as European markets, the Indian markets are also facing global jitters, which most analysts think are more of a short-term phenomenon and the broader trend remains on the upside.
Signs of recession in Europe, slowdown in China and uncertainty over the US Federal Reserve interest rate hike kept global investors on the edge over the past couple of weeks.

Mid  small size house price rise moderated more: RBIMid, small size house price rise moderated more: RBI
BS Reporter | Mumbai Oct 10, 2014 11:52 PM IST
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said the price of houses in the small and medium size category has moderated more sharply as compared to the large size category.
In its monthly bulletin, it said the pace of growth in average house prices slowed in 2013-14 at 12.7 per cent, plausibly reflecting a correction in trends, on the back of subdued demand.
The index of house prices had been growing at an annual average rate of about 20 per cent (yoy) in 2011-12 and 2012-13. For the latest quarter, the yoy increase in the House Price Index at the all-India level was 11.4 per cent, compared to 10.5 per cent in the preceding one.
The Reserve Bank is compiling a quarterly house price index (base 2010-11=100) for 10 major cities -- Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, Bangalore, Lucknow, Ahmedabad, Jaipur, Kanpur and Kochi. Based on these city indices, an average house price index representing all-India house price movement is also compiled. These indices are based on the official data of property price transactions collected from registration authorities of the respective state governments.
RBI said the growth in house prices had moderated in 2013-14 for Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Jaipur and Kanpur. For instance, the price in Mumbai rose on an average annual basis by 30 and 18.5 per cent, respectively, for 2011-12 and 2012-13. This declined to 8.7 per cent in 2013-14.
However, in Bangalore and Ahmedabad, house prices grew at a relatively slower pace during 2012-13 but picked up momentum in 2013-14. Kolkata and Delhi picked up momentum in 2012-13 and then showed some moderation in 2013-14.
Prices in the small size category have gone up at an average annual of 23.7 per cent in the past four years. The average increase has been lower for the medium and large categories at 18.2 and 18.6 per cent, respectively. In 2013-14, the price increase in the small and medium size category moderated to 8.7 and 10.7 per cent, respectively, while that in the large size category remained almost at the average level.
Most realty experts say one should not expect the sector to turn round soon, especially the homes segment. While the new government has raised hopes and improved the sentiment of investors, companies and experts believe a revival is at least a year away. But, they said, commercial properties will be in demand.

Peace Nobel: Recognition for all social activistsKailash Satyarthi
(This year’s award could…)
MUMBAI: The Norwegian Nobel Committee has selected many surprising or controversial winners for the Nobel Peace Prize over the years but there is one area they have generally avoided. Despite many candidates being proposed whose work touches on business and economic issues, they have stuck to politics and general human rights.
In 1913, for example, industrialist and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie came close to winning it, but apparently there was discomfort over his business practices. On the opposite end of the spectrum, environmental organisation Greenpeace is often said to be a serious contender (the Nobel Committee only discloses details of nominees 50 years after the event) yet it's strongly anticorporate approach might have become a hurdle.
One indication that this approach might be changing was the 2006 award to Mohammed Yunus and the Grameen Bank. The Committee recognised that human rights were linked to decent livelihoods and Grameen's microcredit schemes might be one means to that end.
And this year's award to India's Kailash Satyarthi and Pakistan's Malala Yousafzai could be a further indication that innovative approaches to business and human rights might win support of the committee.
Satyarthi is known for his work for child rights across the board, including the specific area of access to education for which the Nobel seems to have coupled him with Malala Yousafzai in a milder version of one of those opposing party pairings that the committee so loves (Mandela-De Klerk, Begin-Sadat, etc).
But Satyarthi has a long history involving a range of issues, and one on which he has spent a great deal of time concerns trade in products and commodities which might use child labour.
Rugmark was About Child-labour Free Carpets
The systems he has helped evolve have important lessons for how corporates can tackle social issues like this in an era where consumers are demanding accountability and social media is enforcing it.
The main innovation that Satyarthi has been involved in is Rugmark, an ethical certification system for the carpet making industry. Satyarthi's involvement with carpets, particularly in Bhadohi-Mirzapur belt goes back to the mid 1980s when he was with Swami Agnivesh's Bahdhua Mukti Morcha. Child labour was routine, justified on the dubious grounds that their smaller fingers helped tie more knots per inch, and that it was a natural form of apprenticeship.
Satyarthi's attempts to stop this on the ground met with a violent response, and he had several narrow escapes. The child rights activists were more successful when they shifted their focus abroad, and persuaded countries like Germany and the US to consider bans on carpets made with child labour.
  This threat forced the industry to negotiate and agree to set up a scheme to certify child-labour free carpets. The activists recognised that a total ban harmed children by depriving their families of livelihoods, so an exemption through certification - with a distinctive and friendly logo of rug with a smile - was an acceptable middle ground, that tapped into the power of consumers. It has not been a universally accepted solution. Free market fundamentalists disliked any talk of sanctions.
In an interview with the Times of India in 2001 the economist Jagdish Bhagwati grumbled: "Kailash Satyavarthi says that Biharis sell their children as bonded labour to work in Hoshiarpur in carpets. He wants foreign sanctions. If carpets are stopped, what will the Bihari parents do? They will send their children to some other conduit elsewhere. In Bangladesh, children were withdrawn from textiles. Many girls took to prostitution." Bhagwati said the solution was to have NGOs work at ground level and to fund families to send their children to school.
On the other hand, some child rights activists feel that certification schemes run the risk of offering cosmetic solutions while diluting the chance of real action. In a report on social labelling schemes published by the Centre for the Advanced Study of India at the University of Pennsylvania, sociologist Gay Seidman noted that "Labels are easy to imitate, and consumers are easy to confuse."
Most carpets sold in the West now carried such labels, but it was not clear how rigorous the inspection procedures behind them were and some could be outright fakes - "child labor activists often suggest that sewing on a social label could become just one more task for a tired six-year-old."

Committee gets cause right  but errs in dragging religious identitiesIndia
(If being Hindu or Muslim…)
Even as India and Pakistan are at each other's throats on the border, the Nobel Committee has sought to unite them in peace, by giving the 2014 Peace Prize to India's Kailash Satyarthi and Pakistan's Malala Yousafzai . Their common fight for the rights of children is the link between the 58-year-old Indian and the 17-year-old Pakistani, the youngest peace prize awardee yet. Satyarthi has been a crusader against child labour for long. Malala almost became a martyr to the cause of girls' education in her land. Both are inspiring figures of enormous conviction and courage. We commend them both and the Norwegian Nobel Committee as well.
But the committee erred in discerning great significance in Satyarthi being a Hindu and Malala being a Muslim. In the battle that Satyarthi has been waging against child labour, the religious identity is wholly beside the point. Underdevelopment, poverty, greed, social inequality and inadequate spread of educational facilities are responsible for child labour and these blight lives regardless of their faith, and oppressors and the exploited come from all religions. In Malala's case, religion is, in fact, a factor. A backward interpretation of Islam make some people oppose women's education. While the Taliban, who have been opposing girls' education and polio vaccination, do cite a combined political and religious identity as their obstructionist motivation, social backwardness remains the enemy, although at one remove, here as well. If being Hindu or Muslim mattered in opposing this backwardness, Einstein's Jewishness should be relevant in his formulation of the theory of relativity, and Ronald Ross' Christian devotion, in his identification of the mosquito as the vector carrying malaria.
This bit of silliness apart, the committee did well to highlight the fact that 168 million children around the world toil as workers earning a pittance instead of going to school. In India, the second stage of the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan seeks to bring universal enrolment at the secondary school stage as well. This is the way to go, combined with sustained poverty reduction.

Nobel Peace Prize 2014: Celebrate the Indian  not IndiaOctober 10, 2014, 8:39 pm IST Saubhik Chakrabarti in The Contrarian Capitalist | Business | ET
9
LET’s celebrate the commitment of Kailash Satyarthi – but let’s not celebrate India. Yet we Indians, especially urban, well-off Indians whose children never need help from an NGO and who dominate media and social media, seem to have no doubt that Nobel Peace Prize for an Indian is a moment of national glory for India.
It is actually a moment that calls for urban well-off India to feel despondent, or even feel ashamed about our country.
This Nobel is simply a reminder of India’s dreadful social conditions, of the brutality of its lumpen capitalists whose bottomlines depend on employing child labour, of the failure of India’s relevant laws, of the failure of its rural school system, and, most of all, of the awful results of patchy economic growth; for, only consistently high economic growth can create conditions where employing a child in a carpet factory becomes an economic non-option.
So, there’s nothing to celebrate as a country. As a country, we get a Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 for being host to the kind of human destitution that typified India in 1947. As a country, our global image is dominated by the narrative of material want. We compare unfavourably to sub-Saharan countries on several human welfare indices, we produce figures of child mortality and malnutrition and a variety of other horrors that make us look like a society incapable of sustained economic and social progress – that’s what this Nobel tells us about India.
We lament now and then that very few Indian scientists get a Nobel. And then when an Indian-origin scientist in a Western country gets a Nobel we appropriate him or her as our own. That’s one kind of utterly silly national celebration – what a non-resident Indian gets a Nobel or heads a global company, the relevant part is not ‘Indian’, it’s ‘non’. Those world class achievements were not made in India. You can celebrate an Indian origin Nobel science winner or a global blue chip company CEO – but don’t pretend what they have done has anything to do with India. Yet we always pretend. And we always look pathetic while pretending.
Going gaga over India because Satyarthi has won the Nobel for helping exploited Indian children is the other kind of pretence. We did the same when Mother Teresa won the Nobel – so much so that we even left the necessary interrogation of some of Mother Teresa’s motives and modus operandi to Western journalists. Indian media just went nuts – oooh, an Indian has won a Nobel.
We are going nuts again. Let’s not. Let’s praise Kailash Satyarthi’s extraordinary work – and let’s remind ourselves what that work tells us about the country we live in.

Vishal Sikka's Infosys beats estimates, Q2 net up 28.6%
ET Bureau Oct 11, 2014, 03.33AM IST
(Infosys, India's second…)
BANGALORE: Infosys announced better-than-expected revenue and profit growth for the July-September quarter and cheered investors with a generous dividend and bonus.
The Bangalore-based company's profit grew 28.6% in the second quarter. However, Friday was dominated by CEO Vishal Sikka's enumeration of the strategic direction in which he is leading the country's secondlargest software exporter.
Sikka, 47, the first non-founder to take the top job at the Bangalore-based company, promised to remake Infosys as a "next-generation company" as he attempts to balance the twin priorities of pushing growth momentum in the traditional business while preparing to compete for leadership in technology areas such as social, mobile, cloud computing and data analytics.
"We not only aspire for consistent and profitable growth but indeed to get back to being a bellwether company for the industry," said Sikka, a former member of the board at German software company SAP who took over as CEO in August after founder N R Narayana Murthy surprisingly decided to step away after returning as chairman last June. "And we want to do that on the basis of innovation, on the basis of technology."
Infosys kicked off earnings season with second-quarter revenue of $2,201 million. At 3.2%, revenue growth over the previous quarter was robust by Infosys' standards and good augury for the rest of the industry.
The company did not, however, alter its guidance of 7-9% growth for the year to March 2015. Software body Nasscom has forecast 13-15% growth for the industry. Operating margin improved by 100 basis points to 26.1%.
Dividend of Rs 30 a Share
Consolidated net profit rose to Rs 3,096 crore in the July-September quarter, 2014-15, from Rs 2,407 crore in the year-ago period. "On several fronts, our efforts to bring in operational efficiencies yielded encouraging results during the quarter", said chief operating officer UB Pravin Rao. "We have seen positive results of some of our interventions on sales, margins and attrition, and we will continue to focus on these areas."
Infosys declared an interim dividend of Rs 30 a share, compared to Rs 20 a share in the previous year. The company also announced a bonus issue of one share for every share held, helping push the company fs stock higher by as much as 7.1%, outpacing the benchmark Nifty index on the National Stock Exchange which was down nearly 1%.
Sikka, who is regarded as the main architect of SAP 's blockbuster HANA platform for realtime analytics, said much of his strategy is work in progress. He promised details about milestones around April next year and predicted it will required 2-3 for "meaningful benefits " from the new blueprint for Infosys.
Analysts are of the view that much of the optimism about Infosys is because of " Sikka the man" referring to his credentials as a technologist, entrepreneur and high-ranking executive at one of the world 's leading software companies.
I am not very optimistic until FY17, h said an analyst at a foreign brokerage, saying it will be at least two years before Infosys can match industry growth rates. While Sikka goes all-in by committing to technologies such as artificial intelligence and automation, experts are of the view that implementation could prove to be a challenge. "The main challenge for Sikka is cultural transformation that impacts each and every business function at Infosys," said Frederic Giron, vice-president and research director at Forrester Research.
In the immediate future, the biggest worry for the company could be the continued exodus of staff, including senior management, with the attrition rate touching a record high of 20.1% at the end of September 30, compared to 19.5% at the end of June. However, Infosys said that it expects attrition to come down in the next couple of quarters to 13-15%.
Moreover, Infosys added a net of only two clients during the quarter.

Infy wants to be a bellwether again; aims 18% growth in long termacquisitions
(It is too early to forecast…)
Vishal Sikka's first earnings presentation as Infosys CEO was centred on the themes of automation, artificial intelligence and 'design thinking,' the latter phrase that describes a creative, user-centred approach to problem-solving. Sikka also addressed questions on some long-standing issues and investor concerns. Excerpts:
On Automation And Artificial Intelligence
I want to make a big mention of automation. Artificial intelligence as a domain is not very well understood. It is often associated with precipitating... the irrelevance of humanity. Having studied at Stanford and other places at the feet of the pioneers of this domain, I see the word fundamentally differently.
Technology has always been about the amplification of the human be ing. About augmenting them with new capabilities, not about making them irrelevant.
On Design Thinking
We are starting Design Thinking training in a massive way . We have already done sessions for many of our leaders, for example in consulting and our sales leadership, together with Stanford University's d.school (design school). We are putting together a very large design thinking training session for all Infosys employees at Mysore as well as our development centres. This will help us train tens of thousands of Infosys employees on Design Thinking over the next few months.
On Target Margins
It is too early to forecast that, but based on the strategy that I have articulated, we should be able to get into 15-18% growth in the long term, and 25-28% margins. I see no reason why, over a long term, we couldn't achieve such numbers.
On Acquisitions
The key idea is to not acquire yesterday's products and services companies, but to acquire capabilities and skills of tomorrow that help us grow in areas that are strategic to us.Beyond the technology and the skills, we also want to use the inorganic strategy to get into some other penetrative but high-growth areas, and some geographies, where acquisitions can help us achieve our objectives faster.
On Working With Startups
Infosys can enable startups to attain great engineering speed, scale and global reach by helping them amplify their development at the right moment, combined with joint go-tomarket where we can help bring startups to our clients. Strategic investment from our $100-million venture fund, to help bring Infosys into close collaboration with today's startups, will lead to great companies of the future.
On Sales Team
We do see meaningful changes on the sales front. Our sales team is actively engaged in renewing its own capabilities through both reskilling and retraining, and bringing in new talent. We have already done Design Thinking training sessions with our sales players.
On Finacle
Our Finacle business did not have such a great quarter, and posted a 5.4% decline in quarter-on-quarter revenue. We just announced a leadership change for this unit, and we will be executing plans on several dimensions to return this business to growth and success.
On Renewing Business Lines
When we think about renewing the landscape, we believe that everyone, in every business, in every industry, needs to renew their existing systems and processes, and for Infosys this means a renewal of our existing business lines.
On Offering Next Gen Services
Every service that we offer today will be renewed on the basis of innovation, automation and improvements in process efficiency . As such there is no old or new service. It is simply an old way or a new way of doing the same services. In addition to renewing the services that we have today , we believe that there is an additional need for new kinds of technology such as new kinds of platforms for new data, machine learning, big data and so forth.

Amazon to steer clear of deep price cuts in Diwali saleAmazon
(Under pressure from big…)
KOLKATA: Call it the Flipkart effect: Amazon India was careful not to make too big a splash as it kicked off the October 10-16 Diwali Dhamaka Sales.
Under pressure from big consumer electronics brands such as Samsung, Sony and LG, the online marketplace steered clear of deep price cuts on the first day, except on products meant solely for sale on Amazon or end-of-life items. Such goods were available at discounts of more than 50%.
Flipkart's Oct 6 Big Billion Day sale generated a massive rush for products at deep discounts, generating complaints as prospective buyers were unable to get the bargains they wanted, prompting the company to send out a public apology.
But the episode also sparked a backlash from traditional retailers who complained about what they said was predatory pricing, persuading the government to say it would look into the matter. Big brands unhappy about online price cuts also came out in support of traditional retail channels.
With Amazon India seemingly toeing the line, Sony and Samsung have promised to work closely with it, a person with direct knowledge of the development said. Hewlett-Packard India joined other manufacturers in advising vendors not to sell online on Friday. LG, HTC and Sony had previously issued similar trade advisories.
"HP has released a number of offers for customers who purchase through HP authorised partners this festive season. The benefits of these are not available for products purchased from unauthorised HP sellers, which includes some online portals," said a HP India spokesperson.
Sony, HTC and others also heavily advertised their own Diwali offers, which are available only in brick-and mortar stores. Diwali falls on October 23. HTC India country head Faisal Siddiqui said the company has been persuading all its partners, including Amazon, to maintain pricing.
Offline Retailers Less Agitated
"Our prices are largely intact on all online portals, and wherever it is not, we are constantly having dialogue with them," Siddiqui said. For instance, HTC raised the issue of its Desire 616 smartphone being discounted on Amazon. Offline retailers seem to be less agitated about the Amazon India sale than about the Flipkart one.
Deals available on the site on the opening day were moderate, said Himanshu Chakrawarti, CEO of The Mobile Store, the country's largest cellphone retailer.
  "None of the popular models were on crazy pricing at least on the first day. However, there were a couple of current models for which we would take up the issue with manufacturers," he said.
Croma, which runs brick-and-mortar stores and is also one of the leading sellers on Amazon India, did not participate in the Diwali sale. Its agreement with the marketplace ensures that no product listed by it can be too heavily discounted.
"We have a very robust and strong relationship with suppliers and manufacturers and very conscious of their pricing guidelines. Our arrangement with marketplaces like eBay, Snapdeal and Amazon are in the same spirit. Being a Tata Group company, our business is governed by ethics and fair practices," said Ajit Joshi, CEO and managing director at Infiniti Retail, which runs the Croma chain.
Most of the big deals on the sale's first day were on brands such as Micromax, Asus, Philips, Pentax and Netgear. Big discounts on Lenovo and Acer tablets were for models exclusive to Amazon. Exceptions were few, such as the Apple iPad Air, HP and Dell laptops, Nokia Lumia 625, Google Nexus 5 and an LG TV model, although big bargains on these were hard to spot.
ET reported Friday that Canon, Videocon and others entered into agreements with Amazon to offer special discounts on models not sold in brick-and-mortar stores, besides persuading it to hold the price line on others to the rate at which offline retail buys from the manufacturers.

Offline mobile phone sellers want e-tailers to curb  predatory pricesAll India Mobile Retailers Association
(“We don’t want that…)
NEW DELHI: A grouping of small and medium-sized mobile phone retailers has decided to seek the formation of an independent regulatory authority to ensure a level playing field between online and brick-and-mortar stores, days after it urged the government to conduct an inquiry into the massively discounted prices offered by competing e-tailers.
Hurt by the "predatory prices" offered by e-commerce players such as Amazon , Flipkart and Snapdeal during the ongoing sales in the run-up to Diwali, the All India Mobile Retailers Association (AIMRA) general secretary Dheeraj Malik said the body wants all retailers to follow fair trade practices.
"We don't want that online retail alone should be regulated; the rules should be same for all retailers, online or offline. We want a level playing field," Malik told ET after the body held its first national-level meeting late Thursday night.
Mobile phones are among the highest selling products on online portals. During the festive season, sale volumes for all consumer products rise dramatically and retailer margins rise from 10-15% to up to 20%.
Malik said the association was talking to the government and had met minister of state for commerce and industry Nirmala Sitharaman on Wednesday, seeking an inquiry committee into the discounts being offered by the etailers.
Flipkart clocked about Rs 600 crore in sales in just 10 hours, with its site recording one billion hits in a day-long pre-Diwali discount sale on Monday.
Online sales account for just 1% of India'sRs 30 lakh crore retail industry but are projected to grow rapidly.
Softening their stand on boycotting certain brands, retailers said they will work with brands to ensure continuity of business but make them aware of problems caused by rampant and heavy discounting online.
"We do not want the consumer to get a raw deal. They should have the option of online pricing, but the discounting is so high it is threatening the business of hundreds of retailers and the indirect industry it supports," Malik said.

Amazon in talks to acquire Jabong; move a counter to Flipkart's Myntra buy?

Amazon
( A regulatory filing by…)
BANGALORE: Amazon is in preliminary talks to buy Jabong, part of the US-based online retailer's plan to bolster its presence selling fashion products, four people aware of the discussions told ET.
Jabong is one of the fashion portals that Amazon is interested in acquiring, and Jabong has other suitors, the sources said, cautioning that a deal is not imminent. A regulatory filing by Rocket Internet, which incubated Jabong, put the value of the fashion portal at 388 million euros, or $500 million (Rs 3,000 crore).
A person with direct knowledge of negotiations said that Jabong is holding out for much more — at least $700 million. Amazon said it does "not comment on anything we may or may not do in the future". Jabong did not reply to emailed questions.
Deal to be complicated
"After Myntra got acquired by Flipkart, Jabong is the ideal candidate," said a person who is working closely with Amazon on the negotiation. A big chunk of the $2 billion that Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has promised to invest in India is meant for acquisitions, this person said. Amazon is battling leader Flipkart for dominance in one of the world's fastest-growing markets for online retail, expected to reach Rs 50,000 crore by 2016 according to consultancy Crisil .
Last month, Bezos told ET that the value of goods sold by Amazon India in a year had topped $1 billion and that fashion was one of the "exciting frontiers" for the Seattlebased company. Jabong, which counts Germany's Rocket Internet and Swedish investment firm Kinnevik among its investors, is the secondlargest fashion portal in India after Myntra, which was acquired by Flipkart in May for an estimated value of $370 million.
According to industry estimates, the Flipkart-Myntra combine has a market share of over 50% in fashion retail and Jabong 25%. Fashionara and Limeroad are the other significant fashion portals. ET has not been able to establish if they are in talks with Amazon. For Amazon, getting it right in India is vital to its fortunes, especially because its presence in China is negligible where Alibaba dominates.
And the key to getting it right in India lies in fashion, the fastest-growing category for online retailers. According to retail consultancy Technopak, fashion accounts for 25% of the online retail industry's sales. To boot, operating margins in fashion are around 35% in an industry where gross margins are in negative territory.
Amazon India started offering fashion products on its marketplace in May, and an acquisition offers a swift route to scaling up. In the United States, Amazon chose a similar strategy to improve its fashion credentials by buying Zappos in 2009. Shares of UK-based clothing portal Asos have been on the rise after rumours of an acquisition by Amazon.
A deal with Jabong, while it may be desirable, will be complicated, said a source who is directly involved in the talks. The complication arises from the fact that in September, investors Rocket and Kinnevik began the process of merging five of their international fashion ecommerce companies, including Jabong, into a single global entity.

Case study: How Starbucks survived financial crisis of 2008Print
Founded in 1971 in Seattle, Starbucks is present in 50 states in the US and 43 countries. It is one of the most respected brands, winning awards such as "Best Business", "Most Admired Company", "100 Best Corporate Citizens" and so on. While its quality is unquestionable, its price has always been higher than those offered by the domestic coffee houses in various countries.
This was one of the reasons why the company took a hit during the economic slowdown of 2008 as customers opted for cheaper options for their everyday coffee. Starbucks was forced to shut 600 shops that were not making profits. By March 30, 2008, its profit had fallen 28 per cent compared to the same period in 2007. In 2009, it closed another 300 stores and laid off 6,700 employees.
On January 8, 2008, Howard D. Schultz returned as CEO of Starbucks after a gap of eight years, replacing Jim Donald. Schultz had nurtured the company since 1982 when it had only four outlets. He had served as CEO from 1987 to 2000 and had presided over the companys public offering in 1992.
Upon coming back, he found that apart from the worsening economic condition in the US, the company's rapid expansion had distracted it from making its cafes an inviting place with new products. In addition, Starbucks also faced competition from McDonald's, which had, in 2008, started setting up coffee bars that sold espresso.
Schultz shot off a letter to the employees on the day he took office once again as CEO. He said, "The company must shift its focus away from bureaucracy and back to customers." He made his objective very clear: "Reigniting the emotional attachment with customers.
"The previous leadership had blamed the economy and the higher cost of dairy products for the slump in business. They had also stated this as a reason to hike prices. However, Schultz took an entirely different view of the situation. He told the employees, "The company shouldn't just blame the economy; Starbucks's heavy spending to accommodate its expansion has created a bureaucracy that masked its problems."
In a departure from conventional strategies like "a redo of the store layout", Starbucks soon embarked on a technology-oriented strategy. An environment where employees could think freely about the organisation and contribute in terms of strategies and ideas was fostered. As a result, a community involvement concept was developed.
In March 2008, "My Starbucks Idea" was rolled out for customers to exchange ideas with each other and directly with the company. As part of this, customers were able to give opinions on everything such as products, services, layout, advertising, corporate social responsibility, in-store music and so on. More than 93,000 ideas were shared by about 1.3 million users on social media, and page views per month rose to 5.5 million.
After the 2007/08 crisis, Starbucks had to rebuild its customer relationships and show the world that it cared for quality and consistency. It also had to give a leg up to the altruistic component of the brand such as community building and care for the environment. Through the "My Starbucks Idea" customers had a direct link with the headquarters and of course Starbucks was listening. Soon Starbucks's ubiquity became an asset as customers from around the world had an opportunity to connect with each other, spawning like-minded communities like the 'free Wi-Fi group', 'soy group', 'comfy chair group' or 'frappuccino lovers'.
Starbucks implemented over 100 ideas. Through this initiative, the coffee retailer built a robust fan base. By giving customers a platform to voice their ideas and views on the brand and by responding to it, it was able to reignite the brand trust.
Starbucks soon realised that it had to project its 'cool' element via social media-based marketing. The organisation must never look desperate or too keen to increase its sales. So the company refrained from pushing too many products, causes or offers to its followers. The focus was more on building and engaging with the community.
One of the accidental tweets from Starbucks was just a smiley face that received a lot of admiration from the community. Tweets such as 'keep calm and make coffee' is in line with its idea of keeping a cool image and building a community. Starbucks's use of social media points to the fine balance it maintained between spontaneous and well-planned posts. The social media platforms have also helped the company swiftly mitigate and manage any information that causes harm to its global identity. In 2009, when rumours of Starbucks's profits being spent on Israel army surfaced, the company used the social media outlets effectively to refute it and restore its image of a peace-loving organisation.
Mobile Apps
The company embraced mobile apps much before its competitors. Very early in the race, Starbucks had linked its social media strategy objectives with technology channels like mobile apps. It was carefully designed to appeal to the masses and specifically to the segment that made up its online community. Through its iPhone app features like store locator, nutrition-based information and rewards programme, it integrated and enhanced its social media community fabric. The head start in technology adoption has helped the company come up with trend-setting ideas.
One of them was the move to help its customers personalise the company's offerings. The initiative, 'MyStarbucksSignature' allowed consumers to develop their own signature drinks (hot or cold coffee), name the drink and share the new flavour with the community. In this way, Starbucks informs the consumer of the wide range of product offering they have at their stores across the world. It also shows the consumer how to order this cup and what it will look like. The only modification a consumer can do in his or her signature drink is in the ingredient mix and quantity. This way the supply network is only slightly disrupted at the retail and service end. Everything else related to ingredients and distribution remains completely untouched.
In 2008, the marketing teams had started a promotion to increase customer visits to stores during breakfast hours. It included a free pastry with a coffee bought before 10:30 a.m. The initiative created traction online and over one million people across the US queued up at Starbucks outlets.
Such social media promotions were much less expensive than the companys promotions at its stores or putting up billboards across cities. The awareness and response was also more than that from promotions through traditional channels like television advertisements.
Employees and baristas too were always an integral part of Starbucks online and social media community. It has a separate page for its employees, which is used to generate and debate ideas.
An example of employees contributing to its success is its Twitter page. The chain's voice on Twitter is 28-year-old Brad Nelson, a former barista. In 2008, when the company was looking for ideas to re-engage with its customers, Nelson suggested that he could begin a Twitter handle for the brand. Today, Starbucks has 775,000 followers.
Conclusion
Starbucks is a great example of a brand turning around its business by returning to its roots and reconnecting directly with its customers.
While many companies are struggling to get back to pre-2007 financial figures, Starbucks has shown that people are willing to spend $5 or 3 pound every day on their latte and tweet about it too.

EXPERTS' VIEW
ALIGNING BUSINESS OBJECTIVES AND SOCIAL MEDIA ACTIONS IS KEY
The crisis at Starbucks was as much the result of the economic recession as due to the expansion of the store network in the previous years. To reconnect with its customers, Starbucks used social media to engage individual customers with its products and brand.
'My Starbucks Idea', set up for customers to exchange ideas, helped the company understand their needs and concerns. Such a strategy could have been dangerous if the company had ignored the customers' suggestions. But Starbucks was responsive and showed that it cared about their customers.
The 'MyStarbucksSignature' initiative, where customers could create their own personalised drinks, showcased the Starbucks assortment, created an interactive experience that involved customers in product creation and taught them how to order such drinks, while making it a fun activity that can be shared with friends. Again, there could be operational pitfalls.
If customisation slows down in-store processes, such initiative can be unsuccessful. So Starbucks integrated 'customisation' into its existing processes. While in the past, Starbucks, as well as other companies, have implemented social media activities, it remains challenging for many to understand the effectiveness of individual social media activities.
Even for Starbucks it may be difficult to judge the relative effectiveness of the individual marketing activities since many were implemented at a time when it was closing down a number of stores. Going forward, it becomes important for firms to evaluate what types of social media activities actually increase revenues. Nonetheless, the case showcases how social media can be used to reignite a brand - especially if the company manages to align its operations with changes to customers' demand for products.
STARBUCKS HAS CREATED VALUE THROUGH SOCIAL CO-CREATION
Co-creation for co-creation sake has little meaning; it needs to be tightly aligned to your business objectives. For Starbucks, understanding its own challenges in the face of the downturn, and the crystallisation of its needs to innovate led to a brilliant move: social co-creation.
This strategy has established a large active online community that influences the company's product strategy, and gathers suggestions on every aspect of its operations. But just having a phenomenal community of product co-creators does not mean that all problems can be presented to, and solved by, the same community. Starbucks? Shared Planet? is the company's commitment to do business in ways that are good for people and the planet.
When Starbucks needed to tackle a specific complex problem - reducing waste generated by its disposable cups - it recognised that the same community that it was engaging with in its ideation site, My Starbucks Idea, was not helpful. Starbucks soon realised that when it comes to co-creation, the platform you need very much depends on the problem you are trying to solve.
It needed an audience that cared about the issue, a new strategy and a new technology. Eventually, Starbucks teamed up with Mutopo, a social co-creation agency that led a group of environmentally conscious, social-media savvy entrepreneurs to solve this problem.
Starbucks' ability to use technology to capture ideas, votes, and comments from its three key broad participant groups - customers, employees, and partners - has created value for the company. It is amongst names like Lego, Ford, and Verizon, who are driving innovation as a sustainable value creation strategy. Starbucks is a company to watch out for as its continues to innovate; a story where every customer is a stakeholder and very vested in the company.
BEST OF THE LOT
BT receives many responses to its case studies.
Below is the best one on Nike (July 6, 2014)
The perspective that Nike moved to pushing the technological boundaries of innovation and then onwards to social media is correct but misses the big picture. As do most analysts by continuing to look at the company as evolving from one category to another. If that were the case, the recent development of Nike pulling out of wearables would seem to suggest that the company's strategy is floundering.
Instead, Nike has positioned itself at the centre of a mass movement towards health and general wellness. Nike today owns this space as well as a multimillion community of active runners and thought leaders. This opens up a plethora of possibilities for the company and also makes it a critical partner for all businesses wanting to reach out to this audience.
There are rumours already of a potential engagement with the impending Apple iWatch! In today's age, it is no longer the specific product that a company brings to market at a given time that is the defining moment. Nike has created and attained an unassailable leadership position, and will be a force to reckon with as the market evolves.

Auto revival  lower rubber augur well for tyre cos: BNPApollo Tyres
(We could slip further down.…)
In an interview with ET Now, Gaurang Shah, VP, Geojit BNP Paribas Financial Services, shares his views on some sectors and stocks. Excerpts:
ET Now: What did you make of the Infosys numbers and the commentary? Would you be comfortable buying the stock after the run-up that we have seen or are there better places available?
Gaurang Shah: I am still positive on the IT sector starting with Infosys, TCS, HCL Tech, Tech Mahindra, Persistent Systems and MindTree, to name a few of them. It is an opportunity to buy because just a couple of days back you had one of the foreign institutions coming out with the sell side report and an underperforming rating for the IT sector. We saw the stock correct.
At the current levels, we are still advising to buy it on dips. We saw about 6-7% run up post the numbers on Friday morning. My guess is that on dips one can definitely go and buy into Infosys and with the numbers I would say that yes it has pleasantly surprised the street. The commentary that has come out from Mr Vishal Sikka would translate into more positivities and growth going forward.
The only big question mark is how they are going to utilise the cash that is there on the balance sheet. Over there you will also see some amount of positivities as we go forward from here on. We have set aside a target of 4050 from mid to long-term time horizon and if the leadership of Mr Sikka translates into more positivities -- that is visible on quarter on quarter numbers -- those targets on Infosys could be revised upward. So maybe somebody with risk appetite can buy at the current levels or can use dips to get into Infosys.
ET Now: It has been a phenomenal ride for Apollo Tyres ever since the FII limit got hiked and not just Apollo, in fact the entire sector has been raring to go. What is the sense that you are getting - has the bus already left or do you think there is still time to catch up and make money there?
Gaurang Shah: There is still opportunity to make money in the entire tyre segment. Lower rubber prices in the commodity market has augured very well for all the tyre manufacturing companies starting with the larger boys like MRF, Ceat, Apollo, JK Tyres, etc. It is going to be prudent to see where do the rubber prices lie going forward in the future in the commodity market and what anticipation one has.
If you look at the revival of the auto sector, both two wheeler, four wheeler, MCV, HCV, etc, and you look at the replacement market which again is a big contributor to the top line and bottom line number for the tyre manufacturing companies, my understanding is that the going has just started being good for some of the ancillary companies like tyre industry in the automobile sector and you could use dips.
We could possibly slip further down. Those are the bad days when you can actually go ahead and buy into a name like Ceat, Apollo and the top notch companies in this entire segment. You could possibly nibble into all these stocks maybe at current levels if you have risk appetite or wait for a dip and then get into it. But the revival of the auto industry and lower rubber prices certainly augur well for the tyre manufacturing companies.
ET Now: What do you expect between Hero and Bajaj or for that matter the other two wheeler stocks, which one would you watch out for the most?
Gaurang Shah: Certainly the weightage goes towards Hero MotoCorp and if you actually go to see the kind of contribution that has come in from the automated scooter segment not only for Hero MotoCorp but even for TVS Motor, it augurs extremely well for these two companies.
Unfortunately Bajaj Auto, who is actually the pioneer of scooters in India and once upon a time had a huge monopoly in this particular segment, does not have this product. So that is where the concern is. New launches and of course the margins picture seems to be much better with Hero MotoCorp and TVS Motors compared to Bajaj Auto and my view would be that going forward, given that you had almost about three to four months of revival of two wheeler and four wheeler as far as month on month numbers are concerned, you have a possibility that in the first quarter or first half of 2015 calendar you have interest rates cuts coming in.
This should also be positive for two wheeler and four wheeler car manufacturing companies. As an investment idea, our earlier bias was Bajaj Auto, but that bias is now shifted to Hero MotoCorp and TVS Motors given the niche edge they have as far as the automated scooter segment is concerned. So you would possibly see more positivities emerging post the numbers for Hero MotoCorp and TVS Motors rather than Bajaj Auto.
ET Now: You also track Reliance pretty closely. While there is still an impending decision on the gas price hike, what is it that you are expecting from the company in terms of earnings this quarter?

Nifty downtrend confirmed if it slips below 7 808 levelsNifty downtrend will be confirmed if it slips below 7,808

(We expected correction…)
By Mazhar Mohammad
MUMBAI: Scary fall of the last few trading sessions, both on domestic and international bourses, failed to conclusively damage the uptrend prevalent in Nifty.
We expected correction not to exceed beyond 7,840 levels but markets in its wisdom has breached this critical level on intraday basis and chosen to bottom out at a low of 7,815 registered on October, 08.
This intraday breach nullified our preferred wave count but still we have two more alternative wave counts which are adhering to all the rules and principles of Elliott Wave Theory.
Hence despite global jitters and a scary fall even after 'positive noise' out of minutes released by Federal Reserve , we remain positive and based on Elliott wave counts and weight of technical evidence present with us we categorically conclude uptrend shall remain intact as long as Nifty trades above 7,808 level.
For this up move, internal wave structure relationships are projecting targets present in the zone of 8,212 - 8,272. If markets doesn't top out in this zone then based on Elliott Wave Logics this move can extend maximum to the level of 8,455/8,554 before concluding this ongoing leg of up move. However, if market breaches the level of 7,808 then downtrend will be confirmed.
Our alternative wave counts will become invalid and we have to retain our preferred count and will be forced to conclude that Nifty made a truncated top, in Elliot Wave Terminology, at a recent high of 8,160 registered on September,19 against absolute top of 8,180 registered on September,08.
In such a scenario we have to conclude that market trend is down and should be ready for sharp cuts and multi month corrective or consolidation phase(may be for another 1-2 months) . Based on this technical evidence we recommend aggressive traders to create long positions with a tight stop below 7,808 for targets of 8,200 levels on Nifty.
In simple words market trend will remain up as long as Nifty trades above 7808 level and downtrend will kick in if this level is violated.
Support: 7846, 7815, 7784 Resistance: 7924, 7947

Rushdie to share PEN Pinter prize with Syrian activist
Alison Flood
books and literature
Salman Rushdie hopes to “shine a light on [the] plight” of the imprisoned Syrian human rights activist Mazen Darwish by sharing his PEN Pinter prize with the journalist and lawyer.
Darwish, founding president of the Syrian Centre for Media and Freedom of Expression (SCM), a 10-year-old organisation that has documented the human rights abuses in Syria since 2011, was arrested on 16 February 2012, according to English PEN. In March this year, he was charged with “publicising terrorist acts.” If he is convicted, he could go to prison for up to 15 years.
“Darwish courageously fought for civilised values — free expression, human rights — in one of the most dangerous places in the world,” said Rushdie. “His continued detention is arbitrary and unjust. He should be freed immediately, and we must hope this award may help, by shining a light on his plight.” The prize was set up in 2009 in memory of the Nobel laureate Pinter, and is given to a writer who judges decide “exemplifies the spirit of Harold Pinter through his or her engagement with the times”, and who, as in Pinter’s own Nobel speech, casts an “unflinching, unswerving” gaze upon the world and shows “a fierce intellectual determination to define the real truth of our lives and our societies.”
Rushdie was chosen this summer for what chair of judges Maureen Freely said were his “many years of speaking out for freedom of expression, but also for his countless private acts of kindness. When he sees writers unjustly vilified, prosecuted or forced into exile, he takes a personal interest.” The British winners — who have included Carol Ann Duffy, David Hare, Hanif Kureishi and Tony Harrison — are then asked to share the prize with an international writer “who is active in defence of freedom of expression, often at great risk to their own safety.”
Rushdie announced that Darwish would receive this year’s international writer of courage award at an event at the British Library this evening. It was accepted on Darwish’s behalf by the Syrian researcher and writer Zaher Omareen.
“There could not be a more appropriate and deserving choice in view of the current situation in Syria, one that speaks directly to the ideals of PEN,” said the author Antonia Fraser, Pinter’s widow.
Freely, president of English PEN, added: “During this time when yet again Syria is capturing headlines around the world, we must not forget that creative defenders of free expression are detained and possibly tortured. Particularly at times of conflict we depend on the voices of calm and principled reason.”
The writers’ group also pointed to “widespread fears that Darwish and his co—defendants have been tortured and ill—treated, and that evidence extracted under torture may be used against them.” — Guardian Newspapers Limited, 2014

Should power producers be compensated for bidsbusiness environment
( With the coal blocks judgement hogging…)
On August 25, the Supreme Court handed down a major judgement on the coal block allocation policy of the government. It called the manner such blocks were allotted 'ad-hoc' and 'without application of mind'. Given that nearly 60% of the power capacity in the country runs on coal, it was a judgement with major implications for the sector. But on the same day in the Supreme Court itself, an episode of another case of critical importance for the power sector was played out. With the coal blocks judgement hogging the headlines the next day, the other case received lesser attention.
Pitted against each other in this fight were, on the one hand, two power distribution companies (discoms) in Haryana; and, on the other, two of the largest power generating companies in the country, Tata Power and Adani Power. And while the SC did not hand down a final judgement in that case, what the judges said in the hearing on that day made a lot of people sit up and take notice.
The hearing centred on what has come to be known as the compensatory tariffs case. Whichever way the case finally gets decided, it is clear that the implications, both legal and financial, for the power sector are huge. Even the immediate consequences were hardly minor.
Barely two days after the hearing, Adani Power yanked 1,424 MW of power that it supplies to Haryana from its giant Mundra plant in Gujarat, though it later claimed that the event was unrelated to the SC hearing. It was forced to restore supplies earlier this week following a critical and sharply-worded ruling from APTEL — the appellate tribunal for the electricity sector (on a par with a high court). "Yes, Adani has restored power to us between October 3 and 4," says an engineer with Uttar Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam, one of the Haryana utilities.
APTEL is also the forum that is currently hearing the overall compensatory tariffs case. And even though the case has not reached its final conclusion, it has spawned a bunch of me-too cases in various courts across the country with companies asking for compensation for everything from unexpectedly sharp rupee depreciation to higher taxes to increases in land acquisition costs. All this, after signing supposedly binding contracts with state utilities.
Predicting Prices
At the heart of the case are two bids launched in 2007 and 2008 by states such as Haryana and Gujarat, among others — asking generation companies to compete for the right to supply power (the winner is the one that bids for the lowest tariff for the power). Adani and Tata were the winners in those two bids, and they bid the tariffs on the understanding that they would absorb changes in the cost of coal over the life of the bid, though they had the choice to make a bid in a way so as to pass on fuel costs to customers (the discoms). Both companies decided to import coal from Indonesian mines for the projects, located in Gujarat.
  A couple of years after Adani and Tata signed the power purchase pacts, Indonesia introduced new rules which set a minimum export price for coal, linked to international benchmarks. Effectively, this pushed up the price of coal for any company importing the commodity from Indonesia, though for the two companies in question, the impact was lower, since they owned equity stakes in the mines they bought coal from. This new law, coupled with the sharp rise in international coal prices at the time, and the weak supplies of domestic coal, made the companies throw up their hands and tell their customers that the power tariffs they had bid were now unviable, and that these should be revised. Further, they asked for compensation for the power they had already supplied at the existing tariffs citing major losses.
The case eventually ended up in the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) where Adani and Tata claimed that two clauses in the power agreements — the so-called standard 'force majeure' clause (which allows parties to revise a contract when events occur which are beyond their control, like war) and the 'change in law' clause — allowed them the right to compensation. Interestingly, the CERC rejected both these claims but allowed compensation anyway in a ruling in April last year, and appointed a committee to decide the amount.
In February this year, it decided that Tata should get about `329 crore in past compensation, and that Adani should get `829 crore. The judgement was appealed by states such as Haryana, and APTEL, in July this year, stayed the payment of past claims, but asked states to pay the revised tariffs from this year, till a final ruling in the case. Haryana appealed this ruling as well, and it was this case that ended up in the Supreme Court, and was heard on August 25.

Fed says global slowdown could push back US ...Federal Reserve officials say global slowdown could push back US rate hike
By Reuters | 12 Oct, 2014, 07.09AM IST
Federal Reserve officials took stock of a slowdown in the global economy and said it could delay an increase in US interest rates if serious enough.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
WASHINGTON: Federal Reserve officials on Saturday took stock of a slowdown in the global economy and said it could delay an increase in US interest rates if serious enough.
Most notably, Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer said the effort to finally normalize US monetary policy after years of extraordinary stimulus may be hampered by the global outlook.
"If foreign growth is weaker than anticipated, the consequences for the US economy could lead the Fed to remove accommodation more slowly than otherwise," he said at an event sponsored by International Monetary Fund.
Nevertheless, he said betting in financial markets on the timing of a US rate hike appeared "roughly" on the mark given the Fed's current expectations on how the economy's recovery would unfold.
The IMF trimmed its global growth forecast ahead of its fall meetings this weekend, where discussions focused on ways to stimulate global demand and prevent the euro zone from slipping back into recession.
"I am worried about growth around the world, there are more downside risks than upside risks," Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo said at a conference the Institute of International Finance sponsored on the sidelines. "This is obviously something we have to think about in our own policies."
Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Evans said a strengthening of the dollar and weak growth abroad could mean slower inflation in the United States, and less justification for the US central bank to raise rates.
The renewed concerns about Europe could represent a serious complication for the Fed, which had been expected to begin bumping up benchmark borrowing costs in the middle of next year.
Fischer spoke in part to calm concerns among developing nations about a potential tightening in US monetary policy, saying the Fed would only move rates higher if the US economy was ready for it. Overall, he said, rising borrowing costs in the United States were unlikely to disrupt flows of capital and investment around the world.

Delhi-Agra high speed train to be named Gati...Arunendra Kumar
(To be flagged off from New…)
NEW DELHI: The semi-high speed train that proposes to reduce travelling time between Delhi and Agra to 105 minutes will be named Gatimaan Express and will have LCD TVs installed behind each seat and emergency braking system.
To be flagged off from New Delhi station next month, the train's name has been chosen because of its capability of running at 160 km per hour speed, the maximum till date in Indian Railways, a senior Railway Ministry official said.
Equipped with comfortable seating arrangement, there will be eight-inch LCD TV screens installed behind each seat, the official said, adding there will also be automatic fire alarm with emergency braking system and passenger information system.
However, in the initial days, the passengers of Gatimaan Express will have the opportunity of watching pre-recording programmes only as the live feed will be provided later on.
The first semi-high speed service of the Railways is considered to be a boon for tourists visiting the city of Taj Mahal .
"We have sought safety certificate from Commissioner Railway Safety to run the semi-high speed train next month as all necessary preparations are being completed now," Railway Board Chairman Arunendra Kumar said.
Asked when the train is scheduled to be flagged off, he said, "The date will be decided after getting the safety certificate but certainly before November 30."
Railways has already conducted two trials of the train in the past and all other arrangements like fencing off certain areas along the route and upgrading of signalling system are being carried out.
Equipped with a 5,400HP electric locomotive, the train will run at maximum speed of 160 km per hour and is expected to cover the 200 km distance in about 105 minutes.
There are 14 new LHB AC coaches manufactured at Rail Coach Factory at Kapurthala for the train and expected to roll out by month end, said a senior Railway Ministry official.
While 12 coaches will be used for daily running, two will be kept as spare ones, the official added.
The train will have Executive Class and Chair Car category of seats and also catering facility.
Railway authorities are also planning to launch similar trains in eight more routes including Delhi to Kanpur and Delhi to Chandigarh.

Strong winds  heavy rains in coastal Andhra ahead of Hudhud strikeCyclone Hudhud
(According to the latest…)
HYDERABAD: Strong winds and heavy rains led to large-scale disruption of power lines in three coastal districts of Andhra Pradesh as the state braced for Hudhud, a very severe cyclonic storm that is expected to hit the coast around noon today.
"Except East Godavari, power entirely failed in the three districts of Visakhapatnam, Vizianagaram and Srikakulam (which are expected to bear the brunt). There were gale winds. The situation is very severe. National Highway in the region has been shut," Special Commissioner, State Disaster Management Authority, K Hymavathi said.
Tens of thousands of people had been evacuated from vulnerable areas of the four districts.
According to the latest bulletin of Indian Meteorological Department , the storm would cross close to the port city of Visakhapatnam around noon.
Wind speed reaching 70-80 kmph gusting to 90 kmph would prevail along and off north Andhra Pradesh and south Odisha coasts this morning.
The wind speed would gradually increase to 170-180 kmph gusting to 195 kmph around the time of landfall along and off north Andhra Pradesh (East Godavari, Visakhapatnam, Vizianagaram and Srikakulam districts) and 80-90 kmph along and off adjoining districts of Andhra Pradesh (West Godavari & Krishna districts) and south Odisha (Ganjam, Gajapati, Koraput and Malkangiri districts).
The department warned that storm surge of about 1-2 metres above astronomical tide would inundate low lying areas of Visakhapatnam, Vijayanagaram and Srikakulam districts of north coastal Andhra Pradesh at the time of landfall.
"Even after landfall the system would maintain the intensity of very severe cyclonic storm for six hours and gradually weaken into a cyclonic storm in subsequent six hours while moving northwestwards across south interior Odisha and Chhattisgarh," the bulletin said.
Andhra Pradesh government has identified 356 villages in 59 mandals of the four districts as cyclone-prone. More than 300 relief camps have been opened.
As many as 19 National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) teams (each consisting of 45-50 members) were deployed in the four districts.
Army columns are positioned at Visakhapatnam and Srikakulam with power boats and other equipment for rescue and relief. Six helicopters have been positioned in the Naval base at Visakhapatnam.
The Indian Air Force has tasked Headquarters Training Command, Bangalore to be the nodal agency for all relief operations in connection with severe cyclone Hudhud .
Earlier this year, a disaster relief conclave was held at Hyderabad wherein officials from all concerned agencies participated.
All relief operations will be undertaken by the IAF under the leadership of Air Marshal Ramesh Rai, Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Headquarters Training Command.
"Sufficient number of aircraft are kept in readiness for this relief operation," the IAF said. PTI RS ABH DV 10120828 NNNN
Heavy rains are being reported from coastal districts of Srikakulam, Vizianagaram, Visakhapatnam, East and West Godavari districts under the influence of the system.
Consequently, downpour and gales have caused damage to crops and civic infrastructure like electric poles as well as roads, reports from the cyclone-hit districts said.
The Andhra Pradesh government has appealed to the people of the coastal districts once again, to remain indoors or move to safer places including cyclone shelters and relief camps for safety.

Rupee sees biggest single-day gain in nearly 2 monthsforeign exchange market
The rupee posted its biggest single-day gain in nearly two months on Thursday, after hitting the highest level in more than two weeks after the U.S. Federal Reserve's September policy meeting minutes suggested it was in no hurry to raise interest rates.
The dollar fell to a three-week low against the yen, as investors cut favourable bets after minutes of the U.S. Federal Reserve's last meeting prompted many to push out expectations for the likely timing of an interest rate rise.
The index of the dollar against six major currencies was down 0.22 percent with most Asian currencies also rallying against the greenback.
“The dollar took quite a beating and we saw domestic equities rally, both together helped the rupee gain,” said Naveen Raghuvanshi, a foreign exchange dealer with DCB Bank.
“We could see the pair touch 60.80 going by technicals but there is good state-run bank buying around 61 levels. Broadly the near-term range is likely to be 60.80 to 61.40/45,” he added.
Traders are now awaiting retail and wholesale inflation data and factory output data due to be released next week for domestic cues.
The partially convertible rupee closed at 61.04/05 per dollar compared with 61.3950/4050 on Thursday. The rupee touched 60.9025 earlier, its strongest level since September 23. The rupee gained for a fourth straight day, rising 0.6 percent, its biggest single-day gain since August 14.
Gains in the domestic share market also helped with good dollar selling seen by custodian banks.
Indian shares rose 1.5 percent, snapping a three-day losing streak, as hopes the Federal Reserve would not rush into raising U.S. interest rates boosted heavyweight banks and blue chips such as Bharat heavy Electricals Ltd.
Traders will continue to monitor shares for clues on the direction of foreign fund flows. Foreign funds have bought a net $13.95 billion in equities and $20 billion in debt so far in 2014.
In the offshore non-deliverable forwards, the one-month contract was at 61.35 while the three-month was at 61.95.

As floods struck  J&K govt. went missing: SC panelflood
A Supreme Court-appointed committee on the “catastrophic floods” in Jammu and Kashmir details the failures of the State government — from failing to evacuate people residing in vulnerable areas to leaving the victims to “fend for themselves” with hardly any food or drinking water.
The committee, in its field report dated October 9, recorded the statements of survivors who said supply of free ration that was promised did not reach them, that they still lived mostly in makeshift places with hardly any blankets for the oncoming winter and no ex-gratia had been paid to them.
The report said doctors deputed to the State by the Centre have either been sent back or remain there with no work while stinking garbage line the streets along with animal carcasses.
The committee was set up by a three-judge Bench led by Chief Justice of India (retired) R.M. Lodha on writ petitions filed lawyers and activists, represented by senior advocate Colin Gonsalves, from Jammu and Kashmir on September 24. It was directed to conduct an independent evaluation of the ground situation in the flood-affected State and file a report on October 10.
The committee comprises Suresh Kumar Sharma, Registrar General, Jammu and Kashmir High Court as convenor; Mian Ab. Qayoom, President, High Court Bar Association, Srinagar; Sanjay Agarwal, Director, Ministry of Home Affairs; M.K. Bhardwaj, President, High Court Bar Association, Jammu; and Vinod Kaul, Secretary, Revenue Department, Jammu and Kashmir government.
Mr. Kaul said the committee was able to witness only five per cent of the devastation in the State. They covered Kulgam, Pulwama, Anantnag, Jammu, Udhampur, Rajouri and Poonch districts between September 30 and October 8.
The report pointed out that “no effective steps were taken to warn people residing in vulnerable areas of Srinagar city of the fast-approaching deluge of flood and to evacuate them.” It said “people remained stranded for days together without food and drinking water, waiting for rescue, which was being elusive.”
The report added that it was only their “fierce sense of survival” and ultimately the valiant efforts of the defence forces, NDRF and local volunteers that rescued them. The report said there is “intense anguish and resentment against [the] authorities.”

Sunday ET | Meet liquor baron Kishore ChhabriaChhabria’s story is inevitably linked with that of two other men — United Spirits chairman Vijay Mallya and Chhabria’s elder brother, the late Manu Chhabria.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
Kishore Rajaram Chhabria, 59, loves being driven across the United States. In September, Chhabria along with wife Bina travelled more than 500 km between two small American towns, Barnard in Vermont and Bedford in Pennsylvania, staying in hotels for several days in both towns. Empty roads and lonely towns inspire Chhabria.
The sense of emptiness helps him "strategize", he says. Though a frequent visitor to the US, Chhabria does not own a house there and prefers hiring chauffeur-driven cars. Left-hand-drives confuse him. For Chhabria — the businessman — this is the right time for strategizing. A lot is at stake. His company Allied Blenders and Distillers (ABD), which owns Officer's Choice, the world's largest selling whiskey brand by volume, has blueprinted an aggressive growth plan. It includes the buyout of a competing brand, acquisition of distilleries and bottling units, heavy borrowing to fuel this binge, and finally, a public issue of shares in two years.
Chhabria's story is inevitably linked with that of two other men — United Spirits chairman Vijay Mallya and Chhabria's elder brother, the late Manu Chhabria. The trio has over the last three decades joined hands and fallen out many times (see The Liquor Wars). Manu Chhabria passed away in 2002, and his family sold the liquor business to Mallya. Mallya has since handed over management control of his liquor business to Diageo and is struggling to hold on to his board seat and chairmanship. Only Kishore Chhabria , with Officer's Choice, which accounts for 75% of ABD's sales by volume, has the luxury to plan growth or take time off in never-heard-of towns in the US, which are almost cathartic for him.
Old-World Style
In India, Chhabria seems to have wrapped himself up in familiarity and tradition. Chhabria loves to be unconventional, in an industry where flamboyance is the convention. At home, which is Casa Grande on Little Gibbs Road, near south Mumbai's Hanging Gardens, Chhabria prefers an old-world style. His office is in the same building as his residence, and he is surrounded by a group of old faithful and some anachronisms like CCTV cameras monitoring every room in the office with the monitor placed directly in front of his table. The office decor is anything but modern, and the drapes and chandeliers may even qualify as opulent.
"I have married only once. Bala (VR Balakrishnan), my secretary, was earlier my father's secretary. My cook has been around for 36 years and my driver for 27 years. Once I grab hold of a person I rarely let go," Chhabria says. Chhabria's company ABD is the third largest maker of Indian-made foreign liquor (IMFL, the rather curious contraction used by governments to differentiate liquor made in the organised sector from indigenous hooch). An 8% market share in IMFL makes ABD one of the largest Indian-owned liquor businesses. The corporate office is at Lower Parel, in a spanking new building, where the company's CEO Deepak Roy sits. Roy, an industry veteran who has also worked with Mallya in the past, has been allotted 5% sweat equity in the company by Chhabria, who owns the rest. Chhabria's son-in-law Jeetu Hemdev, who is married to his elder daughter, works under Roy.
Chhabria confesses that he never encouraged either of his two daughters to take an interest in his business. "In hindsight, I can admit I was wrong. I thought liquor was not a good business for women," he offers.

Kailash Satyarthi: Meet the Nobel Peace Priz...Kailash Satyarthi
( For instance in 2006,…)
For most Indians, Kailash Satyarthi, 60, was a surprise choice for the Nobel Peace Prize , but the child rights activist doesn't hold a grudge against his country for the lack of recognition. Ironically, the honour has come at a time when the new central government seems deeply suspicious of social activists. Satyarthi says he'll work towards bridging the gap between the state and civil society. Excerpts:
Were you expecting this honour?
Not really. I knew that I had been nominated a few times before this, but I did not expect it so suddenly and, that too, today (smiles). For instance in 2006, many foreign agencies had parked outside my office expecting me to win the Peace Prize. Then I was, kind of, expecting it. But this time, there was complete silence before the announcement.
Do you know who nominated you for Nobel Prize this time?
I am not exactly sure who all nominated me this time. But Senator Tom Harkins, who has been the champion of child rights acitivism in the US Congress, was one of them. He has nominated me a couple of times before as well. He's been a big strength for me in my fight against child labour.
What are the thought going through your head as this honour sinks in?
This prize will definitely make the issue of child rights even more important now. More importantly, I hope this honour will change the paradigm of stardom from being just about people who act and act well to those who work on the ground. This will give strength to ordinary activists fighting against child labour and exploitation in my country and globally.
Can you describe the moment or episode that brought you into this field?
When I was about five years old I remember seeing a cobbler and his son, who was probably on my age, sitting outside my school. I was disturbed by this. One day I mustered the courage to ask the cobbler why he doesn't send his son to school. He said, "Babuji, hum toh kaam karne ke liye paida hue hain" (Sir, we are born to work).
That made me angry. I am still angry today even though I am peace laureate now. Why are few children allowed to have dreams, aspirations, career and future and others not?
Does it bother you that you received recognition internationally and not as much in india?
Not really. I love my people in India.
Isn't this honour also at a level a sad commentary on the state of affairs in India, an indictment of Indian society?
Child labour is not a problem exclusive to India. I work in 144 countries gainst this. You could say that this honour is a sad commentary on everyone who talks of freedom, humanity, education and childhood.
Have you spoken to Malala? Do you plan to work with her closely?
I spoke to Malala a little while ago. I've known her for quite some time and met her last in Netherlands with her family. I have suggested that now, apart from our own issues, we have to also work on the issue of peace. We have to see that no child is born or grows up in an environment of fear and violence in my country and in Pakistan.
The new government in India is extremely suspicious of activists and the NGO sector? Is that a right stance to adopt?
I can't say anything about this right now. Let me first talk to the government on this.
Do you think the NGO sector in India is guilty of overreach?
It depends. There is very strong need for the civil society sector everywhere in the world. No government can ignore them. So the onus of responsibility is on both the government and activists.
On hand, the government has to respect the NGOs and civil society who are doing great work and inspiring others to do the same. On the other hand, the civil society must also realize it's equally important to work constructively on social issues. I'll try to bridge the gap between the state and the non-state actors in my country and across the world.
What are your expectations from the country's new Prime Minister.
The PM, as a child, was disciplined and fond of cleanliness. So, as the head of the state he has now initiated the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan. He also sold tea as a kid. He was also a child labourer. So, I am sure he also feels equally strongly about the issue of child rights and will definitely do something about it.

Lack of infra: Will big census towns benefit from  Rurban  MissionCensus Towns
(Welcome to Burari Gaon which,…)
Dalip Singh of Delhi stumbles upon the same dilemma every time he prints his visiting cards: what address should he give his optical shop? No local authority has given him any shop number. Nor does the lane in front of his shop bear any name or number.
If a potential customer calls him up, Singh directs him to a bylane next to the post office located in North Delhi's Burari Gaon. But Singh, like 1.46 lakh other Burari residents, does not make a fuss over the lack of such basic conveniences. There is, after all, an upside to the gaon (village) tag: it ensures that Singh pays very little for his water and zilch as house tax. What is more, he is licensed to raise a floor or two of his residence without taking permission from any government agencies.
Welcome to Burari Gaon which, like 3,893 other urban settlements, displays visible characteristics like a large population and predominantly non-agricultural economic activity. Yet, the office of the Registrar General and Census Commissioner prefers to classify them as "census towns". The respective state governments too have not bestowed the urban tag to them as yet. Not even to 20 of such 'towns' — including Noida, Greater Noida, Khora (all in Uttar Pradesh), Navi Mumbai Panvel Raigarh and Burari in Delhi — that have a population of over a lakh. That these are still towns means that they do not qualify for aid from the union urban development ministry; instead, what they get is a handful of rural development sops.
Rakesh Gupta, a resident of Khora, sums up the problems a typical census town faces: "There is no health centre here. There is just one school, that too a primary one. There is no park here. No one knows the status of our town. It's an urban area, but we have a panchayat. No resident here qualifies to get bank loans and credit cards."
  Urban Confusion
According to the 2011 census report, Khora in Uttar Pradesh's Ghaziabad district (in the vicinity of the national capital) is the eighth largest census town in India with a population of 1.9 lakh. As no building regulations are applicable here, residents have happily constructed four storeys on plots as small as 15 to 25 square yards.
Former urban development secretary M Ramachandran who recently edited a book titled India's Urban Confusion has described the phenomenon of census towns as a classic case of urban confusion. "The census towns will someday become statutory towns. But the tragic
reality is that the state governments have allowed those to grow in a haphazard manner. You won't find proper sewerage, drainage or street lights in most of these towns. There is no regulation in building norms there," he says.
Since census towns are yet to be declared statutory towns by the state governments, the upshot is that they are villages, and hence are eligible to avail of rural development ministry schemes. The UPA government had announced that some of the census towns would be handpicked for holistic development under a scheme called PURA, or Provision of Urban Amenities in Rural Areas, originally a brainchild of former President of India APJ Abdul Kalam.
Under the scheme, which never quite took off, a private bidder was to identify a gram panchayat or a census town with a population of 25,000 to 40,000 and develop it in public-private partnership mode.
  Sorry State of Affairs
The NDA government is likely to subsume PURA in a more ambitious mission called Rurban (rural plus urban), which is likely to be rolled out in a month. A panel headed by the rural development ministry's additional secretary SM Vijayanand has been designing the new scheme. "Yes, census towns will be major beneficiaries under the Rurban Mission," says a rural development ministry joint secretary declining to go into the contours of the new scheme. But if President Pranab Mukherjee's address to Parliament in June was any indication, Rurban Mission would provide urban amenities to rural areas while preserving the ethos of villages.
Though some of the 3,894 census towns are bound to be covered under this ambitious scheme, it is unlikely that all big census towns (12 out of the top 20 fall within the National Capital Territory of Delhi) will benefit from this move, according to people familiar with the matter. Most of the big census towns are in the vicinity of big cities, and the census towns coming under NCT of Delhi even elect their representatives to the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD). Yet, none of those has been notified as urban areas as yet. KP Singh, a resident of Burari, says: "Many here don't want Burari to be a fully urban area as it were will force them to pay property tax. Also, water will get costlier then." Singh runs a fodder shop in the locality, but the dwindling number of buffalos in the area has hit his daily sales — that's perhaps one indicator of Burari's transformation from a rural pocket to a full-blown urban area.

How Nita Ambani ensures RIL s wealth is used to do good at grassroot level | InterviewHow Nita Ambani ensures that RIL's wealth is used to do good at the grassroot level

Creating something out of nothing is what Nita Ambani has been doing for a while now, be it in healthcare and education or in urban renewal and rural development
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
Around a decade and a half ago, two Indian couples landed in Antarctica's Argentinian airbase of Marambio. They were family friends and household names in India Inc — the power couple of Piramal Healthcare, Swati and Ajay Piramal , and the then-heir apparent at Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), Mukesh Ambani , and wife Nita. Swati Piramal recollects how they flew in from Argentina with couples of other nationalities as part of an initiative of Young Presidents Organisation, a global networking group of young chief executives. "There was this vast open barren land and nothing around. On the way we had seen penguins, but near the airbase, there was absolutely nothing," she remembers.
Ask Swati about her co-traveller on the trip, Nita, and she is reminded of a different tract of nothingness — the parched landscape in Jamnagar in the '90s. Piramal recounts the RIL township Nita had designed for employees on what was virtually desert land, using drip irrigation to grow an orchard alongside. Swati says she is most impressed by Nita's "ability to create something magnificent out of nothing". "I have seen her build the Dhirubhai Ambani International School (DAIS) starting with a piece of paper," she adds. "Many can build a school, but she has built India's best."
New Ball Games
Creating something out of nothing is what Nita Ambani has been doing for a while now, be it in healthcare and education or in urban renewal and rural development. As the founder of Reliance Foundation, the petrochemicals and refining giant's philanthropic arm, she now has top-notch professionals to help her execute a basket of diverse initiatives. And she has few inhibitions about stepping into arenas she never laid foot before. Like sports.
Nita easily confesses she knew nothing about cricket when she became a co-owner of Mumbai Indians , a franchise in the Indian Premier League . Ditto for football where she now heads the Hero Indian Super League (ISL). The two-month-long football league (in collaboration with the All India Football Federation ) is about to start with marquee players from all over the world — albeit retired ones. It is being managed by an RIL joint venture between Reliance-IMG and Star TV .
Nita is a quick learner, though, and talks about her interactions with football legends like Alessandro Del Piero and Robert Pires in the same breath as her other pet themes such as education and healthcare (Del Piero is determined to leave his mark on Indian football, according to her).
Slew of Projects
Nita's goal is to enable India to qualify for the football World Cup in 2026, which means that India will have to catapult from its dismal 158th ranking to amongst the top 32 teams in the world in 12 years. Cynics would say RIL stands a better chance of becoming the world's biggest company than India qualifying for the quadrennial football tournament.
For Nita, though, the means may be more important than the end of World Cup qualification. And the means involves getting boys — and girls — to play the game at the grassroots level. Indeed, the common link between sports — whether it's cricket or football doesn't really matter — and the initiatives in education, healthcare and rural development is children. "Education and health care go hand in hand. We have to ensure that every girl child is educated. And if every boy wants a football, we also have to be able to give every girl a toilet."
A similar passion for nitty gritty is evident in another pet project that's keeping Nita busy these days. Sir HN Reliance Foundation Hospital, a 90-year-old institution, reopens as a tertiary care hospital on Diwali. Reliance Foundation took over the hospital around eight years ago and has been renovating it for the last three. It wants to provide world-class healthcare and also serve the underprivileged who live in the area.
It's been quite a ride for Nita, from a middle-class youngster from suburban Mumbai, who married into one of India's richest families at 21 and then in three decades has emerged as a champion of social development. Her friends from her teenage days recollect her quest for perfection in the little things that matter.
On returning home from school, Nita and her schoolmate at Rose Garden Manor School, Meeta Doshi, used to write letters to each other every evening. Doshi, now a practising dentist in Berkeley, California, and Nita don't of course communicate as often these days, but Doshi recalls her obsession with excellence. "Whether it was a dance performance or participating in a sporting event, she always gave it her best and invariably shone."
After marrying Mukesh Ambani, Nita picked up another trait to support her quest for perfection — attention to detail. She says it is Mukesh who taught her about 'floodlights' and 'spotlights', or the need for combining vision with attention to detail. As Gustad Davar, medical director of the hospital, says: "Mrs Ambani is very sensitive to a patient's needs as well as a patient's family needs." The hospital will focus on easy admissions and quick discharges of patients as well as an online queuing system and separate waiting rooms for families on every floor.

FIPB to take up 48 FDI proposals on October 21FIPB to take up 48 foreign investment proposals on October 21
PTI Oct 12, 2014, 11.03AM IST
(The proposals of Punj Lloyd…)
NEW DELHI: With the government on a fast-track to lure foreign investments, FIPB will consider as many as 48 FDI proposals, including that of the HDFC Bank and about a dozen from the pharma sector, at its meeting on October 21.
Pharma proposals including those of Lupin, Sanofi- Synthelabo and Sun Pharma will come up for consideration in the meeting to be chaired by the Economic Affairs Secretary.
Besides, investment applications of major companies like Holcim, Today Magazines Lifestyle and Montblanc Services will be taken up by the Foreign Investment Promotion Board.
The proposals of Punj Lloyd and IdeaForge Technology pertain to FDI in the defence sector, while that of Keppel Puravankara Development is for the real estate space.
HDFC Bank's proposal for increasing the foreign holding in the bank to 67.55 per cent from 49 per cent has been pending before the FIPB since late last year.
The Department of Economic Affairs and the Department of Industrial Policy & Promotion are of view that promoter HDFC Ltd's 22.56 per cent stake in HDFC Bank is already a foreign investment.
Hence, if the proposal of the bank to raise foreign investment to 67.55 per cent is accepted, it would exceed the cap of 74 per cent, after taking into account parent HDFC Ltd's stake.
Foreign entities, including FIIs, hold more than 77.36 per cent in HDFC Ltd, while the foreign holding in a bank cannot exceed 74 per cent as per the existing norms.
At the end of June, foreign institutional investment in HDFC Bank was 33.93 per cent, according to BSE data. Further, foreign investors hold another 16.90 per cent shares through ADRs and GDRs.
If the promoter's (HDFC Ltd) stake of 22.56 per cent is deemed to be foreign, then the total of the above mentioned three categories would take foreign investment to over 74 per cent.
FDI, FII, NRI holding, ADR/GDR, convertible preference shares, foreign currency convertible bonds are treated as foreign investment under the FDI policy.
Investments by HDFC Ltd and associate companies, in HDFC Bank were made before 2009, when the government came out with norms to calculate the level of foreign investment in companies.

Pakistan heavily shelled 15 border outposts and hamlets in Arnia sector of Jammu and Kashmir early Sunday even as it wrote to UN chief Ban Ki-moon blaming India for the escalation in border clashes and sought UN intervention on Kashmir.
The shelling, the first since Thursday, injured three people and ends a pause in fighting that has already killed 19 civilians in the two countries in the worst skirmishes in a decade.

In the letter to Ban, foreign affairs adviser to Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif, Sartaj Aziz, accused India of ‘deliberate and unprovoked violations of the ceasefire agreement and cross-border firing’. He also appealed for UN’s assistance in resolving the dispute with India over the status of Kashmir.
Though there was no formal reaction from New Delhi, India has long maintained that disputes between it and Pakistan should be resolved bilaterally under the framework of the Shimla agreement and Lahore declaration.
 India also considers the UN observer group on Kashmir to have outlived its utility and has criticised Pakistan for depending on a ‘tool of a bygone era’ to address the problems of the present.

The latest round of shelling  by Pakistan comes a week after five people were killed in Arnia.
“Flat trajectory weaponry fire started at 8.10pm (Saturday) on three border posts in Arnia and continued till early morning,” a BSF spokesperson said.
The fresh firing has forced authorities to drop any moves to allow the nearly 30,000 people living in government relief camps to return to their homes.

I-T dept launches secure email system for staffIncome Tax department launches secure email system for staff to curb frauds
PTI Oct 12, 2014, 11.26AM IST
(To curb misuse of official…)
NEW DELHI: To curb misuse of official cyber tools and attempts of phishing, the Income Tax department has rolled out a secure email system for all its employees and officers.
The department, official sources said, has recently discontinued its existing email systems (called Lotus mail and IMail) and has issued instructions to its countrywide staff to get new email IDs prepared after "validation" of their bona fides.
"The I-T department's work over email involves some very secret and proprietary information about taxpayers like refunds and tax returns data. There have been few instances of breach in this system earlier which led to fraudulent transfer of funds. The new email system is more secure and reliable," a senior I-T officer said.
The officer said the I-T department does not directly deal with taxpayers for want of information and its I-T returns collection centre in Bangalore just sends an acknowledgment email once the process of filing is completed.
"The new email system is for secure communication within the department which will ensure no confidential information or data is pilfered," the officer said.
Under the new mechanism, an I-T officer or employee will have to fill up a proforma which requires him or her to share their employee code, designation, personal email ID, mobile number, the Commissionerate they are working in and bona fide signatures after which the database cell of the CBDT will create an email ID and a password.
The new IDs of the department will be registered under 'incometax.gov.in' or 'incometaxindia.gov.in' domain and all its records will be maintained once it is launched, the officer said.
The new government, recently, has also made its plans clear for enabling an official email services environment to all government employees for conducting not only secure exchange of information but also to establish a faith among the general public that any communication made to them over email is not genuine until and unless it emerges from the official government platforms.
The taxman, time and again, has been making public announcements that taxpayers should guard against suspicious hacking or phishing emails which fraudulently use the departments name to con a taxpayer.
"The I-T department does not request detailed personal information through e-mail. The Income Tax department does not send email requesting your PIN numbers, passwords or similar access information for credit cards, banks or other financial information," the I-T has said in its advisory.
It has alerted the taxpayers that if someone happens to receive an email from a link claiming to be authorised by the department, the taxpayer should "not reply."
"Do not open any attachments. Attachments may contain malicious code that will infect your computer. Do not click on any links. If you clicked on links in a suspicious e-mail or phishing website then do not enter confidential information like bank account, credit card details," it had said.
An official explained that Phishing is the process of attempting to acquire sensitive information such as user names, passwords, and credit card details by masquerading as a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication like email.

EPFO to launch online transfer for organised sector workers covered under private PF trusts this month

EPFO
NEW DELHI: Retirement fund body EPFO is all set to launch this month an online facility for transfer of PF accounts for the organised sector workers covered under private PF trusts, that manage their employees' retirement fund themselves.
"The EPFO has planned to launch the facility of online transfer of PF account from private PF trusts to un-exempted firms which are filing PF returns and vice-versa, this month," a Labour Ministry official said.
At present this facility is available to workers of (un-exempted) firms which do not have their PF trusts and manage their employees' accounts with their respective regional fund commissioners of the EPFO. It was launched in October last year.
There are 3,621 private provident fund trusts (PPFT) which are managing the accounts as well as retirement fund of their workers. These trusts are regulated by the EPFO.
According the official, the EPFO has developed a mechanism by which PF accounts can be transfered online from an un-exempted firm to exempted organisation (PPFT).
There were certain technical issues for online transferring of PF accounts on changing jobs from a PPFT to an un-exempted firm.
Now since the EPFO has almost completed the work on the mechanism to enable transfer of PF accounts from a private PF trust to an un-exempted firm and vice-versa, the facility could be launched anytime this month, the official added.
There are over five crore active subscribers whose accounts are being managed by EPFO. But these are all un-exempted firms which don't operate a trust and file provident fund returns with EPFO.
The facility of online transfer of provident fund accounts is aimed at reducing the work load of the body substantially as over 13 lakh applicants file such claims every year.
The EPFO settled 1.21 crore claims in 2013-14, including about 12 lakh PF transfer claims.

Scrap archaic insurance laws: Shriram chiefbusiness (general)
Empower IRDA and make it accountable
It is time to scrap the archaic insurance laws of the country as these have become major impediments for the growth of industry. The Indian government should empower the regulator IRDA (Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority) as a single entity that is responsible and accountable for the performance of insurance sector, asserted insurance industry veteran and founder-Chairman of the Shriram Group R. Thyagarajan.
He said about 95 per cent of the Insurance Act 1938 could be scrapped as they were only proving to be barriers for the growth of the Indian insurance sector. Also, absence of accountability - be it for insurance department or IRDA - was also a concern, he said.
He pointed out that an empowered IRDA could formulate necessary regulations to govern the sector. He felt that there was no need for two different entities – Centre’s finance ministry and the sectoral regulator IRDA. “If IRDA is totally empowered, they can be made responsible. They can’t hide behind Insurance Act and say they are constrained by the Act to effect any change,” he added.
Elaborating on the outdated laws in the Act, he said Section 41, brought during British period, didn’t have any relevance in the current context as all products and pricing were market-based. “This provision was added after a lobbying by the British as a protection against domestic competition,” he pointed out.
Though the industry had been urging for the removal of the rebating practice, there was a move to make the penalty much higher: from Rs.500 earlier to Rs. 5 lakh under the new Insurance Bill, which is awaiting Parliament nod. There was fear that increased penalty would lead to harassment of agents, resulting in bribery and corruption, he said.
Admitting that there was a certain amount of mis-selling in the insurance industry, he pointed out that only less or lower level of regulations would be the solution to remove such practices.
“A streamlined or rationalised regulatory framework will pave the way for a healthy insurance sector in the country,” he added.
Due to outdated laws, life insurance sector’s business had come down by 8-10 per cent in the last six years. It should have actually gone up by high single-digit, Mr. Thyagarajan felt.

Life insurers oppose Sec 45Life insurers oppose Sec 45
M Saraswathy | Mumbai Oct 11, 2014 12:20 AM IST
Life insurers have raised objections to a major change in one of the provisions of the revised insurance Bill, likely to be passed in the winter session of Parliament.
Section 45 in the new Bill says no claim can be repudiated after three years of the policy being in force, even if a fraud is detected, has sent life insurers into a tizzy.
According to Section 45 of the Insurance Act, 1938, no life insurance policy can be called into question on grounds of mis-statement or wrong disclosure after two years of the policy coming into force. However, if the insurer is able to prove that the claim was fraudulent, it need not be passed.
"No policy of life insurance shall, after the expiry of two years from the date on which it was effected, be called into question by an insurer on the ground that a statement made in the proposal for insurance...was inaccurate or false," says the Insurance Act. This is unless the insurer shows that such statement was on a material matter and that the policyholder knew at the time of making it that the statement was false.
Now, under the proposed Bill, this has undergone changes. Insurers said that in the new Bill, several organised rackets of fraudsters would use the facility to defraud insurance companies. This would mean the life insurer would have the onus of proving that the policy had been taken for false purposes and this has to be done within three years of the policy being taken.
Life insurers have sent a representation through the Life Insurance Council to the Rajya Sabha committee. Further, industry bodies have also taken up the matter with government officials. However, the government is yet to take a final call on this issue.
ACHILLES HEEL
Section 45 of the current insurance Act in force says that no life insurance policy can be called into question after 2 years of it being issued. However, if it is a fraud, the claim will not be passed
Proposed amendment in Section 45 of the new insurance Bill, to be tabled in Parliament, states a policy cannot be called in question after 3 years of it being issued
Insurers contend if the Bill is passed in this format, even fraudulent claims will not be be rejected, after 3 years of the policy being issued
"There are several organised persons who take fake insurance either on the names of people who do not exist or on dead persons. If this proposal, that says no claim can be rejected after three years, is implemented, we as a industry will face major losses," said a senior private life insurance executive.
Industry sources said there were several cartels operating in this space that take up policies and make fraudulent claims. They are said to remove all evidence so that a claim is not rejected for fraud.
Senior Irda officials said that whenever there is an opportunity, they would express their opinion on this matter. Irda is on the side of life insurers on this issue.
Overall, industry sources said that while both public and private life insurers would be impacted, public insurer Life Insurance Corporation of India would be heavily impacted since it has a larger volume of policies.
In the earlier version of the Bill that was to be passed in 2008, it was proposed under Section 45 that no life insurance policy could be called into question on grounds of mis-statement or wrong disclosure after five years of the policy coming into force. This has now been revised to bring it to three.
Insurers also fear that this would lead to a rise in litigations, since there could be different interpretations according to the legal system. "A person may want a claim to be paid. However, while after three years even a fraudulent claim will be paid, an insurer may take recourse. We do not know whether it will be either the Act (if passed) or other laws that will hold in the court of law," said a risk officer with a private life insurance company.
In August, the insurance Bill was referred to a select committee of the Rajya Sabha. The House adopted a motion to refer the Bill to the select committee after Finance Minister Arun Jaitley announced a 15-member panel had been formed. The Bill aims to increase the private equity from 26 to 49 per cent in the insurance sector among several other major provisions.
Industry players said that if the Bill was passed in the currrent format, there would be a higher scrutiny of individuals at the time of policy issuance. Verifications would be made stringent and if heavy losses were reported from fraud claims, and the costs would be passed on to all customers as a premium increase on a gradual basis.

Devendra Pathak: Meet the soldier who keeps Pak in checkBSF
(Pathak, in the twilight…)
NEW DELHI: Devendra Kumar Pathak did not get much sleep on the three nights he spent at the border in Jammu & Kashmir earlier this week. Besides being alongside his men inside border outposts as bullets rained across the frontier, the director-general of Border Security Force (BSF) got encouraging calls from Prime Minister Narendra Modi , exhorting him to return fire with fire.
Pathak, in the twilight of his long career in the Indian Police Service, much of which has been spent fighting terrorism and insurgency in Jammu & Kashmir and Assam, is now the man fighting Modi's 'war' with Pakistan on the international border. Although cross-border violations are nothing new, the sheer intensity has made many rate the ongoing skirmish as the worst in a decade.
And much of the action this time has been along the international border, which BSF guards, rather than the Line of Control ( LoC ) overseen by the army.
"We have decided we will give Pakistan a thrashing for their misadventure this time. We have given them a very solid pounding and the loss on the other side is very heavy," Pathak told ET on Friday. "We have fired many more times the rounds Pakistan has fired. They have been silenced."
With his tenure set to last until February 2016 in the post, Pathak is the key man for Modi as things are expected to be on edge at the border given the new, aggressive strategy of engagement.
Incidentally, Pathak was the UPA govt's choice for BSF directorgeneral this April. Top sources in the new government said there could not be a better candidate for the key job given his years of experience on both the frontiers that BSF guards — those with Pakistan and Bangladesh.
Rajnath sent Pathak to Jammu
Hailing from Bihar, he joined the IPS in 1979 at 23 in the Assam-Meghalaya cadre and held charge of four districts as senior superintendent of police (SSP) in the two states at the height of the insurgency there. At the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), he was entrusted with raising the elite, specialist anti-Naxal force CoBRA (Commando Battalion for Resolute Action).
It is, however, his deep knowledge of Jammu & Kashmir that is coming in handy for the government amid the unprecedented crisis on the western front. Pathak was CRPF inspector general in Srinagar as well as CRPF special director-general of the Jammu & Kashmir zone before he shifted to BSF last year as special director and then became DG.
"I do know Pakistan and J&K well," he told ET. "That is why I feel though Pakistan has stopped firing today, you never know what will happen tomorrow. After all, they broke their earlier promise from August to not resort to unprovoked firing."
Home minister Rajnath Singh told Pathak to rush to Jammu on October 6 after firing intensified on the eve of Eid. Sources said Modi spoke to Pathak on multiple occasions while he was in Jammu, exhorting him to raise the morale of his forces and hit back with heavy retaliatory fire.
"It is rare for a PM to speak directly to the BSF chief... Usually the home minister or the home secretary remain in touch with the DG. But this time, from national security advisor Ajit Doval to the home minister and the PM, he was the direct go-to man," one of the persons said.
Pathak declined to reveal what Modi told him. "The PM and defence minister made a public statement on our response," he said. He, however, said that spending tense nights in border outposts with his men and visiting all sectors on the international border was a conscious decision. "You have to do this to show the men that their DG is alongside them. It boosts their morale," he said. On one such night, while Pathak was at an outpost in RS Pura, India fired at 65 Pakistani border outposts inside 15 minutes.

Indo-Pak peace talks: A novel international settlement(By conferring him the award,…)
By Sriram Balasubramanian
Friday's announcement of this year's Nobel Peace Prize winners caught most of us by surprise. Considering the current political backdrop between India and Pakistan — especially with mortars from both countries over the international border keeping both countries on the edge — the Nobel being jointly awarded to Pakistan's Malala Yousafzai and India's Kailash Satyarthi can be interpreted as a signal to the two countries of the two laureates, rather than just being a confirmation of the good work done by the winners.
It also points to the fact that in the smog of negative news that the subcontinent delivers most of the time for the rest of the world, good work that is overlooked has also been recognised by an international body.
While one can argue about the validity of Malala and Satyarthi chosen as the two winners, the joint Peace Prize, as always when a Peace Prize is shared, offers lessons to opinion-makers in both countries. Malala was a front-runner for the Nobel last year due to her incredible journey from near-death in the hands of the Taliban in 2012 to being aglobal icon for the empowerment of women and children.
Her unassuming personality coupled with the support of the western media made her a global icon — and, dare we say, darling — over the last year. On Friday, she was awarded the Nobel for her campaign work based in Britain for the education of girls and women in Pakistan and the world.
Critics had earlier panned her inexperience and drew a distinction between being a global mascot for child rights and her actually not doing much groundwork for any considerable period that promoted 'peace'. That criticism will hold even after she has been awarded the Nobel Prize.
The surprise co-winner Satyarthi is, in a way, diagonally opposite to Malala. The electrical engineer-turned-social activist has spent over 30 years fighting for child rights in India, primarily through the Bachpan Bachao Andolan. He has been rarely covered by the Indian media, never mind the international media, and his credentials stem purely from the work he has been 'quietly' doing.
By conferring him the award, the Nobel Committee has stuck to its mandate of awarding the prize to those who deserve it irrespective of their relative anonymity. The arduous work of Satyarthi and the popular appeal of Malala make for a potent mix that somewhat restores the sanctity of the Nobel Peace Prize whose past winners have been controversial (Barack Obama in 2009, the European Union in 2012) or low key (Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and Tawakkol Karman in 2011).
Both Satyarthi and Malala have worked with a bigger goal in mind despite the apathy and obstacles that they have faced in their respective societies. The India-Pakistan narrative has often been undermined by short-term thinking and this 'India-Pakistan' Nobel injects a bit of 'long-termness' in that narrative. In a way, the Nobel Prize to Satyarthi and Malala, even while recognising their work and worth, provides an unexpectant counternarrative to the usual (and ongoing) subcontinental soap opera.
Malala has been rightly held up as an example in human courage and determination because she stood up when no one else would. Delivering her speech at the United Nations in July 2013, Malala singularly seemed to be at odds with whatever her home country Pakistan seemed to stand for.
In a way, her receiving the Nobel on Friday is a bigger affront to the current Pakistani civilian government that lacks the very mettle that one of its own has displayed.
To consider the Nobel Peace Prize being politically-motivated is a nonsequitur of sorts. Almost all, if not all, Nobel Peace Prizes are political in the truest sense. They are given to make a point or to prove a point or goad a point. This year's prize being shared by an Indian and a Pakistani does not, in any way, reduce the fact that the prize has been given to two remarkable individuals.
But at the same time, it would be wise and indeed fulfilling to realise that the Nobel Committee, with its own not-to-be-underestimated powers of influence, has nudged two battling, bickering countries to see what their two prized citizens can be capable of.

Cricket  Bollywood come together to feed fans  hunger for stardomAlibaba
(ISL is a smaller operation.…)
NEW DELHI: When Athletico de Kolkata host Mumbai City FC at the 68,000-seater Salt Lake Stadium on Sunday, it will see India's two big passions -- Bollywood and cricket - come together with the hope of creating a third one that pulls the masses, feeds their hunger for stardom, brings in the money and is for keeps.
They have basked in, or seen, the rush for the Indian Premier League (IPL), the city-based cricket league. But they will find the Indian Super League (ISL), football's answer to the IPL in India, to be a different ballgame, one that will take a lot more to come together and will need much more time to do so. "We should reach close to breakeven by year five," admits Gaurav Modwel, CEO of FC Pune City, the Pune franchise. "In the long run, I think, it might be bigger than the IPL."
There are many parallels between the ISL and IPL models. They are both city-based sporting leagues, with eight teams each. The bulk of a team's revenues come from dividing what is called the 'central pool' in the IPL, which comprises TV rights and principal sponsorships.
In IPL, this central pool was substantial from the start and has since grown further. It's what enabled cricket franchises operating on annual costs of Rs 100-150 crore to post a profit or, at worst, end with a marginal loss.
ISL is, by comparison, a smaller operation. Each team is looking at an average annual cost of Rs 50 crore. It's not yet clear how much revenue they will end up with. A crude calculation done by ET, based on individual metrics provided by stakeholders in the league, suggest that teams are looking at a loss of Rs 20-30 crore in year one.
Besides the lower popularity of football, ISL also presents fewer --and smaller -- opportunities to monetise than IPL. Take advertising. A three-hour IPL match offers about 40-42 minutes of TV advertising, spaced out between overs.
By comparison, a 90-minute game of football only has a single break, of 15 minutes. "In this, seven-eight minutes will be for ads and the rest for programming," says Sanjay Gupta, chief operating officer at STAR India, the broadcaster and co-promoter of ISL. In addition, there will be about four minutes on either side of the match. That's about 16 minutes in all.
In the case of IPL, since TV rights were sold, the size of the central pool was known at the outset. In ISL, since STAR India is a co-promoter, along with sports management firm IMG and Reliance Industries, it is not paying any TV rights money. What comes to the central pool from the TV side is effectively a function of how many ads can be sold.
According to two stakeholders who didn't want to be named, at least half of these 16 minutes will go to the league sponsors. Hero MotoCorp is the principal sponsor, Maruti Suzuki the associate sponsor and Pepsi, Puma, Nice Gel and Muthoot Finance the remaining sponsors. Hero is paying Rs 54 crore for three years and Maruti Rs 20-22 crore, says a senior official of a media-buying firm representing a sponsor on condition of anonymity. "It always helps to get in early," says Manohar Bhat, vice president, marketing, Maruti Suzuki, while declining to reveal the sponsorship amount. "We are betting on the fact that it will be a success."
In the first year, back-of-the-envelope calculations show that if STAR sells eight minutes of ads per match at Rs 1 lakh per 10 seconds -- the rate for the recently concluded Fifa World Cup -- it will earn about Rs 29 crore from TV advertising.
Extrapolating the numbers reportedly paid by Hero and Maruti, the best-case scenario for sponsorship is about Rs 41 crore.
That's a total central pool of about Rs 70 crore. Of this, about 60-70% of central revenue is expected to be split among the eight teams -- or Rs 6-7 crore per team. Other revenue streams are expected to fetch teams about Rs 15 crore, resulting in a net loss of about Rs 15 crore.
It still might not be a bad longterm business, feels Vinit Karnik, national director, sports and live events at GroupM ESP. "Profit and loss is not the only metric to look at ISL," he says. "It's eventually a valuations game."
One lever for valuations is what makes India a 'can't-ignore' for global business and sport: its population, next only to China. About 150 million TV viewers in India watch soccer, primarily the European soccer leagues. "The challenge, however, is how are we going to convert the followers of European football to Indian football," says Karnik.
ISL franchises will look for tie-ups with global clubs. It's a symbiotic relationship. The foreign clubs can feed the Indian clubs marquee players; the Indian clubs can provide the foreign clubs new fans.
"Look at what happened in Chinese football," says Sameer Manchanda, chairman and managing director of DEN Networks , which owns the Delhi franchise. "Alibaba recently bought a 50% stake in Guangzhou Evergrande Football Club for around $192 million," he says. "This is the kind of opportunity we are looking at in ISL too."

Modi had indicated that Fadnavis is a leader of national prominence
Maharashtra BJP president Devendra Fadnavis is emerging as the front runner for the post of Chief Minister in the event of the party leading the next government in the State, which is increasingly a possibility now, party sources told The Hindu.
The 42-year-old leader from Nagpur, the headquarters of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), has the right ideological credentials and pedigree — his father, Gangadharrao Fadnavis, was an active Sangh leader.
A Brahmin, Mr. Fadnavis fits well in the emerging power matrix within the party also. In a strong indication of his increasing prominence, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said at a meeting in Nagpur early this week that Mr. Fadnavis was a leader of national prominence.
Eknath Khadse and Vinod Tawde, party leaders in the Lower and Upper Houses of the State, respectively, are also aspirants for the post, but Mr. Fadnavis has left them behind, BJP sources said. Mr. Khadse, a five-time MLA, is an experienced hand, but is troubled by health concerns, while Mr. Tawde, until now a member of the Legislative Council, is contesting his first Assembly election.
Mr. Khadse belongs to the Other Backward Castes and Mr. Tawde is a Maratha, two social groups that dominate Maharashtra politics. But being a Brahmin is working in favour of Mr. Fadnavis.
Modi may back Fadnavis for CM
While Maharashtra BJP president Devendra Fadnavis is emerging as front runner for Chief Minister should the party lead the next government in the State, the party remains non-committal. “The BJP builds new leadership by giving opportunity to capable people. From Uma Bharati and Kalyan Singh to Raman Singh and Anandiben Patel, the party gave opportunity to people who proved their leadership abilities,” said Shrikant Sharma, BJP national secretary. “We have several leaders in Maharashtra, one of whom will become the CM.”
Mr Modi would prefer a person who will be dependent on him – which Mr Fadnavis, devoid of a formidable caste base, will be. Mr Fadnavis is reportedly not on good terms with union minister and fellow Nagpurian, Nitin Gadkari.
A stronger Mr Fadnavis will bring about a new balance of power in Maharashtra to Mr Gadkari’s disadvantage that the central leadership of the party may like. Articulate, polyglot and commanding a clean image, Mr Fadnavis could fit well in the Modi scheme of politics, according to the sources.

Sunday ET | Pros and cons of  Rurban  MissionChhabria’s story is inevitably linked with that of two other men — United Spirits chairman Vijay Mallya and Chhabria’s elder brother, the late Manu Chhabria.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
Kishore Rajaram Chhabria, 59, loves being driven across the United States. In September, Chhabria along with wife Bina travelled more than 500 km between two small American towns, Barnard in Vermont and Bedford in Pennsylvania, staying in hotels for several days in both towns. Empty roads and lonely towns inspire Chhabria.
The sense of emptiness helps him "strategize", he says. Though a frequent visitor to the US, Chhabria does not own a house there and prefers hiring chauffeur-driven cars. Left-hand-drives confuse him. For Chhabria — the businessman — this is the right time for strategizing. A lot is at stake. His company Allied Blenders and Distillers (ABD), which owns Officer's Choice, the world's largest selling whiskey brand by volume, has blueprinted an aggressive growth plan. It includes the buyout of a competing brand, acquisition of distilleries and bottling units, heavy borrowing to fuel this binge, and finally, a public issue of shares in two years.
Chhabria's story is inevitably linked with that of two other men — United Spirits chairman Vijay Mallya and Chhabria's elder brother, the late Manu Chhabria. The trio has over the last three decades joined hands and fallen out many times (see The Liquor Wars). Manu Chhabria passed away in 2002, and his family sold the liquor business to Mallya. Mallya has since handed over management control of his liquor business to Diageo and is struggling to hold on to his board seat and chairmanship. Only Kishore Chhabria , with Officer's Choice, which accounts for 75% of ABD's sales by volume, has the luxury to plan growth or take time off in never-heard-of towns in the US, which are almost cathartic for him.
Old-World Style
In India, Chhabria seems to have wrapped himself up in familiarity and tradition. Chhabria loves to be unconventional, in an industry where flamboyance is the convention. At home, which is Casa Grande on Little Gibbs Road, near south Mumbai's Hanging Gardens, Chhabria prefers an old-world style. His office is in the same building as his residence, and he is surrounded by a group of old faithful and some anachronisms like CCTV cameras monitoring every room in the office with the monitor placed directly in front of his table. The office decor is anything but modern, and the drapes and chandeliers may even qualify as opulent.
"I have married only once. Bala (VR Balakrishnan), my secretary, was earlier my father's secretary. My cook has been around for 36 years and my driver for 27 years. Once I grab hold of a person I rarely let go," Chhabria says. Chhabria's company ABD is the third largest maker of Indian-made foreign liquor (IMFL, the rather curious contraction used by governments to differentiate liquor made in the organised sector from indigenous hooch). An 8% market share in IMFL makes ABD one of the largest Indian-owned liquor businesses. The corporate office is at Lower Parel, in a spanking new building, where the company's CEO Deepak Roy sits. Roy, an industry veteran who has also worked with Mallya in the past, has been allotted 5% sweat equity in the company by Chhabria, who owns the rest. Chhabria's son-in-law Jeetu Hemdev, who is married to his elder daughter, works under Roy.
Chhabria confesses that he never encouraged either of his two daughters to take an interest in his business. "In hindsight, I can admit I was wrong. I thought liquor was not a good business for women," he offers.

Final norms for payment banks next month: RBIFinal norms for payment banks next month: RBI Deputy Governor S S Mundra
Oct 12, 2014, 12.00PM IST
(Small banks would provide…)
MUMBAI: Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) Deputy Governor S S Mundra has said that the central bank plans to announce the final norms on small and payments banks next month.
"We have received comments (on the discussion paper). Soon, in a month or so, the RBI will come out with the final guidelines on small and payment banks," he said, while addressing students from the Narsee Monjee Institute Of Management (NMIMS) over the weekend.
To deepen the financial inclusion process, and help get more people under the formal financial system, the RBI has mooted the idea of small banks and payments banks.
It had come out with draft guidelines earlier and had invited comments by August 28.
Mundra sought to dismiss concerns on profitability for such banks, saying they can earn from a variety of avenues like charging for transactions and through investments in government bonds.
Once released, these final norms would allow micro-lenders, telecom players, non-banking finance companies and public sector companies eligible to apply for licences once RBI invites applications for the same.
Small banks would provide a whole suite of basic banking products such as deposits and supply of credit, but in a limited area of operations.
Payments banks would offer a limited range of products such as demand deposits and remittances. They would have a widespread network of access points particularly in remote areas, either through their own branch network or through business correspondents or through networks provided by others.

Malala’s hometown happy but scared
AP Students look out from their classroom in Swat, Pakistan on Saturday.

accomplishment
Hours after Malala Yousafzai was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday, people in her hometown in Pakistan erupted in joy that a young woman from their conservative society had won global recognition for fighting for women’s right to education.
“This is a moment of great honour for us, and the people of Swat and the people of Pakistan,” said Tariq Khan, a medical official, as he bought dry fruit at a brightly lit shop in the main bazaar of Mingora, Malala’s hometown.
Mingora, a small town in the picturesque valley in north-western Pakistan, is surrounded by lush rolling hills and soldiers standing guard at sand-bagged checkpoints.
Malala’s success could bring real change to a region where women are expected to keep silent and stay behind closed doors. Change may be slow, but Malala’s win is bound to inspire girls in the region to pursue education and become independent.
Just a few years ago, the region was overrun by Taliban insurgents who tried to impose strict Islamic rule and ban women from seeking education. Eventually, the Pakistani army drove them away, but tensions are still high in the strategic region.
Despite its conservative Islamic reputation, most people in the region want their daughters to go to school. “I have sent all my daughters and grand daughters to school... Swatis are a very proud people who have always believed in education,” said Akal Zada, a restaurant owner.
“But now we are afraid. No one will say much because we don’t know who is listening. I support Malala’s mission but I admit this with fear. What if the Taliban come back and kill me for saying this? We are all very happy with Malala. But we are also very scared.” — Reuters

Football s answer to IPL ready for kickoffFIFA World Cup
(The first argument that…)
Writing about Indian football, former FIFA Communications Director Keith Cooper had this to say: "There is still a temptation to classify this, the world's second most populous nation, in the familiar category popularly and vaguely known as 'sleeping giants'.
The term has been applied, with varying degrees of justification, to many other countries, especially to those in Africa, where the giant has woken and has startled others into doing so. The Indian colossus remains mostly in slumber, despite intermittent bouts of insomnia, reacting to the occasional attempts to rouse it. But such awakenings have seldom had sufficient effect as to transcend regional frontiers."
The argument appears all the more justified when we note that nations like Costa Rica, where close to 20% people live below the poverty line and 10% are unemployed make it to the quarter-final of the FIFA World Cup . Costa Rica is not an aberration. The other cases in point are Bosnia-Herzegovina, Ghana, Chile and Croatia.
THAT'S WHAT BRINGS ONE TO THE INDIAN SUPER LEAGUE (ISL)
The first argument that is advanced when we talk about the problems plaguing Indian football is we don't have the necessary infrastructure.
We don't have the funds and every corporate worth a name is keen on investing in cricket. The ISL, thankfully, is addressing each of these issues. There are a number of big names that are involved, and the prize monies are seriously lucrative drawing serious global talent to the league.
Not that there haven't been efforts in the past. The Tata Football Academy is a case in point. It had started with much fanfare and at one point did provide a serious supply chain to the national team. Super soccer initiatives that brought clubs like PSV Eindhoven and others also did much to trigger an interest in football in India.
Finally, when the National League , now the I-league, started in 1996, there was serious hope that football will finally have the infusion of positive energy it so badly needed. But the league is still found wanting in several key aspects: organisation, marketing, publicity and, above all, adequate sponsors.
CAN ALL THIS EVER CHANGE? CAN THE ISL MAKE THE REAL DIFFERENCE?
The ISL does give us hope. It is a good mesh of commerce and vision and has all the potential to help the development of football in India. To think that teams from India are training in Europe and to be able to see coaches and players like Zico, Luis Garcia, Del Piero, David James, Robert Pires, Nikolas Anelka and others train and play alongside Indian footballers is sure to give local football a boost.
Detractors have questioned if the football fandom nurtured by the ISL will ever go beyond the traditional power centres of Goa, Kerala, Kolkata and Mumbai. Frankly, it need not. Cricket has never embraced the North-East.
Even if the craze for the ISL is restricted to the cities' housing the eight teams, the job will have been done. Collectively these cities are three times the size of Costa Rica. The talent and corporate potential is ten times the size of Bosnia and the television viewership more than the size of a few Eastern European nations clubbed together.
Will the benefits of monetisation filter down to the grassroots and contribute to improving the domestic football superstructure? Will fans come out to spend their hard-earned money to watch games in October-November when other global leagues are being regularly telecast on TV? Finally, will the tournament serve as a supply line for future national stars? The question of fan participation is pertinent because in India fans generally only watch international football contests and leagues like the English Premier League or the La Liga, pitting top global stars against each other.
Attendance figures at I-League matches, too, have come down in recent times. Despite these apprehensions, the ISL comes at a time when the Indian economy has opened itself to global money and the big corporates trying to make India home are in search of lucrative investment platforms across the country. The ISL, for many, can be the answer. At one go, it will give them a foothold in a market of a billion-plus and is expected to generate eyeballs that millions spent on advertisements won't garner.
Add to this the fact that for a nation of a billion, filling stadiums is hardly difficult with proper marketing and hype.
With celebrity owners like Sourav Ganguly , Sachin Tendulkar and Ranbir Kapoor doing their bit, fans will have more than football on offer for a couple of hundred rupees.

If any league can make  Indians football   it is ISLFIFA
By Desh Gaurav Sekhri
As the inaugural season of the Indian Super League (ISL) starts tomorrow, the professional football league shoulders a host of expectations.
The first Indian league to draw realistic comparisons to the cricket Indian Premier League (IPL), the ISL has a very different structure and revenue model than the IPL, and is a hybrid of traditional and unique, even when compared to global norms.
Promoted by the IMG-Reliance joint venture , which has licensed the commercial rights to Indian football from the All India Football Federation (AIFF), the ISL is India's first attempt at a FIFA-compliant professional league with international football players and managers of some repute. It has standard components, such as a franchise ownership model with eight franchises spread across the country, chosen via a bidding selection process that included meeting the financial thresholds, governance and ethics compliances, a player draft, and a structured grassroots development of football in the franchise's region, among others.
These are appropriate, as governance and integrity have been questioned in most sports ventures in India, if not across the world.
Similarly, establishing a grassroots program for football development sets the standard for improving the quality of football across the country, and at the same time generating a year-round brand awareness model that would expand the loyalty bases for the respective franchises.
Each franchise has been bought for a period of ten years at a cost ranging from Rs 130 cr-160 cr. The ISL has a respected and established title sponsor in Hero MotoCorp, and a suite of associate sponsors including Puma , Pepsico and Amul among others. Unlike the IPL, however, sponsorships do not appear to constitute a significant revenue component for either the league or the franchises.
Although financials are confidential, the central pool of the ISL is expected to be in the $ 10-15 million per year range. To boost revenues, franchises have the right to independently procure team sponsors, and the rights to merchandising.
Merchandising in India has not yet been a viable economic benefit across leagues, but perhaps as loyalty bases grow, this will change. The most unique aspect of the ISL, however, is that the primary broadcaster, Star India, is not merely a broadcast partner, but is a promoterowner of the league.
Therefore, the aggressive marketing across the Star network and the virtually assured broadcasts of each of the ISL matches across the Star Sports electronic and digital platform ensure the dissemination of viewership across the Indian target demographic.
On the f lip side, however, and unlike the IPL, broadcasting rights revenues don't exist in the revenue sharing model with franchises. In the IPL, each franchise receives between $24 million- 28 million solely from the central revenue pool. In the ISL, that amount is greatly reduced, and franchises can expect losses of approximately $7-9 million each over the first few seasons of the league. So, the franchises will need to have staying power and reserves.
Another unique aspect is the celebrity brand ambassador requirement. It is believed that each franchise is required to induct a celebrity brand ambassador for the promotion of the entire league as well as the home franchise, which is why one has witnessed a plethora of advertising and marketing initiatives involving sports and celluloid superstars.
To make this more palatable, it is rumoured that celebrity brand ambassadors could be offered sweat equity in exchange for their marketing and advertising obligations over the seasons.
There are many challenges that the ISL faces, the most important one being the reliance on a sub-par Indian talent pool of players, and the dependence on international stars who are past their prime. The quality of the football will ultimately decide the success of the ISL, and this is, at this juncture, an unknown variable, and a stark contrast to the IPL, which had Indian and international superstars captive to it.
If in future editions it is viable enough to attract current footballing stars from the European leagues even if for short stints, it may overcome the risk and challenges, and finally bring football into the Indian mainstream. Whether the league succeeds or not remains to be seen. But it definitely has potential. If any league can make 'Indians football', it is the ISL.

Jail is no bar: how Jaya  Lalu  Chautala hold on to powerComments
While Jayalalithaa’s conviction in the disproportionate assets case is a victory for the judiciary and for proponents of the decriminalisation of politics, it is unlikely to end the political career of the former chief minister of Tamil Nadu. The truth is that the functioning of political parties rarely changes when their leaders are put behind bars. There are many ways for elected representatives to ensure that their parties run as smoothly as before. These include conducting regular meetings inside jail with a coterie and using loyalists as a link with party functionaries.
J Jayalalithaa with her entourage.
Jayalalithaa is only the latest in a string of powerful politicians who have run their parties from jail. Others include former Bihar chief minister and Rashtriya Janta Dal chief Lalu Prasad Yadav, YSR Congress president YS Jagan Mohan Reddy and former Haryana chief minister OP Chautala.
While members of the political party might be reassured by its continued smooth functioning, a politician calling the shots despite being incarcerated is an indication that the party is not democratic. “The real driver of representative democracy is a political party, which is today run as a personal fiefdom,” says Jagdeep Chhokar, founder member of Association for Democratic Reforms, who believes that few Indian political parties have real internal democracy.
“We still have a very long way to go as democratic society where rule of law is supreme,” he adds.
The trend is more evident in the case of regional parties as they often revolve around a single personality and rarely have a second line of command. “Today, the AIADMK exists because of Jayalalithaa. She is the face of the party and she is the vote catcher,” said Vaasanthi Sundaram, author of the unpublished biography Jayalalithaa: A Portrait. Political analyst Jai Mrug suggests that the scenario is also evidence of the functioning of political parties based on a patron-client relationship. “The leader is seen as a Robin Hood. His acts of omission and commission are overlooked as a trade-off for the benefit of patronage,” he says.
The reverential attitude of jail staff and the privileges extended towards these prisoners are a matter of some concern as they invariably violate prison regulations. Incidentally, there is no classification of inmates under the category of “political prisoners” in the Prisons Act 1894 or in the rules made to operate the law.
So how should jail authorities deal with the demands of high-profile prisoners? “In case he or she wants any kind of different treatment, prison officials should ask for a written direction from the competent authority of the state,” said RK Saxena, former Inspector General (prisons) Rajasthan. Alternatively, the convicted politician has the right to approach the court for entitlements.
“In a majority of the cases, this does not happen and prison authorities go out of their way to make arrangements for prisoners with a political background,” says Saxena. Little wonder then that a politician’s work day looks much the same whether he’s in prison or out of it.
Jayalalithaa’s aura permeates all across

Panneerselvam is Amma’s choice, we will 200 per cent support and do everything that we would do for Amma,” was the refrain of shocked and distraught party workers on the day that Jayalalithaa was taken away to Bangalore Central Prison.
Among her followers, loyalty to Amma is complete. Members of the party cadre even bow in respect to the helicopter that ferries her and prostrate on the floor on which she walks. Where else in India can you shoot pictures of a row of bowing politicians, dressed in trade mark white shirt and dhoti, other than in Tamil Nadu? Whether she is physically present or not, Jayalalithaa’s aura seems to encompass everyone. And for the AIADMK’s men and women, she is here, there and everywhere.
On September 27, when she was jailed, members of the party’s cadre engaged in sporadic and spontaneous incidents of violence. Amma is believed to have sent a quiet but firm word to Pannerselvam to discipline the party cadre, lest the violence provide the opposition with grounds to attack the AIADMK government.
Read: Jayalalithaa sentenced to 4 years in jail; clashes in Tamil Nadu
Given all this, it is no surprise that Amma’s physical presence is not required for the daily functioning of the party for which her every wish is a command.
No formal second-rung leadership has been designated in the party that runs on auto pilot in Jayalalithaa’s absence. This was the case when she spent about three months in 2001 in Bangalore prison and it is the case now too. As in the army, ministers and office bearers know what is expected of them. Discipline is total and its enforcement strict. While Manmohan Singh as prime minister could not dare to reshuffle his cabinet as per his own wishes and had to retain Raja, Jayalalithaa shuffles her ministers like she’s playing a game of cards. Indeed, in Tamil Nadu, administrative and police reshuffles are routine and frequent. “With her, one does know where one stands,” says a former bureaucrat.
Members of the bureaucracy and politicians all know that loyalty is paramount. A whiff of doubt and they could be out. But all this only endears her to her party cadre. They worship her because Brand Amma wins elections.
With or without Karunanidhi

In 2001, DMK chief M Karunanidhi spent about a week in jail after he was arrested in a midnight swoop. His son and political heir Stalin too was arrested. The arrests were in connection with alleged corruption in the construction of 10 flyovers in Chennai.
If his opponents hoped the incident would set him back, they had misjudged.
The incident instantly won Karunanidhi the sympathy of the people who had just voted him out, and the central government, led by Atal Behari Vajpayee, stood firmly by its ally.
MK Stalin too had to spend some time in Madurai jail. Things could have turned chaotic for the party but the DMK, which has a strong cadre and a well-defined party structure, fought back with protests. Some 32,000 party members were lodged in different jails. As a result, Karunanidhi refused to seek bail for himself, thereby earning even more appreciation from his followers.
Read: Katju to Karunanidhi: explain growth of your wealth
The party cadre’s loyalty, intact even today, was the engine that drove the protests. “How badly Kalaignar was treated was shocking.  Cadres were angry, restless and agitated. But the illegal arrests were criticised by everyone,” says a senior DMK leader.
The DMK has a firm party structure in place and its executive council comprising senior leaders discuss, debate and deliberate, often clashing with one another on issues. But once Karunanidhi himself takes a final call and issues a directive, everyone falls in line.
Even when Karunanidhi was lodged at the central jail, his party apparatus worked as if he was still physically among them. Matters were eased somewhat by the fact that his trusted followers including senior leaders, who built the party with Karunanidhi, know his mind and strove to work accordingly.
However, the party did not have to suffer too long. Karunanidhi was released in less than 10 days as public opinion in the country and the central government too came down heavily against the Jayalalithaa government for the manner in which the entire issue had been handled.
Jail no hindrance for OP Chautala in ticket distribution

About one-and-a-half years ago, the principal opposition party in Haryana, the Indian National Lok Dal, looked like it would collapse.
The reason: On January 22, 2013, the Delhi CBI court sentenced the INLD supremo and former chief minister Om Prakash Chautala, his elder son Ajay Chautala — sitting MLA from Dabwali — and eight others to 10 years imprisonment in a case involving the illegal recruitment of about 3,000 teachers.
 The INLD, which has always been seen as centered around Chautala, quickly reconciled itself to being led from prison. Matters that just could not be tackled from prison were looked after by Chautala’s younger son Abhay Chautala. The sitting MLA from Ellenabad took the party’s reins in his hands while ensuring that senior leaders including KC Bangar and party president Ashok Arora were by his side.
Meanwhile, the jailed leaders would periodically check into the Medanta Hospital, a five-star health facility in Gurgaon that’s everything a prison is not. Naturally, Chautala is kept abreast of all party goings-on and information. Communication between the leader and the workers has also been total.
Read: INLD supremo OP Chautala surrenders at Tihar Jail
Indeed, communication has been so smooth that, Chautala, who has been meeting a large number of party workers at the hospital every day, has also decided the distribution of all the 88 tickets (of the total 90 seats — two were given to INLD ally Shiromani Akali Dal). In between all this excitement, Chautala was also periodically granted bail on different grounds.
Perhaps the INLD leader had been pushing the envelope rather too brazenly. The bail given by the court was heavily criticised by the CBI when Chautala, on his extended bail (begun from September 25, 2014), began campaigning at full throttle in support of his candidates across the state.
Earlier this week, the CBI’s objections led the court to ask Chautala to appear before it on October 10. Subsequently, he was asked to surrender to jail authorities by October 11. Does this mean party workers will be bereft? Quite unlikely judging from past events.
Lalu Prasad Yadav's art of conducting jail durbars

The jail authorities were at his service and ensured that he got the same treatment as he did when he was chief minister.  Except for the fact that he functioned as de facto chief minister from the camp jail, Lalu’s routine was as normal as ever.  As his wife was at the helm of the state’s affairs, officials regularly visited the jail and took directives from Lalu on every issue big or small. He cleared files in consultation with some top bureaucrats and issued directives to the secretaries of departments. Some senior officials used to carry files to the jail so Lalu could take a look at them and include his directives. Those files were then ferried back to the chief minister who would affix her signature.
Read: Jayalalithaa lodged in jail while Chautala, Lalu are out on bail
During his second stint at Patna’s Beur jail and later at the designated prison ward of the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS), Lalu continued with a similar routine of meeting party leaders and officials. Meeting hours were fixed for durbars and for the RJD leaders, who flocked to him inside the prison ward. Astute politician that he is, Lalu used his jail terms to reap political benefits and to consolidate his backward class and Muslim vote bank to his advantage in later elections.
Life in prison was not particularly inconvenient for Lalu who used to cook the food he enjoyed, which included  mutton and fish preparations, with pomfret being a special favourite. Every day, the stream of supporters from his political turf Chapra and its nearby areas would throng the prison ward and bring him gifts of food including curd, fish of all varieties and crabs. His barber and masseur too visited him regularly. “It was sort of an open jail for him,” recalled a staff member of the IGIMS.

Pak targets 15 border posts  villages along IB in Jammu  3 injuredPak targets 15 posts in Jammu, seeks UN help
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  Jammu, October 12, 2014

Pakistan heavily shelled 15 border outposts and hamlets in Arnia sector of Jammu and Kashmir early Sunday even as it wrote to UN chief Ban Ki-moon blaming India for the escalation in border clashes and sought UN intervention on Kashmir.
The shelling, the first since Thursday, injured three people and ends a pause in fighting that has already killed 19 civilians in the two countries in the worst skirmishes in a decade. The Pakistan foreign ministry has claimed that Indian firing over the past month has killed 12 and injured 52 of its civilians.

In the letter to Ban, foreign affairs adviser to Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif, Sartaj Aziz, accused India of ‘deliberate and unprovoked violations of the ceasefire agreement and cross-border firing’. He also appealed for UN’s assistance in resolving the dispute with India over the status of Kashmir.
Though there was no formal reaction from New Delhi, India has long maintained that disputes between it and Pakistan should be resolved bilaterally under the framework of the Shimla agreement and Lahore declaration.
 India also considers the UN observer group on Kashmir to have outlived its utility and has criticised Pakistan for depending on a ‘tool of a bygone era’ to address the problems of the present.

The latest round of shelling  by Pakistan comes a week after five people were killed in Arnia.
“Flat trajectory weaponry fire started at 8.10pm (Saturday) on three border posts in Arnia and continued till early morning,” a BSF spokesperson said.
The fresh firing has forced authorities to drop any moves to allow the nearly 30,000 people living in government relief camps to return to their homes.

Cyclone Hudhud reaches peak strength  batters eastern IndiaCyclone Hudhud blasts India's east coast, at least five dead
By By Jatindra Dash | Reuters –  Sun 12 Oct, 2014

By Jatindra Dash
VISAKHAPATNAM India (Reuters) - Cyclone Hudhud blasted India's eastern seaboard on Sunday with gusts of up to 195 km per hour (over 120 mph), uprooting trees, damaging buildings and killing at least five people despite a major evacuation effort.
The port city of Visakhapatnam, home to two million people and a major naval base, was hammered as the cyclone made landfall, unleashing the huge destructive force it had sucked up from the warm waters of the Bay of Bengal.
Wreckage was strewn across Visakhapatnam, known to locals as Vizag. Most people heeded warnings to take refuge, but five were killed by falling trees and masonry, and thousands of homes were damaged, emergency officials said.
The chief minister of Andhra Pradesh, the state that bore the brunt of Hudhud's onslaught, said the extent of damage would only become known after the storm abates.
"We are unable to ascertain the situation. Seventy percent of communication has totally collapsed ... this is the biggest calamity," N. Chandrababa Naidu told Headlines Today television.
"We are asking people not to come out of their houses," Naidu said, adding that damage assessment would start on Monday. "We are mobilising men and material immediately."
Prime Minister Narendra Modi called Naidu and promised "all possible assistance in relief and rescue operations", his central government said in a statement.
The low toll reported so far followed an operation to evacuate more than 150,000 people to minimise the risk to life from Hudhud - similar in size and power to cyclone Phailin that struck the area exactly a year ago.
After a lull as the eye of the storm passed over the city, winds regained their potency. Forecasters warned Hudhud would blow strongly for several hours more, before wind speeds halve in the evening.
"Reverse windflow will be experienced by the city, which will again have a very great damage potential," L.S. Rathore, director-general of the state India Meteorological Department (IMD), told reporters in New Delhi.
The IMD forecast a storm surge of one to two metres (three to six feet) above high tide that could result in flooding of low-lying coastal areas around Visakhapatnam, Vijayanagaram and Srikakulam.
TERRIFYING WIND
A Reuters reporter in Visakhapatnam said the storm had smashed his hotel's windows and flooded the ground floor. It was difficult even to open the door of his room, he said, as wind rushing through the corridors drove it shut again.
"I never imagined that a cyclone could be so dangerous and devastating," said one businessman who was staying in the hotel. "The noise it is making would terrify anyone."
An operations centre in state capital Hyderabad was inundated with calls from people seeking help, including 350 students stranded in their hostel without food or water, said K. Hymavathi, a top disaster management official.
Visakhapatnam port suspended operations on Saturday night, with its head saying that 17 ships which had been in the harbour were moving offshore where they would be less at risk from high seas. The city airport was closed and train services suspended.
The IMD rated Hudhud as a very severe cyclonic storm that could pack gusts of 195 kph and dump more than 24.5 cm (10 inches) of rain.
The cyclone was strong enough to have a "high humanitarian impact" on nearly 11 million people, the Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System (GDACS), run by the United Nations and the European Commission, said.
The evacuation effort was comparable to one preceding Cyclone Phailin, credited with minimising fatalities to 53. When a huge storm hit the same area 15 years ago, 10,000 people died.
Hudhud was likely to batter a 200-300 km stretch of coastline before losing force as it moves inland, forecasters said.
According to the IMD, peak wind speeds will drop to 60 kph by Monday afternoon. Hudhud is expected to continue to dump heavy rains in northern and northeastern India and, eventually, snow when it reaches the Himalayan mountains.

Sunday ET | Pros and cons of  Rurban  MissionChhabria’s story is inevitably linked with that of two other men — United Spirits chairman Vijay Mallya and Chhabria’s elder brother, the late Manu Chhabria.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
Kishore Rajaram Chhabria, 59, loves being driven across the United States. In September, Chhabria along with wife Bina travelled more than 500 km between two small American towns, Barnard in Vermont and Bedford in Pennsylvania, staying in hotels for several days in both towns. Empty roads and lonely towns inspire Chhabria.
The sense of emptiness helps him "strategize", he says. Though a frequent visitor to the US, Chhabria does not own a house there and prefers hiring chauffeur-driven cars. Left-hand-drives confuse him. For Chhabria — the businessman — this is the right time for strategizing. A lot is at stake. His company Allied Blenders and Distillers (ABD), which owns Officer's Choice, the world's largest selling whiskey brand by volume, has blueprinted an aggressive growth plan. It includes the buyout of a competing brand, acquisition of distilleries and bottling units, heavy borrowing to fuel this binge, and finally, a public issue of shares in two years.
Chhabria's story is inevitably linked with that of two other men — United Spirits chairman Vijay Mallya and Chhabria's elder brother, the late Manu Chhabria. The trio has over the last three decades joined hands and fallen out many times (see The Liquor Wars). Manu Chhabria passed away in 2002, and his family sold the liquor business to Mallya. Mallya has since handed over management control of his liquor business to Diageo and is struggling to hold on to his board seat and chairmanship. Only Kishore Chhabria , with Officer's Choice, which accounts for 75% of ABD's sales by volume, has the luxury to plan growth or take time off in never-heard-of towns in the US, which are almost cathartic for him.
Old-World Style
In India, Chhabria seems to have wrapped himself up in familiarity and tradition. Chhabria loves to be unconventional, in an industry where flamboyance is the convention. At home, which is Casa Grande on Little Gibbs Road, near south Mumbai's Hanging Gardens, Chhabria prefers an old-world style. His office is in the same building as his residence, and he is surrounded by a group of old faithful and some anachronisms like CCTV cameras monitoring every room in the office with the monitor placed directly in front of his table. The office decor is anything but modern, and the drapes and chandeliers may even qualify as opulent.
"I have married only once. Bala (VR Balakrishnan), my secretary, was earlier my father's secretary. My cook has been around for 36 years and my driver for 27 years. Once I grab hold of a person I rarely let go," Chhabria says. Chhabria's company ABD is the third largest maker of Indian-made foreign liquor (IMFL, the rather curious contraction used by governments to differentiate liquor made in the organised sector from indigenous hooch). An 8% market share in IMFL makes ABD one of the largest Indian-owned liquor businesses. The corporate office is at Lower Parel, in a spanking new building, where the company's CEO Deepak Roy sits. Roy, an industry veteran who has also worked with Mallya in the past, has been allotted 5% sweat equity in the company by Chhabria, who owns the rest. Chhabria's son-in-law Jeetu Hemdev, who is married to his elder daughter, works under Roy.
Chhabria confesses that he never encouraged either of his two daughters to take an interest in his business. "In hindsight, I can admit I was wrong. I thought liquor was not a good business for women," he offers.

TOPICS
company information
Infosys, on Friday, cheered the investors by reporting a strong growth in the second quarter ended September 30, 2014. The city-based IT company reported a consolidated net profit of Rs.3,096 crore against Rs.2,407 crore in the year ago period, up 28.6 per cent. On a quarterly basis, the net profit witnessed a growth of around 7.3 per cent when compared to the previous quarter.
The company also surprised the investors by announcing 1:1 bonus issue of equity shares and 1:1 stock dividend of American depository shares, to increase liquidity of its shares and expand the retail shareholder base. The move to issue bonus shares for employees is after eight years. The board also declared an interim dividend of Rs.30 a share
The consolidated revenue for the reported period rose by 2.9 per cent to Rs.13,342 crore from Rs.12,965 crore in the corresponding period last year. In dollar terms, the net profit increased 6 per cent sequentially, and the total revenue grew by 3.1 per cent. The company held liquid assets, including cash and cash equivalents, certificates of deposits and government bonds, worth Rs.33,616 crore at the end of September 30, 2014. Going forward, the company expects its revenue for the full fiscal year to grow 6.7-8.7 per cent.
During the quarter, Infosys and its subsidiaries added 49 clients, and also made a gross addition of 6,682 employees. At the end of the second quarter, there were 1.65 lakh employees. The attrition rate went up to 20.1 per cent from 19.5 per cent quarter ago and 17.3 per cent year ago.
“Digital transformation is reshaping the business of every one of our clients. We see this as a great opportunity to help them renew the core of their business as well as to expand into new frontiers and are seeing early positive results,” said Infosys’ newly appointed Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director Vishal Sikka.
Infosys revenues from the major geographic such as North America and Europe increased marginally to 60.8 per cent and 24.7 per cent, respectively. The company’s revenues from the Indian business witnessed a drop in growth and stood at 2.2 per cent in the second quarter when compared to 2.4 per cent previous year.
On the margins front, the company posted 100-basis point sequential expansion in its operating profit margin for the second quarter Q2 at 26.1 per cent.
“We have been able to improve our margins during the quarter and feel confident of sustaining these within a narrow band,” said Rajiv Bansal, Chief Financial Officer. “This is giving us increased confidence to make the investments required to meet our growth aspirations.”
Major verticals such as banking and financial services and insurance contributed around 32.8 per cent of the total revenue followed by manufacturing and retail as well as life science at 23.3 per cent and 23.4 per cent, respectively.
The earnings during the quarter were mainly fuelled by the uptick in demand environment, cost optimisation, coupled with the company’s cost rationalisation measures. “On several fronts, our efforts to bring in operational efficiencies yielded encouraging results during the quarter,” Infosys Chief Operating Officer U. B. Pravin Rao said. “We have seen positive results of some of our interventions on sales, margins and attrition, and we will continue to focus on these areas.”
The financial performance of the company in the second quarter was welcomed by the bourses. On the BSE, the company’s shares closed 6.68 per cent higher at Rs.3,888.95 on Friday.
Commenting on the Infosys results, Mr. Dipen Shah, Head- Private Client Group Research, Kotak Securities, said, “Infosys results were higher than our estimates on the revenues and margins front. The guidance has been maintained, which is along expected lines. The company has improved efficiencies while adding a relatively higher number of employees, which is encouraging. We remain optimistic on the future prospects of Infosys.”

Karnataka govt prohibits Bosch plant strikeUpdated: October 10, 2014 23:58 IST
Karnataka govt prohibits Bosch plant strike
Special Correspondent
strike
Karnataka government has issued an order which prohibits the ongoing strike at auto component maker Bosch’s plant in Bangalore. The workers are on strike since September 16 in support of their demands pertaining to wages, benefits and regularisation of temporary workers.
In a press release, Bosch said the State government issued the order dated October 10 prohibiting the strike with immediate effect.
The Mico Employees Association president S. Prasanna Kumar, however, declared the strike will continue. “It is holiday tomorrow and day after, we will continue our strike on Monday,” he told The Hindu.
A writ petition filed by the Association in the High Court of Karnataka, challenging the conciliation being declared a failure by the government, is scheduled to be taken up on Monday.
The release from Bosch Ltd said prior to the order, the Labour Department had convened conciliatory meetings between the management and workers. There were also ‘special interventions’ by many senior government officials and senior ministers. The proceedings, ‘unfortunately’ did not result in a mutually agreeable resolution.
Stating it will ‘continue to adopt a fair, but firm approach,’ the company asked the workers to call off the strike, report to work and restore normalcy.

(Facebook requested Prasad…)
NEW DELHI: World's biggest social network Facebook wants to connect more people to internet in India which accounts for the third largest online user base globally after China and the US but has a very low internet penetration growth rate.
On his first visit to India, Facebook CEO and co-founder Mark Zuckerberg today met Telecom Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad to discuss expanding reach of internet including by using alternate technology.
After an about hour long meeting, Prasad told reporters that meeting was fruitful and Facebook has shown interest in joining Digital India program of India.
"Connecting more than a billion people with internet is not only going to improve lives of people in India but helping innovation and imagination of Indian people will help turn around the world and we are very excited in opportunities in India," Zuckerberg said.
According to sources, Facebook requested Prasad to establish single point contact in his ministry for the alternate technology to which the minister immediately agreed.
"We have dedicated some officials from my ministry to work closely with Facebook on their proposals to expand digital services in the country," Prasad said.
A ministry official said Joint Secretary Telecom and Joint Secretary IT will be single point contact for Facebook for their projects so that the modalities related to their alternate technology is expeditiously worked out.
Facebook is also in process to launch applications on utility services for which customer may not have to pay any internet charges as the company is doing in Zambia in partnership with Indian telecom major Airtel.
"Zuckerberg said that they are almost ready to launch service as they have done in Zambia with Airtel. Minister has assured them of full support," the official said.
Prasad has asked Facebook CEO to partner in National Optical Fibre Network program which aim to connect 2.5 lakh village panchayats by high speed broadband by 2017 to which Zuckerberg has agreed.
"Minister asked them to play role in retailing of broadband services once NOFN is ready. They have said that they will build business with new entrepreneurs in the country," the official said.
Facebook in India has over 100 million active users. The company recently acquired mobile messaging application WhatsApp which adds to its reach in the country.

Blasted by Pawars  but Chavan finds NCP a like-minded partyCongress
(I would urge everybody that…)
The Battle for Maharashtra assembly is being fought by the Congress party under the leadership of former Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan. He is the sole face presented by the Congress in this campaign. Chavan is now targeted during this election campaign not just by the opposition BJP and Shiv Sena but also by his own ally the NCP. Prithviraj Chavan spoke on the current political scenario and on the allegations levelled against him in an exclusive interview with ET's Rohit Chandavarkar. Excerpts:
You are the sole face of the party in this campaign. The Congress never went with a single face earlier. Is this some learning from the BJP's Lok Sabha campaign?
Alot of thinking happened about how the campaign for Maharashtra assembly elections should be designed. We took advise from professionals and also did a lot of internal discussions. It was decided by the media committee that this kind of a campaign would be best suited for assembly polls. The campaign is happening under my leadership so it was decided to design it in this manner.
Pawars are saying they will never work with you or Congress.
I would urge everybody that they should not assume anything. We believe we will emerge as the largest single party in these elections. Nobody should assume their support will be inevitable for the party that wants to form the government. Such presumptions are hypothetical.
Have you thought about post-election alliances?
The Congress will never go with the BJP or Shiv Sena or for that matter with the MNS . We have to go with likeminded parties. If we think that we are in a position to form a government with some likeminded party that situation will be addressed in the post-poll situation. The party's central leadership will take a call on who has to work with whom at the right time.
The Congress feels that NCP is likeminded but some leaders of the NCP have openly said that they have many options and wide choice.
That is the difference between us and them. We have certain ideological values and follow certain principles. We know that the NCP was trying to get close to the NDA before the Lok Sabha elections . Many leaders know about this and have even spoken about this. We will not compromise on ideology. I think one of the big things happening in the elections this time is that the relevance of likeminded smaller or regional parties will be put to a severe test. For instance Shiv Sena and Maharashtra Navanirman Sena (MNS) are likeminded and functioning exactly on similar lines.
Now, people will decide whether two parties are required in this space. I think voters will decide and give a mandate on this. Similarly Congress and NCP are likeminded. The very relevance and existence of the smaller and regional parties will be put under a severe test in these elections.
How do you react to allegations about procrastination and indecision?
In today's day and age, everything is on record and transparent. I don't have to tell you anything. Everything is accessible through Right To Information ( RTI). Anybody can put an application and check out how fast or slow my government was working. I have installed a file journey management system software in my office, which is monitoring everything. I cleared 36,000 files during my tenure.

Bizarre & brave options for post-poll action in Maharashtra(Even ‘development angst’…)
By Kumar Ketkar
There is little consensus among those debating different postelections scenarios for Maharashtra in drawing rooms, local trains, lunch rooms and canteens. But the crux of all discussions hovers around the persona and politics of PM Narendra Modi , who continues to polarise every debate.
The opinion polls too seem to be quite confusing as multiple identities have entered the electoral fray. The Hindutva identity is overshadowed by the Marathi pride, at least in Mumbai-Konkan belt; the Maratha caste identity has overtaken the Hindu card in western and south Maharashtra; the Vidarbha identity has become an issue in Nagpur-Amravati; Gopinath Munde's legacy represented by his daughter Pankaja has brought the OBC issue to the surface. Even 'development angst' has taken a backseat. This is why, though Modi's rallies have been aggressive, his campaign has been defensive. That he had to undertake two dozen rallies is seen as an act of desperation, since no single issue is dominant.
Given the political flux, here are some different permutations and combinations:
Scenario 1: A majority for BJP along with its four allies. This would lead to election of a BJP CM. BJP (or its Mahayuti) will have to win at least 145 assembly seats for this to materalise.
Scenario 2: BJP and allies get 110-130 seats and forms the government with the help of independents. This will mean a BJP-led government, but not a coalition, in the classical sense. If opinion polls are to be believed, one of these options are most likely.
Scenario 3: BJP with allies secure 90-100 seats. Needing 45-55 MLAs more, the party offers the hand of friendship to the Sena, forgetting and forgiving the recent fracas. Congress and NCP had similarly come together in 1999, just months after NCP was created because some Congressmen could not acc ept Sonia Gandhi's foreign origin.
Scenario 4: The Shiv Sena wins 80-100 seats against BJP's tally of 70-80. With Sena falling short, Uddhav Thackeray makes BJP an offer it cannot refuse. He then becomes the chief minister of the Sena-BJP alliance, both bury the acrimony and remember their 25-year old marriage and Hindutva family values.
Scenario 5: BJP and Sena refuse to join hands despite failing to secure a majority on their own. With either party needing around 70-odd legislators, NCP and Shiv Sena could come together, get MNS to join them and manage to reach the magic figure of 145. For this to happen, NCP will have to win about 50-60 seats, Shiv Sena 80-90 seats and MNS 10-15 seats. This is unlikely, but not improbable.
Scenario 6: NCP and Congress manage 60-70 seats each and decide to repeat the 1999 coalition experiment. They too could manage enough rebel winners ready to come back. Prithviraj Chavan or Ajit Pawar are then likely to become CM. No one may be ready to bet on this but one cannot rule out this.
Scenario 7: None of the major political parties are willing to cooperate with each other, something similar to the scene in the Delhi assembly but with much more at stake. In that situation, there will be President's rule. During the President's rule period, some parties may reconcile with others to manage the numbers and form a government. If the deadlock is not broken even then, there would be another election in a year. Modi may perhaps prefer it because president rule in effect means rule by the PMO .
Readers could work out even more interesting scenarios, logical or outlandish!

Maharashtra united
(The manifesto said that…)
MUMBAI: Coming barely five days before the Assembly polls in Maharashtra, Shiv Sena today released its election manifesto, which focusses on the overall development of the state.
The manifesto, released by Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray , stresses on keeping Maharashtra united .
Sena and MNS have previously attacked BJP after charging that it was plotting to divide Mumbai and Maharashtra while NCP chief Sharad Pawar has claimed that the party was pursuing its agenda favouring the formation of smaller states.
Sena vowed to once again make Maharashtra the most- favoured investment destination if voted to power.
Sena, which underwent a bitter split with BJP, its partner for 25 years, has promised to expedite infrastructure development in Mumbai through a slew of projects, including coastal road, freeing up of Mumbai Port Trust land, development of eastern coast and completion of the Navi Mumbai airport well within the stipulated time.
The manifesto said that free tablet computers will be provided to students in the rural and urban areas of Maharashtra. The tabs, which will come with solar power chargers, would be given to students of Classes 8 to 10 under the state syllabus, promised Sena.
Besides, Sena has assured that it would undertake beautification work for Mumbai and its beaches and develop Maharashtra as a business and agriculture hub.
The party also promised modern health facilities for the people of the state.

(The AICC panel has straightway…)
NEW DELHI: Congress president Sonia Gandhi has referred Kerala PCC's demand for "appropriate action" against party MP Shashi Tharoor , for his "pro-Modi stands", to the AICC disciplinary action committee headed by AK Antony. Senior Congress leaders Motilal Vohra and Sushil Kumar Shinde are the other members of the panel.
The AICC panel has straightway started processing the charge against Tharoor with Antony holding talks with Vora in New Delhi on Friday.
Shinde, who is campaigning in Maharashtra, is also learnt to have been apprised of Gandhi's decision to refer the PCC demand against Tharoor to the panel.
As per the organisational norms, the AICC disciplinary committee will serve a show-cause-notice to the accused to give the person an opportunity to offer an explanation or an apology whichever may be the case.
A source said the AICC panel could respond to the PCC's demand for action against Tharoor after the completion of elections in Maharashtra and Haryana. The PCC has been demanding that Tharoor withdraw himself as a brand ambassador of Narendra Modi-initiated Swachh Bharat plan and apologise for his recent "pro-Modi remarks" or he be removed as AICC spokesperson and placed under suspension.

People looking for food porn come to Zomato.xxx: CEOPeople looking for food porn come to Zomato.xxx, says founder Deepinder Goyal

Deepinder Goyal is a first generation entrepreneur, but got support from his family when he set up Zomato.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
There was a time when people would rack their brains to search for a place to eat out. The online restaurant guide Zomato started in 2008 and changed that. With a few clicks, it suggested places you could eat or order food from.
Since then, the Gurgaon-based company has been on an expansion overdrive. Zomato's net is now spread in 16 countries. It entered four new markets by acquiring local equivalents of itself — MenuMania (New Zealand), Lunchtime (Czech Republic), Obedovat (Slovakia) and Gastronauci (Poland).
Last month, Zomato expanded its presence in Indonesia. The firm also won the 2014 Economic Times 'Startup of the Year' award. ETPanache speaks to Deepinder Goyal, founder and CEO, Zomato, about all things food and business.
What does food mean to you? What do you consider to be soul food?
Food for me has always been about exploring and discovering cuisines. My need to discover food translated into organising menus and this gave birth to Zomato. About soul food, nothing hits the spot like butter chicken.
What are the new things you learnt about different food cultures through your job?
In Philippines, I learnt that it's rude to stay quiet while eating. In Qatar and the UAE, you never touch food with the left hand. In the UK, never leave a spoon in a teacup.
Getting into a new market is challenging. In which city did you enjoy setting up business and which were the places which were difficult to penetrate?
We had a memorable country launch in Lisbon, Portugal. The vibrant dining and internet scene makes it a great market for our product. Restaurant owners and the people in Lisbon were extremely receptive to our platform.
On the contrary, the UK entry was tough because of competition and the market size. The market is extremely fragmented in terms of discovery and transactional websites. When we launched in January 2013, we ran an outdoor advertising campaign in the London underground in advance to raise awareness about Zomato. In other countries, we haven't needed to advertise.
What features did you introduce to woo customers in the UK?
We offered restaurants based on categories such as 'great places for breakfast', 'pet friendly' restaurants, etc, based on the popularity of these restaurant categories in London. We recently launched table bookings by partnering with Opentable, Bookatable and ResDiary.
How do you know you are hiring the right people, especially in smaller cities and cities abroad?
We try to go beyond traditional hiring techniques. A person's personality and attitude are definitely what stand out during our hiring conversations. One without the other doesn't cut it for us.
We started 'Trial Week' for engineers and 'Leadership Program'that focuses on picking up former entrepreneurs. Of course, finding the right person can take months. Once we have identified the right person in the leadership position,though, it takes us about three or four days to make the offer.
From which city in India do you clock maximum traffic and for what cuisines?
Delhi sees the most traffic in India. It's by far the most exciting city for food in the country. There's been a high demand for global cuisines in the Capital with increasing demand for Italian food. We are also noticing steady user increase in smaller cities. With an increase in the number of young professionals with high disposable incomes, eating out has become extremely popular.
You are a foodie. What is the weirdest dish you have had till now and where?
Black pudding in London. I tried it during our London launch. A few of my colleagues and I had stepped out for breakfast and ordered a full English breakfast. When I had the first bite of this strange black mass on my plate, I made a weird face. My colleague informed me the dish contained pig's blood mixed with some oatmeal. I continued eating it.
Your favourite food dishes?
I eat out a fair bit (more than I like, actually). My favourite dishes are Galouti kebabs and butter chicken.
How do you maintain a work-life balance?
I am online from Monday to Saturday. On Sundays, however, I try to switch off so I can spend time with my wife Kanchan and daughter.
What was your parents' reaction when you quit Bain & Company to focus on Zomato? We hear you told them after you put in your papers. And are you a first generation entrepreneur in your family?
Yes, I'm a first generation entrepreneur. My parents don't really think about things once they have happened. When I told them I had quit my job, their reaction was "Ok, whatever, you'll figure it out". They asked me to tell them if things got difficult financially. My wife, Kanchan, has supported me always and is a big believer of Zomato. It is important having family's support in your entrepreneurial pursuits.
Is there a well-known person you have an unexpected connection with?
I share a great working relationship with investor Sanjeev Bikhchandani of Info Edge. He is more an entrepreneur, less investor. When Sanjeev and I met for the first time, we hit it off. It's been a great run since then.
On Zomato.xxx
Around 2010-11, people were starting to talk a lot about food porn. We realised we were sitting on an untapped opportunity. xxx domains are hard to come by and we thought it would be a good idea to get a xxx domain for the purpose of displaying delicious food. We have seen a great response from users.

In pics: Andhra braces for cyclone HudhudWorst of cyclone Hudhud over, rain remains the worry
It was on the same day last year that Cyclone Phailin made a landfall at Gopalpur – 285 kms North East of Visakhapatnam.
Visakhapatnam city and district and the four adjacent districts – Srikakulam, Vizianagam towards north and East and West Godavari districts to the south are on high alert and are bracing for Hudhud, which stopped shy of becoming a super cyclone.
The penultimate danger signal no. 10 is raised at the posts of Kalingapatnam, Bhimunipatnam, Visakhapatnam and Gangavaram.
It was the lull before the storm on Friday but Saturday was a picture of the danger looming large.

Without RIL s wealth  I wouldn t have been able to pursue my passion for philanthropy(Without the wealth I would…)
Nita Ambani talks about her pet ventures. Excerpts from an interview with ET Magazine:
On the interest in sports, first cricket and then football:
I will be honest. I got involved (in football) only three months back. I lost my father recently. The first meeting on the football league was on the 13th day. Now everywhere I am surrounded by it. You know, honestly, I realized I didn't know anything about cricket when we started Mumbai Indians . I learnt by mistakes. In football too, we have a long journey ahead, the goal being that India plays the 2026 World Cup.
On her penchant for getting into details of projects:
I do get involved in a lot of detailing and I have learnt this from my husband Mukesh. It can have positives as well as negatives. Attention to detail can sometimes slow us down. For example, sometimes people ask me why aren't we building 15 Dhirubhai Ambani International Schools across the country. But while looking into detail, I like to empower our teams to take the decisions. And as Mukesh says, one needs to have both floodlights (for the big-picture view) and spotlights (for the nitty-gritty).
On what she has learnt from Mukesh Ambani and Dhirubhai:
From Mukesh, I have learnt two things: that we should not be afraid to make mistakes. You never get it right the first time, but you have to accept the mistake, work harder and move on. The second thing is you should never sacrifice quality. One more thing that I learnt from him is to respect every human being. I was 21 when I got married, and there was so much inspiration in my house from my father-in-law Dhirubhai Ambani and husband Mukesh. Living in the same house as my father-in-law, I could learn so many things. The main thing was positivity. He used to say that if you can keep your attitude positive, small issues will disappear.
On how her philanthropic focus juxtaposes with the wealth-creation machine that Reliance is:
Without the wealth I would not be able to pursue my passion (for philanthropy). And a big part of wealth creation is also creation of jobs — we (Reliance) are creating 1,25,000 jobs. Now with me on the board, where I represent the CSR part of Reliance, we are looking at how to lend scale to the CSR activities. I want to speed up the foundation work. Education can be scaled up. With Reliance Jio coming in, we can somehow make healthcare available on the phone.

How Nita Ambani is ensuring grassroot develo...How Nita Ambani ensures that RIL's wealth is used to do good at the grassroot level

Creating something out of nothing is what Nita Ambani has been doing for a while now, be it in healthcare and education or in urban renewal and rural development
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
Around a decade and a half ago, two Indian couples landed in Antarctica's Argentinian airbase of Marambio. They were family friends and household names in India Inc — the power couple of Piramal Healthcare, Swati and Ajay Piramal , and the then-heir apparent at Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), Mukesh Ambani , and wife Nita. Swati Piramal recollects how they flew in from Argentina with couples of other nationalities as part of an initiative of Young Presidents Organisation, a global networking group of young chief executives. "There was this vast open barren land and nothing around. On the way we had seen penguins, but near the airbase, there was absolutely nothing," she remembers.
Ask Swati about her co-traveller on the trip, Nita, and she is reminded of a different tract of nothingness — the parched landscape in Jamnagar in the '90s. Piramal recounts the RIL township Nita had designed for employees on what was virtually desert land, using drip irrigation to grow an orchard alongside. Swati says she is most impressed by Nita's "ability to create something magnificent out of nothing". "I have seen her build the Dhirubhai Ambani International School (DAIS) starting with a piece of paper," she adds. "Many can build a school, but she has built India's best."
New Ball Games
Creating something out of nothing is what Nita Ambani has been doing for a while now, be it in healthcare and education or in urban renewal and rural development. As the founder of Reliance Foundation, the petrochemicals and refining giant's philanthropic arm, she now has top-notch professionals to help her execute a basket of diverse initiatives. And she has few inhibitions about stepping into arenas she never laid foot before. Like sports.
Nita easily confesses she knew nothing about cricket when she became a co-owner of Mumbai Indians , a franchise in the Indian Premier League . Ditto for football where she now heads the Hero Indian Super League (ISL). The two-month-long football league (in collaboration with the All India Football Federation ) is about to start with marquee players from all over the world — albeit retired ones. It is being managed by an RIL joint venture between Reliance-IMG and Star TV .
Nita is a quick learner, though, and talks about her interactions with football legends like Alessandro Del Piero and Robert Pires in the same breath as her other pet themes such as education and healthcare (Del Piero is determined to leave his mark on Indian football, according to her).
Slew of Projects
Nita's goal is to enable India to qualify for the football World Cup in 2026, which means that India will have to catapult from its dismal 158th ranking to amongst the top 32 teams in the world in 12 years. Cynics would say RIL stands a better chance of becoming the world's biggest company than India qualifying for the quadrennial football tournament.
For Nita, though, the means may be more important than the end of World Cup qualification. And the means involves getting boys — and girls — to play the game at the grassroots level. Indeed, the common link between sports — whether it's cricket or football doesn't really matter — and the initiatives in education, healthcare and rural development is children. "Education and health care go hand in hand. We have to ensure that every girl child is educated. And if every boy wants a football, we also have to be able to give every girl a toilet."
A similar passion for nitty gritty is evident in another pet project that's keeping Nita busy these days. Sir HN Reliance Foundation Hospital, a 90-year-old institution, reopens as a tertiary care hospital on Diwali. Reliance Foundation took over the hospital around eight years ago and has been renovating it for the last three. It wants to provide world-class healthcare and also serve the underprivileged who live in the area.
It's been quite a ride for Nita, from a middle-class youngster from suburban Mumbai, who married into one of India's richest families at 21 and then in three decades has emerged as a champion of social development. Her friends from her teenage days recollect her quest for perfection in the little things that matter.
On returning home from school, Nita and her schoolmate at Rose Garden Manor School, Meeta Doshi, used to write letters to each other every evening. Doshi, now a practising dentist in Berkeley, California, and Nita don't of course communicate as often these days, but Doshi recalls her obsession with excellence. "Whether it was a dance performance or participating in a sporting event, she always gave it her best and invariably shone."
After marrying Mukesh Ambani, Nita picked up another trait to support her quest for perfection — attention to detail. She says it is Mukesh who taught her about 'floodlights' and 'spotlights', or the need for combining vision with attention to detail. As Gustad Davar, medical director of the hospital, says: "Mrs Ambani is very sensitive to a patient's needs as well as a patient's family needs." The hospital will focus on easy admissions and quick discharges of patients as well as an online queuing system and separate waiting rooms for families on every floor.

Hudhud makes landfall in Vishakapatnam coast, three killed

Andhra Pradesh
(Strong winds and heavy rains…)
VISHAKAPATNAM: Severe cyclonic storm Hudhud with wind speed of 170-180 kmph made a landfall in this port city of Andhra Pradesh today triggering heavy downpour that left three persons dead in Visakhapatnam and Srikakulam districts.
Strong winds and heavy rains triggered by the cyclone led to largescale destruction of power lines leading to outages in the three districts of Visakhapatnam, Vizianagaram and Srikakulam.
"Three deaths have been reported due to the impact of Hudhud cyclone. Two died after trees fell on them and one in collapse of compound-wall in Visakhapatnam and Srikakulam districts, respectively," Andhra Pradesh Chief Secretary I V R Krishna Rao said.
During the cyclone, winds with 195-200 kmph speed have been reported causing uprooting of a lot of trees. The wind has also damaged electrical poles and mobile towers. Due to fall of electric poles, electricity and communication network have been effected in the area, he said.
People of Visakhapatnam, Srikakulam and Vizianagaram districts have been asked to stay back in their houses and if the walls of their houses are weak they can shift to cyclone relief centres, Rao said.
The cyclone, which crossed the Visakhapatnam coast, seems to be in a period of lull in the first hour, but people should follow the advisory as it may suddenly aggravate later, officials said. NDRF teams have been deployed in affected areas, the chief secretary said.
In Delhi, IMD Director Laxman Singh Rathore said the centre of cyclone was crossing the Andhra Pradesh coast and wind speed was 170-180 kmph gusting up to 195 kmph.
He said the wind speed will come down by 50 per cent in the next six hours. The average sea wave surge was 1.5 meter and will vary from one to two meters in places as the cyclone crosses Vizag.
"The PMO is monitoring the situation arising out of the cyclone on an hourly basis," he said, adding that helicopters will operate for relief and rescue measures in the Andhra coast region only tomorrow morning after slow-down of windspeed.
The heavy rains triggered by the cyclone left two persons dead.
While one person was killed when the compound wall of a building collapsed in Visakhaptnam district, another person died in Srikakulam district when a tree collapsed following pounding rains, according to Andhra Pradesh disaster management department.
"Except East Godavari, power entirely failed in the three districts of Visakhapatnam, Vizianagaram and Srikakulam. There were gale winds. The situation is very severe. National Highway in the region has been shut," Special Commissioner, State Disaster Management Authority, K Hymavathi said.
The authorities have evacuated 90,013 people across the four districts of Srikakulam, Vizianagaram, Visakhaptnam and East Godavari.
Andhra Pradesh government has identified 356 villages in 59 mandals of the four districts as cyclone-prone. More than 300 relief camps have been opened.
Army columns are positioned at Visakhapatnam and Srikakulam with power boats and other equipment for rescue and relief. Six helicopters have been positioned in the Naval base at Visakhapatnam.
The Indian Air Force has tasked Headquarters Training Command, Bangalore to be the nodal agency for all relief operations in connection with severe cyclone Hudhud.
  Telecom network also failed following which a control room in Visakhapatnam failed to operate, officials said.
In neighbouring Odisha, heavy rains coupled with high-speed wind lashed several parts of south Odisha where over 45,000 people have been evacuated from vulnerable areas to safety.
An estimated 45,000 people have so far been evacuated in eight districts of Malkangiri, Koraput, Rayagada, Nabarangpur, Ganjam, Gajapati, Kandhamal and Kalahandi to ensure zero casualty, Special Relief Commissioner (SRC) P K Mohapatra said.
Under the influence of the cyclone, heavy rains pounded many parts of Malkangiri, Ganjam, Khurda, Gajapati, Puri and Rayagada districts, while strong surface wind swept several areas.
The state capital of Bhubaneswar also experienced rains since last night and the intensity of rain and wind flow is gradually gaining pace as Hudhud roared towards the coast.
To deal with the calamity, as many 26 teams - 16 of NDRF and 10 teams of ODRF - have already been deployed in vulnerable places for rescue work, according to Chief Secretary G C Pati. Each team comprises 40 personnel.
"We have been assured by the Centre that army teams will be ready at Raipur in Chhattisgarh and 5 choppers at Kalaikunda in West Bengal for our call," he said.
As a precautionary measure, East Coast Railways cancelled train services on Bhubaneswar-Visakhapatanam route, while the state government has stopped bus service in five districts like Ganjam, Gajapati, Rayagada, Nabarangpur and parts of Kalahandi. The private bus operators have also been asked not to operate service tomorrow.
"We have appealed to the public in the eight districts not to venture out of their houses during the landfall of the cyclone and six hours after that," Mohapatra said, adding BSNL had been requested to send SMS to its users urging them not to venture out.
According to the latest IMD bulletin, rain and thundershowers would occur at most places in the state during the next 48 hours.
Similarly, heavy to very heavy rainfall in some places with extremely heavy rainfall is expected at one or two places in Malkangiri, Koraput, Rayagada, Nawarangpur, Ganjam, Gajpati, Kalahandi and Phulbani of South Odisha in the next 24 hours, said local IMD centre Director Sarat Sahu.
Heavy to very heavy rainfall has been forecast at one or two places in Khurda, Puri, Jagatsinghpur, Nayagarh, Jajpur, Balasore, Bhadrak, Kendrapara, Cuttack, Dhenkanal and Maurbhanj during the same period.

$100-bn bait: Modi tells states to competeComments
Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Thursday foreign investment worth $100 billion is knocking at India’s doors, as top industrialists promised to pour in big bucks in Madhya Pradesh to help boost India’s fastest growing state. Modi was speaking at the Global Investors’ Summit at Indore.
“Investments worth $100 billion from abroad have applied for visa,” he said. “Now it is the turn of the states to capitalise on the opportunity. The roads are wide open.
The states which are ready can walk away with major share.”
Indian industry promised investments worth nearly Rs. 100,000 crore for the state.
The bulk of these investments were pledged by ADAG, Reliance Industries, Adani Group and Suzlon. The four companies have pledged investments of Rs. 85,000 crore in the state over the next 4-5 years. The amount easily overshadow Rs. 11,500 crore pledged for Maharashtra at a similar summit last month, but is no match to the Vibrant Gujarat Summit in 2013, where investments worth Rs. 40 lakh crore were promised.
“So far we have invested Rs. 30,000 crore in the state in four key areas — coal, power, cement and telecom,” said Anil Ambani, chairman, Reliance ADAG. “We are committing ourselves to double our investments in the state to Rs. 60,000 crore by 2020.”
Elder brother Mukesh Ambani, chairman, Reliance Industries, also pledged to double investments. The company would invest nearly Rs. 20,000 crore while Adani Group would also pump in a similar amount in the next five years.
“In 10 months from now, you can look forward to MP being the digital capital. Digitisation is a prerequisite and will also create more jobs,” Mukesh Ambani said.
Suzlon Energy will invest close to Rs. 15,000 crore in the next five years to set up power projects of 2,000 MW. Essar group chief Shashi Ruia said his company has already invested Rs. 9,000 crore, and will put in an additional Rs. 4,000 crore for coal bed methane exploration.
Welspun India also committed an investment of Rs. 5,000 crore in renewable power sector.

Bookies expect a BJP Chief Minister in stateBhupinder Singh Hooda
(Chautala’s Tihar claim…)
HANSI: Both PM Narendra Modi and Haryana CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda may have a reason to thank Om Prakash Chautala . The former Haryana chief has said that he will be the state's next chief minister even if he has to operate from Tihar jail—the boast has boosted the stock of both BJP and Congress, according to the satta bazaar.
This is the analysis of punters in Hansi, infamous as Haryana biggest betting market. Once regarded as a site of archaeological importance, it's now known more for its chopta bazaar, the hub of satta activities.
Chautala's Tihar claim has to be set against his conviction in a teachers' recruitment scam. Unless overturned on appeal, this disqualifies him anyway from political office. Nevertheless, it's apparently had the opposite effect to what was intended.
"The educated class of Haryana, especially non-Jats, have taken against this dream of having an incarcerated CM," said a financier in Hansi.
Hansi's betting public is "fairly confident" that no single party will be able to get a majority, said one of them. They are also not ruling out chances of a hung assembly.
According to them, the BJP may end up with 28 to 32 seats, while the Hooda-led Congress could get close to 25. Chautala's INLD may be hard pressed to get to the 25-seat mark, punters suggested.
The Congress has "improved" in the past few days, said a bettor. While rallies by Modi have had an impact, the "damage" on Congress because of this is not more than "5 to 10%", the person said.
One bettor said the forecasts made by the satta soothsayers were fairly reliable. Unlike other bookies who had predicted a victory for the Haryana Janhit Congress party's Kuldeep Bishnoi over Dushyant Chautala in the Hisar LS byelection, the Hansi satta market had predicted a clear win for the first-timer over Bhajan Lal's son, which is how it played out.
But Bishnoi may have reason to be happier now. According to the Hansi odds, Bishnoi and his wife Renuka Bishnoi will sail through from Adampur and Hansi. But Bishnoi's HJC isn't likely to do too well, with not more than half a dozen seats expected, by the satta baaar.
On the other hand, the contest between Dushyant Chautala and Prem Lata, wife of Chaudhary Birender Singh, for the Uchana constituency is being viewed as a close one. Lata has the potential to create an upset, according to the market.
There's some good news for inde pendent candidates. The expectation is that around eight to 10 independent candidates may emerge victorious in the upcoming multipronged contest.
No candidate is seen as a favourite for the post of CM, but the satta bazaar expects this person to be from the BJP.

Delhi High Court directs Om Prakash Chautala to surrenderDelhi High Court directs ?Om Prakash Chautala to surrender on Saturday

Delhi High Court
(He was granted bail in the…)
NEW DELHI: The Delhi High Court on Friday cancelled the bail of Indian National Lok Dal chief Om Prakash Chautala. It directed Chautala to return to Tihar jail immediately. The move has come as a blow to the former Haryana chief minister who has been the chief campaigner for INLD.
Chautala, who was out on bail in recent months on health grounds was addressing political rallies since late last month in violation of the bail conditions. He was asked to surrender at Tihar jail on Saturday. The high court also directed him to stop addressing political rallies.
The high court order has come as a blow to the INLD which had been gaining political ground in recent days for the October 15 assembly elections in Haryana. The crowds at INLD rallies had started swelling ever since Chautala started addressing them. He addressed dozens of rallies across Haryana in the past fortnight.
The former chief minister is serving a 10-year prison term after his conviction in a teachers' recruitment scam by a CBI court in Delhi in January last year. He was later granted bail by the Delhi High Court after he pleaded that he was undergoing medical treatment at Medanta Hospital in Gurgaon.
The high court order came on a petition filed by an individual who pointed out that Chautala was blatantly violating bail conditions. CBI also pleaded before the court that Chautala's bail be cancelled.
All 90 assembly seats in Haryana go to polls October 15. The results will be known October 19. Haryana witnesses a triangular fight between the ruling Congress, BJP and main opposition INLD.
"I am pained and disappointed with Chautala's act. Now that he is discharged from hospital, he should surrender," the High Court remarked.
During the hearing, Om Prakash Chautala personally urged the judge to let him surrender October 17. But the court decided not to bargain over surrender date, because of Chautala's conduct. The CBI has moved the court charging him with violating the bail conditions.

Robert Vadra deals 10 years of loot: Ashok KhemkaAshok Khemka calls Robert Vadra deals 10 years of loot

Ashok Khemka
CHANDIGARH: Ashok Khemka , who acted as the whistleblower in the Robert Vadra land deal case in Haryana, has said that a clean chit from the Election Commission (EC) stating that there is no poll code violation does not mean no financial wrongdoing has been committed in the transaction involving Congress president Sonia Gandhi's son-in-law.
Talking to ET, the IAS officer said the EC has only maintained that there was no violation of the election code of conduct as the deal was done before September 12 when the code came into force after assembly polls for Haryana were announced.
"Ten years of loot can't be absolved just like that. EC has only said that there was no poll code violation. This is not a clean chit (for Vadra)," Khemka said. The land deal was cleared on July 16. Khemka underlined that corruption was an "intricate issue" and cannot be seen only as somebody giving money "off hand" for a deal and somebody else accepting it. The bureaucrat who has faced more than 44 transfers in his 23 year career, said the EC gave its judgement only on the basis of the facts presented to it by the Bhupinder Singh Hooda government.
Earlier in the day, BJP had wondered if all the facts relating to the case were put by the Congress government in Haryana before the poll panel.
Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has raised questions on the role of the state government in the whole affair. Congress leader Salman Khurshid dismissed this allegation and said this is an attempt to "stonewall" the due process. "EC is nobody to say that there was no wrongdoing in the case," Khemka told ET.
He also accused the media of distorting facts relating to the case and focusing only on whether it was a poll code violation. "This is the height of ridiculousness by the media," the officer said. Meanwhile, INLD has also said the process followed in the land deal is "wrong and illegal".
"This is not an election code violation issue. I don't know how the prime minister went wrong on this. The process followed in the land deal is wrong and illegal" RS Chaudhary, senior leader of INLD told ET.

Lopchu tea: A brand that puts no stock in HarrodsSave precious time tracking your investments
It's a brand of Darjeeling tea that London's Harrods store has wanted to stock but hasn't been able to. Japanese buyers are willing to pay for it to be posted to them. India's leading tea connoisseurs love its aroma and smoky taste. It's even popular with the regulars at AKG Bhavan, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) headquarters in New Delhi.
It's Lopchu, a 90-year-old tea brand that has won a dedicated, global following after enduring tough competition, including products from Tata Global Beverages and Hindustan Unilever .
Suparno Basu, a 33-year-old software engineer from Kolkata, has been drinking Lopchu tea since his college days. "My father has been buying Lopchu tea for years and I have got used to it. I need to drink a cup of Lopchu tea at least once in a day. I cannot go without it."Even so, Basu and others like him who enjoy their cup of Lopchu tea may find it increasingly difficult to buy the beverage. And there doesn't seem much that can be done to increase its availability.
The secret of the success of Lopchu tea may lie in the area where it's grown - an estate situated between Darjeeling and Teesta, at an altitude of 4,800 feet. It's believed that 95% of the tea bushes here were originally transplanted from Yunnan province in China.
The garden has about 226 acres under production and most of the tea is exported to Europe, the US and Japan. People say the word Lopchu has been derived from Lepcha, the inhabitants of the hilly areas of Darjeeling.
Lopchu has managed to make a niche for itself even among Darjeeling teas, which the Tea Board of India says are the "world's most sought-after." The cool and moist climate, the soil, the rainfall and the slopping terrain all combine to give Darjeeling tea its unique "muscatel flavour," according to the Darjeeling district website.
The Lopchu tea estate was under British control till 1954, when it was bought by SN Kanoria and GL Kanoria, cousins who were in the jute trade, a fledgling business in West Bengal at that time.
Subsequently, their sons, P Kanoria and CK Kanoria, started looking after the garden. Now, the third generation of the Kanorias — Rajesh and Sandip — are supporting the family business.
"The cool environs of Lopchu tea give it a delicate 'muscatel' flavour and a soothing, smoky taste," says Rajesh Kanoria, a software engineer from the Indian Institute of Technology in Kharagpur. "And our unique business model is that we are 100% packet tea and we try to maintain a unique blend for our teas." Lopchu tea is well known among the elite circles in Delhi. Retail outlets in the Capital see demand for Lopchu tea throughout the year.
The retail price of Lopchu tea ranges from Rs 300 a kg to Rs 1,400 a kg, depending on the variety. Lopchu tea is available in grades including flowery orange pekoe and golden orange pekoe and as black tea bags.
"Demand is huge for this tea from the upper class and upper middle class of society. But there is always a supply shortage," says Abhijeet Mazumdar, owner of Camellia Twigs, a retail outlet in Delhi's Indraprastha Extension. The Kanorias are aware of the shortage, but there's little that they can do.
Rajesh's father, 72-year-old Purushottam Kanoria, says that at best, the Lopchu tea garden can produce 100,000 kg of tea annually. Comparatively, India's tea production in 2013 was 1,200 million kgs.
"Generally, it varies between 80,000 kg and 90,000 kg. Even though there is huge demand for our tea, we sometimes fail to maintain a constant supply line. And moreover, this year has been particularly bad for Darjeeling planters as delayed rains have affected production," says the senior Kanoria.
The Kanorias don't have any immediate plan to come up with any new marketing initiative for promoting Lopchu tea. Rajesh, who juggles between his software and tea businesses, says Lopchu has a dedicated clientele and therefore there is no need to think about a fresh marketing strategy.
"We have our dealer and distributor networks and we continue to sell our teas through them only. We try to maintain a unique quality for all our grades," says Rajesh. SS Bagaria, chairman of the Darjeeling Tea Association, says that those who have developed a palette for Lopchu would like to adhere to the brand as it has a distinctive taste. This loyalty extends to overseas customers.
"There are buyers from Japan who pay more for the postage to procure a kilo of Lopchu," says Purushottam Kanoria. "Harrods had approached us many times to procure our tea but they had told us they would sell the tea under their own brand name. We had never compromised on our brand name and we had refused to sell our teas to Harrods." The Kanorias don't have any immediate plans to expand their presence in the Darjeeling tea industry, either.
"We may not get the same quality tea as Lopchu. And moreover, there is no garden on the block right now. The cost of production has also gone up and so we do not feel that it will be a profitable proposition to acquire gardens now," says Purushottam Kanoria.

Who would have thought that men would lean towards Chanderi fabric? The Baroda royal family would have us believe so. Rajmata Shubhangini Raje Gaekwad says that the pagdi, angrakha and the dupatta, which the men in the royal family carried along with the sword, were all made of Chanderi.
The Rajamata along with the current queen of Baroda, Radhika Raje Gaekwad, were in Mumbai as part of Taj Khazana to revive Chanderi sarees. In fact, she got the inspiration for the current collection from Raja Ravi Varma's painting. Apparently, Mahraja Sayyaji Rao II of the Baroda royal family had invited the royal artist from Kerala to paint portraits of his family.
"Raja Ravi Varma's paintings captured the texture of Chanderi worn by the men and women of the royal family beautifully," says the Rajmata. So next time, pick Chanderi for your wedding pagdi — it's got a royal salute.

While the cubicle is today seen as a symbol of the drudgery of office work, the design was originally meant to give workers freedom when it was first introduced in 1968. In his book Cubed: A Secret History of the Workplace, author Nikil Saval writes that what we today call the cubicle was actually first marketed as 'The Action Office II,' the second attempt of designer Robert Propst to create a workstation that gave people individual autonomy.
Saval writes that the design, produced by the office furniture company Herman Miller, was met with public acclaim. But as companies began to copy the design, their versions increasingly were marketed as the small, closed boxes modern workers are familiar with.
Later, Propst told The New York Times that he had designed the Action Office II to "give knowledge workers a more flexible, fluid environment than the ratmaze boxes of offices". All Propst had left was this final denouncement of what his creation had become: "The cubicle-ising of people in modern corporations is monolithic insanity".

Everything you need to know about Parent PLUSSEND
EMAIL
No parent wants to see a child take on crushing debt, especially when it comes to college.
When all other financial aid options have been explored, you may decide to take out your own federal Direct PLUS loan to help pay for a college education.
But PLUS loans have come under fire in recent years.
Critics decry the ease with which parents obtain big loans that have high interest rates, no annual borrowing limits and fewer protections than federal loans for students have. Before you sign the dotted line on your own PLUS loan, here’s everything you need to know.
Covering the gap
Direct Parent Loans for Undergraduate Students (PLUS), often referred to as Parent PLUS Loans, help families pay for college costs that are not covered by other financial aid, such as loans, scholarships or grants. To acquire a PLUS loan, you must fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) . The amount you qualify for will be included in the student’s financial aid award letter.
But this particular loan is different from any other federal student loan.
Repayment of the PLUS loan falls on the shoulders of parents; it can never be transferred to the student, even after graduation. Parents are required to sign a Master Promissory Note when agreeing to the terms of the loan, which means they are solely responsible for the loan and are not acting as cosigners.
The maximum amount parents can borrow is the total cost of college — tuition, books, housing and so on—minus any other financial assistance the student has been awarded. In other words, all the costs that are left over once you’ve exhausted other types of aid.
No annual limit
Unlike with most other federal loans , there’s no annual limit to how much you can borrow on a PLUS loan. Because of this, parents who take out large amounts may face debt well into their retirement years.
While other federal loans do not require a credit check, PLUS loans do. Parents who have credit problems may have to use an endorser, or document extenuating circumstances with the U.S. Department of Education.
On the other hand, while proof of income is required for a private loan, such proof isn’t necessary to receive a PLUS loan. Critics say this means parents can be saddled more easily with big debts they won’t be able to repay later.
PLUS loans also differ from other loans in terms of repayment.
With most student loans, repayment begins six months after the student leaves school. With a PLUS loan, parents must begin making monthly payments 60 days after the loan is disbursed. The standard repayment plan is for 10 years, but plans may be changed at any time and possibly extended up to 25 years.
Extending the loan means parents pay less each month, but will owe more interest overall.
Parents who fail to repay the loan will default and be subject to a host of consequences. The full balance of the loan will become due immediately and parents will be disqualified from deferment, which allows you to stop making payments on your loan temporarily.
In addition, the defaulting parent will be reported to credit bureaus and will lose eligibility for future federal student aid and assistance. Those who default may also be sued by the government, in which case all or part of their federal and state tax refunds or other federal state payments could be taken and wages may be garnished.
The fine print
It’s worth noting that the fixed interest rate on PLUS loans is currently 7.21%, higher than on any other type of federal loan. For example, Perkins loans carry a 5% interest rate, and other direct loans are at 4.66%. There is also a loan origination fee on all Direct PLUS loans, which is determined by the timing of the loan disbursement.
For loans disbursed on or after Dec. 1, 2013, and before Oct. 1, 2014, the loan fee is 4.288% of the principal amount of the annual loan. For loans disbursed on or after Oct. 1, 2014, the loan fee is 4.292% of the principal loan amount.
If you need to take out a loan for your son or daughter and don’t want to pursue private loans , be sure to take out only as much as your student will need each year.
If you find you no longer need the money you borrowed, you’ll have the chance to cancel all or part of the disbursement when each one is released, usually twice a year.
Paying for higher education is no picnic, especially for parents. While PLUS loans may seem the obvious choice to help lighten your child’s debt load, be careful not to borrow too much yourself.
Otherwise you’ll find yourself paying the bill long after the hoopla of graduation has ended.

Rangeela was my turning point: Manish MalhotraCall him a Bollywood stylist.
Call him a bridal designer.
Call him a fashion maverick these days.
Call him what you will.
Manish Malhotra will always be just
Manish Malhotra. No more. No less
Four days before Lakmé Fashion Week’s Autumn/ Winter 2014 finale, the 8th floor of a mid-town Mumbai five-star hotel is chaotic. Designer and Bollywood stylist Manish Malhotra is trying to decide which model will look best in what bridal avatar at the finale. "Who has a flat stomach here?” he asks. “You? Come try the sari.” He pauses, looking slightly worried, lines forming on his forehead. “Maybe we can try this lehenga on Carol or Sandhya?”
A good fit: At the fittings for his show, Manish may be all business, but he always finds a moment to laugh
Suddenly, he smiles, looking at a male model. “Maybe you can trim that beard a bit? You can’t look like a terrorist!” And then he looks at another model. “You need coffee,” he says.
There are a few laughs and he’s back to work. “I should change something. Something doesn’t look right,” he muses. And then he asks a bystander, “How’s it looking?” She is flustered. “Lovely!” she manages to say, caught by surprise. He gives her a smile and an ‘I-hope-it-all-turns-out-good’ look. Then it’s back to the edit.
Purnima Lamba, head of innovations at Lakmé, says that while discussing the theme of the finale with Malhotra (which was bridal), the first thing she told him was: ‘Tell me what you are known for, and let’s not do that.’ “And Manish was super excited. He’s an incredible collaborator,” she says.
That could be Malhotra’s mantra these days as he reinvents himself as a designer – letting his designs reflect his maturity and his growth, even as they still retain that ‘Manish Malhotra’ charm. The result was this – there was no gold at the finale, and that could be a first for Malhotra, who is known for his metallic embroidery and chiffons. Instead, we saw palettes of grey and purple, lots of mirror work, OTT headgear and embroidered capes.
“This was a very controlled collection,” observes Anaita Shroff Adajania, the show’s stylist and Malhotra’s old friend. “Most designers are shy to learn, but not Manish; he is like a sponge, he just wants to absorb. When he first started out, he was more about outfits. Now he’s more cohesive and thinks of the outfit as part of a collection. He still loves what he stands for, but wants to grow.”
Rags to Rangeela
It’s taken Malhotra a long time to reach this space; a space where he is known not only as the ultimate Bollywood designer but as a fashion maverick as well. What’s common to both tags is his mass appeal, whether it’s inspiring millions to wear hot pants and knotted tops like Urmila Matondkar did in Rangeela (1995), or making sure every other bride wants (or at least tells their tailor to copy) a Manish Malhotra ensemble for their wedding, like their favourite star, Kareena Kapoor Khan.
Born into a typical Punjabi family in Mumbai, Malhotra is the son of an air-conditioning business owner. But even as a child, he was only interested in movies – the songs, the colours, the costumes and the actresses (Sridevi was his favourite). As he had a knack for sketching, in his 6th standard, he joined a painting class. “I was good in science only because my diagrams were good,” he laughs. “Mathematics was terrible.”
But the Bandra boy wanted to move out of his suburb and went to Elphinstone College to study. That’s where he got hooked to English movies in addition to Bollywood. To supplement his pocket money, he conducted surveys for market research agencies, and modelled for ads such as Gold Spot and Close-Up.
But he wanted to see the world. “I saved Rs. 90,000 and went to Bangkok and Singapore. That quest to see the world and explore was always there,” he says.
Though he loved cinema, Malhotra didn’t know many film people (though his cousin Lali was married to David Dhawan), and spent a lot of time wondering how to break in. On his return from Bangkok, he joined a boutique called Equinox, where he spent his time sketching and draping the mannequins.
Then one day in 1987, he decided to hire two tailors and just started taking orders. “Obviously, I wasn’t going to join the family business,” he says. “My parents didn’t understand this, but came around eventually.”
It was at this time that Ensemble opened in Mumbai, which was one of the first multi-brand stores that gave Indian designers a platform for showcasing their designs. It could have been a game-changer for Malhotra but as he says, he didn’t have money to even think of making a collection.
“I didn’t have the money to go abroad, I was late with my NIFT (National Institute of Fashion Technology) application, and didn’t have the money for a collection,” Malhotra says. “So I decided, why not movies? To me, the costumes were looking really bad.”
It wasn’t a smooth start for him. David Dhawan offered him a chance to style Divya Bharti for a song in 1989. “I remember the look I gave her (I shopped at the Taj) – it was a black brocade skirt and a gold top. But the movie was shelved,” he says. He then designed clothes for Juhi Chawla for a song in Swarg (1990), but his big break came when celebrity photographer Rakesh Shrestha introduced him to Sridevi, and convinced her to use him as a stylist for a photo shoot.
Malhotra’s foot was in the door. In the next one year, he was working with Sunny Deol, Chunky Pandey and Sridevi. The first movie they did was Gumrah in 1993, and her fitted, embroidered waistcoat with black denims in the song Tere Pyaar Ko Salaam was a fresh look at a time when heroines were swathed in ruffles, satin and dowdy layers.
He doesn’t remember, though, where his design aesthetic came from. “It was all my imagination,” he says. “I had never even studied design. Movies were hard. In those days, cheques bounced all the time. And there were all these female designers, with books of work, and I was the young boy who sketched. I won over the actors quickly, but monetary validation was hard to come about.”
Then Kajol danced in the rain in her white mini skirt in Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (1995) and people began to notice Malhotra. And finally, the turning point in his career arrived with that seminal movie, Rangeela (1995), which changed the way we looked at the curvy Indian heroine forever.
A stitch in time
We’re chatting over lunch at the Lakmé Fashion Week Winter/Festive 2014 fittings, where Malhotra confesses he loves food like any other Punjabi. “The other day Kangana [Ranaut] was over for lunch and she said, ‘Do you eat like this every day?’ And I was like, yes, I am Punjabi.”
He pauses for a brief conversation with model Deepti Gujral. “I want to look like you. You know someone told me that day, ‘Weight toh chala jayega, but face kaun badlega?’” he tells her. It’s obvious he’s got a knack for making people laugh.
Then we go back to Rangeela. “No one can take that away from me,” he says. “Rangeela changed the way the film industry saw costume design – Filmfare instituted the Award for Costume Design for the first time ever, which I won. I did that. It was my turning point. For a guy who had never travelled, I was in and out of Switzerland and London.”
It was during Rangeela that he realised that Bollywood was not such a bad place after all. “I met film director, Ram Gopal Varma, who narrated the whole movie [Rangeela] to me. I was so happy.”
Other instances that restored his faith in the industry were a visit to Yash Chopra’s house for Aaina (1993), where Pamela Chopra won him over with her class. “She was just so elegant”, he recalls. And the time when Yash Johar called him for a project and asked whether he could send over an advance of Rs. 10,000, a rare thing in a world of delayed payments.
Rangeela arguably has been one of the sexiest movies ever. How can anyone forget Urmila dancing on Versova beach in skin-tight red leggings and a tank top?
“I introduced the word styling, without even knowing what that meant,” says Malhotra. “I took the first step. As long as I live, it will always be that – Manish Malhotra came and changed the way movies looked.” He also did the seemingly impossible – made an actress look sexy without looking vulgar. It’s no wonder then his star shone brighter post Rangeela.
Karisma and Kareena Kapoor are die-hard followers, so are Kajol, Priyanka Chopra and most recently, Alia Bhatt, who in her movie Humpty Sharma ki Dulhaniya says, “Mai shaadi karungi toh Kareena wala designer lehenga pehenke karungi”, and also walked the ramp for Malhotra in his lehenga. Like Alia, there are brides all over the country who die for the Manish chiffon sari or embroidered lehenga.
Fashion forward
But in the last three years, Malhotra’s work has been more about mainstream fashion than Bollywood or bridal. For Manish, it was just a natural progression. Other than the finale which, with its greys and deep reds, was quieter in appeal, his opening collection for Lakmé Fashion Week Winter/Festive 2013 last September was surprising, with its cool sharara pants, Rajasthani koti tops and custom zari work.
“Today I am enjoying this phase; the business of fashion interests me,” says Malhotra. “People wait for my collections. I launch them in my store the same day I launch them on the ramp. That’s the belief the client has in me.”

So how come women so far apart in aesthetics, as Kareena Kapoor Khan and an aunty in Kanpur, both lust for that Manish sari?
“I think I am interested in people. I may not be eclectic, but I have a connect with the audience that makes me popular,” says Malhotra. “That’s because I am still part of an audience myself. I have a sense of what works and what doesn’t. I go to the theatre wide-eyed. I have never been the one who knows it all. I am in touch with reality.”
It’s not always been about the accolades, though. Many critics over the years have spoken about Malhotra’s “repetition” and tsk-tsked over his “bridal designer” tag. But he seems equally dismissive about the analysis.
“For me, it’s never been about that critic who said, ‘Oh, it’s not out of the box’. I didn’t promise that. I promised to do what I do best,” he says. “My true calling is Indian wear. When people think of a sangeet, reception or shaadi, they think of me. I want clothes that make sense.”
Today he employs 300 embroiderers in-house, 160 workers in Kashmir and 140 workers in Mijwan (Uttar Pradesh). “That’s not mass – my embroidery takes three months to do,” Malhotra says. “It’s a lot of investment. How is that mass? But the connect is mass. I know my buyer. She is a young girl who wants to look glamorous, whether she is fat, dark, fair or short. She wants to be herself.”
His success relies on his instincts as much as his tireless disposition. Everyone tells us that no one works harder than Malhotra. “He is so disciplined and a multi-tasker,” says choreographer Lubna Adams. Make-up artist Cory Walia can’t stop praising Malhotra. “No one has a stronger work ethic. He also knows what he is capable of and doesn’t try and be somebody else.” And he manages to be fun nonetheless. “He might be going crazy at work, but he is still so affable,” says Walia.
Films frills
Actor Imran Khan backs Malhotra’s belief that he knows what works. “During I Hate Luv Storys (2010), I second guessed many of his choices for me,” he says. “But when I saw them on screen, I was like ‘damn, this is what he meant’. He knows what colour, texture and fabric will look good on screen.”
And as Kareena, who met him first when she was nine years old while visiting her sister Karisma on the sets of Deedar (1992), says, “In the fashion world, where everyone is trying to be someone, Manish Malhotra is just himself – unapologetically glamorous and sparkly. What he has done for Indian fashion is that he’s made it reach out to every Indian.”
Hundreds of girls would have rushed to their tailor and ordered the Madhuri Dixit -style sheer kurtas after Dil Toh Pagal Hai (1997); or the red bell bottoms Kareena Kapoor wore in Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham (2001); and more recently, college girls went back to the ethnic chic look he created for Alia Bhatt in 2 States (2014).
Whether it’s his styling expertise, his trademark chiffon saris, gold embroidery lehengas or his new avatar as the sophisticated clothes-maker for the modern Indian bride, his greatest strength lies in staying true to his own style.
“I read this quote by Tom Ford that I identify with,” says Malhotra. “He said something to the effect that he doesn’t presume he is a big artist, he just gets up and does what he loves and if people like that, he is satisfied. I am the same. I will never change as a person, I will just evolve. When newcomers like Alia Bhatt and Varun Dhawan say that if they walk the ramp for Manish, it’s a sign they have made it, that’s a sign of respect you can’t beat.”
Critics be damned. Manish Malhotra has had the last word.

Countdown for IRNSS 1C launch from October 13Countdown for IRNSS 1C launch from October 13
By PTI | 12 Oct, 2014, 11.34AM IST
The first two satellites in the series, IRNSS 1A and IRNSS 1B were launched from Sriharikota on July 1, 2013 and April 4 this year respectively.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
CHENNAI: The countdown for the launch of India's navigation satellite IRNSS 1C, the third of seven satellites in the series to put in place India's navigation system on par with US' Global Positioning System, on board PSLV C 26 will commence at the spaceport of Sriharikota tomorrow.
The earlier planned launch on October six was postponed following a technical problem.
"The 67-hour countdown for the mission will commence at 0632 hrs IST on October 13," ISRO said.
IRNSS 1C with a lift-off mass of 1,425.4 kg would be launched on the 28th flight of India's PSLV-C26 from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre at Sriharikota, some 100 km from here. Like the launch of similar missions of IRNSS 1A and IRNSS 1B earlier, this mission would be launched on the XL version of the PSLV.
As part of its aspirations to build a regional navigational system equivalent to Global Positioning System of the US, ISRO plans to send seven satellites to put in place the Indian Regional Navigational Satellite System (IRNSS).
The first two satellites in the series, IRNSS 1A and IRNSS 1B were launched from Sriharikota on July 1, 2013 and April 4 this year respectively.
ISRO needs to launch at least four of the seven satellites to start operations of IRNSS, ISRO officials said.
IRNSS is similar to US' Global Positioning System, Russia's Glonass and Europe's Galileo. China and Japan also have similar systems, 'Beidou' and 'Quasi Zenith.'

AGMs cannot be chai-samosa parties: SEBI Chairmanquarterly or semiannual financial statement
Stressing on a need for better governance practices at listed companies, SEBIi Chairman U K Sinha on Friday said things are changing for good and shareholder meetings should not be like a “chai and samosa party“.
Mr. Sinha gave credit for this change to growing activism of institutional investors, stronger regulations and an improved surveillance mechanism at SEBI, while asking independent directors to act like “an extended arm of the regulator” when companies discuss business matters in their board meetings.
The SEBI chief also asserted that the onus needs to be put more on the promoters or the top executives, rather than the companies as a whole, when it comes to penalties.
Speaking at a session on ‘Improving Board Effectiveness’ during a KPMG event, Mr. Sinha said that positive changes are also been seen at board meetings where compensation proposals for top executives are being rejected almost on a regular basis - a trend which was “unheard of” till about 4-5 years ago.
He also rejected the criticism that regulators were becoming activists and praised the institutional investors for adopting an effective activism to put shareholder proposals for proper discussions.
“There is a feeling that regulators are becoming activists. In fact one particular corporate leader made a remark that SEBI is becoming a dragon and may be we will have to move to other parts of the world to do business,” he said.
About positive changes taking place, Mr. Sinha said: “In boards after boards, compensation proposals are getting rejected. Five years ago, I think it was unheard of.
“Many people even didn’t go to attend board meetings and it was granted that it (their renominations) was going to happen. In fact, the general meetings of corporates of India were mainly a ‘chai and samosa’ party,” he added.
“There is an alliance now of institutional investors and activists. Previously this alliance did not exist and because of that even if there were some murmurs... It was not proven to be effective. Now, in countries after countries this alliance is proving its worth and they are proving they can be effective,” Mr. Sinha said.
The SEBI chief also said that the regulations are getting amended across many countries and the rules were being tightened to remove the loopholes and to empower regulators.
“More and more resources are placed before the regulators. Between 2006 and 2013, the US market regulator SEC has increased its expenditure by 62 per cent and employee strength by 22 per cent. For the FCA in the UK, the numbers are 48 per cent and 15 per cent. Similarly it is happening in many other countries,” Mr. Sinha said.
He added: “In India, for example, in 2006 we had only 440 employees and today we have 760 employees... We are now recruiting chartered accountants from the campuses, we are recruiting statisticians, system analysts and IT professionals.
“I would like to tell you that not only in India but also in other parts of the world, huge amount of money is being invested by the regulators on surveillance mechanism. Here in India, in SEBI, we have the surveillance system which I would like to believe is one of the best in the world. Everyday we get almost 100 alerts.”

Experience prevailed over youth as Vishnu Vardhan and Prerna Bhambri were crowned hard court champions in the Fenesta National tennis championship here on Saturday.
While Vishnu Vardhan beat talented Sidharth Rawat 6-2, 4-6, 6-3 for his maiden national hard court title in three attempts, Prerna completed a hat-trick of titles, defeating 16-year-old Karman Kaur Thandi 4-6, 6-4, 6-3.
Karman, though, had the consolation of winning the under-18 singles title beating Simran Kaur Sethi in a three-set slugfest in the evening, which nicely added to the women’s doubles title she won on Friday with Sai Samhitha. For Vishnu Vardhan, who had lost to Yuki Bhambri in 2011, it was a relief. After winning the first set, he almost derailed his campaign in the second. Relying on his powerful serves, Vishnu Vardhan outplayed Rawat with a flurry of aces to rattle the youngster. Rawat, who came into the match with the reputation of a giant-killer, looked nervous and barely able to play the ball.
But, Rawat slowly clawed his way back into the match, breaking Vishnu Vardhan in the fifth game of the second set to begin the turnaround. Vishnu Vardhan’s serves appeared to lose potency as Rawat grew in confidence, managing to return everything the senior pro threw at him. He broke Vishnu Vardhan again in the ninth game and then held his own to take the match into the decider.
Rawat almost caused his third major upset of the tournament before an umpire’s decision to replay a point in the seventh game of the decider broke his momentum. He could not recover as Vishnu Vardhan managed to hang on for victory. His impressive run in the tournament, however, helped Rawat secure a wild card for the upcoming ATP Challenger at Indore.
Prerna too had a tough outing against Karman. The six-foot tall teenager took advantage of her height, winning the first set with an impressive forehand. Prerna committed several errors as she failed to react in time to Karman’s quick returns. The defending champion, though, fought her way back to win the second and brought her experience into play to win the decider. Karman, though, returned to win the under-18 title later in the day, defeating Simran 6-4, 3-6, 7-6(5). Karman won the first set but almost lost her way in the middle. Trailing 0-3 in the second, Simran reeled off seven straight games to take the set and a 1-0 lead in the third. The set went into the tie-breaker and Karman dug deep into her reserves as Simran, finalist last year as well, faltered.
In the boys’ final, Vidit Vaghela managed to get past Dalwinder Singh 6-4, 2-6, 6-4.
The men’s and women’s singles winners received Rs. 3 lakh each and a wild card for the Delhi Open Challenger next year while the runners-up got Rs. 2 lakh each and a wild card to the qualifiers of the same tournament.
The results (finals): Men: Vishnu Vardhan bt Sidharth Rawat 6-2, 4-6, 6-3. Women: Prerna Bhambri bt Karman Kaur Thandi 4-6, 6-4, 6-3. Under-18: Boys: Vidit Vaghela bt Dalwinder Singh 6-4, 2-6, 6-4. Girls: Karman Kaur Thandi bt Simran Kaur Sethi 6-4, 3-6, 7-6(5).

To meet Simon in the title clash after the Frenchman beat Lopez
Roger Federer brought World No. 1 Novak Djokovic’s juggernaut to a halt when a 6-4, 6-4 victory in the Shanghai Masters on Saturday set up a final against unseeded Frenchman Gilles Simon.
The 33-year-old Swiss was in aggressive mood against his younger opponent, who was on a 28-match winning streak in China, and converted his third match point with a backhand volley to end a semifinal slugfest that lasted one hour 35 minutes.
Federer, who will return to second in the rankings on Monday, broke serve in the fifth game of the first set after a couple of unforced errors from the twice Shanghai Masters champion.
The 17-time Grand Slam winner broke again in the opening game of the second set and went on to exact sweet revenge for his defeat in their last meeting, at the Wimbledon final in July.
Earlier, Simon moved into his first Masters Series final in six years after outclassing big-serving Spaniard Feliciano Lopez.
The World No. 29 faced little pressure on his serve and dominated the match from the baseline with some sumptuous groundstrokes to beat the 33-year-old Lopez 6-2 7-6 (1).
Lopez, who knocked out World No. 2 Rafa Nadal in the second round, netted a backhand volley to hand Simon the first break of the match in the third game and the tall Spaniard only had himself to blame as a double fault gifted a second break. The frazzled World No. 21, under pressure from Simon’s winners, finally held to make it 5-2 but the Frenchman wrapped up the set in 25 minutes with an ace down the middle that swerved teasingly away from the left hander.
Lopez mixed up his tactics in the second set, opting to attack the net more to hustle his opponent, whose only previous Masters Series final appearance came in 2008 in Madrid, with some success.
The Spaniard came through seven deuces in the third game to avoid another break while Simon only dropped four points on his serve in the set.
The pressure finally told on Lopez in the tiebreak as he crumbled under a mix of double faults, netted returns and wild smashes to lose it 7-1. — Reuters

The scheme encourages MPs from both Houses to identify and develop one village from their constituencies
Taking forward his announcement during his address to the nation on August 15, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday unveiled a blueprint for the Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana (SAGY) on Jayaprakash Narayan’s birth anniversary.
The scheme encourages Members of Parliament from both Houses to identify and develop one village from their constituency as a model village by 2016, and two more by 2019, covering over 2,500 villages of the 6 lakh villages country-wide.
“This is not a rupiya-paisa yojana but a demand-driven, people’s participatory scheme. There are 800 parliamentarians and in three years, 2,500-odd villages could get covered. If States were to initiate their own similar schemes with MLAs, 6,000 to 7,000 villages could get covered. One good village can affect an entire area, and a viral effect could begin,” Mr. Modi said while unveiling SAGY for which no new funds have been allocated.
MPLAD funds to benefit model villages
The 65-page outline for the Sansad Adarsh Gram Yojana, released by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday here, in the presence of Rural Development Minister Nitin Gadkari, requires MPs to identify one village with a population of 3,000-5,000 in the plains and 1,000-3,000 in the hills within a month for convergence of existing schemes for socio-economic development of the area.
MPs can choose any village except their own or their spouse’s. There is no other criterion.
MPs are expected to facilitate a village development plan, motivate villagers to take up activities and use the Rs.5-crore MPLAD fund to fill gaps for funds besides mobilising “additional resources especially from Corporate Social Responsibility” in sewage and water supply schemes.
The activities and outcomes will cover broad development indicators such as health, nutrition and education through organising immunization drives, improving mid-day meal schemes, improving Aadhaar enrolment, setting up “smart schools” with IT-enabled classrooms and e-libraries, improving panchayat infrastructure under schemes such as MNREGA and Backward Regions Grants Fund.
A series of measures speak of better implementation of existing and new schemes and laws including RTI Act, National Food Security Act, National Rural Livelihood Mission, Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, while at the same time emphasising “activities to improve hygienic behaviour” by encouraging bathing among villagers, use of toilets and exercising for thirty minutes every day. It envisions social development in villages through identifying a village day, a village song, and focusing on alternative methods of dispute resolution.
There will be real-time web-based monitoring and a first review after five months by an independent agency. District Collectors will carry out a baseline surveys and then chair monthly review meetings to monitor progress. At the State-level, Chief Secretaries will lead an empowered committee on the same and the Minister for Rural Development and Secretary, Rural Development, will chair two national-level committees to track the scheme.
“This is not a small risk that I have taken by suggesting this. Instead of maximising the use of MPLAD funds over the largest possible area, this will instead require focusing the funds in a village. MPs will be able to identify the shortcomings in implementation of schemes,” said Mr. Modi.
Speaking at the event, Mr. Gadkari said: “SAGY aims at socio-economic transformation, not just making government funds and facilities available to villages. This will be a movement from swaraj to suraaj.” The aim would be to inculcate a sense of pride, volunteerism, and self-reliance in villages, he added.

India can be a tough market for Google s AndroidOne: IDCIndia can be a tough market for Google's AndroidOne: IDC
Press Trust of India | New Delhi Oct 12, 2014 11:16 AM IST
Google's ambitious move to address the fragmented Android ecosystem with its AnrdoidOne devices will help in redefining the affordable smartphone segment, but the Indian market will be a tough call for the US-based tech giant, feels research firm IDC.
Last month, Google launched AndroidOne range of devices in partnership with Indian handset makers Micromax, Karbonn and Spice and mobile operators like Airtel and Reliance. The smartphones are priced Rs 6,399 onwards.
"Despite significant marketing spend already in evidence on AndroidOne, IDC believes India will be a tough crucible for Google. Blocked out of China, Google has no choice but to make a large downstream investment in the Next Billion consumer segment in India," the research firm said.
India is the first country where the California-based firm's Android One devices have been launched. Roll out across other markets like Indonesia, Philippines, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka will follow in coming months.
Success in this segment will greatly enhance their ability to leverage Android to drive adoption by the Next Billion of the Google consumer cloud, it added.
"IDC believes that AndroidOne is crucial for Google to execute on its strategy to leverage the fast-growing Android user base to drive engagement for its increasing portfolio of essential Google services, including search, Maps, Google Now and others," it said.
A consistent user experience, or at least a vastly improved one, will greatly increase engagement and ultimately revenues, IDC added.
The research firm said it expects AndroidOne will attract significant sales and redefine the affordable smartphone segment by reshaping the mid tier with a range of devices that feature good enough device specifications for a fraction of the price compared to flagship devices.
It added that AndroidOne will go further and effectively create a bipolar pear shaped environment where the high end will be dominated by the likes of Apple and Samsung with their iPhone and Galaxy flagship devices and the low end will increasingly converge around USD 100 Average Selling Price (ASP) benchmark.

Work out a plan to deal with supply: PMO to ...Anil Ambani
("It is essential to ensure…)
NEW DELHI: The PMO has asked the Coal Ministry to work out a plan of action to deal with the present situation -- arising out of the Supreme Court's cancelling the allocation of 214 coal blocks -- in consultation with infrastructure ministries so that end-use plants are not stranded in the absence of fuel.
"It is essential to ensure the end use plants in the infrastructure sector are not stranded for want of coal supply. Hence the ministry must have worked out a plan of action to deal with the present situation in consultation with the infrastructure ministries," the Prime Minister Office said in a recent letter to Coal Secretary S K Srivatava.
It further said that "the same may be shared with this office".
Nripendra Misra , Principal Secretary to Prime Minister Narendra Modi , had written earlier to the Coal Ministry regarding the contingency plan to deal with the implications of the Supreme Court's judgement on coal block allocation.
In a major blow to the corporate sector, the Supreme Court had last month quashed allocation of 214 out of 218 coal blocks alloted to various companies since 1993 terming it as "fatally flawed" and allowed the Centre to take over operation of 42 such blocks which are functional.
It said the beneficiaries of the illegal process "must suffer" the consequences and refused to show sympathy to private companies which submitted that Rs 2.87 lakh crores have been invested in 157 coal blocks and Rs 4 lakh crores in end-use plants.
It, however, saved from the "guillotine" four allocations -- one each to SAIL and NTPC and two blocks to Sasan Power Ltd owned by Anil Ambani's Reliance Power -- and also gave a six months breathing time to rest of them to wind up their operations by March 31, 2015.
The apex court directed the the allottees of coal blocks to pay within three months an additional levy of Rs 295 per metric ton of coal extracted to compensate financial loss caused to the exchequer by the illegal and arbitrary allotments.

(With Air India grappling…)
NEW DELHI: With Air India grappling with financial crisis, the Supreme Court has rapped the government for giving "profitable routes" to private carriers and asked it to plan a turnaround in the national carrier saying it "faces extinction" if things continued like this.
"Why many lucrative routes have been given to private carriers," a bench comprising justices Vikramjit Sen and Kurian Joseph observed while expressing concern over Air India taking a beating against private airways, post merger of Air India and Indian Airlines.
The bench, which wanted the Civil Aviation Ministry to think over the various issues plaguing the national carrier, also said other area of concern was the priority given to private airlines with Air India aircraft being asked to hover around during the peak landing hours causing huge loss of money on fuel.
"A situation has reached where after travelling in private airlines, when one boards Air India, he thinks why have I taken this flight. The situation is really, really bad, we are sorry to say. The financial loss is already being talked about since long, passenger dissatisfaction is a known fact too.
"Strangely, Air India is focusing on money-losing routes while many profitable routes have been given to the private airlines. Please think of how a turnaround can be brought about," the bench said, adding, "if things continue like this the airline faces extinction."
The remarks were made during the hearing of the cross-appeals filed by Air India Management and workers union against the order of the Bombay High Court which dealt with various contentious issues arising out of the Justice Dharmadhikari report on the merger of the erstwhile Indian Airlines and Air India.
Attorney General Mukul Rohtagi was appearing for the Centre and Air India.
The high court had dealt with the issues of 75 per cent of wages and salary for the workers and had asked the unions to approach the Central Government Industrial Tribunal regarding lowering of salary allowances following the merger.
The high court had on January 27 declined to stay the implementation of the Dharmadhikari report on the merger of the erstwhile Indian Airlines and Air India.
The unions' had contended that the management should have issued notices to them under section 9A of the Industrial Disputes Act before altering service conditions.
The petitions were filed in the high court by the unions against the national carrier over the "arbitrary" change in service conditions of the pilots, engineers and other employees post merger.
Air India had set up a four-member committee under former Supreme Court judge D M Dharmadhikari on the integration of workforce post merger. The Committee submitted a report to the government in January 2012. The union, however, contested the recommendations.
The high court had earlier, in response to one of the petitions, passed an interim order asking the authorities to keep the service conditions unchanged.
The unions had argued that the airline management could not unilaterally transfer employees to other departments of sister concerns.
In one of the petitions, Indian Commercial Pilots' Association, representing the former Indian Airlines pilots, had challenged the January 2013 notifications by the airline which provided for only 75 per cent of the arrears payable to the pilots till November 2012.
In November 2011, the airline management had fixed pilots' emoluments for 72 flying hours as well as the "lay over subsistence allowance". The pilots rejected the lower allowances and demanded full payment terming it as a move to alter service conditions.

# of televisions Product Score This graph shows the LG 60LB7100’s score compared to other televisions we tested.
Michael Desjardin
October 08, 2014
With the growing ubiquity of 4K, ultra-high definition TV, the window for purchasing a full-HD television and still getting serious mileage out of it is closing. The LG 60LB7100 (MSRP $1,899.99) is a big, stylish LED TV that's packed with enough features to feel fresh for years. It's also not that pricey, but its performance leaves a lot to be desired for a TV of its class.
Still, a $1,900, 60-inch, 3D TV with LG's fantastic smart platform is a bargain. If you don't mind some blemishes on your TV and you're not planning on being an early adopter of 4K, the LB7100 is a viable option.
The Looks
It cuts a fine feature if you can fit it on a table.
If you've been paying attention to LG's 2014 lineup, the LB7100's outfit won't come as a surprise, since nearly every TV in LG's catalog this year is sporting the same design. It's a TV that's both handsome and simple: two wide-set, angular feet cradling a thin, silver bezel that allows the picture to "pop" in front of the backdrop of whatever room it's in. A slight lack of practicality is the only design blunder here; although the wide-set feet don't pose a problem with a 39-inch model, the distance between the feet starts to command a presence at 60 inches. Make no mistake about it: This TV needs a wide surface. If you're considering the 65- or the 70-inch model, your days of balancing your TV on top of your cable box are over.
A slight lack of practicality is the only design blunder here. Make no mistake, this TV needs a wide surface.
Once you've set up the LB7100–a process as simple as screwing its feet on and finding someone to help you lift it–you'll be rewarded with a sleek, minimalist TV that doesn't trade its lack of flashiness for an ability to impress. I have to hand it to LG: The design is modern without feeling flashy, complementing a room's design without dominating it. It won't stand out in a room, but that's the point.
On the back of the LB7100's mammoth panel you'll find back- and side-facing cut-outs containing the TV's myriad of connection ports. Users are graced with three HDMI inputs, three USB ports, an RS-232 mini-jack, shared component/composite inputs, a digital audio output, a coaxial RF connector, and a LAN ethernet port for accessing the internet. The LB7100 also ships with two pairs of 3D glasses and the company's "Magic Remote," but more on those later.

The Experience
This TV features the best smart platform on the market.
In a year filled with disorganized, clunky smart platforms, LG's webOS is not only a breath of fresh air, it's one of the best attempts to streamline the smart experience that we've ever seen. Instead of dumping the entire platform into a main hub and calling it a day, LG provides users with a centralized hub and a personalized menu bar, the latter of which can be accessed without interrupting playback. This menu bar is the primary means of navigating through the available smart features, so I'm happy to report that it's a breeze to use.
One of the key features of webOS is the ability to navigate swiftly from any app to live TV, a Blu-ray, or another app without interrupting playback. For example, if you're watching a movie on Netflix but want to jump to a live football game, webOS will automatically hold your place in Netflix. Whenever you decide to finish the movie, you won't need to restart Netflix and fumble through its menus a second time.
There's also a variety of integrated search options that make it easy to see if the content you want is available via cable, satellite, or with any of the apps in webOS.
Navigation in LG's webOS is silky smooth and hopping from one app to another is seamless.
Of all the complimentary things I can say about webOS–from its versatility to its convenience–I was consistently impressed by the software's responsiveness. Thanks in part to LG's Magic Remote, navigation is silky smooth and hopping from one app to another is seamless. There's a distinct lack of lag from menu-to-menu, which can't be said for many smart platforms today.
If there's one downside to this set it's the clunky calibration settings. Although the LB7100 ships with a wealth of options for tweaking your picture, the haphazard TV's menu software renders them pretty much useless.

Should power cos be compensated for low bids made earlierbusiness environment
( With the coal blocks judgement hogging…)
On August 25, the Supreme Court handed down a major judgement on the coal block allocation policy of the government. It called the manner such blocks were allotted 'ad-hoc' and 'without application of mind'. Given that nearly 60% of the power capacity in the country runs on coal, it was a judgement with major implications for the sector. But on the same day in the Supreme Court itself, an episode of another case of critical importance for the power sector was played out. With the coal blocks judgement hogging the headlines the next day, the other case received lesser attention.
Pitted against each other in this fight were, on the one hand, two power distribution companies (discoms) in Haryana; and, on the other, two of the largest power generating companies in the country, Tata Power and Adani Power. And while the SC did not hand down a final judgement in that case, what the judges said in the hearing on that day made a lot of people sit up and take notice.
The hearing centred on what has come to be known as the compensatory tariffs case. Whichever way the case finally gets decided, it is clear that the implications, both legal and financial, for the power sector are huge. Even the immediate consequences were hardly minor.
Barely two days after the hearing, Adani Power yanked 1,424 MW of power that it supplies to Haryana from its giant Mundra plant in Gujarat, though it later claimed that the event was unrelated to the SC hearing. It was forced to restore supplies earlier this week following a critical and sharply-worded ruling from APTEL — the appellate tribunal for the electricity sector (on a par with a high court). "Yes, Adani has restored power to us between October 3 and 4," says an engineer with Uttar Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam, one of the Haryana utilities.
APTEL is also the forum that is currently hearing the overall compensatory tariffs case. And even though the case has not reached its final conclusion, it has spawned a bunch of me-too cases in various courts across the country with companies asking for compensation for everything from unexpectedly sharp rupee depreciation to higher taxes to increases in land acquisition costs. All this, after signing supposedly binding contracts with state utilities.
Predicting Prices
At the heart of the case are two bids launched in 2007 and 2008 by states such as Haryana and Gujarat, among others — asking generation companies to compete for the right to supply power (the winner is the one that bids for the lowest tariff for the power). Adani and Tata were the winners in those two bids, and they bid the tariffs on the understanding that they would absorb changes in the cost of coal over the life of the bid, though they had the choice to make a bid in a way so as to pass on fuel costs to customers (the discoms). Both companies decided to import coal from Indonesian mines for the projects, located in Gujarat.
  A couple of years after Adani and Tata signed the power purchase pacts, Indonesia introduced new rules which set a minimum export price for coal, linked to international benchmarks. Effectively, this pushed up the price of coal for any company importing the commodity from Indonesia, though for the two companies in question, the impact was lower, since they owned equity stakes in the mines they bought coal from. This new law, coupled with the sharp rise in international coal prices at the time, and the weak supplies of domestic coal, made the companies throw up their hands and tell their customers that the power tariffs they had bid were now unviable, and that these should be revised. Further, they asked for compensation for the power they had already supplied at the existing tariffs citing major losses.
The case eventually ended up in the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) where Adani and Tata claimed that two clauses in the power agreements — the so-called standard 'force majeure' clause (which allows parties to revise a contract when events occur which are beyond their control, like war) and the 'change in law' clause — allowed them the right to compensation. Interestingly, the CERC rejected both these claims but allowed compensation anyway in a ruling in April last year, and appointed a committee to decide the amount.
In February this year, it decided that Tata should get about `329 crore in past compensation, and that Adani should get `829 crore. The judgement was appealed by states such as Haryana, and APTEL, in July this year, stayed the payment of past claims, but asked states to pay the revised tariffs from this year, till a final ruling in the case. Haryana appealed this ruling as well, and it was this case that ended up in the Supreme Court, and was heard on August 25.

The sense of emptiness helps him "strategize", he says. Though a frequent visitor to the US, Chhabria does not own a house there and prefers hiring chauffeur-driven cars. Left-hand-drives confuse him. For Chhabria — the businessman — this is the right time for strategizing. A lot is at stake. His company Allied Blenders and Distillers (ABD), which owns Officer's Choice, the world's largest selling whiskey brand by volume, has blueprinted an aggressive growth plan. It includes the buyout of a competing brand, acquisition of distilleries and bottling units, heavy borrowing to fuel this binge, and finally, a public issue of shares in two years.
Chhabria's story is inevitably linked with that of two other men — United Spirits chairman Vijay Mallya and Chhabria's elder brother, the late Manu Chhabria. The trio has over the last three decades joined hands and fallen out many times (see The Liquor Wars). Manu Chhabria passed away in 2002, and his family sold the liquor business to Mallya. Mallya has since handed over management control of his liquor business to Diageo and is struggling to hold on to his board seat and chairmanship. Only Kishore Chhabria , with Officer's Choice, which accounts for 75% of ABD's sales by volume, has the luxury to plan growth or take time off in never-heard-of towns in the US, which are almost cathartic for him.
Old-World Style
In India, Chhabria seems to have wrapped himself up in familiarity and tradition. Chhabria loves to be unconventional, in an industry where flamboyance is the convention. At home, which is Casa Grande on Little Gibbs Road, near south Mumbai's Hanging Gardens, Chhabria prefers an old-world style. His office is in the same building as his residence, and he is surrounded by a group of old faithful and some anachronisms like CCTV cameras monitoring every room in the office with the monitor placed directly in front of his table. The office decor is anything but modern, and the drapes and chandeliers may even qualify as opulent.
"I have married only once. Bala (VR Balakrishnan), my secretary, was earlier my father's secretary. My cook has been around for 36 years and my driver for 27 years. Once I grab hold of a person I rarely let go," Chhabria says. Chhabria's company ABD is the third largest maker of Indian-made foreign liquor (IMFL, the rather curious contraction used by governments to differentiate liquor made in the organised sector from indigenous hooch). An 8% market share in IMFL makes ABD one of the largest Indian-owned liquor businesses. The corporate office is at Lower Parel, in a spanking new building, where the company's CEO Deepak Roy sits. Roy, an industry veteran who has also worked with Mallya in the past, has been allotted 5% sweat equity in the company by Chhabria, who owns the rest. Chhabria's son-in-law Jeetu Hemdev, who is married to his elder daughter, works under Roy.
Chhabria confesses that he never encouraged either of his two daughters to take an interest in his business. "In hindsight, I can admit I was wrong. I thought liquor was not a good business for women," he offers.

Cyclone Hudhud hammers eastern India  at least two deadCyclone Hudhud blasts India's east coast, at least five dead

VISAKHAPATNAM India (Reuters) - Cyclone Hudhud blasted India's eastern seaboard on Sunday with gusts of up to 195 km per hour (over 120 mph), uprooting trees, damaging buildings and killing at least five people despite a major evacuation effort.
The port city of Visakhapatnam, home to two million people and a major naval base, was hammered as the cyclone made landfall, unleashing the huge destructive force it had sucked up from the warm waters of the Bay of Bengal.
Wreckage was strewn across Visakhapatnam, known to locals as Vizag. Most people heeded warnings to take refuge, but five were killed by falling trees and masonry, and thousands of homes were damaged, emergency officials said.
The chief minister of Andhra Pradesh, the state that bore the brunt of Hudhud's onslaught, said the extent of damage would only become known after the storm abates.
"We are unable to ascertain the situation. Seventy percent of communication has totally collapsed ... this is the biggest calamity," N. Chandrababa Naidu told Headlines Today television.
"We are asking people not to come out of their houses," Naidu said, adding that damage assessment would start on Monday. "We are mobilising men and material immediately."
Prime Minister Narendra Modi called Naidu and promised "all possible assistance in relief and rescue operations", his central government said in a statement.
The low toll reported so far followed an operation to evacuate more than 150,000 people to minimise the risk to life from Hudhud - similar in size and power to cyclone Phailin that struck the area exactly a year ago.
After a lull as the eye of the storm passed over the city, winds regained their potency. Forecasters warned Hudhud would blow strongly for several hours more, before wind speeds halve in the evening.
"Reverse windflow will be experienced by the city, which will again have a very great damage potential," L.S. Rathore, director-general of the state India Meteorological Department (IMD), told reporters in New Delhi.
The IMD forecast a storm surge of one to two metres (three to six feet) above high tide that could result in flooding of low-lying coastal areas around Visakhapatnam, Vijayanagaram and Srikakulam.
TERRIFYING WIND
A Reuters reporter in Visakhapatnam said the storm had smashed his hotel's windows and flooded the ground floor. It was difficult even to open the door of his room, he said, as wind rushing through the corridors drove it shut again.
"I never imagined that a cyclone could be so dangerous and devastating," said one businessman who was staying in the hotel. "The noise it is making would terrify anyone."
An operations centre in state capital Hyderabad was inundated with calls from people seeking help, including 350 students stranded in their hostel without food or water, said K. Hymavathi, a top disaster management official.
Visakhapatnam port suspended operations on Saturday night, with its head saying that 17 ships which had been in the harbour were moving offshore where they would be less at risk from high seas. The city airport was closed and train services suspended.
The IMD rated Hudhud as a very severe cyclonic storm that could pack gusts of 195 kph and dump more than 24.5 cm (10 inches) of rain.
The cyclone was strong enough to have a "high humanitarian impact" on nearly 11 million people, the Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System (GDACS), run by the United Nations and the European Commission, said.
The evacuation effort was comparable to one preceding Cyclone Phailin, credited with minimising fatalities to 53. When a huge storm hit the same area 15 years ago, 10,000 people died.
Hudhud was likely to batter a 200-300 km stretch of coastline before losing force as it moves inland, forecasters said.
According to the IMD, peak wind speeds will drop to 60 kph by Monday afternoon. Hudhud is expected to continue to dump heavy rains in northern and northeastern India and, eventually, snow when it reaches the Himalayan mountains.

Andhra Pradesh
(Strong winds and heavy rains…)
VISHAKAPATNAM: Severe cyclonic storm Hudhud with wind speed of 170-180 kmph made a landfall in this port city of Andhra Pradesh today triggering heavy downpour that left three persons dead in Visakhapatnam and Srikakulam districts.
Strong winds and heavy rains triggered by the cyclone led to largescale destruction of power lines leading to outages in the three districts of Visakhapatnam, Vizianagaram and Srikakulam.
"Three deaths have been reported due to the impact of Hudhud cyclone. Two died after trees fell on them and one in collapse of compound-wall in Visakhapatnam and Srikakulam districts, respectively," Andhra Pradesh Chief Secretary I V R Krishna Rao said.
During the cyclone, winds with 195-200 kmph speed have been reported causing uprooting of a lot of trees. The wind has also damaged electrical poles and mobile towers. Due to fall of electric poles, electricity and communication network have been effected in the area, he said.
People of Visakhapatnam, Srikakulam and Vizianagaram districts have been asked to stay back in their houses and if the walls of their houses are weak they can shift to cyclone relief centres, Rao said.
The cyclone, which crossed the Visakhapatnam coast, seems to be in a period of lull in the first hour, but people should follow the advisory as it may suddenly aggravate later, officials said. NDRF teams have been deployed in affected areas, the chief secretary said.
In Delhi, IMD Director Laxman Singh Rathore said the centre of cyclone was crossing the Andhra Pradesh coast and wind speed was 170-180 kmph gusting up to 195 kmph.
He said the wind speed will come down by 50 per cent in the next six hours. The average sea wave surge was 1.5 meter and will vary from one to two meters in places as the cyclone crosses Vizag.
"The PMO is monitoring the situation arising out of the cyclone on an hourly basis," he said, adding that helicopters will operate for relief and rescue measures in the Andhra coast region only tomorrow morning after slow-down of windspeed.
The heavy rains triggered by the cyclone left two persons dead.
While one person was killed when the compound wall of a building collapsed in Visakhaptnam district, another person died in Srikakulam district when a tree collapsed following pounding rains, according to Andhra Pradesh disaster management department.
"Except East Godavari, power entirely failed in the three districts of Visakhapatnam, Vizianagaram and Srikakulam. There were gale winds. The situation is very severe. National Highway in the region has been shut," Special Commissioner, State Disaster Management Authority, K Hymavathi said.
The authorities have evacuated 90,013 people across the four districts of Srikakulam, Vizianagaram, Visakhaptnam and East Godavari.
Andhra Pradesh government has identified 356 villages in 59 mandals of the four districts as cyclone-prone. More than 300 relief camps have been opened.
Army columns are positioned at Visakhapatnam and Srikakulam with power boats and other equipment for rescue and relief. Six helicopters have been positioned in the Naval base at Visakhapatnam.
The Indian Air Force has tasked Headquarters Training Command, Bangalore to be the nodal agency for all relief operations in connection with severe cyclone Hudhud.
  Telecom network also failed following which a control room in Visakhapatnam failed to operate, officials said.
In neighbouring Odisha, heavy rains coupled with high-speed wind lashed several parts of south Odisha where over 45,000 people have been evacuated from vulnerable areas to safety.
An estimated 45,000 people have so far been evacuated in eight districts of Malkangiri, Koraput, Rayagada, Nabarangpur, Ganjam, Gajapati, Kandhamal and Kalahandi to ensure zero casualty, Special Relief Commissioner (SRC) P K Mohapatra said.
Under the influence of the cyclone, heavy rains pounded many parts of Malkangiri, Ganjam, Khurda, Gajapati, Puri and Rayagada districts, while strong surface wind swept several areas.
The state capital of Bhubaneswar also experienced rains since last night and the intensity of rain and wind flow is gradually gaining pace as Hudhud roared towards the coast.
To deal with the calamity, as many 26 teams - 16 of NDRF and 10 teams of ODRF - have already been deployed in vulnerable places for rescue work, according to Chief Secretary G C Pati. Each team comprises 40 personnel.
"We have been assured by the Centre that army teams will be ready at Raipur in Chhattisgarh and 5 choppers at Kalaikunda in West Bengal for our call," he said.
As a precautionary measure, East Coast Railways cancelled train services on Bhubaneswar-Visakhapatanam route, while the state government has stopped bus service in five districts like Ganjam, Gajapati, Rayagada, Nabarangpur and parts of Kalahandi. The private bus operators have also been asked not to operate service tomorrow.
"We have appealed to the public in the eight districts not to venture out of their houses during the landfall of the cyclone and six hours after that," Mohapatra said, adding BSNL had been requested to send SMS to its users urging them not to venture out.
According to the latest IMD bulletin, rain and thundershowers would occur at most places in the state during the next 48 hours.
Similarly, heavy to very heavy rainfall in some places with extremely heavy rainfall is expected at one or two places in Malkangiri, Koraput, Rayagada, Nawarangpur, Ganjam, Gajpati, Kalahandi and Phulbani of South Odisha in the next 24 hours, said local IMD centre Director Sarat Sahu.
Heavy to very heavy rainfall has been forecast at one or two places in Khurda, Puri, Jagatsinghpur, Nayagarh, Jajpur, Balasore, Bhadrak, Kendrapara, Cuttack, Dhenkanal and Maurbhanj during the same period.

(Land Rover, an iconic British…)
LONDON: Tata group's Land Rover has forayed into an elite club of world's 100 most valuable brands as the only Indian-owned entity, while iconic Apple has retained its top slot with nearly USD 119 billion valuation.
Land Rover, an iconic British car brand owned by Indian conglomerate Tatas, has been ranked 91st with a brand value of $ 4.47 billion and is one of the five new entrants on this annual list compiled by leading brand consultancy Interbrand.
Apple -- maker of iPhone mobiles, Mac computers, iPad tablets and iPod music players among others -- is followed by Google on the second position (USD 107 billion). These are the only two with brand values in excess of USD 100 billion.
While Land Rover is the only Indian-owned entity on the list, there are at least six other brands ranked among top 100 that are part of the entities run by Indian-origin CEOs.
These include Satya Nadella-led Microsoft (5th with brand value of USD 61 billion), Indra Nooyi-led Pepsi (24th; USD 19 billion), Shantanu Narayen-led Adobe (77th; USD 5.3 billion) and Ajay Banga-led MasterCard (88th; USD 4.7 billion).
Ivan Menezes-led British drinks giant Diageo, which also owns majority stake in India's largest alcoholic beverage manufacturer United Spirits, also has two portfolio brands -- Smirnoff (34th; USD 13 billion) and Johnnie Walker (86th; USD 4.8 billion) -- on the top 100 list.
Land Rover has been ranked higher than many big global brands like FedEx, Huawei, Heineken, Pizza Hut, BOSS, Nokia, Gap and Nintendo.
"Exemplifying British engineering and expertise in the SUV category, the iconic British brand (owned by TATA of India) has invested heavily in product creation, facility, and infrastructure," Interbrand said.
The leading brand consultancy further noted that "with 115 awards across its car range (led by Range Rover with 55 awards), Land Rover is finally getting the recognition it deserves and has improved its J D Power scores significantly."
"With the customer at the heart of the company, a clear focus and significant investment in improving design and quality, and demonstrating world-class technology and innovation, Land Rover is fully equipped to experience accelerating success in the forthcoming Age of You," Interbrand added.
Among top-ten, Apple and Google are followed by Coca-Cola, IBM, Microsoft, GE, Samsung, Toyota, McDonald's and Mercedes Benz.
Apple's brand value increased 21 per cent year-on-year, while for Google it was 15 per cent and for Coca Cola it was 3 per cent.
To be included in Best Global Brands, a brand must be truly global, having successfully transcended geographic and cultural boundaries, Interbrand said.
It must have a significant presence in Asia, Europe, and North America, as well as broad geographic coverage in emerging markets.
Moreover, the brand must have a public profile and awareness across the world's major economies.

Indian IT spending to reach $7.2 billion in 2015: Gartner
ET Bureau Oct 12, 2014, 01.46PM IST
(The delivery of a citizen-centric…)
NEW DELHI: The Indian government's spend on information technology will rise 5 percent in 2015 to $7.2 billion, helped by regional, state and central government spending on internal and external IT and telecommunications, according to research firm Gartner.
Government IT spending in India is on pace to total $ 6.6 billion in 2014, the research firm added.
"IT services, which include consulting, implementation, IT outsourcing and business process outsourcing, will be the largest overall IT government spending category through 2018," said Anurag Gupta, research director at Gartner. "IT services are expected to grow 10.9 percent in 2014 to reach $1.8 billion in 2015, up from $1.6 billion in 2014 - with the business process outsourcing segment growing 22 percent during 2014," he added.
The spending can be attributed in large part to the government's recent IT-based initiatives such as "Digital India", which seek to leverage the use of technology in all government processes, and ensure electronic delivery of citizen services to all sections of Indian society. This would require a fair amount of investment in hardware, software and the installed infrastructure base.
Gartner said government spending on software is expected to grow to $910 million in 2015, from $788 million in 2014, and will be led by growth in vertical specific software. Internal services, or the salaries and benefits paid to the information services staff of an organization, is expected to grow at the rate of 9.9% this year.
"India has a new government in power with the underlying promise of 'Less Government & More Governance'. The delivery of a citizen-centric and transparent government is only possible through the extensive use of technology and by leveraging digital government," said Gupta.
"We expect a focus on expanding broadband penetration, accelerating digitization of core government processes, leveraging mobility to engage the citizens, cloud initiatives and public private partnership. India has ambitious plans to build several smart cities, and this will create new opportunities," he added.

P Chidambaram advises against lifting curbs on gold imports
PTI Oct 12, 2014, 02.19PM IST

Congress
(Chidambaram agreed that…)
MUMBAI: Former finance minister P Chidambaram has advocated against lifting of curbs on gold imports, saying the benefits accruing from restrictions would far outweigh problems like spurt in smuggling.
"No. Not in my view," Chidambaram, who initiated these measures as the Finance Minister in the previous UPA regime in the face of a record high current account deficit (CAD), told PTI over the weekend when asked whether the time was ripe to withdraw the curbs.
The senior Congress leader was in the city to campaign in Maharashtra Assembly polls.
The CAD, which is the difference between inflow and outflow of foreign exchange , had touched an all-time high of USD 88.2 billion or 4.8 per cent of GDP in 2012-13.
The high current account deficit had led to the rupee plummeting to its all-time low of 68.80 in August last year.
On concerns like a spurt in smuggling activities, which had otherwise been checked after liberalisation, Chidambaram said the benefits of the gold import curbs are too big.
In wake of the high gold imports affecting current account deficit, the previous government had hiked the import duty on gold three times to 10 per cent and also compelled importers to export a sizeable part of the commodity under the 80:20 rule.
However, during this fiscal, there was some clarification in the 80:20 rule after a massive reduction in CAD.
According to some estimates, 200 tonnes of the precious metal will be imported into the country in the calendar year 2014.
There has been a jump in gold smuggling cases registered by enforcement agencies.
When asked if it is fair to artificially reduce CAD, Chidambaram said: "What else to do? There is no other way. I agree that CAD should be reduced by exports, but it won't happen overnight. Can we afford to spend USD 50 billion on gold imports? We cant afford it."
Chidambaram agreed that in the long-term, we should focus on pushing exports to reduce CAD but at the moment the country is left will little option.
Talking about international rating agency S&P's outlook upgrade on India, Chidambaram said that this was due to the handsome growth rate of 5.7 per cent in the first quarter.

After RBI diktat  Uber under scanner of Tax ...After RBI diktat, Uber under the scanner of Services Tax Department
PTI Oct 13, 2014, 05.53AM IST
(The service tax notice to Uber makes…)
MUMBAI: After allegedly falling foul with RBI, the US-based transport app provider Uber Inc, which offers its services to around 1,200 cab operators in India's 10 top cities, has come under the scanner of the Services Tax Department.
"We have sent a tax enquiry to Uber Inc. So far, they have not paid us a single penny in taxes. We have not sent them a demand notice as they don't have an office in the country, but are operating through their Netherlands arm," Mumbai Service Tax Commissioner SK Solanki told PTI.
When asked what is the quantum of the money they are in default of, Solanki said: "The department has not sent a demand notice to them but an enquiry, seeking clarifications.
"Their headquarters has informed us that some representative from their Netherlands office will meet us. We will issue them a demand notice after getting their response because we are not sure who is liable to pay the tax - Uber or the cabbies. But someone has to pay," he said.
Uber has become popular by offering luxury car rides for a little more than the regular fare.
The service tax notice to Uber makes it the first such demand to a foreign service provider in the e-commerce space in the country.
The San Francisco-based Uber Inc claims to be the world's largest transport app service provider by online aggregation of luxury cab operators, and has been under legal and regulatory lens in almost all the markets it operates in like the home market US, Germany, Britain, Poland, Brazil, Korea, among others. It is present in over 200 cities globally.
In August this year, the Reserve Bank had reportedly asked it to stop receiving payments with single-factor authentication from October 31, which would effectively mean that it will have to shut shop by the end of the month here.
When told that Uber claims it is not in default, Solanki said: "I don't understand how they are different from any other taxi operator like Meru, TabCab etc who all pay service tax. We are very sure that either Uber pay us the tax or cabbies do so. But getting it from some 1,200 cabbies individually is not easy."
When contacted for response, Uber communications head for APAC Region, Evelyn Tay in an email told PTI: "Uber complies with all applicable tax laws, and pays the relevant tax in every territory it operates in. All payments on the Uber system are cashless and fully traceable in an industry that has been notoriously cash-based for years."
The privately held company, set up in March 2009 by Travis Kalanick (chief executive) and Garrett Camp, has Goldman Sachs and Google Ventures among others as investors and offers vehicles for hire, ride-sharing through its app.

SXSW hiring 50 interns for this year s conferenceExhibitors explore the show floor at  SXSW in Austin.
(Photo: Garrett Hubbard, USA TODAY)
Most people are pretty jealous I go to school in sunny California, but right now I’m wishing I was a Texas student — for now until March 2015, at least.
That’s because SXSW is holding its annual music, film and interactive media conference (the eponymous South by Southwest Music Conference and Festival) — and it’s looking for more than 50 interns to help make it a success.
“We currently have 18 different internships we are currently recruiting for,” says Gene Butler, the volunteer and intern coordinator. From legal matters and interactive programming and production to volunteer coordination and event planning , it’s almost guaranteed you’ll find one that plays to your strengths.
And don’t let a distaste for Starbucks runs and copy machines scare you away from applying. Most of SXSW’s employees start out as volunteers or seasonal interns, so the company is big on challenging you and giving you a meaningful experience.
Whatever type of intern you are, you’re encouraged to find and tackle problems that you see. That sounds way more valuable than memorizing someone’s taste for café au lait.
“There is a family feel here; interns are integrated into the departments where they work and become a part of a tight knit team and the bigger SXSW family as well,” Butler says. “Also, our interns get to see what it takes to put on a world class conference and festival from behind the scenes. When they have down time during the event, they can attend any of the showcases, movies, panels, or trade shows.”
One more job perk: the tons of free swag interns walk away with.
If this sounds like great experience to you, check out SXSW’s internships and apply! I’ll be there with you in spirit.

Cook says Pietersen’s book has ‘tarnished’ English cricket

Denying Kevin Pietersen’s claims that a bullying culture had flourished in the England dressing room in recent years, captain Alastair Cook says the maverick cricketer’s controversial autobiography has “tarnished” one of the most successful eras for the national team.
“I’m very proud of that era we played in to win three Ashes series and become the best side in the world. I only have fond memories of that, but I do believe it’s kind of been tarnished and I’m sad about that,” Cook told ‘BBC’
“I think it’s been a really sad week for cricket. We have to draw a line under it at some stage and this is a good time” the 29-year-old said.
The release of ‘KP: The Autobiography’ this week has been accompanied by controversy with former and current players either backing or criticising the former batsman’s claims in the book.
Pietersen’s international career effectively ended in February when his central contract with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) was terminated.
He scored 8,181 runs at an average of 47 in 104 Tests and captained England in three Tests.
A “hurt” Cook denied that a bullying culture flourished in the team in recent years.
“International cricket is a tough place and, as a team, you’re striving for excellence at all times. Certainly at some stages those frustrations boiled over more than they should have done, but that was only people who were desperate to succeed and wanting to know the other 10 blokes around were committed 100 per cent to it also.
“Did it overstep the mark a couple of times? Possibly, but we addressed those issues. That’s what happens in teams, but it certainly wasn’t a bullying environment as such,” Cook said.
Cook also did not agree with Pietersen’s views about former coach Andy Flower.
“I’ve known Andy since he was a player in the Essex dressing room. He took me under his wing as a player and then obviously, your relationship changes as a coach to a player and then to a head coach and a captain.
“I’ve only got respect for him, as a man, as a coach. Chatting to some of the other players about it, they feel the same. A lot of our success was down to his drive and his determination to make us a tough England side.”

Rinki Roy Bhattacharya explores how an unlikely film “Madhumati” was born out of her father and celebrated filmmaker Bimal Roy’s oeuvre
When planning the golden jubilee celebration of the Bimal Roy classic “Madhumati”, it struck Rinki Roy Bhattacharya to explore a book on the subject. She looked to restore a link. “I felt something was broken, a link, a promise. I embarked on a journey to address that unfortunate cultural gap. The fact that Bimal Roy was my father however proved challenging to me as a writer. I experienced a constant struggle to separate the two distinct and powerful identities, the filmmaker from my father,” she writes in her introduction to “Madhumati, Untold Stories From Behind The Scenes”, published by Rupa.
The well-crafted book is a story narrated by Rinki through anecdotes and her own remembrances, like the first time she met Dilip Kumar Sahab, his picture pasted on her bedroom door, how she yearned to be his beloved, her vivid memory of his light-blue Impala Studebaker with BMW 2424 number, her gracious acknowledgement of Deep Bhatt, who took her to the locations where “Madhumati” was shot in Kumaon. The book is an interesting read for all Bimal Roy fans and especially those who fell in love with “Madhumati”, for its gripping tale and also the enchanting music of Salil Chowdhury, the haunting Aaje Re Mai To Kab Se Khadi Is Paar still a rage.
Replete with anecdotes and some little known facets of the iconic movie, the book, as Rinki describes it, is a tribute to Bimal Roy, a master of the craft. As Vyjayanthimala Bali, the ravishing heroine of the movie, observes, “Madhumati, the innocent tribal girl from the hills, was conceived as a mixture of the earthy and the ethereal. The reincarnation story of Madhumati was treated so artistically by Bimalda that it never went beyond the realm of realism he was renowned for. It will always remain one of the most memorable films of my career.”
When planning the celebration, Rinki felt the desire to write on “Madhumati”. “I realised there was still a story to narrate, there were some players still around, waiting for recognition. I felt a stab when I went to invite Pran saab for the function and I discovered he had lost his memory. I went to (filmmaker) Hrishikesh Mukherjee and he said he won’t talk about two people (my father and Ashok Kumar). I felt so sad. We all wanted to know about “Madhumati” from them, the film, my father and the actors.”
Of course, Rinki remembers those glorious days. “I remember going for the premiere and it was such fun because we were never bothered about what my father was when it came to filmmaking or watching. But there were so many questions related to the film that begged answers. Why did Bimal Roy make such a film, It was so unlikely. And that is how it all started.”
As a writer, a movie buff and a critic, where would Rinki place “Madhumati”? “I think it is unique. Here is a man who made serious stuff relating to dispossession, tragedy of farmers, untouchability. This is such a distinct film, very unlike any of his other films. No way when I watch the film do I feel that my father was uncomfortable making it. He just takes you off on a melodious journey. It is an absolute musical odyssey. I place it very high. It has its own place and the most definite film on reincarnation till date. “
And what of the remakes of some Bimal Roy films? “One has to look at it independently. Every artist has a right to show his art. Why not? If “Parineeta” is relevant today then why not? They can do it. My father’s “Parineeta” or “Devdas” is still so popular…All I would say is we should not compare them. It is not fair. A remake is often related to the culture and relevance of the times. People have been copying it (“Madhumati”) ad nauseam. It is a very important work and my father’s craft is at his best. My father was well known for his frame, the famous Bimal Roy frame. He never compromised on his craft and for the first time he had 11-12 songs in a film. This was very rare for a Bimal Roy film. He has got a hero, heroine, villain, typical pardesi babu and gaon ki chokri.”
In praise of her father’s work, Rinki adds, “He broke all stereotypes within the popular format and reinvented a story in his own style. It must have been very difficult but the amazing thing is he went along it. And he gave us something really to cherish. It is very compelling. No time and generation thing. Very subtle, love and romance... The way my father portrayed love in the film, the way it progresses, was amazing, the various stages of love, wooing and falling in love. It had its own magic, nostalgic. Today’s audience just loves it.”
“Madhumati” continues to fascinate the audience. Rinki recalls, “I love watching it and for many people it is their favourite. I watched it with today’s generation in a festival and the whole hall was dancing. They were first-time watchers!”
Madhumati remains closest to Rinki and hence this well-written book. “My father never talked about his work. It is closest to me. My father was also engrossed completely in the film, rising early, having early recordings. The film had seven sound tracks and not three as was the norm. It was technically superb.”
What impressed the daughter most was Bimal Roy’s “simplicity and commitment to the work. The way he treated the subject, never pushing the actors. In terms of simplicity he was great. A bit of melodrama was there because it portrayed life. The way the actors delivered their lines, dignity and decency, carried his stamp. Sunil Dutt and Balraj Sahni are examples. His work was sometimes autobiographical. My father did not make his actors shout. That is how he was in real life.”
What was Rinki’s favourite Bimal Roy moment? “It is the telephone song sequence from “Sujata” (the Talat Mahmood great Jalte Hain Jiske Liye). In the beginning of the song Nutan gets very emotional. My father told her to hold back her emotions because she had to last until the last stages of the song. You can see this control of emotions by Nutan. My father never directed, he actually guided his actors. He had other people to act it out. My father would give little tips. Pran saab and Vyjayanthiji confessed his presence was all that was needed for them to give inspired performances.”
A proud daughter, Rinki concludes, “I could not have asked for more. I was so privileged to be my father’s daughter. He was so caring, so sensitive, kept everything simple and was not at all patriarchal.”

Pakistan violates ceasefire  resumes firing along LoCPakistani Army resumes unprovoked firing along LoC
By Indo Asian News Service | IANS –  Sat 11 Oct, 2014
Print
Jammu,: The Pakistani Army Saturday resorted to unprovoked firing at Indian positions along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir's Poonch district.
A senior police officer told IANS here: "The Pakistani Army violated the ceasefire in Shahpur Kerni sector of the LoC in Poonch district today (Saturday) afternoon.
"The Pakistani Army is using automatic weapons to target Indian positions. Firing started at 12.45 p.m. and is still going on (at 2 p.m.). The Indian Army retaliated and firing exchanges are still going on in the area."
Eight civilians were killed in unprecedented peace0time mortar shelling by the Pakistani Army on the International Border and the LoC in the Jammu region since Oct 6, while over 60 were injured.
As many as 30,000 border residents are presently living in relief camps set up by the state government away from the areas vulnerable to Pakistani shelling.
Pakistani shelling makes life hell for people
Life for nearly 30,000 people living in relief camps has been turned upside down after they were forced to abandon their homes because of indiscriminate shelling from across the India-Pakistan boder on civilian habitations in Jammu, Kathua and Samba districts. Local residents say the hostilities were nothing short of a war, save for the movement of tanks and fighter planes.
Eight civilians have been killed and more than 60 injured in Pakistani mortar shelling since October 6 on the Line of Control (LoC) and the International Border (IB) in Jammu and Kashmir. Just five among the injured are security personnel - four army soldiers and a paramilitary BSF trooper.
The Pakistani army and paramilitary Rangers have violated the ceasefire agreement 35 times in five days, Indian military offiicals say. The Indian Army and the BSF have been adequately retaliating, but the matching retaliation to this act of aggression has not brought any succour to the lives of the traumatized villagers on the border.
"The present shelling by Pakistan has been worse than the 1971 war in the R.S. Pura sector. We have left everything behind and have been living in this ITI building since then," a visibly angry resident at the R.S. Pura relief camp, who did not want to be named, told IANS.
"The new government at the centre had promised there would be peace on the border after it took over. We voted for the BJP during the Lok Sabha elections because of that promise. See what has happened to us now," he added.
There are over 30 relief camps set up for border residents in Jammu, Samba and Kathua districts and the general refrain is that things have become unbearable for the people living there.
Many residents from the affected villagers are saying the present hostilities between the two countries are nothing short of a war.
"The only thing that has not happened during Pakistan shelling of our areas is the movement of tanks and fighter planes. Everything else here suggests a war," another affected villager from Samba district's Ramgarh sector told IANS.
Chief Minister Omar Abdullah said Pakistan's act of aggression stemmed from its failure to attract international attention on Kashmir during its Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's address to the UN General Assembly last month.
India has refused a flag meeting between the two countries unless Pakistan stops its shelling and firing.
The stalled peace process between the two countries would take months before its resumption is even spoken about. But normalcy would take much longer to return to the lives of thousands of affected residents on the LoC and the IB in the Jammu region.
More than 600,000 people have been directly affected by the unprecedented floods in the Valley Sep 7. A rattled state administration is battling hard to come to grips with the colossal damage to private and public properties and infrastructure, including bridges, roads and government installations.
Many residents in the flood-affected areas have taken a stoic view of their devastation: accepting the inevitable as an act of God.
The state's misfortune this time is that perhaps both God and man have joined hands to wreak havoc here.

Lalit Modi's status as RCA chief in doubt
RCA and BCCI officials met in Jaipur on Saturday to discuss the Rajasthan XI team selection as per the Rajasthan High Court directive.

Lalit Modi ousted?
There is confusion over Lalit Modi's status as president of the Rajasthan Cricket Association, with reports of him being voted out by the association's members coming in, even while RCA deputy-president Mehmood Abdi rubbished claims of his ouster.
RCA and BCCI officials met in Jaipur on Saturday to discuss the Rajasthan XI team selection as per the Rajasthan High Court directive. Following that meeting, an anti-Modi lobby, headed by RCA vice-president Amin Pathan, claimed to have met separately and voted Modi out of the RCA. However, Modi aide Abdi said the RCA was fully behind him as the president.
Pathan said the supposed move to remove Modi was taken with a view to break the banned association's impasse with the BCCI. "When we elected Lalit Modi, we were told the RCA wouldn't face any problem. We didn't know it would lead to a ban from the BCCI and our players would suffer," Pathan said. "All these hassles in fielding our teams in different tournaments are not acceptable. We have elected a new body and will write to the BCCI to accept us."
Soon after, Abdi told ESPNcricinfo: "These are all disgruntled elements, which are working for the interests that are anti-RCA. The entire association is behind Mr Lalit Modi and there is no change in his status." Later, he added in a statement, "The so-called meeting of the RCA executive committee in Jaipur was wholly unauthorised and illegal. Moreover, there was no notice of any such meeting and it was organised in a very clandestine manner away from the RCA office. All those claiming to be members of the executive committee attending that meeting were fake identities.Strict disciplinary action will be taken against all those found involved in this mischief."
Modi, speaking to PTI, put the "revolt" down to team-selection issues. "Some disgruntled members probably didn't get their way in selection of boys and thus revolted. Not worried about such vested people," Modi said. "No interference in selection has always been my mantra - if someone wants to revolt, most welcome. But on my watch, no interference or blackmailing will be allowed."
Aside from Modi, Pathan, one of the association's six vice-presidents, also claimed to have ousted Abdi and treasurer Pawan Goyal in an extraordinary general meeting. Pathan also announced himself as the acting president. On the other hand, Abdi said neither the president nor the secretary Sumendra Tiwary had convened a general body meeting.
The BCCI members did not take any part in the second meeting. In the first meeting, which dealt with the Rajasthan teams' selection, BCCI general manager, game development, Ratnakar Shetty met with Abdi, Tiwary and other RCA representatives to start the selection procedure as per court directive. Abdi and the other RCA representatives handed over some of the requisite documents to start the selection procedure to Shetty and court-appointed coordinator Taposh Chatterjee. It was then decided that the junior selection trials will be held in the coming week. The date of senior selection trials will be decided later.
The RCA was suspended in May by the BCCI after former IPL chairman Modi, who was expelled by the BCCI last year for "committing acts of serious misconduct and indiscipline", was elected the state association's president. The BCCI suspended it for allowing a banned individual to be a part of its affairs, and, later, omitted the various teams representing Rajasthan from its domestic programme for the upcoming season.
That left the players anxious and confused as to what their future holds, and eventually a petition was filed in the in the Rajasthan High Court on behalf of 75 Rajasthan cricketers, asking that they not be made to suffer "only for one reason, which is the grudge between BCCI and RCA". Subsequently, the court passed an interim order appointing selection committees to pick teams to represent the state in various BCCI domestic tournaments in 2014-15, but not under the usual banner of the RCA. While that came as a boost for the players, the impasse between the BCCI and the RCA continued.
Pathan had previously been a Modi loyalist. The secretary of the Kota District Cricket Association, he had even accompanied Abdi when Modi's nomination papers were filed for the RCA election in November.

Pharma cos may post robust top-line growth in Q2Pharma cos may post robust top-line growth in Q2
Press Trust of India | Mumbai Oct 12, 2014 11:30 AM IST
Pharmaceutical firms are expected to post robust top-line growth and improve profitability in the second quarter of this fiscal, driven by steady growth in the country, a brokerage firm has said.
For the July-September period, we expect a robust growth of 18% in revenues, EBITDA 22% and earnings 18% for our coverage universe, driven by ramp-up in the US and steady growth in India due to price hikes for certain products," Edelweiss Securities said in its report here.
Russia/CIS and Japan growth is likely to be muted given the rouble/yen depreciation versus the Indian rupee, it said.
Earnings momentum of pharma companies is to continue on robust top-line growth and improving profitability. Gross margin has been rising since the past few quarters as the US is gaining scale with more productive launches and the India business is bouncing back and favourable currency, it said.
This has enabled higher investments in R&D and also led to structural improvement in EBITDA margin, which the borkerage firm believes is sustainable. Steady margins will lend credence to the thesis that Indian pharma has moved up the value chain in the US, the report said.
The report said that the Sun Pharma, Ranbaxy and Torrent are expected to report strong earnings as Sun Pharma subsidiary Taro hiked prices of clobetasol, clotrimazole, warfarin and carbamazepine in June 2014, which should drive the second quarter earnings. Ranbaxy will also benefit from the Diovan FTF launch in July 2014.
Torrent's earnings will drag with the Cymbalta exclusivity ending.
Consolidation of Elder's acquired business would cushion its profitability.
Cipla witnessed better-than-expected margin improvement in the first quarter which is expected to continue. It should also gain from its partnership with Teva for Baraclude, it said.
The business model of Indian generic players is evolving seamlessly towards higher value realisation.
"We expect US growth to remain robust on market share gains and multiple niche launches going forward. We believe the India market is well set to grow, particularly with the pricing policy uncertainty done with and first round of price hikes for NLEM (National List of Essential Medicines) products undertaken...." the report said.

Satya Nadella gaffe: Research shows wide gender pay gap in Indian IT
PTI Oct 12, 2014, 02.25PM IST
(According to Catalyst global…)
NEW DELHI: Amid Microsoft's Indian-origin CEO Satya Nadella's gaffe on linking pay hike for women to 'good karma', research shows that a considerable pay gap emerges between men and women staff in Indian IT sector over time, despite they normally starting at similar levels.
Speaking at a conference on women in technology sector, Nadella said last week in the US that "it's not really about asking for the raise, but knowing and having faith that the system will actually give you the right raises as you go along."
"Because that's good karma. It'll come back because somebody's going to know that's the kind of person that I want to trust," he had said.
This created a furore, including on social media platforms, and Nadella promptly termed his comments as "inarticulate" and "completely wrong". He tweeted and also issued a memo to Microsoft employees to explain his position.
"Although it's unfortunate that a senior leader like Nadella made such comments, it's commendable that he quickly realised his mistake and issued a swift and sincere apology," Catalyst India WRC Executive Director Shachi Irde said.
Founded in 2011, Catalyst India WRC is a membership community composed of 58 leading corporations and professional firms committed to building inclusive workplaces that expand opportunities for women and business in corporate India.
It is part of US-based Catalyst group, which was founded in 1962 and is a leading non-profit membership organisation expanding opportunities for women and business.
"What's good for women is good for men, business, economies and society as a whole," Irde said.
According to Catalyst global research, there are considerable gender pay gaps within the tech sector as well as across other industry sectors.
"In India specifically, our research on the tech sector reported that women and men start out as equals with equal pay and responsibility, and similar aspirations to the highest levels, including that of CEO.
"But a gender gap emerges over time. Women lag behind men (to a tune of about Rs 3.8 lakhs or $ 6,000) by the time they are about 12 years into their careers," Irde said.
Intentional action and leadership is needed to root out these disparities within organisations.
"We look to leaders like Nadella to ensure that appropriate action is put to words so that talented women and men can contribute, achieve and get paid fairly for their work," Irde said.
GlobalHunt MD Sunil Goel said "on a broader term this (Nadella's comments) should have been that good worker whether male/female should concentrate and focus on working hard and burn their larger portion of energy in work rather than thinking of how to negotiate better.
In an open letter to Satya Nadella published on Time Magazine website, Nilofer Merchant wrote that "Bias against women in tech is fixable. But only with conscious leadership."
"While achieving wage equality is important, what is more important is creating a new normal where women don't have to live by the old rules created by men in the industrial era," said Merchant, a US-based renowned strategist and advisor to many bluechip companies globally.
Instead of waiting for the industry to change (miraculously), why not be the change, she asked.
"Tomorrow, you re-level and compensate every woman on the same pay scale as your men. That would change the industry, and you have it within your powers to do it.
"It would redeem your stupidity yesterday. But more importantly, it would signal to the industry what leadership actually looks like," Merchant said.

After RBI diktat  Uber under lens of Service...After RBI diktat, Uber under the scanner of Services Tax Department
PTI Oct 13, 2014, 05.53AM IST
(The service tax notice to Uber makes…)
MUMBAI: After allegedly falling foul with RBI, the US-based transport app provider Uber Inc, which offers its services to around 1,200 cab operators in India's 10 top cities, has come under the scanner of the Services Tax Department.
"We have sent a tax enquiry to Uber Inc. So far, they have not paid us a single penny in taxes. We have not sent them a demand notice as they don't have an office in the country, but are operating through their Netherlands arm," Mumbai Service Tax Commissioner SK Solanki told PTI.
When asked what is the quantum of the money they are in default of, Solanki said: "The department has not sent a demand notice to them but an enquiry, seeking clarifications.
"Their headquarters has informed us that some representative from their Netherlands office will meet us. We will issue them a demand notice after getting their response because we are not sure who is liable to pay the tax - Uber or the cabbies. But someone has to pay," he said.
Uber has become popular by offering luxury car rides for a little more than the regular fare.
The service tax notice to Uber makes it the first such demand to a foreign service provider in the e-commerce space in the country.
The San Francisco-based Uber Inc claims to be the world's largest transport app service provider by online aggregation of luxury cab operators, and has been under legal and regulatory lens in almost all the markets it operates in like the home market US, Germany, Britain, Poland, Brazil, Korea, among others. It is present in over 200 cities globally.
In August this year, the Reserve Bank had reportedly asked it to stop receiving payments with single-factor authentication from October 31, which would effectively mean that it will have to shut shop by the end of the month here.
When told that Uber claims it is not in default, Solanki said: "I don't understand how they are different from any other taxi operator like Meru, TabCab etc who all pay service tax. We are very sure that either Uber pay us the tax or cabbies do so. But getting it from some 1,200 cabbies individually is not easy."
When contacted for response, Uber communications head for APAC Region, Evelyn Tay in an email told PTI: "Uber complies with all applicable tax laws, and pays the relevant tax in every territory it operates in. All payments on the Uber system are cashless and fully traceable in an industry that has been notoriously cash-based for years."
The privately held company, set up in March 2009 by Travis Kalanick (chief executive) and Garrett Camp, has Goldman Sachs and Google Ventures among others as investors and offers vehicles for hire, ride-sharing through its app.

India draw level after Caribbeans collapseTweet
0
Kohli and Raina helped India recover.India 263 for 7 (Kohli 62, Raina 62, Dhoni 51*, Taylor 3-54) beat West Indies 215 (Smith 97, Pollard 40, Shami 4-36, Jadeja 3-44) by 48 runs
Scorecard and ball-by-ball details
Chasing 264, West Indies were coasting. Dwayne Smith had gone past his highest ODI score, and his second-wicket partnership with Kieron Pollard was assuming threatening proportions. With nine wickets in hand, a long list of batsmen waiting in the dressing room, and 128 required at exactly a run a ball, this was West Indies' match to lose. They went and lost it.
It started with the wicket of Pollard, who chased a wide ball and dragged Amit Mishra onto his stumps. From that point, West Indies imploded. On a two-paced Feroz Shah Kotla pitch, India's bowlers put the brakes on the scoring, and panic took hold of the batsmen. West Indies lost their last nine wickets for 79 runs, and their last eight for 45.
In ODI cricket, six an over is usually a doddle when you have wickets in hand and not too many runs left to get. On this pitch, however, scoring quickly wasn't easy unless you had your eye in. India had discovered this to their detriment earlier in the day, both at the start and the end of their innings.
Having opted to bat first, they had struggled to break the shackles against accurate new-ball bowling from Ravi Rampaul and, in particular, Jerome Taylor , who attacked a good-length area close to off stump and allowed the pitch to do the rest. The second-wicket pair of Ajinkya Rahane and Ambati Rayudu had looked quite ill at ease while adding 46 in 67 balls, and even Virat Kohli had taken his time to find his feet.
Suresh Raina looked fluent right from the time he walked in, however, and his front-foot stride - the surest sign that his mind isn't entirely consumed by thoughts of the short ball - was light and sure whenever the bowlers gave him half an opportunity to drive through the off side.
Raina and Kohli slowly got on top of the bowling, and began the batting Powerplay on the cusp of India's first century stand for the fourth wicket since August 2012, and the score read 163 for 3.
It looked like a launchpad to a 280-plus score, but the dismissals of Raina and Kohli, in the 37th and 41st overs, sucked the momentum out of India's innings. Without MS Dhoni's unbeaten 40-ball 51, it's unlikely India would have gotten near their total of 263, with pretty much everyone else at the other end struggling to come to terms with the surface and West Indies' adroit use of the slower ball at the death.
The wicket of Pollard caused a similar, and even more dramatic, turnaround in the tempo of West Indies' innings. Till then, Mishra had endured a frustrating evening. He had bowled a number of good balls, had had a close lbw shout against Pollard turned down, and had been picked off for three massive sixes, two of them by Pollard, and not necessarily off the middle of his bat. Having just struck his third six, he went after one tossed up wide outside off and inside-edged it onto leg stump.
Following that breakthrough, Mishra bowled 16 successive dot balls, landing everything on a good length on off stump, getting some balls to grip on the pitch and others to skid off the surface, and completely confounded Marlon Samuels , who had scored a century against this same attack three days ago.
Smith carried on fluently at the other end, picking off Kohli's wrong-footed legcutters for four fours in two overs, and launched Mohammed Shami over the long-on boundary in the first over of the batting Powerplay. In sight of his first century in ODIs and List A cricket, however, Smith received the perfect riposte from Shami, a full, fast ball that swung in a touch and cannoned off the pads and into the stumps.
The required rate crept up to over seven, and Samuels slapped a perfectly slappable long-hop from Umesh Yadav straight to cover. The spinners then discovered the turn available on the pitch, Mishra spinning one sharply to find Denesh Ramdin 's outside edge, Ravindra Jadeja doing the same to beat Andre Russell 's edge and have him brilliantly stumped by Dhoni. By this point, West Indies had been knocked out - the four wickets that remained fell in the space of 26 balls, and India won with 21 balls left to play.

P Chidambaram against lifting curbs on gold ...You are here: Home > Collections
P Chidambaram advises against lifting curbs on gold imports
PTI Oct 12, 2014, 02.19PM IST
Tags:
Congress
(Chidambaram agreed that…)
MUMBAI: Former finance minister P Chidambaram has advocated against lifting of curbs on gold imports, saying the benefits accruing from restrictions would far outweigh problems like spurt in smuggling.
"No. Not in my view," Chidambaram, who initiated these measures as the Finance Minister in the previous UPA regime in the face of a record high current account deficit (CAD), told PTI over the weekend when asked whether the time was ripe to withdraw the curbs.
The senior Congress leader was in the city to campaign in Maharashtra Assembly polls.
The CAD, which is the difference between inflow and outflow of foreign exchange , had touched an all-time high of USD 88.2 billion or 4.8 per cent of GDP in 2012-13.
The high current account deficit had led to the rupee plummeting to its all-time low of 68.80 in August last year.
On concerns like a spurt in smuggling activities, which had otherwise been checked after liberalisation, Chidambaram said the benefits of the gold import curbs are too big.
In wake of the high gold imports affecting current account deficit, the previous government had hiked the import duty on gold three times to 10 per cent and also compelled importers to export a sizeable part of the commodity under the 80:20 rule.
However, during this fiscal, there was some clarification in the 80:20 rule after a massive reduction in CAD.
According to some estimates, 200 tonnes of the precious metal will be imported into the country in the calendar year 2014.
There has been a jump in gold smuggling cases registered by enforcement agencies.
When asked if it is fair to artificially reduce CAD, Chidambaram said: "What else to do? There is no other way. I agree that CAD should be reduced by exports, but it won't happen overnight. Can we afford to spend USD 50 billion on gold imports? We cant afford it."
Chidambaram agreed that in the long-term, we should focus on pushing exports to reduce CAD but at the moment the country is left will little option.
Talking about international rating agency S&P's outlook upgrade on India, Chidambaram said that this was due to the handsome growth rate of 5.7 per cent in the first quarter.

States say direct jet fuel import to cost them Rs 2,500 cr
New Delhi: States will lose around Rs 2,500 crore in taxes annually on account of the Centre's decision of to allow domestic airline companies to directly import aviation turbine fuel (ATF).
Airlines like Kingfisher could take advantage of importing jet fuel directly.Reuters
"The direct import of ATF by aviation companies will cause a revenue loss of Rs 2,500 crore to the states. Although the Centre has protected their revenues, the move will impact revenues of states," Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi, who heads a panel of state finance ministers on GST, told reporters here.
Last month, the Centre had allowed debt-laden local airlines to import jet fuel directly, thereby enabling them to avoid sales taxes ranging between four per cent and 30 per cent levied by state governments.
Airlines, almost all of which are losing money, currently buy ATF from domestic refiners like Indian Oil Corp. Though the jet fuel is priced at parity with international rates, the actual cost to airlines is higher because of state sales tax.
Jet fuel price in India exceeds the global average by more than 50 per cent mostly due to local taxes. Some estimates suggest that direct imports could cut fuel costs by up to 20 per cent.

Wells Fargo worker s mass email goes viralWells Fargo worker asks CEO for raise in email, CC'ing hundreds of thousands
By Ben Rooney   @ben_rooney October 10, 2014: 11:54 AM ET
 
Employee asks CEO for raise, CCs 200K coworkers
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
A Wells Fargo worker decided to ask his CEO for a raise and wanted everyone at the company to know about it.
So he emailed the CEO and CC'd hundreds of thousands of his co-workers.
Now, the whole world knows about it.
The employee, Tyrel Oates, asked Wells Fargo ( WFC ) chief John Stumpf to take a stance on income inequality by offering all 300,000 employees a $10,000 raise.
Oates estimates that an across-the-board pay raise would cost the bank $3 billion, "just a small fraction of what Wells Fargo pulls in annually." In the email, a copy of which was obtained by CNNMoney, he pointed out that in the second quarter alone the bank had earned $5.7 billion.
Click here to read the email
Oates did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But he told The Charlotte Observer that he's not worried about his job.
By boosting workers' pay, Oates said Wells Fargo will "help to make its people, its family, more happy, productive, and financially stable."
Related: CEOs make 296 times more than workers
Oates urged Stumpf to consider the "positive publicity" the bank would enjoy by giving workers a raise "in a time of extreme consumer skepticism towards banks."
The bank also has an opportunity to set an example for other big corporations by making its workers' a priority. Wells Fargo could "show the rest of the United States, if not the world, that, yes, big corporations can have a heart other than philanthropic endeavors."
Related: Elizabeth Warren: 'Wealth trickles up'
The email came with the subject line "income inequality" was marked "high" importance. The list of recipients was 15 pages long and included individual Wells Fargo employees and distribution groups. The Observer estimates that 200,000 employees were copied.
A Wells Fargo spokeswoman said the bank offers its employees "market competitive compensation" that includes base pay, benefits and other "career-development opportunities." The bank added that the pay it offers "significantly exceed" federal minimums.
Oates acknowledges that Wells Fargo offers pretty good benefits like 401(K).
He also acknowledges that he works at a bank that is extremely profitable. However, Oates points out the profits are not evenly shared among employees and that with the exception of upper management, the majority of workers barely make enough to live comfortably on their own income.
He ends his email with a clarion call to his co-workers: "It is time that we ask, no, it is time that we demand to be rightfully compensated for the hard work that we accomplish ... And while the voice of one person in a world as large as ours may seem only like a whisper, the combined voices of each and all of us can move mountains!"

Stocks should fall more. You shouldn t worryBy Paul R. La Monica   @lamonicabuzz October 10, 2014: 4:40 PM ET
 
The market suffers from whiplash
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
It looks like the streak of big gains for stocks following huge losses is over.
The broader market was down again Friday. The Dow suffered another triple-digit loss, dropping 115 points. The S&P 500 fell more than 1%.
And tech stocks really took it in the chin. The Nasdaq also dropped more than 100 points, a decline of more than 2%. Intel ( INTC , Tech30 ), Facebook ( FB , Tech30 ), Cisco ( CSCO , Tech30 ), Microsoft ( MSFT , Tech30 ) and many other stocks in CNNMoney's Tech 30 index fell sharply.
It's been a rough start to October. Volatility is back with a vengeance and white-knuckled investors are worried that the recent sell-off is going to get worse. CNNMoney's Fear & Greed Index hit 1 on Friday. It can't go lower than 0.
But do you know what? Stocks probably should fall further in the short-term.
Let's put things in perspective. The Dow is only 4% below its all-time high from September 19. The S&P 500 is about 5% below its record high -- also set that day.
If those records turn out to be a market top for the foreseeable future, people will point to Alibaba's ( BABA , Tech30 ) red hot initial public offering that day as Exhibit A for how "irrationally exuberant" (You can call me Al ... Greenspan) stocks had become.
Related: Strategists still expect small gains for stocks this year
Many experts believe that the market is long overdue for what's known as a correction. That's a 10% pullback from a recent peak. The last correction took place in 2011. The market did get within a whisker of a correction in the spring of 2012. The S&P 500 fell 9.94% between April 2 and June 1 of that year.
Why should stocks go even lower though? Beyond the fact that the market eventually needs to obey the law of gravity, there are legitimate concerns facing investors right now. Here are five that shouldn't come as any surprise.
1. Earnings for the third quarter are expected to be good, but not great. Ditto for fourth quarter guidance.
2. The Federal Reserve will almost certainly announce later this month that it is finally ending its policy of "quantitative easing" -- purchasing billions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities.
What is your best investment? Share your story with CNN
QE has helped keep long-term rates low. It has been the financial equivalent of human growth hormones, steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs. So it's understandable for investors to be concerned about how the market will do after being "juiced" by the Fed for nearly six years.
3. The Fed is also expected to begin raising interest rates sometime in 2015. It hasn't hiked rates since December 2008. A whole generation of new traders and investors have no idea what it's like to invest while the Fed is tightening. That could be a problem.
Related: Are stocks a trick or treat?
4. Europe is an economic mess. China is showing signs of a slowdown. That will hurt corporate profits for big U.S. firms and could also spill over to the broader economy. We all should have learned by now that decoupling is a myth. The U.S. can't outgrow the rest of the world indefinitely when two of its major trading partners are struggling.
5. The world is a scary place right now. Ebola, ISIS and the Russia-Ukraine situation are all things that were not on many people's radar at the start of 2014. But they are constantly in the headlines now. So all three of them could classify as a "Black Swan" -- an event that came out of nowhere to disrupt the markets.
Take a deep breath and relax. Now all of this may sound unsettling. But it doesn't mean that stocks are likely to crash. Even if a correction happens soon, that does not mean that it has to be the beginning of a bear market.
I've already mentioned that the market's last correction was in 2011 and that stocks flirted with one in 2012. There was also a correction in 2010. But what happened after all those pullbacks? Stocks eventually bounced back and hit new highs.
 
Boo! October is often scary for stocks
This is not to suggest that you should just shrug off the recent concerns plaguing the market. Quite the contrary.
It's actually a good sign that investors are no longer complacent and ignoring bad news. People should be worried and stocks should be pulling back.
But this dip should help restore some normalcy to the market. Stocks will trade at more reasonable prices as investors adjust their expectations for earnings and economic growth.
None of that is bad. It's healthy. I'd be a lot more worried if the Dow and S&P 500 were still at all-time highs. The market has finally woken up and smelled the proverbial coffee. It's about time.

Snapchat isn t private. Period.By Jose Pagliery   @Jose_Pagliery October 10, 2014: 4:52 PM ET
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
The photo-sharing app Snapchat offers a false sense of privacy by promising it will erase photos.
In fact, numerous third-party apps like SaveSnap, SnapBox and SnapSpy offer users the ability to save incoming photos.
Their mere existence undermines Snapchat's purpose. And if these third-party apps are unsafe, Snapchat is too. An Internet storm brewing Friday offered a prime example.
One of those third-party services was supposedly hacked, according to Business Insider . Misfits on the image-sharing website 4chan.org claim they hacked into a third-party app and stole 100,000 photos and videos.
This collection, which might be published this weekend, is likely to include child pornography. Snapchat is popular as a tool for sending nude images. And half of its users are teenagers between the ages of 13 and 17.
"Everyone who sends a message using Snapchat's service could be at risk," said Patrick Wardle, research director at security firm Synack .
Related: Naked celeb hack shows 'delete' doesn't mean delete
Snapchat is adamant that its servers were not hacked. But that doesn't matter, because there's a hole in their entire system.
Computer security experts already reject the Snapchat platform. Critics have previously noted that anyone can take a screenshot of an incoming photo -- or use a separate camera to take a picture of the screen.
But the hack of third-party apps reveals another flaw in Snapchat's platform -- and questions the company's commitment to security, according to computer security researcher Jonathan Zdziarski .
One, Snapchat isn't doing enough to protect its software. That's why third-party apps can essentially hack its platform. Two, Snapchat hasn't succeeded in convincing Apple and Google to keep what are essentially "Snapchat hacks" out of their app stores.
 
What is Snapchat?
Neither Apple ( AAPL , Tech30 ) nor Google ( GOOG ) responded to questions about the matter.
Snapchat did not explain why others are so easily able to reverse engineer the company's software and thwart its privacy features.
Chris Wysopal, cofounder of security firm Veracode , said Snapchat should try to ban these third-party apps.

Kmart says payment systems hackedKmart says payment systems hacked
By Melvin Backman   @CNNTech October 10, 2014: 7:21 PM ET
Shoppers wait for a Kmart to open on Thanksgiving night 2012 in Griffith, Indiana.
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
Kmart said Friday that its payment system had been compromised by malware since early September.
The bug affected shoppers in the company's physical stores, and it compromised an unspecified number of credit and debit card numbers. It also said kmart.com and Sears customers were not targeted.
Kmart said affected customers who reported any fraudulent purchases would not be liable if they reported the activity in a timely manner, though it did not give a specific time frame. It will also pay for credit monitoring services.

MNS candidate could ve committed rape after polls'MNS candidate could've committed rape after polls'
Yogesh Joshi , Hindustan Times  Pune, October 11, 2014
First Published: 16:05 IST(11/10/2014) | Last Updated: 00:58 IST(12/10/2014)
Comments
The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader and former home minister RR Patil while commenting on rival MNS candidate's criminal background said he should have committed rape at least after elections.
Patil's comments, caught on camera, sparked a major controversy with rivals lapping it up to turn the heat against Patil and NCP.
Patil has been facing a bitter electoral battle from Kawathe-Mahankal assembly constituency with BJP nominee Ajit Ghorpade posing a major challenge.
The controversial remarks made the by former home minister came on Thursday while he was addressing a public meeting in Kawathe-Ekand, in Sangli district.
In the meeting, Patil narrated morning's incident about his meeting with the supporters of Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) candidate Sudhakar Khade.
According to Patil, these supporters had come to extend their support as Khade was behind the bars facing rape and molestation charges.
Addressing the crowd, Patil said, "Supporters of MNS candidate had come to meet me to extend their support since their own candidate is behind bars. I told them, if he wanted to contest elections to become a legislator, he should have committed rape at least after the elections."
Realizing that his remarks may cause immense damage especially when assembly elections are just four days away, Patil expressed regrets. "My comments were of satirical nature. I regret if anyone feels hurt. I have no intentions to insult women."
Patil added saying his comments were directed at MNS candidate who has criminal background. Khade, a history sheeter is contesting elections on MNS ticket though he was previously with Shiv Sena. Khade was first accused of rape in 2007. In 2011, he was charged in another rape and molestation case.
Criticizing Patil, Sanjay Patil, a BJP MP from Sangli said, "People like Patil have always taken names of Shahu-Phule-Ambedkar. Today they have been exposed before the society."
Found cornered over party nominee's criminal background, MNS leader Bala Nandgaonkar said, "Person at stature of RR Patil should have thought twice while commenting against MNS candidate who has been falsely implicated in criminal cases."
Previously too Patil was surrounded by controversy when his remarks in the aftermath of 26/11 Mumbai drew severe criticism. Patil was accused of downplaying the severity of attacks saying, "In big cities like this, small things do happen." His comments attracted flack eventually forcing him to resign as home minister.

heads of state
With an aim of giving a boost to India’s relations with Scandinavian countries, President Pranab Mukherjee on Sunday left on a tour of Norway, the first by the Head of State, and Finland during which efforts will be made to attract investment from Norway to India.
Accompanied by Union Minister of State for Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises Pon Radhakrishnan, the highlight of Mr. Mukherjee’s visit to the two nations will be that he would be crossing the Arctic Circle and visiting the village of Santa Claus before he returns to India on Friday.
He was given a ceremonial send off at Rashtrapati Bhavan by Vice-President Hamid Ansari, Minister of Human Resource Development Smriti Irani, Lt. Governor of Delhi Najeeb Jung and the three service Chiefs.
The focus of the visit would be work out a mechanism for attracting investment from Norway to India in the infrastructure sector and other areas.
At present a meagre four billion dollar of investment of the 850 billion dollar Norwegian Pension Fund flows to India, said Secretary (West), MEA, Navtej Sarna.
But there is a commitment to raise it to 20 billion to 40 billion dollars, “and we want to see how we can push that further and with which sectors we can do that,” he said.
The Norwegian Pension fund, earlier knows as ‘Oil fund’, is a result of large state revenues from petroleum activities which resulted in substantial financial assets.
Started in 1990 to help in long-term and sound management of the Fund, it also helps to ensure that both present and future generations can benefit from Norway’s petroleum wealth.
As Norway is the world’s third largest exporters of hydrocarbons in the world and has huge reserves of oil and gas, the President, before his departure, had a meeting with businessmen and industrialists to understand how India could be benefited from the Scandinavian nation.
Norway is a source of modern technologies in exploration and drilling besides being having tremendous ship-building expertise.
“These are some things which we have to look at,” Mr. Sarna said.
A number of agreements would be signed during the visit which will cover the fields of education, trade and cooperation in several other areas including Earth Sciences.
Norway has given unconditional support for India’s candidature in the Arctic Council as an observer. There are 12 non-Arctic countries which have been admitted as observers to the Arctic Council.
India has a station ‘Himadri’, located in the middle of North Pole and Norway.
“The tremendous interest in earth sciences comes from the fact that whatever happens in the Arctic affects us immediately in terms of climate change, in terms of predictability of monsoons, in terms of various other natural phenomena which happen up there and have to researched,” Mr. Sarna said.
“We have recently put up a deep-sea probe up beyond towards the North Pole which is playing a very critical role in this research,” Mr. Sarna added.
India finds Norway as an important country in the international fora. Although Norway is not a member of the European Union, it is very active in the international arena.
Norway has expressed support for expansion of permanent and non-permanent Security Council as well as for India’s candidature for permanent membership.
“This is something which again we will be pushing with Norway and seeking their support for India to get its rightful place in other international fora,” he said.
In the second leg of his tour, Mr. Mukherjee will reach Finland on October 14 where the Mayor of Helsinki will host a lunch for the President.
“There will be meetings of the business delegation and the Indian community. There will be a visit to the Parliament of Finland where he meets the Speaker and other Parliamentarians. He will also lay a wreath at the Hietaniemi Cemetery which is a national monument for people who lost their lives in the wars,” Mr. Sarna said.
He said the President would visit a town which is across the Arctic Circle, the first time that the President of India actually steps across the Arctic Circle.
“The town is called Rovaniemi. This is an actual village. There is a Santa Claus post office, there is a Santa Claus house and various things,” he said.
He said Finland has been very supportive of India on the Nuclear Suppliers Group issue, in the IAEA, on UN Security Council reforms, as well as for India’s entry into the Arctic Council.
The two countries hope to sign a number of agreements once again covering education, energy, fishing etc on government-to-government, business-to-business as well as institution-to-institution. “Finland is also one of the countries which has already been listed for waiver of diplomatic official passport holders for visa purposes,” he said.
The President returns to India on October 17.

Sunday ET | Enter the curious world of censu...Chhabria’s story is inevitably linked with that of two other men — United Spirits chairman Vijay Mallya and Chhabria’s elder brother, the late Manu Chhabria.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
Kishore Rajaram Chhabria, 59, loves being driven across the United States. In September, Chhabria along with wife Bina travelled more than 500 km between two small American towns, Barnard in Vermont and Bedford in Pennsylvania, staying in hotels for several days in both towns. Empty roads and lonely towns inspire Chhabria.
The sense of emptiness helps him "strategize", he says. Though a frequent visitor to the US, Chhabria does not own a house there and prefers hiring chauffeur-driven cars. Left-hand-drives confuse him. For Chhabria — the businessman — this is the right time for strategizing. A lot is at stake. His company Allied Blenders and Distillers (ABD), which owns Officer's Choice, the world's largest selling whiskey brand by volume, has blueprinted an aggressive growth plan. It includes the buyout of a competing brand, acquisition of distilleries and bottling units, heavy borrowing to fuel this binge, and finally, a public issue of shares in two years.
Chhabria's story is inevitably linked with that of two other men — United Spirits chairman Vijay Mallya and Chhabria's elder brother, the late Manu Chhabria. The trio has over the last three decades joined hands and fallen out many times (see The Liquor Wars). Manu Chhabria passed away in 2002, and his family sold the liquor business to Mallya. Mallya has since handed over management control of his liquor business to Diageo and is struggling to hold on to his board seat and chairmanship. Only Kishore Chhabria , with Officer's Choice, which accounts for 75% of ABD's sales by volume, has the luxury to plan growth or take time off in never-heard-of towns in the US, which are almost cathartic for him.
Old-World Style
In India, Chhabria seems to have wrapped himself up in familiarity and tradition. Chhabria loves to be unconventional, in an industry where flamboyance is the convention. At home, which is Casa Grande on Little Gibbs Road, near south Mumbai's Hanging Gardens, Chhabria prefers an old-world style. His office is in the same building as his residence, and he is surrounded by a group of old faithful and some anachronisms like CCTV cameras monitoring every room in the office with the monitor placed directly in front of his table. The office decor is anything but modern, and the drapes and chandeliers may even qualify as opulent.
"I have married only once. Bala (VR Balakrishnan), my secretary, was earlier my father's secretary. My cook has been around for 36 years and my driver for 27 years. Once I grab hold of a person I rarely let go," Chhabria says. Chhabria's company ABD is the third largest maker of Indian-made foreign liquor (IMFL, the rather curious contraction used by governments to differentiate liquor made in the organised sector from indigenous hooch). An 8% market share in IMFL makes ABD one of the largest Indian-owned liquor businesses. The corporate office is at Lower Parel, in a spanking new building, where the company's CEO Deepak Roy sits. Roy, an industry veteran who has also worked with Mallya in the past, has been allotted 5% sweat equity in the company by Chhabria, who owns the rest. Chhabria's son-in-law Jeetu Hemdev, who is married to his elder daughter, works under Roy.
Chhabria confesses that he never encouraged either of his two daughters to take an interest in his business. "In hindsight, I can admit I was wrong. I thought liquor was not a good business for women," he offers.

Neck-deep in loss  AI spends $6 m to insure 6 grounded planesAir India spends $6 mn to insure 6 grounded planes
Press Trust of India | Mumbai Oct 13, 2014 12:38 AM IST
Government carrier Air India, sitting on a huge debt pile and surviving on a Rs 30,000- crore government bailout, is allegedly getting even those aircraft not in operations for some years, insured at a cost of $6 million a year. The airline's recognised pilots union, the Indian Commercial Pilots Association (ICPA), has sought an independent probe into these allegations and fix accountability on individuals responsible.
"Six Boeing 737-200 Fs, out of service for more than three years, are still being insured at $1 million each per annum, for more than the past three years. We demand an immediate, time-bound investigation by an external agency to look into this huge financial irregularity," ICPA General Secretary Shailender Singh said in a letter to AI Chairman Rohit Nandan.
The letter is also addressed to Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathy Raju and the Chief Vigilance Commissioner.
The AI spokesperson did not respond to calls.
The airline had renewed its insurance on October 1 for nearly $29 million to cover its 132 aircraft (including the 17 of AI Express and 8 of Alliance Air,) close to 18 per cent higher than it what it paid last year, $23 million. Airline insurance premia had gone up this year after a string of tragedies across the globe. Alleging that even as recent as on October 1, the insurance cover for four of these aircraft was renewed for another year at $50,000 each, the ICPA said, "We are also alarmed at the sharp 95 per cent drop in the insured sum of these aircraft, which till September 30 were insured for $10,00,000 and now only for $50,000."

Anti-Naxal operations: Local detonating wire bleeding security forcesnational security
An easily available ‘detonating wire’, commonly used in mining operations, has been found to be the catalyst behind numerous deadly IED blasts by Naxals in the red corridors of the country.
Security agencies undertaking anti-Naxal operations are now mulling options to somehow restrict or regulate the sale and usage of the “Cordtex wire” which they say has found recent prominence among Naxal cadres to set up chain Improvised Explosive Device (IED) blasts in killing and maiming security personnel and sometimes even civilians, who inadvertently get trapped into these death traps.
“The Naxals are using the Cordtex wire to set up and trigger IEDs containing as many as 250-300 locally made bombs in one go. The phenomenon is called ‘daisychain’ and this wire acts as a catalyst. A number of IED blasts have been conducted by the ultras using this,” a senior officer deployed in the Left Wing Extremism (LWE) theatre said, quoting an analysis report prepared in this regard.
A regular Cordtex wire is prepared by embedding explosives and is covered in a plastic sheath which makes it act like a catalyst for blasting explosives inter-twined with its charge ends.
“Its (Cordtex) local variants are much easy to obtain and hence its misuse by Maoist cadres is leading to fatal causalities among security forces,” the officer said.
Leading anti-Naxal operations force of the country CRPF has also raised an alarm over its increasing use in conducting IED blasts by Naxals and it has recently issued directives to its operational units on the ground to check against its pilferage and study its characteristics.
“The local commanders of security forces like CRPF have been asked to take up the issue with local mining and state government authorities to check against the pilferage of these wires. They have also been instructed to make sure that the bomb disposal teams in their respective units know what a Cordtex wire is,” the officer said.
The IED blasts are the biggest threat to life for security forces operating in these difficult red theatres and in the past there have been numerous incidents where such blasts claimed a number of lives and even led to the amputation of limbs of troops of state police forces and those from paramilitary contingents like CRPF.
Hundreds of personnel have been killed due to IED blasts and the usage of mine-protected vehicles or movement on foot by troops have also not been able to stop these incidents totally.
“The Naxals are not able to loot weapons of the security forces over a period of time and hence they are now using chain IED explosions to kill and maim security personnel and then scamper with their arms and ammunition,” another officer deployed in the Naxal hotbed of Sukma in Chhattisgarh said.
According to a recent blueprint prepared by the CRPF, the paramilitary has decided to increase the number of its bomb disposal squads in each of its anti-Naxal operations battalion and for this specific purpose the force has also increased seats for its officials to learn counter-IED techniques at its niche institute in Pune.

India may have to wait for automatic exchange of Swiss information

(India may have to wait longer…)
NEW DELHI/BERNE: India may have to wait longer for joining "selected" countries with whom Switzerland plans to do automatic exchange of information on tax matters, even as Indian and Swiss officials will meet soon to iron out their bilateral arrangements on suspected tax evasion cases.
Switzerland has started a process for putting in place a mechanism for automatic exchange of tax information with foreign jurisdictions, but in the initial phase, the Alpine nation has decided to focus only on European Union and the US .
"The primary focus is on the European Union (EU) and its member states, as well as the United States. Negotiations on the automatic exchange of information with other selected countries are to be examined," a Swiss Federal Department of Finance spokesperson told PTI from Berne.
The response was to a query on whether India would also be among the countries with which Switzerland would start discussions in the initial phase.
The spokesperson further elaborated that initially the focus would be on countries having close economic and political ties with Switzerland, but did not name India.
"In an initial phase, consideration would be given to countries with which there are close economic and political ties and which provide their taxpayers with sufficient scope for regularisation and which are considered to be important and promising in terms of their market potential for Switzerland's financial industry," the official added.
Swiss Federal Council, on October 8, adopted definitive negotiation mandates for introducing the new global standard for the automatic exchange of information in tax matters with other countries.
The new Indian government, which assumed office in May, has stated that all efforts would be made to bring back the alleged black money parked by its citizens abroad, including in Swiss banks.
A meeting is likely to take place in "coming weeks" between Indian and Swiss officials in connection with India's efforts to convince Switzerland to share details about suspected tax evaders who might have accounts in Swiss banks.
Indian and Swiss authorities have been in talks for quite some time on the matter of alleged black money parked by Indian citizens in banks in Switzerland.
The Swiss Finance Ministry spokesperson recently confirmed that a meeting is expected in the coming weeks, but did not disclose any further details.
The new automatic information exchange framework is being put in place close on the heels of G-20 nations, including India, approving a mechanism for such cooperation between different countries and India is one of the early adopters of this framework prepared by Paris-based think tank OECD.
"The effectiveness of AEOI (Automatic Exchange of Information) will come only when the standard is translated into domestic legislations and hardware in banks' IT. This means that AEOI will take place in 2017 at the earliest," Pascal Saint-Amans, Director of the OECD Centre for Tax Policy and Administration, had said in May.
During that month, 47 countries, including India and Switzerland, agreed to this automatic exchange mechanism.
The new standard provides for exchange of information on bank account balances, interests, dividends, other financial income and sales proceeds to compute possible capital gains.
Latest data from the Swiss National Bank shows that total money held by Indians jumped to Rs Rs 14,100 crore in 2013 as compared to Rs 8,547 crore a year ago.
Following amendments to their Double Taxation Avoidance Convention (DTAC) in October 2011, India has made several requests seeking information about its nationals holding bank accounts in Swiss banks.
However, Swiss authorities have been refusing to share information on names procured by India through other countries, namely France and Germany, saying that they figured in lists stolen by certain ex-employees of concerned banks.
Switzerland says that bank account details cannot be shared on the basis of illegally obtained information.
In July, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had informed Parliament that Switzerland has raised some legal issues with regard to providing details of Indian citizens who have parked illegal funds in Swiss banks.
Asserting that the government was making all efforts to get details of such accounts, Jaitley had also said it was collecting evidence in this regard.
A Special Investigation Team (SIT), chaired by former Supreme Court judge Justice M B Shah, is looking into the menace of black money.
Meanwhile, Swiss government has said that the new international standard on automatic exchange of tax information would allow for a level playing field in the competition between financial centres besides being an important instrument to combat tax evasion.
However, it has maintained that domestic bank client confidentiality would not be affected by the implementation of the new global standard.
"There is to be only one global standard, the exchanged information should be used solely for the agreed purpose (principle of speciality), the information should be reciprocal, i.e. should flow in both directions, data protection must be ensured and the beneficial owners of trusts and other financial constructs should also be identified," the Swiss government had said in a statement on October 8.

Kingfisher Airlines faces scrutiny for accou...Kingfisher Airlines faces scrutiny for accounting lapses

(The airline, part of Vijay…)
NEW DELHI: Grounded carrier Kingfisher Airlines is facing a close regulatory scrutiny over suspected lapses in its accounting practices and the Corporate Affairs Ministry is looking into possible violations of Companies Act.
The airline, part of Vijay Mallya-led UB Group , has been grounded since October 2012, after being bogged down by huge and mounting losses.
The Ministry is closely looking at possible violations of companies law by Kingfisher Airlines, especially with regard to accounting practices, sources said.
Taking note of the observations made by the carrier's statutory auditors, the Ministry has also sought an update from the Registrar of Companies (RoC) about the financial aspects of the company for the 2013-14 financial year.
The carrier, which is registered with RoC Bangalore, is yet to submit its annual financial results for the 2013-14 period to the stock exchanges.
In a filing to the BSE on August 26, the carrier had said that steps were being taken to appoint directors in order to comply with provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 and listing agreement with the stock exchanges.
"Thereafter, steps will be taken towards publishing the audited results for the year ended March 31, 2014 and for the quarter ended June 30, 2014," it had said.
Back in May, Kingfisher had informed stock exchanges that "there are hardly any employees attending office and the company is currently operating with skeletal staff making it difficult to audit and publish the results in time."
For the year ended March 2013, the carrier saw its net loss widen to Rs 4,301.12 crore. During that period, the gross income stood at Rs 683.46 crore.
In September, state-owned United Bank of India had declared Kingfisher Airlines, its promoter Vijay Mallya and other directors as wilful defaulters but the decision is currently stayed by the Calcutta High Court.
UBI's exposure to Kingfisher Airlines was around Rs 350 crore as part of consortium led by State Bank of India.
The consortium of 17 banks, has an outstanding debt of about Rs 6,521 crore from the now-grounded carrier and outside the consortium, the bank gave about Rs 60 crore loan for pre-delivery payment.
As part of the recovery process, banks in February last year decided to sell a portion of the collateral with them, including shares of its group companies United Spirits Ltd and Mangalore Chemicals & Fertilizers Ltd, Mallya's Goa villa, Kingfisher House in Mumbai and the Kingfisher brand, which was valued at over Rs 4,000 crore at the time it was pledged.

Deal activity jumps 22% in first 9 months to $36.2 billion

(During January-September…)
MUMBAI: The overall deal activity in the country grew 22 per cent in the first nine months of the year to $ 36.2 billion with the total number of deals at 886, according to Grant Thornton report.
The total volume of deals done in the same period of 2013 stood at $ 29.7 billion with 694 deals, according to Grant Thornton's quarterly dealtracker report.
"While the year began on a rather cautionary note, the deal pace started picking up in the months closer to the elections and the momentum kept increasing thereafter, signalling positive vibes for the months and quarters to come," Grant Thornton India partner Raja Lahiri said in the report.
During January-September period, the total number of merger and acquisitions that took place stood at 441, worth $ 27.817 billion. In the similar period, the total merger and acquisition was $ 21.699 billion with 372 deals.
During the period, the PE deals were worth $ 8.45 billion and their number stood at 445.
Inbound merger and acquisition deals stood at $ 9.698 billion with 129 deals in the first nine months as against $ 5.685 billion with 103 deals in the year ago period.
The report said there is a continuous uptick in private equity deal values and volumes, with over 50 percent deal volume from private equity/venture capital investments alone.
Lahiri said an increase across segments from domestic, inbound, outbound to private equity in both values and volumes implies a revival in business sentiments and investment climate.
"We have seen merger and acquisition values driven by the pharma sector with deals such as Sun-Ranbaxy merger indicating the consolidation trend in the sector, and GlaxoSmithKline consolidating operations by hiking the stake in the domestic subsidiary," Lahiri said.
"We have seen merger and acquisition values driven by the pharma sector with deals such as Sun-Ranbaxy merger indicating the consolidation trend in the sector, and GlaxoSmithKline consolidating operations by hiking the stake in the domestic subsidiary," Lahiri said.
Moreover, with close to a 40 percent increase in investment volumes over 2013, private equity deals have contributed 50 per cent of total deal volumes in 2014 driven by the technology sector.
Key deals in the technology sector include Cognizant acquiring US based Trizetto for $ 2.7 billion, Flipkart-Myntra acquisition for $ 340 million.
The report said the PE investment continues to be driven by the e-commerce sector led by the billion dollar investment into Flipkart.
Sectors which are expected to see renewed deal activity include infrastructure, energy, consumer and financial services.
"We expect valuations to go up given the renewed business sentiments which in our view, would be both a challenge and an opportunity for dealmakers to close deals in the coming quarters," Lahiri said.
"We believe that this momentum of deal activity will continue to increase and we look forward to closing the year on a high note," he said.

NCPs corruption will surge again if voted to power: Modielection
Making a scathing attack on NCP, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said that if the Sharad Pawar-led party is voted to power again, it will further increase its “corrupt activities.”
“NCP is naturally corrupt. Since the time the party was born nothing has changed, their leaders have remained the same. Do you know what their clock (party symbol) means? The clock shows 10 minutes to 10 which means in 10 years they have increased their corrupt activities 10 times,” he said.
Addressing a poll rally at Pandharpur town in Maharashtra’s Solapur district, he said, “If they (NCP) are voted to power once again, they will now increase their corruption 15 times.”
Mr. Modi also did not spare the Congress, saying he is keeping a watchful eye on the country’s coffers sitting at the Centre, and won’t let any “panja” (Congress’ party symbol ’hand’) touch the treasury.
The year 2014 marks the end of Congress and NCP era in the state, he said.
Charging that the Congress and the NCP together “destroyed” the state during their rule, the Prime Minister urged the people to “wipe” out both parties from state politics.
“They have destroyed Maharashtra during their rule and emptied whatever money the state had. There is still time left. Wipe them out from state politics, and I assure you I will leave no stone unturned in helping you realise your dreams,” Mr. Modi said.
“Monday is the final day of campaigning. And this year marks the end of Congress and their allies. They think they are so powerful that they can keep people in their pockets and dream of being voted to power again and again. But they should know when the mood of public changes, no one will be spared,” Mr. Modi said.
He said though thousands of farmers have been committing suicide in the state every year, the then ruling party did not once blink and shared their (farmers’) woes, he said.
“Every year 3,700 farmers commit suicide in this state. But they (the former Congress-NCP government) did not even have a tear in their eye. Did the farmers demand a bungalow, car, tractor, scooter or a cycle? They only wanted water, which you could not give them,” Mr. Modi said.
Listing out an elaborate plan to prevent farmers’ suicides, he said, “There are some rivers that overflow each year and some that remain dry. It is my dream to connect all these rives so that water can be diverted to rivers that do not get sufficient water. This way my farmer will get all the water that he requires.”
The BJP is eager to start big ticket projects in the state, which would help generate employment, he said.
“Wherever there are three sons in a family, two are sent to cities to earn their livelihood. If there are no industries, how will our youth earn their living? I want to start infrastructure projects here and develop industries so that youth can earn a comfortable living,” he said.

The BSE benchmark Sensex on Friday fell nearly 340 points, its biggest fall in over two weeks, due to across-the-board losses in blue chips amid a global sell-off on economic growth concerns, although software firm Infosys Ltd surged 6.68% on smart Q2 earnings.
The 30-share barometer, which had gained 390.49 points yesterday, fell by 339.90 points, or 1.28%, to 26,297.38, with all the sectoral indices, except IT and technology, ending in negative zone with losses up to 4%.
On similar lines, the National Stock Exchange index Nifty struggled to maintain the 7,900-mark and ended 100.60 points, or 1.26%, down at 7,859.95 after dipping to 7,848.45 during the session.
Brokers said besides profit-booking by speculators, a lower closing on other Asian markets and a subdued opening of the european mkarkets on growing concerns about the global economy as the head of the IMF warned that Euro-zone could slip into recession, influenced the trading sentiment at Mumbai.
They said, however, rally in Infosys on the back of good second quarter earnings, cushioned the fall in the benchmark Sensex.
Shares of IT major Infosys surged 6.68% to close at 3,888.95 after the company posted 28.6% jump in consolidated net profit for the quarter ended September 30, and declared bonus issue in the ratio of one share for every share held.
Of the 30 Sensex shares, 23 shares ended with losses led by Tata Motors (down 5.3%), Hindalco (4.79%) and Sesa Sterlite (4.60%).
Sectorwise, the metal index suffered the most by losing 4.11%, followed by auto index by 2.78%, FMCG index 2.56%, Banking index closed 1.80% lower.
Bucking the trend, IT index rose 2.29%, while Teck index gained 1.17%.
Meanwhile, provisional data released by stock exchanges showed foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) sold shares worth a net Rs. 20.89 crore on Thursday.

Former IPL Commissioner Lalit Modi was on Saturday unceremoniously ousted from the president’s post of the Rajasthan Cricket Association (RCA) with a rebel group led by local BJP leader Amin Pathan taking over the reins.
On a day of hectic developments, Pathan was elected as the Acting president by the majority of the members in an extraordinary general body meeting, bringing a dramatic end to Modi’s tenure almost five months after he was elected to the top post.
It is learnt that 23 out of the 33 district cricket associations of RCA supported the move to remove Modi, who has been banned for life by the BCCI but came back as the chief of state association with an overwhelming majority in May this year.
With BCCI imposing a ban on RCA following Modi’s election as its president, there was an impasse on the future of state’s cricketers on their participation in the BCCI affiliated tournaments.
Modi’s sudden ouster also paves the way for RCA’s smooth return into the BCCI fold. It will also ensure regular annual grants for the body as well as Sawai Man Singh Stadium getting its quota of IPL and international matches.
In view of the stalemate, Rajasthan High Court, in a recent judgement, formed an Ad-Hoc body of three separate selection committees to choose the various state teams for BCCI tournaments.
However, with RCA still remaining banned by the BCCI which hampered its smooth functioning, there was an unrest among members with a lot people supporting Pathan, a BJP leader from Kota, who is also the district association president from the region.
It is also learnt from sources that Pathan had the backing of the Vasundhara Raje Scindia led state government which wanted the RCA to function smoothly with the co-operation of the BCCI.
“We passed a no—confidence motion against Lalit Modi today. 23 out of the 33 district cricket associations of RCA supported the move to remove Modi. In the meeting we also removed Pawan Goyal (treasurer) and Mehmood Abdi (Deputy president),” Pathan said after the meeting.
“Tomorrow we will go to the BCCI and seek their advice on the future course of action,” he said.
He said that the players will be able to play in various domestic tournaments.
“The teams will represent Rajasthan, but not under the usual banner of the Rajasthan Cricket Association. But the players’ future would not get hampered,” he said.
The elections in RCA was held in December last year but the results were announced only in May this year in the wake of a prolonged legal tussle.
The BCCI had banned Modi after its disciplinary committee found him guilty. The former IPL boss was accused of misappropriation of funds during the second and third editions of the cash-rich league.
While Modi’s confidante Mahmood Abdi ran the show and took up the battle for his boss with the BCCI convincing 75 players of various age-group to file a case against BCCI, four of the prominent cricketers including a former India U-19 captain, a Test player and an India A player along with an IPL player did not sign on the dotted lines making it clear that all was not well within the RCA.
“Four senior players Pankaj Singh (Test), Ashok Menaria, (U-19 and India A), Robin Bist (India A) and Dishant Yagnik (Rajasthan Royals) did not sign the legal document when RCA moved court against BCCI. So it’s not that all players were happy with the functioning of current regime,” a top RCA official said.
Repeated calls to Abdi went unanswered, while no other member close to Modi was willing to comment on the development.
It is also learnt that BCCI’s convenor for Rajasthan Amrit Mathur visited Jaipur a few days back to take stock of the situation and also spoke to the anti-Modi group.
“It wasn’t a sudden move as it was done with a lot of thinking and anti-Modi faction kept BCCI in the loop”, the official said.
BCCI’s GM (Game Development) Ratnakar Shetty reached the city to finalise the dates of the selection committee meetings as well as inform that RCA will be able to host all its home Ranji Trophy matches in the state.
While there are possibilities that Modi and Abdi might take legal recourse against this move, the ruling group is planning to hold an election and come to power with proper mandate in a few months time.

HYDERABAD: An economic offences court here has issued summonses to Satyam Computer Services founder Ramalinga Raju , his brother Rama Raju and three former senior executives among others, to appear before it on November 13 in connection with complaints by capital market regulator SEBI.
Based on two complaints filed in August by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) on alleged unfair trade practices adopted by Raju and alleged violations of the insider trading regulations committed by him and others, the court issued notices on Friday.
Earlier, the market regulator had slapped a penalty of Rs 1,849 crore plus 12 per cent interest per annum on them, besides banning the accused from the market for 14 years.
SEBI filed the complaints in the economic offences Court urging the court to punish the accused Raju brothers and CFO Vadlamani Srinivas , besides two former auditors of global auditing firm PWC, which allegedly helped perpetrate the country's biggest corporate fraud, among others.
B S Siva Prasad is standing counsel for SEBI. According to SEBI complaints, the accused are punishable under Section 24 (a) under SEBI Act which carries punishment upto 10 years. The first complaint has eight people as accused and the other has 14 people and entities as accused.
On January 7, 2009, Raju, the then Chairman of Satyam Computers had sent an email to SEBI, wherein he admitted and confessed to inflating the company's cash and bank balances, besides understating liabilities and other financial mis-statements.
After the fraud came to the light, the government had ordered an auction for sale of the company in the interest of investors and employees of what was known at that time as the country's fourth largest infotech firm.
The company was acquired by Tech Mahindra, then renamed as Mahindra Satyam and eventually it was merged with Tech Mahindra.
According to SEBI, Raju brothers made 'unlawful gains' to the tune of Rs 543.93 crore from sales of shares and Rs 1,258.88 crore, by way of pledging of some shares.

ISIS in fresh Sebi missive on caution against terror outfits
PTI Oct 12, 2014, 04.33PM IST
("Members are advised to…)
NEW DELHI: In a fresh list of terror outfits circulated by regulator Sebi to the stock exchanges, market entities have been asked to stay cautious about any funds or entities linked to the infamous ISIS (Islamic State in Iraq and Syria) finding their way to Indian capital markets.
While no instance of any ISIS-linked activities in the Indian markets has come to the fore so far, the regulator has informed the stock exchanges about the updated Al-Qaida sanctions list of the United Nations Security Council, which has named various ISIS-linked entities in its new list.
The stock exchanges have, in turn, informed their trading members about the updated sanctions list.
In one such circular dated October 7, leading bourse BSE said: "Sebi has informed the Exchange about the amendments/addition to UNSC's Al-Qaida Sanctions List."
"Members are advised to take note of the above and ensure compliance with the same," BSE said while enclosing the updated lists of sanctions-hit entities.
In a separate circular dated October 1, NSE said that Sebi has informed it "about changes that have been made to the Taliban and Al-Qaida Sanctions List and UN Security Council 1988 Sanctions List."
Asking the trading members to take note of the updated lists and ensure compliance, NSE also drew the attention of its members to the provisions of a Sebi circular in this regard.
As per this circular issued under the Combating Financing of Terrorism obligations, Sebi has directed all registered market entities that before opening any new account it will be ensured that the name/s of the proposed customer does not appear in the updated sanctions lists of the UN Security Council.
Further, it has been directed that market intermediaries shall continuously scan all existing accounts to ensure that no account is held by or linked to any of the entities.
Full details of accounts bearing resemblance with any of the individuals/entities in the list are required to be intimated to Sebi and the FIU-IND (Financial Intelligence Unit of India), as per a Sebi circular in this regard.
Those figuring in these lists are required to be subjected to various sanction measures such as freezing of assets/accounts and denial of financial services.
Senior officials and top market executives said that there have been no major instance of any entities linked to these groups having found to be trading in Indian markets in the recent past, but regulations and global standards require a constant vigil for such cases.
The updated list now includes many entities and individuals linked to ISIS, which is also known as IS (Islamic State), such as ISIL (Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant), Al-Qaida in Iraw, as also those associated with Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.
These include an Official spokesman of ISIL, emir of ISIL in Syria, a Kuwait-based financier, recruiter and facilitator for ISIL, an Iraq-based senior ISIL representative and a French terrorist fighter who travelled to Syria and joined ISIL and is active in propagating ISIL ideology on Internet.
The sanctions list already includes the name of fugitive underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, Hafiz Saeed, Harkat-ul Jihad Islami and Global Relief Foundation.
ISIS started as an Al-Qaida splinter group and reportedly it engages in mass-killing, public executions, crucifixions and other terror acts.
The group reportedly controls hundreds of square miles, while ignoring international borders with a presence from Syria to Iraq. Its top leaders is Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and ISIS have posted videos on internet showing execution of hostages and journalists among others.
Earlier this year, Sebi updated its Anti-Money Laundering/Countering Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) framework for market intermediaries incorporate the amendments made in the PML Act and Rules.
The major changes to the framework are with regard to record keeping requirements, appointment of designated director to oversee compliance with AML/CFT obligations, reliance on third party for carrying out client due diligence and risk assessment to be carried out by intermediaries.
"Money laundering is globally recognized as one of the largest threats posed to the financial system of a country. The fight against terrorist financing is another such emerging threat with grave consequences for both the political and economic standing of a jurisdiction.
"Rapid developments and greater integration of the financial markets together with improvements in technology and communication channels continue to pose serious challenges to the authorities and institutions dealing with Anti-Money Laundering and Combating Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT)," Sebi said in its latest annual report for 2013-14.
During 2013-14, with respect to stock brokers, Sebi carried out 62 special purpose inspections to check their compliance with the AML/CFT and KYC norms. In case of depository participants, 53 inspections were carried out in this regard, while 21 inspections were carried out with respect to mutual funds to review compliance with AML/CFT and KYC related norms.
Stock exchange and depositories also conduct inspections of stock brokers and depository participants and also at the time of half yearly internal audits by independent professionals to verify compliance to AML/CFT norms.

Even after landfall of cyclone Hudhud, the system will maintain the intensity of very severe cyclonic storm for 6 hours and gradually weaken into cyclonic storm in subsequent six hours while moving northwestwards across south interior Odisha and Chhattisgarh, an IMD bulletin said.
Under its influence, rainfall in most places with heavy falls in some places will occur in south Chhattisgarh, adjoining Telangana and south Odisha and isolated heavy to very heavy falls in north Chhattisgarh and north Odisha, it said.
Gale with speed reaching 100-120 kmph gusting to 130 kmph will prevail for 6 hours after landfall and 80-90 kmph gusting to 100 kmph for subsequent 6 hours over East Godavari, Visakhapatnam, Vizianagaram and Srikakulam districts of north Andhra Pradesh and Ganjam, Gajapati, Koraput and Malkangiri districts of Odisha.
Squally winds with speed reaching 55-65 kmph gusting to 75 kmph will also prevail for the next 12 hours after landfall in south Chhattisgarh and adjoining districts of north Telangana and south Odisha, the IMD said.

Online shopping spree makes offline retailer...Online shopping spree makes offline retailers cry foul
IANS Oct 12, 2014, 04.58PM IST
(The online price war crazy…)
BANGALORE: As online shopping trend sweeps digital India, offline retailers are a worried lot, with sales of electronic goods, consumer durables and utility products declining across cities and towns even during the peak festival season.
With e-commerce players Flipkart, Snapdeal and Amazon pitching for more orders, offering hefty discounts and freebies in the virtual world, vendors in the real world are crying foul of unfair competition and a non-level playing field.
"Growing competition among them (e-retailers) for ramping up sales at any cost is affecting our business, as we do not see the kind of footfalls we got even year ago and our retail sales have taken a severe hit because many asmart' buyers prefer shop online where prices are lower than we are able to give on several goods," manager of a leading consumer showroom told IANS here.
Though the annual sales turnover of the offline retail sector is estimated to be $25 billion (Rs.150,000 crore) as against $3 billion (Rs.18,000 crore) of the emerging e-tail sector, many retail formats are feeling the heat of their tech-savvy counterparts.
"Unlike them (e-retailers) who sell goods at factory price and save on overheads by delivering them to buyers through courier, we have to factor intermediary costs and profit margin within the MRP (maximum retail price). They (e-retailers) also do not pay value added tax (VAT) on sales, as they claim to be just shipping the goods from source (factory) to end-user," the manager said on anonymity.
The online price war, triggered by Flipkart Oct 6, with steep discounts, crazy deals and lucky draws on a range of products, has brought to the fore the threat the sun rise e-tail sector poses to the traditional retail sector.
Flipkart's 'Big Billion Day' sale also resulted in its website crashing for hours and outrage in the social media for acheating' its online shoppers, with deceptive offers and false promises.
Flipkart, however, claimed that it got a billion hits and sold products worth $100 million (Rs.600 crore) on the day, with a whopping five-lakh mobile handsets, five-lakh clothes and shoes and 25,000 television sets flying off its shelves within hours of opening its discounted sale at 8 a.m.
When complaints reached the government a day after Flipkart apologised to millions of its customers Oct 7 for its failures, Union Minister of State for Commerce and Industry Nirmala Sitharaman said Oct 8 her ministry would look into them.
With Snapdeal also offering same day similar discounts and lower prices on a host of like products as Flipkart, traders expressed concerns over the fallout of cut-throat competition among e-retailers on their retail sales.
The Confederation of All India Traders also urged the commerce ministry to regulate e-retail business and trade practices of its companies, as they were offering huge discounts during the ongoing festival season.
According to a survey by Assocham (Associated Chambers of Commerce & Industry), online shopping growth is projected to zoom 350 percent during Diwal and may result in footfalls at shopping malls in Chennai plunging 46 percent this month.
"During Diwali alone, online shopping is estimated to cross Rs.10,000 crore and going forward, the trend will not only continue, but also grow dramatically to cross Rs.100,000 crore over the next four years," the survey pointed out.
The survey also found that e-commerce sales in August and September grew 200 percent from 120 percent year ago (2013), with mobile sales booming 100 percent, as more and more consumers tend to shop online, which is fast, with simple payment and quick delivery service.
"This festive season, traditional retail shopping has taken a back seat. Apart from convenience, rising fuel price, security reasons, online discounts and choice of products are making consumers shop online more," Assocham secretary-general D.S. Rawat said in a statement, citing the survey findings.
Even small-time dealers in this tech hub and Mysore, about 150km away, have seen a 30-40 percent fall in sales of IT hardware and electronic products due to tech-savvy buyers switching over to e-retailers like Flipkart and Snapdeal over the months because of huge discounts, ease of transaction and getting the goods delivered at home or workplace in a day or two.
"We are not able to match the discounted prices offered by them (e-retailers) on same products we have been selling over the years even after our buyers bargain for price reduction," Ganesh Shetty, a dealer in the city's wholesale market, told IANS.
Worried over the impact of e-commerce on their business, many dealers and traders recently appealed to the state government to bring e-retailers under VAT net and ensure a level-playing field for their survival in the long-term.
"We can't afford to sell below the procurement price, as we have to absorb other costs such as shop rental, staff wages, sales tax and transportation," Shetty added./Eom/750 words.

Neck-deep in loss  Air India spends $6 million to insure 6 grounded planesAir India
(The Indian Commercial Pilots…)
MUMBAI: National carrier Air India, which is sitting on a huge debt pile and surviving on the Rs 30,000- crore government bailout, is allegedly getting grounded aircrafts insured at a cost of $ 6 million in a year.
The state-run airline's recognised pilots union, the Indian Commercial Pilots Association (ICPA), has sought an independent probe into these allegations and fix the accountability on individuals responsible for this.
"Six Boeing 737-200 Fs, which have been out of service for more than three years, are still being insured at $1 million each per annum or $ 6 million, for more than the past three years. We demand an immediate, time-bound investigation by an external agency to look into this huge financial irregularity," ICPA General Secretary Shailender Singh said in a letter to Air India Chairman Rohit Nandan . The letter is also addressed to Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathy Raju and the Chief Vigilance Commissioner.
The Air India spokesperson did not respond to calls. The airline had renewed its insurance on October 1 for nearly $29 million to cover its 132 aircraft (including the 17 of AI Express and 8 of Alliance Air,) which was close to 18 per cent higher than it what it paid last year, $23 million. Airline insurance premia had gone up this year after a string of tragedies across the globe.
Alleging that even as recent as on October 1, the insurance cover for four of these aircraft was renewed for another year at $50,000 each, the ICPA said, "We are also alarmed at the sharp 95 per cent drop in the insured sum of these aircraft, which till September 30 were insured for $10,00,000 and now only for $50,000."
These aircraft were converted into freighters for cargo operations at a considerable expense at a time when they had almost completed their life span, ICPA said
The contract for their use was executed with logistics firm Gati in May 2007, which was discontinued in March 2009, due to certain disputes, which the union claims to have led to an arbitration which the Air India lost. The arbitration tribunal had recently ordered Air India to pay Rs 26.82 crore to the private company.
"We also demand a complete and independent probe into this contract and a diligence audit into how the case was handled by the management. What is baffling is that the management is maintaining these aircraft in its fleet and paying hefty insurance premium for no use," the letter alleged.
"Prima facie there is a loss of crores of rupees on account of unwarranted insurance outgo alone, in addition to the awarded claim of Rs 26.82 crore ordered by the arbitration tribunal in favour of Gati. To this has to be added the cost of conversion of these aircraft from passenger to cargo configuration," the ICPA letter said.
The union said that these losses are being incurred at a time when salaries and allowances are being cut unilaterally and when the management claims that it is an everyday fight for them to pay full salaries to the staff and meet other day-to-day operating expenses.

PLA identifies 40 problems in first combat training

(The 2.3 million strong People's…)
BEIJING: Chinese military has identified a host of problems after conducting massive military exercises for the first time to sharpen the troops' fighting capability which if not rectified will hinder its ability to win wars.
The 2.3 million strong People's Liberation Army (PLA) has issued a document detailing 40 problems with current exercises featuring real battle scenarios, official media reported today.
"If the problems are not rectified, the PLA's ability to fight and win will be hindered for sure," state-run Xinhua news agency quoted the military headquarters as saying.
"The list will help the army focus on its weaknesses and force them to learn how to fight," it said.
The PLA general staff headquarters listed existing problems with military training by its land, navy, air forces and artillery troops, the PLA Daily newspaper reported today.
Under the exercises, the military resorted to massive mobilisation of troops on a scale which observers say it has not done before.
The challenges include soldiers' personal problems, current methods and standards of military training and issues of work style in the army, the report said.
The issues were singled out based on assessment of troop performance in routine exercises or joint drills with foreign armies, it said.
The exercises were held in the back drop of escalating tensions with Japan over the disputed islands and with Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei on the South China Sea dispute as well as the big American push under the Asia Pivot concept to deploy majority of its assets in Asia Pacific.
China too has a border dispute with India with tensions recurring over aggressive patrolling along the Line of Actual Control, ( LAC ) resulting in tense stand offs.
The exercises which disrupted flight schedules for several weeks last month were being held on a massive scale to win regional wars, a concept being advocated by the Chinese leadership for long.
But it was only after President Xi, who is also head of the military and ruling Communist Party of China ( CPC ), came to power that the military began exercises with troops divided into Chinese and enemy troops to train under real battle conditions.
Xi has repeatedly asked the troops to be prepared to win actual battles since he took office in 2012.

Cyclone Hudhud
(Normal life was thrown completely…)
VISHAKAPATNAM: Severe cyclonic storm Hudhud hit the port city of Vishakapatnam today bringing with it torrential rains in three coastal districts of Andhra Pradesh and leaving five persons dead in the state and neighbouring Odisha besides snapping power and communication lines.
Normal life was thrown completely out of gear as winds with a speed of 170 to 180 kmph battered Visakhapatnam, Srikakulam and Vizianagaram districts.
The very severe cyclonic storm made landfall in Visakhapatnam before noon. The gale, accompanied by heavy downpour, resulted in trees being uprooted and roofs of thatched huts and sheds being swept away.
While authorities in Andhra Pradesh evacuated 90,013 people across the four districts of Srikakulam, Vizianagaram, Visakhaptnam and East Godavari, about 68,000 people were evacuated from coastal districts of Odisha.
In Delhi, IMD Director General Laxman Singh Rathore said that "Due to the hilly topography, the cyclone's intensity will reduce in next six hours and further reduce in next 12 hours. However, the area (Vizag) will experience heavy to very heavy rainfall for the next three days."
As the storm progresses, it will bring heavy rainfall to very heavy rainfall in Chhatisgarh, Bihar, East Madhya Pradesh and East UP and Gangetic belt of West Bengal.
"We are in touch with the chief secretaries of these state governments and providing with bulletins. Warnings have also been issued to shift crops which have been harvested to minimise the impact of heavy rains in these areas," Rathore said.
Aircraft services will be able to operate from tomorrow morning as the weather is expected to improve.
"The PMO is monitoring the situation arising out of the cyclone at regular intervals," he said. While three persons were killed in rain-related incidents in Andhra Pradesh, two were killed in Odisha.
"Three deaths have been reported due to impact of Hudhud. Two died after trees fell on them and one in collapse of compound-wall in Visakhapatnam and Srikakulam districts, respectively," AP Chief Secretary IVR Krishna Rao said.
Casualty in cyclone Hudhud rose to two in Odisha. A fisherman was caught in the sea current amid a tidal surge while he was trying to save his fishing boat anchored in the coast of Puri, Special Relief Commissioner PK Mohapatra said.
Yesterday, a nine-year-old girl drowned when a boat engaged in evacuation of the people in Satbhaya area of Kendrapara district capsized in the Baunsagadi rivulet.
Union Cabinet Secretary Ajit Kumar Seth said the Prime Minister was concerned not only about AP and Odisha but also wanted other states, which could face heavy rains minus the cyclone, to be alerted.
  "We have done that," Seth said, adding that while the Prime Minister reviewed the situation last night, he himself has been reviewing the situation closely and holding meetings with Chief Secretaries of Andhra Pradesh and Odisha twice daily.
Seth advised residents of cyclone-hit Vizag to exercise caution till the second phase of the high wind is over even as he lauded the efforts of the central agencies and state government in meeting the challenge.
He said once the initial brunt has been taken at the time of the landfall of the cyclone, there is a lull as the centre or eye of the storm passes but thereafter the wind speed is going to pick up again and it is going to be the same as was when it hit the coast first.
Seth said the government does not have the total estimate of the damage caused due to the cyclone as yet.
"State government, central agencies are on their job. They have done their job. The Army, the Navy and all other agencies are already there.
"Both the governments were well-prepared. We have been reviewing the situation with them... They have got their act together. They have taken necessary precautions and alerted the local population," Seth said.
The NDRF has doubled the strength of its teams stationed in Vishakapatnam to 13 in order to undertake swift relief and rescue operations.
"We have increased our teams to 13 in Vizag after the landfall occurred. Earlier there were six teams stationed here," National Disaster Response Force chief O P Singh said.
In Bhubaneswar, Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik said the cyclone had its impact in different districts like Ganjam, Gajapati, Koraput, Puri, Kalahandi and Kendrapara.
68,000 people have been evacuated to safe places, the chief minister said, directing the officials to continue the evacuation of people from vulnerable areas as the complete impact of the cyclone would be felt some hours after the landfall.
The affected people have been accommodated in 604 shelter homes, Patnaik said, adding the state government was prepared to face the situation caused by the cyclone and possible floods thereafter.
Under the impact of the cyclone, the entire coastal and southern region experienced moderate to heavy rainfall since early morning though the maximum wind speed was below 60 kmph.
However, the weather office predicted an increase in the wind speed in eight southern districts.
The state government has identified the eight districts of Ganjam, Gajapati, Malkangiri, Koraput, Rayagada, Nabarangpur, Kandhamal and Kalahandi which will bear the maximum brunt of the cyclone.

NEW DELHI: Going through a blog can help young aspirants get guidance to crack the medical entrance examination to the country's premier institution.
'Aim4Aiims', a blog started by a group of seven previous toppers of the entrance exam, provides tips and tricks to face the toughest test to enter India's number one medical college.
The seven members who contribute to the blog, offer free guidance and counselling to medical aspirants and supervise and assist the youngsters in preparing for the exam.

The blog also provides guidance on how to overcome the exam phobia, time management, Dos and Don'ts for the upcoming AIIMS 2015 medical entrance examination.
"Visiting this descriptive and significant blog can be helpful to all medical aspirants, especially if one aspires to be at the AIIMS. One can use this blog to decipher the secret of success of the toppers which can then be implemented by them to prepare for their upcoming entrance test," Ajay Mohan, a member of the team, said.
"Depression, nervousness and low-self-esteem are epidemics suffered by most students in the post-class 12 period, which is considered to be the most tedious and crucial part of students' life.This blog can be a medium of relief to all medical aspirants now. It can now serve as your guiding light," Mohan, who is in his fourth year of the MBBS course, said.
The group has also introduced the facility of a telephonic guidance system.
A website, has also been launched to help students go through past AIIMS exam papers.
Guidance classes have been arranged in the national capital, starting from November 1 and lasting for a month, Mohan said.
"It's basically a guidance class to show them how to make their way easily towards a successful career. Aspirants will have to pay a meagre sum of Rs 7,000 for the complete duration, which is nothing compared to the regular classes that charge hefty amount in the market," Mohan said.

Railways now an attractive investment desti...Narendra Modi government makes railways an attractive investment destination by pitching for it's modernisation

EMD
(Indian Railways,  largest…)
NEW DELHI: Indian Railways has become an attractive investment destination , especially with the Narendra Modi government pitching for modernisation and upgradation of one of the largest railway networks in the world with high-speed trains and modern stations with world-class amenities.
The prime minister's recent interaction with the leaders of Japan and China has led to both inking agreements to invest in India's mammoth railways network by way of high-speed trains and modernising stations. Teams from both Japan and China will be visiting India soon to study specific sectors before finalising agreements, said an official.
Japan has offered to provide financial, technical and operational support to India for introducing its bullet trains, called Shinkansen, on the Ahmedabad-Mumbai route.
The Japan International Cooperation Agency is conducting a feasibility study on the 530-km-long Mumbai-Ahmedabad route for running a bullet train at a speed of over 250 km an hour. The study will be completed by July 2015, Indian Railways spokesperson Anil K. Saxena told IANS.
The corridor with around seven stations is expected to cost Rs.60,000 crore (about $1,000) over six years, at Rs.10,000 crore a year.
"The safety angle of the bullet train project on the corridor will be studied," Saxena added.
Once completed, a bullet train would take around 3-4 hours to reach Ahmedabad, compared to the eight hours it takes now by express train.
Japan has also evinced interest in financing semi-high speed trains in India, which travel at speeds up to 200 kmph, while bullet trains run at speeds of over 250 kmph.
A Japanese team would conduct a study for semi-high speed and bullet train on the Mumbai-Delhi corridor, the official added.
With China, the agreements inked are for increasing the speed of trains on the existing rail network, modernising stations and enhancing mutual cooperation in the sector.
Though Beijing was pushing for its bullet trains, New Delhi has decided to go for semi-high speed trains on the Chennai-Bangalore-Mysore stretch. The speed on this stretch is proposed to be raised to 160 kmph. A study would be conducted by the Chinese side before the project is inked.
With regard to China's eagerness to introduce its bullet trains, the spokesperson said it has been asked to identify the corridors and also conduct a study on the safety aspect.
Around 10 stations have been identified for modernisation. These would be made into world-class stations. Delhi and Mumbai stations are to be initially upgraded and Chinese help would be sought for this.
Modi, during his US visit, pitched for investment in Indian Railways. Two major American firms - Electro-Motive Diesel ( EMD ) and General Electric - have been shortlisted for the manufacture of heavy locomotive engines in PPP (public-private partnership) mode in Bihar.
Indian Railways, the largest network in Asia, runs 11,000 trains every day, of which 7,000 are passenger trains. It ferries over 13 million passengers every day on its 63,028-km tracks.

BEIJING: Airbus has decided to set up an A330 Completion and Delivery Centre in China to benefit from the massive growth of its aviation sector, expected to expand from the present 1,000 aircraft to 5300 by 2033.
The centre, to be established in Northern China's Tianjin city, is aimed at supporting the fast growth of air traffic in China with larger aircrafts, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported today.
The in-service Airbus fleet with Chinese operators now comprises more than 1,000 aircraft.
Between 2014 to 2033, Airbus forecasts a demand in China for more than 5,300 new commercial aircrafts, in addition to freighters.
"In its 30 year history the Airbus partnership with China keeps on growing and expanding. The intended establishment of an A330 Completion and Delivery Center will add a new exciting chapter to our longstanding track record of mutual achievements," Fabrice Bregier , Airbus president and CEO said.
The A330 Family, which spans 250 to 300 seats, has attracted more than 1,300 orders, with over 1,000 aircraft flying now with more than 100 operators worldwide.

Kailash Satyarthis NGO goes after child traffickerComments
As Nobel Peace Prize winner Kailash Satyarthi spent a busy Saturday meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi and giving interviews to the media, his Bachpan Bachao Andolan (BBA) was done celebrating and was back on the job, in hot pursuit of a big-time child trafficker from Jharkhand.

They’d already put off the planned raid by a day — having joined the 60-year-old in celebrating his joint Nobel with Pakistani teen and fellow child rights champion Malala Yousafzai — and couldn’t wait any more. On Saturday, they got in touch with the Delhi Police crime branch to make arrangements for the raid.

HT is withholding the name of the trafficker and other related details to ensure the raid isn’t hampered in any way.
Activists with BBA believe taking him down will lead to more arrests, and to more minors being rescued. “The celebrations will continue but we can’t forget our basic work for which we have got the Nobel.
 This arrest might end up exposing a big racket and we are assisting the police to arrest him at the earliest,” said one activist.
The trafficking racket in Delhi is a steadily growing menace with victims — mostly minors and women — brought in from states like Jharkhand and West Bengal. Once in the city, they are pushed into child labour, illegal domestic work or prostitution by unscrupulous placement agencies.
“This particular trafficker is wanted in several cases of child trafficking,” a police officer said, adding that they got to know of him after the recent arrest of a former Jharkhand minister under the arms act. “The ex-minister was apparently hiding in his house and there is a possibility that traffickers are linked to a number of politicians,” the officer said.

Other officers revealed the trafficker and his wife, who run an illegal placement agency in west Delhi, brought in minors on the pretext of getting them jobs and education. The couple’s name figured in a list provided by the Jharkhand CID last year of 240 illegal agents suspected of trafficking young girls from the state.
Sources said BBA had provided details of possible hideouts to the police, and would assist in the raid along with members of another NGO, Shakti Vahini.
“Met Nobel laureate Kailash Satyarthi ji & congratulated him,” Modi tweeted after the meeting. The BBA founder also received a call earlier in the day from BJP patriarch LK Advani.

Deepavali
Traffic arrangements should be made such that there is easy access to the Island Ground.
Work is under way for cracker units to set up temporary shop at Island Grounds. Over 120 wholesale and retail crackers units from Parry’s Corner, Broadway, Flower Bazaar and Kotwalchavadi will be operating from the Grounds this season.
Temporary stalls with tin sheet roofs are being erected at Island Grounds, which belongs to the Tamil Nadu Tourism Development Corporation (TTDC). The state-run tourism agency would install and maintain these stalls for a nominal rent. Special efforts have been taken by TTDC to prevent any untoward incidents, including fire accidents. A dozen contingents of Tamil Nadu Fire and Rescue Services (TNF&RS) personnel and the police would be deployed at Island Grounds. Adequate parking arrangements for two-wheelers and cars have been made. Separate entry and exit gates have been created. “More food courts and joyrides for children are also part of the arrangements at the Island Grounds. The cracker shops have been adequately spaced, one from the other,” said a TTDC official.
Unlike Bunder Street and other narrow stretches in Broadway and Parry’s Corner, Island Grounds is open and spacious. More importantly, consumers can shop in a safe environment without fear of getting trapped in the event of an accident.
The order to shift the cracker shops from Parry’s Corner to Island Grounds, especially during Deepavali, came in 2011 after the Madras High Court directed the state government to make necessary arrangements.
Cracker shops owner have been planning to display a variety of fire crackers including colourful rockets and crackers that make less noise but emit more light.
“Traffic arrangements should be made in such a way that access to Island Grounds is easy. Basic amenities including water taps and toilets should also be improved at the facility,” said K. Abbas of Chennai Fireworks Dealers Welfare Association.

Putin orders troops to withdraw from Ukrain...Vladimir Putin orders Russian troops to withdraw from Ukrainian border
By Reuters | 12 Oct, 2014, 06.29PM IST
The troop pullout came before an expected meeting between Putin and his Ukrainian counterpart Petro Poroshenko in Milan next week.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
MOSCOW: Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered Russian troops to withdraw to their permanent bases after military exercises in Rostov region near the border with Ukraine, the Kremlin said, in a sign of some tension easing before a key meeting next week.
The troop pullout came before an expected meeting between Putin and his Ukrainian counterpart Petro Poroshenko in Milan next week.
The Kremlin said that the Russian president had met his defence minister, Sergei Shoigu.
"The minister had reported to the Supreme Commander about the completion of summer period of training on shooting ranges of the southern military district," said a statement on the Kremlin's web site.
"After the report, Putin ordered to launch the return of the troops to their permanent bases. In total, these are 17,600 military servicemen who were trained on the shooting ranges of Rostov region in summer."
Russian RIA Novosti news agency, citing the defence ministry, said that the troops have already started to pull out.
Relations between Moscow and the NATO alliance are at a post-Cold War low over Russia's actions in Ukraine, where it annexed the Crimean peninsula in March and has been supporting pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine.
The West has introduced a wide range of sanctions against Russian banks, energy companies and individuals for Moscow's role in the Ukrainian conflict, which has claimed the lives of over 3,000 people.
A month ago, NATO said Russia had several thousand combat troops and hundreds of tanks and armoured vehicles in eastern Ukraine supporting pro-Russian separatists fighting the Ukrainian army.
Russia denies the charges but says it has a right to defend the interests of the region's Russian-speaking majority.
The alliance said at the end of last month it had observed a significant pullback of Russian conventional forces from inside Ukraine since an uneasy ceasefire began on Sept. 5.
The Kremlin has said Putin and Poroshenko may hold talks on the sidelines of a summit of Asian and European leaders in Milan on Oct. 16-17.
Alexei Makarkin from the Center for Political Technologies think-tank told Echo Moskvy radio that the troop pullout is probably one of the compromises between Russia and Ukraine.
"I think it could be about lifting part of the Western sanctions against Russia as a response to these decisions," he said.

Pakistan hits 15 border posts  villages in Jammu  3 injuredPak targets 15 posts in Jammu, seeks UN help
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  Jammu, October 12, 2014
First Published: 09:35 IST(12/10/2014) | Last Updated: 09:32 IST(13/10/2014)
Comments
Pakistan heavily shelled 15 border outposts and hamlets in Arnia sector of Jammu and Kashmir early Sunday even as it wrote to UN chief Ban Ki-moon blaming India for the escalation in border clashes and sought UN intervention on Kashmir.
The shelling, the first since Thursday, injured three people and ends a pause in fighting that has already killed 19 civilians in the two countries in the worst skirmishes in a decade. The Pakistan foreign ministry has claimed that Indian firing over the past month has killed 12 and injured 52 of its civilians.

In the letter to Ban, foreign affairs adviser to Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif, Sartaj Aziz, accused India of ‘deliberate and unprovoked violations of the ceasefire agreement and cross-border firing’. He also appealed for UN’s assistance in resolving the dispute with India over the status of Kashmir.
Though there was no formal reaction from New Delhi, India has long maintained that disputes between it and Pakistan should be resolved bilaterally under the framework of the Shimla agreement and Lahore declaration.
 India also considers the UN observer group on Kashmir to have outlived its utility and has criticised Pakistan for depending on a ‘tool of a bygone era’ to address the problems of the present.
Read: Pak writes to UN chief; asks intervention on Kashmir
The latest round of shelling  by Pakistan comes a week after five people were killed in Arnia.
“Flat trajectory weaponry fire started at 8.10pm (Saturday) on three border posts in Arnia and continued till early morning,” a BSF spokesperson said.
The fresh firing has forced authorities to drop any moves to allow the nearly 30,000 people living in government relief camps to return to their homes.

Kerry for renewed commitment to Middle East...John Kerry calls for renewed commitment to Middle East peace
PTI Oct 12, 2014, 06.48PM IST
Tags:
Ban Ki-Moon
(Speaking at  international…)
CAIRO: Describing the current status quo in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process as "unacceptable and unstable", US Secretary of State John Kerry today called for a renewed commitment for achieving peace in the Middle East .
Speaking at an international donors conference here for reconstruction of the war-battered Gaza Strip, Kerry emphasised that the effort should look beyond arranging money and aspire to fulfill the goal of peace between Israel and the Palestinians.
"Out of this conference must come not just money but a renewed commitment from everybody to work for peace that meets the aspirations of all, for Israelis, for Palestinians, for all people of this region. And I promise you the full commitment of President (Barack) Obama, myself and the US to try to do that," the Secretary of State said.
"Everything else will be a band aid fix, not a long-term solution. Everything else will be the prisoner of impatience and that has brought us to this unacceptable and unstable status quo," he asserted.
Kerry said with winter approaching, thousands of Palestinians displaced from their homes need urgent help.
He also announced an additional $ 212 million in aid to the Palestinian people at the conference, saying, "The people of Gaza do need our help desperately, not tomorrow, not next week, but they need it now".
US-brokered peace talks between Israel and the Palestinian Authority (PA) broke down in April followed by the devastating 50-day war in Gaza in July where more than 2,200 people were killed as Israeli attacks left the area badly battered.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called for lifting the Israeli blockade and for applying a two-state solution.
Ban said that both sides need to avoid violations of international law as he also advised their leaders to overcome their differences to put an end to the conflict.
PA President Mahmoud Abbas also spoke at the conference seeking $ 4 billion in aid to rehabilitate Gaza.
Abbas also stressed that "it is no longer acceptable to live in a state of repeated wars".
Thanking Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi for his efforts to achieve an agreement and help promote the Palestinian cause, Abbas said that the PA would continue to work closely with Egypt on reaching a lasting truce.
Reflecting on the situation in the West Bank which is controlled by the PA, Abbas said that Israel's continued settlement activity was harmful to the economy and prevented Palestinians from developing large chunks of the West Bank.
"There must be an international approach" to ending the decades-old conflict, Abbas stated, which must include a Palestinian state.
The donors conference, co-organised by Egypt and Norway, aims to raise billions of dollars to rebuild Gaza after the bloody conflict that started in July and left over 2,000 Palestinians dead and 100,000 others homeless.
The conference is being attended by more than 30 foreign ministers, over 50 national delegations and around 20 representatives from regional and international organisations.

Pakistan's third largest mosque, "Bharia Town Jamia Masjid" opened for public

"Bharia Town Jamia Masjid"
(Muslims walk near the Badshahi…)
LAHORE: The construction of Pakistan's third largest mosque has been completed at a cost of over Rs 100 crore and opened for the public here.
The "Bharia Town Jamia Masjid" is the third largest mosque in Pakistan after Badshahi Masjid and Faisal Masjid.
The main hall of the mosque can accommodate 25,000 people and it has a total capacity of 70,000.
The mosque has 21 domes and four 165 feet high minarets. "These specifications make it the largest mosque in Pakistan in terms of covered area," one of its architects, Nayyar Ali Dada claimed.
However, senior architect at Pakistan archeology department, Maqsood Ahmed told PTI that even in terms of covered area Bahria Town Jamia Masjid comes after Badshahi and Faisal mosques.
"It is a beautiful addition to the country's largest mosques," he said.
It has glimpses of historical Badshahi and Wazir Khan mosques. It is designed to capture the historical essence of Lahore and its surrounding cities.
"The sandstone bricks for the exterior bear the characteristic orange hue. The sands of Multan have an orange colour. Multan's sand was used to make the exterior bricks. We found some old craftsmen, while some new ones were trained to make geometric and floral patterned tiles," Dada said.
The construction started three years ago and 1,000 labourers have been constantly working at the site ever since.
The main three-dimensional arched dome at a height of 150 feet is embossed with floral inlays and Mughal-era calligraphy.
Eight chandeliers, synchronized to make a mammoth chandelier, are installed at the dome's centre.
An area on second floor has been reserved for women. According to Malik Riaz, the mosque would become the hallmark of Lahore Bahria Town and a symbol of Pakistan across the Muslim world.

Govt to look into complaints on Flipkart s big sale'Govt to look into complaints on Flipkart's big sale'
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, October 08, 2014
First Published: 17:56 IST(8/10/2014) | Last Updated: 08:54 IST(9/10/2014)

The government has received “many complaints” from traders on e-retailer Flipkart’s massive discount sale on Monday that offered deep discounts but also threw open the question of lack of regulatory oversight over India’s booming e-commerce business.
“We have received many inputs. Lot of concerns have been expressed. We will look into it,” commerce and industry minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Wednesday.
Read: ‘Marked up’ prices, server crash spoil Flipkart party
Flipkart’s ‘The Big Billion Day’ overburdened its servers within two hours of the sale being opened and many users complained of landing on error pages and seeing their sale process being interrupted, amid accusations that discounts were offered on inflated prices.
“There are many complaints. We will study the matter... Whether there is a need for a separate policy or some kind of clarification is needed, we will make it clear soon,” said Sitharaman, who is also the minister of state for finance and corporate affairs.

The Confederation of All India Traders has also sought a probe into the business model and trade practices of e-commerce companies to find out how they are offering huge discounts during the festive season.
Flipkart on Tuesday wrote a formal apology to its registered customers for the technical and transaction troubles faced on Monday, when attempting to purchase goods on the website.
The company earned the ire of disgruntled shoppers by offering some supposedly discounted items at prices higher than what rivals such as Amazon and Snapdeal were offering.

India set to grow at 6.4 percent in 2015: IMFAP Developments have been accompanied by rising capital inflows as well as a revival in investment and industrial activity.
TOPICS
economy (general)
India is projected to grow at 6.4 percent in 2015 with industrial production and other indicators turning around thanks to stronger business confidence since the parliamentary elections, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
“India’s growth outlook has improved since the last national election, helped by lower uncertainty and improved business confidence,” the 188-nation watchdog of global economic health said in its October 2014 Update of Asia and Pacific Economic Outlook.
Despite a weaker-than-expected first half of the year, the outlook for the region remains solid, it said with GDP forecast to grow by 5.5 percent for the third consecutive year in 2014, rising slightly to 5.6 percent in 2015.
“In India, growth (based on GDP at factor cost) has gathered steam as industrial production and other high-frequency indicators have started to turn around on the back of stronger business confidence” since the last national elections, IMF said.
These developments have been accompanied by rising capital inflows as well as a revival in investment and industrial activity, it noted.
“India’s GDP growth appears to have bottomed out,” IMF said, forecasting its “rise to 5.6 percent in 2014, accelerating further to 6.4 percent in 2015, despite headwinds from ongoing fiscal consolidation and a tighter monetary stance”.
But “India’s high and persistent inflation remains a policy concern and is projected to decline only gradually, reaching 7.8 and 7.5 percent in fiscal years 2014 and 2015, respectively,” IMF said.
Economic resilience to global financial risks has increased in the region, especially in India, where policy actions to reduce vulnerabilities have helped lower external and domestic imbalances, it said.
In India, for instance, international reserves have risen and the current account deficit has been slashed, contributing to a significant reduction in gross external financing needs, the regional update said.
Suggesting that reforms to maintain high and sustainable growth will also help lower near-term vulnerabilities, IMF advocated stronger investment and efficiency in India as important steps in this direction.
In the case of India, previous interest rate hikes and other policy measures are helping contain price pressures, and the full effect of past monetary tightening is yet to be felt, the update said.
“However, close vigilance is warranted, particularly in the event of large cost-push shocks or if there is evidence that inflation expectations become unmoored,” it said.
“India also needs to further remove structural impediments to investment, including by further liberalizing its FDI regime and labour market regulations,” IMF said.
“Energy sector policies are also needed in India to boost industrial activity,” it said.
The update said the ongoing global recovery, while tepid, should support Asia’s exports. “Meanwhile, favourable financial and labour market conditions, as well as broadly accommodative policies, will continue to underpin domestic demand” in the region.
“Policymakers in the region should capitalise on the outlook to gradually rebuild policy space and push ahead with structural reforms to deliver sustainable growth,” the IMF suggested.

Narayana Murthy says no to ‘Chairman Emeritus’
Staff Reporter
board of directors (appointment and change)
Infosys Founder N. R. Narayana Murthy, on Friday, said he would not continue as the Chairman Emeritus of Infosys, which he, along with other six, founded 33 years ago. Turning down the offer from the board, Mr. Murthy said he wanted to avoid conflicts and maintain corporate governance standards at the firm.
Mr. Murthy would step down from the role of non-Executive Chairman with effect from Friday.
The board has accepted Mr. Murthy’s decision, and thanked him for his vision, leadership and guidance in making Infosys a global company, the company said in a statement to the BSE.
When asked about Mr. Murthy’s decision, Infosys CEO and Managing Director Vishal Sikka said, “I do have a great chemistry with him; he is a great teacher. I’m going to look for advice and guidance from him; he will be forever known as Mister Infosys…”
With the stepping down of Mr. Murthy, K. V. Kamath has been elected as the Chairman of the board, effective October 11.
The company has classified its founders Mr. Murthy, Nandan Nilekani, Kris Gopalakrishnan, S. D. Shibulal and K. Dinesh, along with other immediate family members, as promoters/ promoter group.
“With the last two founders, Mr. Murthy and Mr. Gopalakrishnan demitting office, the founders have neither association with the company nor exercise any control over the affairs of the company after the current date,” the statement adds.
The founders have, therefore, requested the company to seek classification of their revised status. Infosys is in the process of seeking appropriate regulatory guidance on the same.

Charting out a new direction and road for the growth of Infosys, CEO and Managing Director Vishal Sikka, on Friday, said there was a need for design thinking with thrust on all pervasive digital transformation that could reshape the software industry. “We see that the world around us is driven by software and software-driven technologies in a fundamental and profound manner… that transformation is affecting every industry and business... and there is a great opportunity for every company to transform,” he said after releasing the first quarterly results here..
Stressing the need and importance of culture in transformation, Mr. Sikka said, “No company can transform itself unless its workforce and culture move into the next generation. To re-skill this workforce and get them to think differently and understand, the new business realities and models you need to learn.”
“We believe that we are also going to need the renewal of our processes, of the way we operate, our internal system and processes, the way we engage with our employees and customers. We are also increasing our focus on education, learning and the way we focus on our employees,” he added.
To a query Mr. Sikka said “I think it is wrong to think of the new strategy in the context of any of the work that we did in the past. There is nothing radically different that I am proposing. I prefer not to look back on what Infosys 3.0 was or was not. What we have set out is ideas that are relevant to the clients.”
Terming Infosys as a next generation company with tremendous potential, he said, “We aspire to become the best of an excellent service company. I believe we will get back to that level. We will be focusing on consistent profitable growth. We aspire to go back to that and once again become the bellwether in the Indian IT industry.”
The company CEO also said M&A did not play a major role in transformation. However, it was key for growth.
According to the company, it will partner or acquire start-ups in any part of the world.
“The work with regards to the start-ups has three different dimensions to it. Firstly, we, at Infosys, can be a great accelerator to the roadmap for start-ups. We can be a great enabler to get them to their roadmap faster. We work with several start-ups in this dimension already. Second dimension is to bring the start-ups to our clients. So joint go to market is something we can do, and we are already doing,” he said.

Court rules in favour of Vodafone in tax case

taxes and duties
IT Dept.’s action was a “blatant attempt to tax hypothetical or non-existent income.”
In a relief to Vodafone, the Bombay High Court, on Friday, ruled in favour of the Indian subsidiary of Vodafone Group PLC in the transfer pricing case.
The division bench of the Bombay High Court, headed by Chief Justice Mohit Shah, held that there was no question of imposing transfer pricing regulation, and that Vodafone India Services Pvt. Ltd. (VISPL) was not liable to pay the additional tax amount of over Rs.3,000 crore.
VISPL had challenged the Income Tax Department, and had argued that the share premium received on the issue of shares was never taxable.
Senior counsel Harish Salve had argued that the Income Tax Department’s action was a “blatant attempt to tax hypothetical or non-existent income.”
“The case relates to an imposition of tax by the tax office on VISPL, which issued shares to its foreign holding company. The foreign holding company was issued shares by VISPL on a price which was determined by a formula as per RBI guidelines. The shares were issued on a premium. The tax office said that they would disregard the RBI guidelines. According to them, the shares were undervalued and a higher premium should have been charged. The alleged shortfall in premium, according to tax office, was covered by transfer pricing and the Indian company, that is, VISPL, was liable to pay tax on the shortfall of premium,” advocate Anuradha Dutt, representing VISPL said.
VISPL had argued that the transfer pricing regulations were not applicable as there was no income from the transaction. Many other companies apart from Vodafone have also moved the court against similar transfer pricing orders and show-cause notices issued by the Income Tax Department.

The incident happened at Super Bazar around 9 p.m., when three men opened four rounds of fire opened on constables Prateek and Sandeep.
However, people overpowered one of the assailants and roughed him up before handing him over to police. The other two managed to escape.
Police said the attacker was taken to the Ram Manohar Lohia hospital. They are trying to establish his identity, and of the other two.

Best of times for the RSS  it aims for makeover at 90Comments
When Doordarshan recently telecast live Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat’s Vijaya-dashami speech, it brought the organisation — the BJP’s ideological parent--into the sort of spotlight it has historically sought to avoid.
But with former pracharak Narendra Modi as PM, the RSS is closer to the corridors of power than it’s ever been. And the Sangh has made its choice: Dynamically embrace change rather than continue to lurk in the background.
So expect the Sangh’s new avatar to communicate more aggressively, adopting the sort of rhetoric that appeals to the young. It will also use innovative ways to recruit, engage with newer social groups, work closely with research institutes and expand its global footprint.
All this without compromising its ideological agenda: the ‘unity and organisation’ of Hindu society on strong Hindutva lines.
HT has learnt of plans to revive Hindustan Samachar, a news agency affiliated to the Sangh. Retired journalists are being hired, and government agencies may soon buy its news.
The Sangh’s campaign arm Vishwa Sampark Kendra is being equipped with the latest technology and infrastructure to disseminate information. After the Bhagwat telecast, expect far greater coverage and attention to Sangh activities in the private as well as official government media.
The Sangh embraced new technology early. And while there is no official membership in the RSS, it uses the web as a mode of recruitment. Manmohan Vaidya, chief spokesperson, told HT how the join RSS link on its web draws close to 7,000 responses every month. “We pass on the name to the area-in-charge; he goes to the house of the person who has shown interest and explores how best he can contribute — either by coming to a shakha, or joining service activities, or through the social media.”
All this needs some explaining even to insiders. An RSS pracharak recently asked a member of the Sangh’s publicity cell, “Sangh does not need any publicity. What is the point of this cell?” The member could see where the ambivalence stemmed from, but he explained: “It is not for publicity of the Sangh, but for national issues, Sangh’s work, and to remove misperceptions.”
He then gave an anecdote involving a person who was a regular critic of the Sangh on television shows. The publicity cell invited him to attend an RSS camp. The guest came across the city to the camp at 4am. He was impressed, and toned down his criticism.
As the supplier of the ruling government’s ideology, the new Sangh attaches importance to its research links. The Vivekananda International Foundation — which has provided top officials to the Modi PMO — is one such institute close to the RSS.
But there are others too. The India Policy Foundation is run by Professor Rakesh Sinha, and its recent activities have included a seminar on Integral Humanism to commemorate Deen Dayal Upadhyay’s 98th birth anniversary.
Another think-tank is the India Foundation, which has on its board BJP general secretary Ram Madhav and national security adviser Ajit Doval’s son Shaurya, and works on strategic and foreign policy issues.
BJP vice-president Vinay Sahasrabuddhe heads the Public Policy Research Centre, which has been asked to pass on inputs to various ministries.
The Sangh also sees the need to attract newer social groups beyond Brahmins and traders to expand its support base.
 The Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram has already been working with tribals for decades; there is also now an aggressive outreach towards Dalits. Indresh Kumar, a senior RSS official, heads a minority outreach unit which worked during elections to mobilise Muslims to support Modi.
Kumar is also the Sangh’s link to the Tibetan community in exile, with the Sangh believing that Buddhism is but a part of the larger Hindu Parivar.
And to reach out to the urban young, the Sangh relies more on the language of nationalism and cultural pride, rather than on issues like Ram temple.
For IT professionals, weekly shakhas and IT milans are organised. There has been a debate on whether to shed the khakhi shorts but for now, the decision is to stick to the traditional uniform. HT reported last week how the RSS was now eyeing an expansion in Europe.
Agree or disagree with the Sangh worldview, for a 90-year-old organisation, the RSS is changing fast with the times.

Air India spends $6 mn to insure 6 grounded ...Air India
(The Indian Commercial Pilots…)
MUMBAI: National carrier Air India, which is sitting on a huge debt pile and surviving on the Rs 30,000- crore government bailout, is allegedly getting grounded aircrafts insured at a cost of $ 6 million in a year.
The state-run airline's recognised pilots union, the Indian Commercial Pilots Association (ICPA), has sought an independent probe into these allegations and fix the accountability on individuals responsible for this.
"Six Boeing 737-200 Fs, which have been out of service for more than three years, are still being insured at $1 million each per annum or $ 6 million, for more than the past three years. We demand an immediate, time-bound investigation by an external agency to look into this huge financial irregularity," ICPA General Secretary Shailender Singh said in a letter to Air India Chairman Rohit Nandan . The letter is also addressed to Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathy Raju and the Chief Vigilance Commissioner.
The Air India spokesperson did not respond to calls. The airline had renewed its insurance on October 1 for nearly $29 million to cover its 132 aircraft (including the 17 of AI Express and 8 of Alliance Air,) which was close to 18 per cent higher than it what it paid last year, $23 million. Airline insurance premia had gone up this year after a string of tragedies across the globe.
Alleging that even as recent as on October 1, the insurance cover for four of these aircraft was renewed for another year at $50,000 each, the ICPA said, "We are also alarmed at the sharp 95 per cent drop in the insured sum of these aircraft, which till September 30 were insured for $10,00,000 and now only for $50,000."
These aircraft were converted into freighters for cargo operations at a considerable expense at a time when they had almost completed their life span, ICPA said
The contract for their use was executed with logistics firm Gati in May 2007, which was discontinued in March 2009, due to certain disputes, which the union claims to have led to an arbitration which the Air India lost. The arbitration tribunal had recently ordered Air India to pay Rs 26.82 crore to the private company.
"We also demand a complete and independent probe into this contract and a diligence audit into how the case was handled by the management. What is baffling is that the management is maintaining these aircraft in its fleet and paying hefty insurance premium for no use," the letter alleged.
"Prima facie there is a loss of crores of rupees on account of unwarranted insurance outgo alone, in addition to the awarded claim of Rs 26.82 crore ordered by the arbitration tribunal in favour of Gati. To this has to be added the cost of conversion of these aircraft from passenger to cargo configuration," the ICPA letter said.
The union said that these losses are being incurred at a time when salaries and allowances are being cut unilaterally and when the management claims that it is an everyday fight for them to pay full salaries to the staff and meet other day-to-day operating expenses.

Pak hits 15 border outposts  villages in Jammu  3 injuredPak targets 15 posts in Jammu, seeks UN help
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  Jammu, October 12, 2014

Pakistan heavily shelled 15 border outposts and hamlets in Arnia sector of Jammu and Kashmir early Sunday even as it wrote to UN chief Ban Ki-moon blaming India for the escalation in border clashes and sought UN intervention on Kashmir.
The shelling, the first since Thursday, injured three people and ends a pause in fighting that has already killed 19 civilians in the two countries in the worst skirmishes in a decade. The Pakistan foreign ministry has claimed that Indian firing over the past month has killed 12 and injured 52 of its civilians.

In the letter to Ban, foreign affairs adviser to Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif, Sartaj Aziz, accused India of ‘deliberate and unprovoked violations of the ceasefire agreement and cross-border firing’. He also appealed for UN’s assistance in resolving the dispute with India over the status of Kashmir.
Though there was no formal reaction from New Delhi, India has long maintained that disputes between it and Pakistan should be resolved bilaterally under the framework of the Shimla agreement and Lahore declaration.
 India also considers the UN observer group on Kashmir to have outlived its utility and has criticised Pakistan for depending on a ‘tool of a bygone era’ to address the problems of the present.

The latest round of shelling  by Pakistan comes a week after five people were killed in Arnia.
“Flat trajectory weaponry fire started at 8.10pm (Saturday) on three border posts in Arnia and continued till early morning,” a BSF spokesperson said.
The fresh firing has forced authorities to drop any moves to allow the nearly 30,000 people living in government relief camps to return to their homes.

Microsoft CEO in hot water on pay gapMicrosoft CEO to women: Not asking for a raise is 'good karma'
By Charles Riley   @CRrileyCNN October 10, 2014: 1:46 AM ET
 
Microsoft CEO's gender gap gaffe
HONG KONG (CNNMoney)
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has disavowed controversial comments he made at a women's tech conference, including the suggestion that women who don't ask for raises will receive "good karma."
"Was inarticulate [on] how women should ask for raise," Nadella said on Twitter following his appearance at the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing conference in Phoenix, Arizona. "Our industry must close gender pay gap so a raise is not needed because of a bias."
At the conference, Nadella implied that instead of asking for a raise, women should have faith that they will be rewarded over the long arc of a career.
"That ... might be one of the additional superpowers, that quite frankly, women who don't ask for raises have," he said. "Because that's good karma. It will come back."
Related: Microsoft CEO skewered on Twitter over 'karma' comment
Women make nearly $11,000 less each year than men, according to the U.S. Census Bureau's latest report on income and poverty. That translates to women making 78 cents to every dollar made by men. For the last several years it has been 77 cents on the dollar, making this year's figures a tiny improvement.
 
Why investing in women pays off
In an email sent to Microsoft ( MSFT , Tech30 ) employees and published on the company's website, the CEO said he answered the question "completely wrong."
"I believe men and women should get equal pay for equal work," Nadella wrote. "If you think you deserve a raise, you should just ask."
Related: Satya Nadella outblunders Steve Ballmer
Nadella, a 22-year veteran at Microsoft, was elevated to the CEO position in February. He had been overseeing various aspects of the company's corporate software business since 1992.
His comments drew intense criticism on social media. The comments were also challenged by Maria Klawe, the session's moderator, who is also the president of Harvey Mudd College and a board member at Microsoft.
Klawe said she had lost tens of thousands of dollars by not being more assertive in salary negotiations.
Related: Sarah Silverman is tired of the 'vagina tax'
"Do your homework," she told the crowd. "Make sure you actually know what a reasonable salary is when you're offered a job. Do not be as stupid as I was."
Microsoft recently released workplace diversity statistics showing it has a problem with gender imbalance -- particularly at the leadership level -- as much like other leading tech firms.
Microsoft's workforce is 71% male, a figure that rises to 83% for both technical and leadership roles. Those figures are roughly in line with the gender breakdown at Google , Facebook , Yahoo and Apple .

F1: Hamilton wins inaugural Russian GP  Mercedes take constructors  crownprint
Lewis Hamilton reeled off his fourth consecutive victory to extend his lead in the Formula One drivers' title race and secure Mercedes' maiden triumph in the constructors' championship on Sunday when he won the inaugural Russian Grand Prix in emphatic fashion.
The 29-year-old Briton, starting from his 38th pole position, cruised to the 31st success of his career to draw level with fellow-Englishman Nigel Mansell in the record books, finishing the race 13.657 seconds ahead of Mercedes teammate and nearest rival German Nico Rosberg.
Hamilton's win lifted him 17 points clear of Rosberg, who made a mistake on the opening lap and, after a pit stop, recovered from the back of the field. Hamilton now has 291 points to Rosberg's 274 with three races remaining.
Just a week after Jules Bianchi's life-threatening accident in the storm-hit Japanese Grand Prix, where the French driver suffered severe head injuries, the race was preceded by tributes to support his fight for life in hospital in Yokkaichi.
Hamilton's win was his ninth this year and the result delivered Mercedes' ninth one-two of the season as they ended Red Bull's four-year dominance of the teams' crown. They will now aim to beat McLaren's record of 10 wins set in 1988.
Finn Valtteri Bottas finished third for Williams ahead of Briton Jenson Button and his McLaren teammate, Danish rookie Kevin Magnussen, with two-time champion Fernando Alonso of Spain finishing sixth for Ferrari after an inspired, but troubled, drive.
Australian Daniel Ricciardo was seventh for Red Bull ahead of departing German teammate and four-time champion Sebastian Vettel and Finn Kimi Raikkonen, in the second Ferrari. Mexican Sergio Perez was 10th for Force India.
"Congratulations to the team on the constructors' championship - history in the making," said Hamilton afterwards on team radio before he and the other leading finishers met Russian President Vladimir Putin, who arrived at the circuit with 14 laps remaining to preside over the podium ceremony.
"Sorry, guys," said Rosberg. "That was very unnecessary (his attack on lap one), but thank you for the unbelievable car that allowed me to fight back to take second."
On a hazy, warm day under blue skies and air temperatures of 22 degrees, the race was preceded by ceremonies dedicated to support for Bianchi, around an on-track message that declared 'Jules we are all supporting you'.
The tributes were emotional and palpable and many drivers appeared to be moved before they returned to their teams for the start.
At the off, Hamilton steered diagonally to his right to lead Rosberg towards Turn One, a mild kink en route to Turn Two where the German locked up under braking, as he passed inside Hamilton and ran wide across the run-off area.
For Rosberg, it was an expensive rush of blood. His journey across the brightly-coloured escape zone lifted him into the lead only briefly before his race engineer asked him to 'give position back to Lewis, please.'
Rosberg did so, falling to second before pitting immediately to replace his flat-spotted tyres and re-joining at the back of the field.
Rosberg was soon finding his rhythm, rising to 16th by lap eight, and the top 10 soon after, encouraged by his engineer's message that he was fast enough to finish on the podium.  By lap 24, he was seventh and Hamilton held a 12.6sec lead ahead of Bottas.
Button pitted on lap 23, conceding third to Alonso who was 26 seconds adrift. Two laps later Bottas pitted before Alonso came in for a bungled Ferrari stop that saw his car twice dropped early by the front jack man.
All this left Alonso down in ninth behind Massa, who had driven magnificently from the back for Williams. Rosberg rose again to fifth on lap 26 and then, with a forceful move on Bottas, to second on lap 31, when Vettel had pitted.
For the Russian crowd, unfortunately, home favourite Daniil Kvyat was unable to shine as he slipped from his best grid position of fifth down to 14th in his Toro Rosso while the Anglo-Russian Marussia team's sole entrant Briton Max Chilton was forced to retire due to vibrations.
"It's been a very, very difficult week for the team and everyone in the F1 family," he said. "It was hard on the grid and all the drivers were struggling, but hopefully they are putting on a good show for Jules. It's just a shame we couldn't complete the race for him."

AOL has tapped Viacom exec  Dermot McCormack as president of its video division, replacing Ran Harnevo , who is leaving the company to pursue other opportunities.
Harnevo has been with AOL since its September 2010 acquisition of 5min Media, the web-video startup he co-founded and led as CEO. After his exit, Harnevo will remain executive producer of AOL’s first long-form original series, “Connected.”
McCormack will lead AOL’s video businesses, comprising about 200 employees. That includes AOL On, the Internet media company’s 14 video channels; the Be On branded-content platform; and AOL Studios, which produces and distributes original programming. At Viacom, he most recently ran Viacom Music & Logo’s Connect Content Group, in charge of all digital initiatives for MTV, VH1, CMT and Logo.
“Dermot is a game-changing talent with experience exactly where we need it — building audiences through engaging programming — and is the person I expect to take AOL’s video efforts to the next level, building on our significant success to date and increasing the pace of our innovation and growth,” AOL CEO Tim Armstrong said in announcing the hire.
Harnevo, in a statement provided by AOL, said, “Building 5min Media as a small startup and then getting acquired four years later to keep going full speed and reach our vision, was the best experience in my professional life… Dermot is the right person to lead AOL On forward, and now it’s time for me to return to my entrepreneurial roots.”
On Twitter, Harnevo put it this way:
Time for me to take a deep breath and a rest. And then go back to what I realized I love to do most – being an entrepreneur, inventing shit
— Ran Harnevo (@harnevo) October 7, 2014
McCormack, 45, starts at AOL on Thursday, Oct. 9. He reports to Armstrong and Bob Lord, CEO of the AOL Platforms advertising and technology group, and will be based in both New York City and Los Angeles.
“I’ve been working in the emerging content space of (traditional) media companies for several years,” McCormack said in an interview. “I feel like there’s a whole reinvention that will happen over the next five to 10 years. It’s an interesting evolutionary time.”
McCormack will largely be based in NYC, also overseeing the video tech team in Tel Aviv, Israel, and Beverly Hills-based AOL Studios, which is headed by Nate Hayden following the departure of Gabriel Lewis , who joined Disney’s Maker Studios in August.
Before joining Viacom in 2008, McCormack was Cablevision Systems’ SVP of interactive product management and was co-founder and chief technology officer of online-gift currency startup Flooz.com. Prior to that, McCormack, was one of the first executives at iVillage.com, where he led advertising products and strategy.
Since 2011, AOL has launched nearly 50 original series since 2011, and its library of curated and original video content is now distributed on 15 connected devices, including Apple TV and Roku.

CBI starts probe against IRDA, Reliance General Insurance
PTI Oct 12, 2014, 09.24PM IST

CBI
(The agency has named Reliance…)
NEW DELHI: CBI has started a probe into alleged undervaluation of penalty to the tune of nearly Rs 17,500 crore on Reliance General Insurance Company Limited by the officials of Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority(IRDA) in 2009.
The agency has named Reliance General Insurance Company in its inquiry and "unknown officials" of the Authority, CBI sources here said today.
"CBI has registered a preliminary enquiry against unknown officials of Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority and a private company on allegations that a penalty of Rs 20 lakh (approximately) was imposed on the said company instead of Rs 17,500 crore for 3.5 lakh instances of violations of IRDA guidelines," CBI spokesperson Kanchan Prasad said.
According to IRDA penalty order in 2009, the company had sold 3.5 lakh policies and each policy constituted a violation thereby making company liable for a penalty of Rs 17,500 crore. But only Rs 20 lakh of penalty was actually levied, it said.
The then Chairman J Hari Narayan who signed the order has already been quizzed, CBI sources said, adding that they are trying to understand if there was a mala fide or a quid pro quo in the order.
The allegations relate to Reliance Health Care policy which was sent to IRDA in 2005 for necessary clearances which was cleared in 2006.
A Reliance General Insurance spokesperson said the allegation that penalties of Rs 17,500 crore could have been imposed in this matter is baseless, unfounded and devoid of any legal foundation.
The total premium collected under the policies issued more than five years back was Rs 80 crore, against which claims of Rs 140 crore were paid, resulting in huge losses to RGCIL, the spokesperson said.
The penalty of Rs 20 lakh imposed was itself thus highly excessive and unwarranted, and the allegation that this represented a 'favour' to RGCIL is far-fetched and imaginary.
"We welcome any enquiry into the exercise of discretion by IRDA in this matter, which is identical to penalties imposed on all leading insurers in the country," the spokesperson said.
Narayan is reported having said that the insinuation that he had favoured RGICL was unfounded.
In 2006, IRDA revised guidelines or 'File and Use' specifying various other procedural and other requirements to be followed by the insurers. "These revised guidelines required the prior approval in case change in the name or any of the terms and conditions or an increase in the price of the product," the IRDA order had said.

Hudhud: South Odisha fears floods after cycloneChakapada
("Heavy rains lashed in the…)
BERHAMPUR ( ODISHA ): With the southern districts of Ganjam, Gajapati and Kandhamal receiving heavy rainfall due to cyclone Hudhud , the local administration has started preparations for floods if such a situation arises.
While the water level of river Bansadhara is flowing near its danger level at Kasinagar in Gajapati district, water level in other rivers like Rushikulya at Sorada, Purushottampur and Aska are in upward trend.
The water level of Bansadhara at Kasinagar was 54.10 meters as against its red mark of 54.60 meters.
Since more rainfall in the catchment areas of the river Rushikulya, Bansadhara, Baitarani and their tributaries are expected, these districts may face flood situation.
The administration is now bracing to face the flood. "We have identified some flood-prone areas to evacuate the people, if the flood situation arises," said Ganjam District Collector Prem Chandra Chaudhary.
The NDRF and fire services personnel were deployed in flood-prone areas to evacuate people, he said
"We are monitoring water level of different rivers to take the precautionary measures to face the flood situation, if arise," Chaudhary said.
"No damage was reported from anywhere due to the cyclone and rains in Ganjam district," the collector added.
"We have already evacuated the people from the vulnerable areas near Kasinagar," said Gajapati Collector Mansi Nimbhal.
Around 57,000 people were evacuated and housed in 625 shelters.
"As a precautionary measure, we have released water from different reserves to store the rainwater," said chief engineer-cum-basin manager, Rushikulya, Vansadhara and Nagabali Gyana Ranjan Mohanty.
Almost all the reservoirs in the districts are presently below their full reserve level.
The by-poll bound Kandhamal district also received heavy rainfall under the influence of cyclonic storm system.
"Heavy rains lashed in the district, but there is no damage report from anywhere in the district," said Kandhamal Collector N. Thirumala Naik.
On an average, 65 mm rainfall was recorded in Daringibadi, Raikia and Chakapada blocks.
The by-election for the Kandhamal Lok Sabha election will be held on October 15. The polling parties would be dispatched on Monday.
"We think there will be no problem to go to the polling stations," said Naik, who is also the returning officer.

More than 1.5 lakh evacuated in four districts of Andhra Pradesh
Ahead of Cyclone Hudhud, classified as very severe, more than 1.5 lakh people have been evacuated to 370 relief camps and shelters from four frontline districts of Visakhapatnam, Srikakulam, Vizianagaram and East Godavari of Andhra Pradesh on Saturday. With expected rainfall of up to 45 cm and wind speeds of 180 kmph, Hudhud is due to make landfall between Visakhapatnam and Kalingapatnam in Srikakulam district on Sunday morning.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi reviewed the situation, and asked Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh to remain in touch with the Chief Ministers of Andhra Pradesh and Odisha. Director of the Cyclone Warning Centre Ramachandra Rao said Hudhud was within the range of the Doppler Weather Radar.
Even after landfall, the system would maintain the intensity of a very severe cyclonic storm for six hours and only gradually weaken while moving northwest across south interior Odisha and Chhattisgarh.
