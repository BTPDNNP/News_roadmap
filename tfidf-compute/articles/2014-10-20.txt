Rajnikanth says  glad  to see Jaya back in her residenceRajnikanth says 'glad' to see Jayalalithaa back in her residence

Actor Rajnikanth on Sunday said he was 'glad' to see AIADMK chief J Jayalalithaa back in her Poes Garden residence after being granted bail in a graft case and wished her good health and peace.
"I am very glad to have you back in Poes Garden. Praying for good times for you. Always wishing you well for good health and peace," he said in a letter to the former chief minister.
In the letter released by the AIADMK headquarters, he also wished Jayalalithaa Happy Deepavali.
Incidentally, the Tamil icon also resides in the same Poes Garden area.
Press release by AIADMK
Meanwhile, Union minister for women and child development Maneka Gandhi also wrote to the former chief minister, hoping to see her "formally back at the helm of administration again."
Expressing her support and sympathy with Jayalalithaa, who stepped out of a Bangalore jail on Saturday after the Supreme Court granted her bail in an illegal assets case, Gandhi said she would be happy to do anything "to make this time less onerous."
"You have been through a great deal of suffering in your life and it is remarkable how you have always managed, through discipline and courage, to overcome the odds against you," she said in the letter released by AIADMK.
Gandhi told Jayalalithaa she was sure "this time will be over soon and we will see you formally back at the helm of administration again."     
Saying Jayalalithaa had done "remarkable things" for Tamil Nadu, Gandhi wished good health for the 66 year-old leader, adding she had "many admirers across the country."
Jayalalithaa was granted bail by the Supreme Court in the Rs. 66.65 crore disproportionate assets case on Friday and was released from the Parappana Agrahara prison in Bangalore on Saturday

Easy Rider chopper sells at auction for $1.35 million; is it the real one'Easy Rider' chopper sells at auction for $1.35 million. But is it the real one?
AP

A motorcycle reportedly featured in the film 'Easy Rider' has been sold for what auctioneers say was $1.35 million.
The Profiles in History auction house did not identify the buyer with Saturday night's winning bid for the "Captain America" red, white and blue, chromed-out chopper.
Spokeswoman Sabrina Propper said bidding was fierce for the Harley-Davidson that the house said was ridden by Peter Fonda in the 1969 counterculture cult movie.

More than one version of the bike was built but according to the auction catalog, the one that sold was the only one to survive.
According to the catalog, it was used in the climactic crash sequence at the end of the film and restored by Dan Haggerty, who had a bit part in the film and vouched for its authenticity. Fonda, who played Wyatt and rode the bike in the movie, also vouched for its authenticity, according to the auction house.
The seller, Michael Eisenberg, also has a letter from the National Motorcycle Museum in Anamosa, Iowa, which displayed the bike for 12 years, saying Eisenberg's is the only surviving "Captain America" bike.
But another collector, Gordon Granger of Texas, says he owns the authentic chopper and also has a certificate signed by Haggerty to prove it.
Haggerty acknowledged to the Los Angeles Times this week that he authenticated and sold two "Captain America" bikes.
Now Haggerty says just one of the bikes is legitimate, and it's Eisenberg's - the one sold by the auction house.
For his part, Fonda says he has no idea which bike is the real one.
"There's a big rat stinking someplace in this," the 74-year-old actor, who co-wrote "Easy Rider," told the Times.
Eisenberg, a Los Angeles real estate agent and collector of Hollywood memorabilia, bought his chopper earlier this year from John Parham, a Midwestern motorcycle parts magnate who had purchased the bike from Haggerty 12 years earlier.
Michael Eisenberg, sits on the customized Captain America chopper he says Peter Fonda rode in Easy Rider in Calabasas, California. (AP photo)
 
Haggerty did not deny that he also signed Granger's authenticating documents. He now says he signed something that simply was not true.
"That was my mistake," Haggerty said. "It's not the real bike."
Granger, furious about the auction, insists he owns the genuine article.
"They know damn well they don't have the real bike," Granger said. "I own the original remaining "Captain America" bike. The one to be auctioned is a replica."
The chopper features a forward-angled front wheel and handlebars, fishtail exhaust pipes and a teardrop-shaped gas tank where the movie's protagonists stashed their cash. It was designed with input from Fonda who insisted on it being decorated with the American flag.
The catalog says the bike - which was sold by Michael Eisenberg - was restored by Dan Haggerty.
But Gordon Granger of Texas says he owns the authentic chopper and also has a certificate from Haggerty.
Haggerty has acknowledged that he authenticated and sold two "Captain America" bikes.
But he said before the sale that just one was legitimate - Eisenberg's.

5-yr-old Indian reaches Everest Base Camp; claims world recordComments
As snowstorms lashed Nepal’s Himalayan region few days ago, a five-year-old boy from New Delhi and his father stayed indoors at a small lodge in Pheriche, a village in the Everest region located 4371 meters above sea level.
They were worried that the mission that they had set out to accomplish could get jeopardized midway. But the weather cleared two days later and they set out again towards their goal.

On Friday, Harshit Saumitra, a Class 1 student of GD Goenka School in New Delhi, reached the Everest Base Camp (5364 m), becoming arguably the youngest person to complete the difficult trek.
It took the child 10 days to cover the distance of 62km trek, many sections of which were covered by 5-7 inch of snow from the snowstorm caused by the tail-end of cyclone Hudhud.
“I felt very good. I unfurled the tricolor at the Everest Base Camp,” said Harshit at a press meet here after his return from the trek. He also climbed the Kalapathar (5550 m) peak located near the EBC.With this feat the child overtakes the record set by Aaryan Balaji, a seven-year old Indian boy who had reached EBC and Kalapathar peak in May 2012.
“We were worried that Harshit might experience altitude sickness. But he didn’t face any problem,” said the child’s father Rajeev Saumitra, a mountaineer who had reached the peak of Mount Everest (8848 m) last year.
The family plans to register the feat in record books like the Guinness World Records and the Limca Book of World Records by submitting the necessary proofs.
Harshit who climbed Rohtang Pass (3930 m) before attempting EBC has his eyes set on climbing Mount Kilimanjaro (5895 m) in Africa next and plans to attempt Mount Everest (8848 m) in a few years.

Single  successful: BJP upsets dynamics of alliance politicsComments
The results of the Maharashtra and Haryana assembly elections have set the stage for what could turn out to be a turning point in the country’s politics with the BJP poised to take on a host of regional parties in state elections in the next one-and-a-half years.

With BJP president Amit Shah’s gamble of going it alone paying off in the latest assembly elections, the party is likely to follow the template in future elections starting with Jammu and Kashmir and Jharkhand in the next few weeks and Bihar next year. While the BJP allied with regional parties in the past, it has never been coy about its preference for bipolar polity.
After it vanquished the Congress in the parliamentary election and now its traditional strongholds of Haryana and Maharashtra, the BJP will be inclined to ride on the continuing Narendra Modi wave to end the dominance of regional players. The BJP had never contested more than 26 seats in Haryana and more than 119 in Maharashtra; the party’s tally in these two states post-results leaves no ambiguity about the success of Shah’s bold, if risky, strategy.
According to party sources, if there has to be an alliance--like the one with the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) of Ramvilas Paswan and the Rashtriya Lok Samata party (RLSP) of Upendra Kushwaha in Bihar--the BJP will not be a junior party in it.
Most immediately, the BJP’s massive win may mean shrinking bargaining space for JVM(P) leader Babulal Marandi in Jharkhand, who had rejected the BJP’s offer of a merger and has been playing hardball in back channel talks for an alliance.
Further down the road, regional parties are also likely to face the heat in Assam, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Puducherry which are set to go to the polls early in 2016.
In Assam, the BJP will be inclined to replace its erstwhile ally AGP to mount a challenge to the ruling Congress. Similarly, given the visible surge in its support base in West Bengal in the Lok Sabha election, the party will be looking to elbow out the Left and the Congress to emerge as the principal challenger to the ruling Trinamool Congress.
The success of the go-it-alone policy in Haryana and Maharashtra is also likely to have a bearing on political equations in Punjab where coalition partner BJP is learnt to be uneasy about people’s growing disillusionment with the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD).

BJP set to rule Haryana  largest party in MaharashtraComments
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) stormed to power in Haryana on Sunday and was set to form the government in Maharashtra as well, in a verdict that underlined Prime Minister Narendra Modi's indisputable role in helping expand the party's national footprint.
 
Both victories are historic for the BJP. In Haryana, where the party had never been a force, it won 47 seats in a 90-member assembly to take power on its own. In Maharashtra, it emerged as the single largest party, bagging 122 seats in the 288-member House — which is enough to form a coalition government on its own terms.

The party had taken a huge a gamble by going it alone in both states, which have either been traditional Congress strongholds or led by regional forces, but its decision to sever ties with its allies paid off.
 
Sunday's verdict sets the momentum for the party's campaign for a string of assembly polls over the next two years. It gives the BJP significant political leverage over the country's financial capital, Mumbai, and enhances its capacity for quick political mobilization in the region around the national capital, New Delhi.

Modi's intensive campaigning in both states helped the party, but its win was also partly a result of severe anti-incumbency sentiment against the Congress. Allegations of corruption and crony capitalism plagued both the Bhupinder Singh Hooda government in Chandigarh and the Congress-NCP alliance in Mumbai.
 
BJP president Amit Shah said the results were a vindication of the leadership of Modi who won a landslide victory in the April-May Lok Sabha elections.
"This is a reply to those who said after a few bypoll results that the Modi wave is over. It shows Modiji is the undisputed leader … the Modi wave is like a tsunami which has drowned everyone," he said.
As BJP supporters erupted in celebrations, the mood at the Congress camp was sombre. The grand old party suffered another humiliating defeat in the assembly elections after its worst-ever performance in the Lok Sabha elections earlier this year.
"We accept the verdict of people. People have voted for a change, after 15 years of our government in Maharashtra and 10 years in Haryana," Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi said in a statement.
He added the Congress will "work hard on the ground to once again earn the confidence of the people".
Highlights
 
 
The BJP's win was particularly stunning in Haryana where it leapt to a majority from just four seats in the previous assembly. The party's victory was largely a result of its decision to turn old caste equations on their head and mobilise non-Jat social groups in the state.
The saffron party won 47 seats, one more than the magic number. The Indian National Lok Dal (INLD), whose chief Om Prakash Chautala is in the Tihar jail in connection with a recruitment scam, came second with 19 seats.

The Congress won 15 seats, while the Haryana Janhit Congress (HJC) - BJP's estranged ally - bagged two seats.
In Maharashtra, the party's decision to campaign alone after snapping ties with its 25-year-old ally, the Shiv Sena, turned out to be a winning strategy as it established the BJP as the dominant partner. It was hoping for a majority win, but its showing was still impressive.
It had never contested more than 119 seats in the past and won more seats this time than it had ever fought earlier. Its vote share jumped from 14% to close to 28%, establishing the BJP as the clear senior partner in any future alliance.
 
The Sena, fighting alone in the polls, won 63 seats and hinted that it was ready for talks with the BJP. However, Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray also indicated that it will not approach the BJP on its own.  
Some reports said Uddhav congratulated Modi and BJP chief Shah after the writing on the wall was clear in signs that he too was warming up to the party.
Intense negotiations are expected over the next few days in the state, but Shah categorically said the BJP will form a government in Maharashtra. "There will be a BJP government and there will be a BJP chief minister in the state."

Union Minister Nitin Gadkari, considered close to RSS leadership, has been offered the post of Maharashtra CM, party sources said.  They said Gadkari was reluctant but had been given a couple of days to decide; clarity is expected in a day or two.
Devendra Fadnavis, a fellow politician from Nagpur, is a strong contender for the job. The BJP’s parliamentary board has decided to send home minister Rajnath Singh to Mumbai as central observer to oversee the election of BJP legislature party leader.
 
The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) offered outside support to a BJP-led government, triggering talks of new political equations in the wake of the verdict. Sharad Pawar's NCP could bag just 41 seats in these elections.
Its past ally, the Congress, however, was the worst affected. It won just 42 seats, down from the 82 it was able to bag in 2009.

Won t extend unsolicited support to BJP: Uddhav | Liveblog | CoverageBal Thackeray
(Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray today…)
MUMBAI: Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray today made it clear his party will not lend unsolicited support to BJP in forming the government in Maharashtra, saying "let them make the first move".
"I am sitting at my home peacefully, if somebody thinks our support is needed, they can approach us. Somebody from that side (BJP) should come to us with a proposal. How can I go about offering my support?" he told reporters as the poll threw up a hung Assembly and BJP was set to form its government with surprise backing from NCP.
"What if I approach them and they say no and tell me we already have NCP's support," he asked.
Uddhav said if BJP was okay with NCP's support, "let them go with NCP".
About BJP patriarch L K Advani's comments favouring a reunion with Shiv Sena, Uddhav said," This is what I had expected. When Balasaheb (Sena founder Bal Thackeray), Atal Behari Vajpayee, Advani, Pramod Mahajan and Gopinath Munde were around, ours was not just a political alliance, but a close relationship."
"We have secured 60 seats which is not a bad performance," he said, adding "nobody can corner me."
"We defeated those who caused anguish to late Bal Thackeray ," Uddhav said, in an apparent reference to the defeat of former Sena leaders Narayan Rane and Ganesh Naik.
He also raised the issue of creation of a Vidarbha state, a cause supported by BJP and staunchly opposed by Shiv Sena, saying, "We are ready to extend support if we get an assurance that Maharashtra will remain united."

http://tcrn.ch/1CCjoDNHandbook For A New Era Of Crowdfunding
Posted
#Gamergate Shows Tech Needs Far Better Algorithms
Editor’s note: Sandeep Sood is founder of Oakland, Calif.-based Monsoon+RainFactory , a product house that conceptualizes, designs, develops and markets mobile and web applications.
Ever been to Indiegogo? Kickstarter? Spend any cash? What’d you leave with? Why does anyone buy a product that doesn’t exist yet…and may never exist? On the surface, crowdfunding seems to defy logic. Economists find the phenomenon of crowdfunding startling. If you think like an economist, crowdfunding shouldn’t work. But it does. And those who understand why it works are able to get results every time.
Why Does Crowdfunding Work?
There’s no amount of economic acrobatics or consumer rationalization that can explain it. That doesn’t mean there’s no explanation. I’ve seen it work first-hand a dozen times — predictably. The explanations move you beyond logic into behavioral psychology.You need to understand how crowdfunding works because it has become a driving force for everything from hardware products to startup investing. Figure out what the economists can’t, and you’re on your way to making crowdfunding work for you.
Instead of going to the bank and putting up collateral to fund their crazy idea, entrepreneurs  tap into a world that is seeking out connections and ideas everyday. Just hack together a passable prototype, and a product is making money from day one without giving up a thing. No stock, no IOUs, nothing.
People back these entrepreneurs knowing this. Based on a video and a few paragraphs. To buy a product that may never get built at all. Why? Are we so in need of a story that we’ll open up our wallets to anyone taking a risk? Because some dude with a cooler looks like he’s having a lot of fun? Maybe.
I’ve taken a long hard look at crowdfunding behaviors. What makes people want to give to some projects and not others? It’s more than just altruism and some irrational gift economy gumming up the works of the supply-and-demand machine, as the New York Times suggested. It’s an emotional thing, and it’s bigger than logic.
First comes love. Backers often want something so badly, they’ll do anything for it to exist. On Kickstarter or Indiegogo, when someone sees a product they love, made by someone they believe in, backing is a way of throwing their hat into the ring. They wager what it takes to realize an idea, even if there’s risk involved. It doesn’t matter if they can’t enjoy the result right away. Love is patient. Love is kind.
Next, backing a crowdfunding campaign is essentially a chance to shape the way things are. It’s influence, and it gives backers an outlet where they can be creative. Even if it’s just vicariously. Throw in a little surprise (nine months later something shows up in the mail) and bang, they didn’t just buy something. They were part of an experience from start to finish, and research shows buying an experience makes us far happier than buying things.
Build your campaign around love of the product and a chance to make a dent in the universe, and you’re a step ahead of the game. Instead of economics, let these emotional impulses guide your decisions for what you build, how many you build, how much you charge, and what you give away. If everything you do isn’t helping people feel—love and vicarious creativity—your crowdfunding campaign doesn’t have much of a chance.
Ingredients for a Successful Campaign
Here’s your challenge: Your competition is getting bigger, corporations are testing out new products, and venture capitalists are using crowdfunding as a proving ground before they shell out any cash. I’m not saying it’s not grassroots anymore, but there’s a newer, bigger movement that overshadows the small guys we send to Sundance every year. Here are five considerations to use in the new era of crowdfunding:
1. Story, Story, Story
Platforms like Indiegogo and Kickstarter were designed for storytelling. Anyone can sell a product off a shelf. How many can sell thousands before they’ve been made? Only the ones that capture our imagination. Bring people along on your journey. Where did your idea come from? How will it change their lives?
The JIBO robot was born out of a family who was tired of fumbling with technology. Tile suggests that if you use its chips to keep track of stuff you lose track off, you’ll have time to find something big, like a husband. A good narrative can make unremarkable garage-sale items sell for 50 times more than what they’re worth. What can it do for you?
2. Partners
Every campaign’s got the same tools to tell its story. It’s about how well you use them that’ll make the difference. My guess is, there are some things you’d be better off leaving to the pros.
Video Producers. The first thing people do is watch your video. My advice: get some all-stars who know how to make an emotional pitch and can package it up nicely. It’s hard to talk about yourself, and even harder to look good doing it.  Consider agencies that work JUST in video, such as Sandwich Video (which launched Coin), and Feedback LLC (which launched Tile).
PR Campaign. PR companies orchestrate launches like Houston blasts rockets. Get the timing right and get the right people talking about your product. Organic traffic from your crowdsourcing platform won’t account for much more than 10 percent of a successful campaign’s booty, so you’re going to have to look elsewhere. PR firms such as Inner Circle Labs (which launched Jibo), JumpStarter PR, or BAM Communications (which focuses on innovation) should be considered.
Marketing Agency. Get a marketing team that understands technical marketing and how to design and develop compelling web and mobile experiences, such as Wareness.io and Agency20, which focus just on crowdfunding. You’ll want them to launch and manage your funnel, but they should also be thinking about your user experience and building you a website that can serve as the traffic hub of your campaign.
3. A Real Ad Budget
Have a budget of at least $50,000 to start. Grassroots isn’t dead, but it isn’t growing, either. Making people feel emotionally invested in your product is table stakes. You’ve got to start there. But advertising is the only thing that gives your campaign legs and makes it predictable. Everything else is holding your breath and hoping for the waters to part. So build advertising into your budget, and if you’re raising funding, start with at least that much.
Plan to spend your first $50K learning. Figure out what you need to spend to acquire one new customer. Scale that to 10. Test the crap out of it. Then, scale that to a thousand, ten thousand, and a hundred thousand. Test a variety of media and ad channels. If you have a solid product and stay diligent, you will reach a point where you’re spending what you need to spend on each customer to make long-term money. Hear that humming? That’s the sound of your very own perpetual money machine. Don’t worry, you’ll get used to it.
4. A Storefront
If you didn’t get it by now, we’re not really talking about crowdfunding as a “campaign.” This is the new way to market your product. Don’t just think of Kickstarter or Indiegogo as some punctuated thing that’s going to end. Make it your storefront and your e-commerce engine. Use the crowdsourcing platform as a way to accept payment and take control over how you tell your story. You need your own site in addition to any platform you’re using. You can build your own site and sell people on your own even if you are using platforms like Indiegogo and Kickstarter.
When your crowdfunding campaign is over, your team should be ready to make some tweaks and turn this into your store. Nothing is wasted. Your crowdfunding campaign isn’t some moonshot gamble; it’s the beginning of everything.
5. The Wild Card
Like I said, everyone’s working with the same materials. But some repurpose them in a way that no one’s ever done before. Exaggerate what makes you different. Have a gaming product? Maybe you let people unlock achievements and new levels of contribution. Weight loss tool? Perhaps track total pounds lost in parallel with funds earned. Don’t be afraid to let your personality set you apart from the noise.
It is now possible to develop your product and your customer base simultaneously. We’re only beginning to realize the implications here — in an era where we can prototype groundbreaking products in our garage, we can also practice telling our story to millions of customers, learning what will and won’t make them fall in love.
This is the way we build (products and customers) now. And the crowd is going wild.

China-Afghan-Pak discuss roadmap for stabilityafghanistan
(The three countries discussed…)
ISLAMABAD: China, Afghanistan and Pakistan today held trilateral dialogue here and discussed a range of strategic issues including drawing a roadmap for regional cooperation on war-torn Afghanistan and strengthening ties among them for peace and stability in the region.
The two-day track 1.5 dialogue among officials and experts of the three countries was organised by Pakistan-China Institute (PCI) and German agency Konrad Adeneaur Stiftung.
The three countries discussed different strategic issues to draw a roadmap for the future and to seek regional cooperation on Afghanistan.
Chinese Ambassador Sun Weidong said the conference provides a vital platform to strengthen communication and cooperation among the three nations.
Sun said the international cooperation should help the war-torn Afghanistan to maintain its sovereignty and territorial integrity after the first peaceful democratic transition.
He said that Pakistan and China have close cooperation in countering terrorism which is a threat to both countries.
"China supports Pakistan's efforts to promote dialogue and improve relations with Afghanistan," he said.
Afghan Ambassador Janan Mosazai said Afghanistan would never allow its soil to be used against peace and security of its neighbours.
He said that Afghanistan was eager to deepen relations with their all neighbours including China and Pakistan.
PCI chief Mushahid Hussain said that 21st century is the 'Asian Century' and Asian countries must decide their own destiny.
He said the institute was working to bring the three countries close to each other.
"Cooperation between Pakistan, China and Afghanistan would form the crux of the tripartite initiative which was the core objective of the dialogue," a statement from the PCI said.
The two-day conference will discuss presence of Afghan refugees in Pakistan, cross-border terrorist movement, capacity of the Afghan national security forces, protection of foreign investments in Afghanistan.
The first such conference was held in Beijing in August last year.

Hong Kong street clashes erupt despite immin...Hong Kong street clashes erupt despite imminent talks

The worst political crisis in Hong Kong since Britain handed the free-wheeling city back to China in 1997 entered its fourth week with no sign of a resolution.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
HONG KONG: Violent clashes erupted in Hong Kong early on Sunday for a second night, deepening a sense of impasse between a government with limited options and a pro-democracy movement increasingly willing to confront police.
The worst political crisis in Hong Kong since Britain handed the free-wheeling city back to China in 1997 entered its fourth week with no sign of a resolution despite talks scheduled on Tuesday between the government and student protest leaders.
Beijing has signalled through Hong Kong's leaders that it is not willing to reverse a decision in late August that effectively denies the financial hub the full democracy the protesters are demanding for an election in 2017.
"Unless there is some kind of breakthrough in two hours of talks on Tuesday, I'm worried we will see the standoff worsen and get violent," Sonny Lo, a professor at the Hong Kong Institute of Education, told Reuters.
"We could be entering a new and much more problematic stage. I hope the government has worked out some compromises, because things could get very difficult now."
Hong Kong's Beijing-backed leader Leung Chun-ying, who has so far resisted calls to quit, said more time was needed to broker what he hoped would be a non-violent end to the upheaval.
"To work out a solution, to put an end to this problem, we need time. We need time to talk to the people, particularly young students," he told Hong Kong's ATV Television. "What I want is to see a peaceful and a meaningful end to this problem."
Hong Kong's 28,000 strong police have been struggling to contain a youth-led movement that has shown little sign of waning after three weeks of standoffs.
Roughly a thousand demonstrators in the Mong Kok district launched a fresh assault early on Sunday, putting on helmets and goggles before surging forward to grab a line of metal barricades hemming them into a section of road.
Scores of riot police had smashed batons at a wall of umbrellas that protesters raised to defend themselves. Amid shouts and hurled insults, violent scuffles erupted before police surged forward with shields, forcing the crowds back.
One activist in a white T-shirt and goggles was hit with a flurry of baton blows, leaving him bleeding from a gash in the head. Several protesters were taken away.
Dozens of people were reportedly injured in the two nights of clashes, including 22 police officers. Four people were arrested early on Sunday, police said.
The clashes came hours after the talks were confirmed for Tuesday. They will be broadcast live.
On Sunday evening, crowds again began building as protesters stockpiled helmets and fashioned home-made forearm shields out of foam pads to parry baton blows.
RESTIVE GENERATION
The protesters, led by a restive generation of students, have been demanding China's Communist Party rulers live up to constitutional promises to grant full democracy to the former British trading outpost.
Hong Kong is ruled under a "one country, two systems" formula that allows it wide-ranging autonomy and freedoms and specifies universal suffrage for Hong Kong as an eventual goal.
But Beijing is wary about copycat demands for reform on the mainland and it ruled on Aug. 31 it would screen candidates who want to run for the city's chief executive in 2017. Democracy activists said that rendered the universal suffrage concept meaningless. They are demanding elections with open nominations.
Leung appears hamstrung, unable to compromise because of the message that would send to people on the mainland while more force looks likely to only galvanize the young protesters.
Hong Kong's Security Chief Lai Tung-kwok said some of the clashes in recent days had been initiated by activists affiliated to "radical organisations which have been active in conspiring, planning and charging violent acts".
The city's embattled police chief, Andy Tsang, also expressed his frustration when he broke three weeks of silence on Saturday to say "extremely tolerant" policing had not stopped protests becoming more "radical or violent".
The demonstrations pose one of the biggest challenges for China since the crushing of a pro-democracy movement in Beijing in 1989.
The situation in Hong Kong surfaced in weekend talks between U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Chinese State Councillor Yang Jiechi in Boston.
A senior State Department official said Hong Kong was discussed as part of "candid exchanges" on human rights while a Chinese Foreign Ministry statement said Yang had told Kerry that Hong Kong was "purely an internal affair of China".
In Mong Kok, protesters resting during the day on Sunday were defiant and also angry that local officials were portraying their campaign as increasingly radicalised and violent.
While police took down some banners and posters, they left one of the more popular and dramatic, a cardboard cut-out of Leung being hanged in effigy from a lamp-post.
"I will continue to stay here until CY (Leung) resigns," said Lap Cheung, 40, who quit his IT job in the United States to return to Hong Kong for the protests, adding that he had no hope for Tuesday's talks.
Besides Mong Kok, about 1,000 protesters remained camped out at the headquarters of the civil disobedience "Occupy" movement on Hong Kong Island in a sea of tents on an eight-lane highway beneath skyscrapers close to government headquarters.

Weekend recap: Are Indian men still looking for virgin bridesRevealing Why Modern Indian Men Still Want A Virgin Wife
Bollywoodshaadis.com –  Thu 16 Oct, 2014 11:45 AM IST
Print
In one of the episodes of a famous chat show hosted by Karan Johar, the guest actress Frieda Pinto was asked about how her matrimonial advertisement would read. She was quick to frame these simple words, “Will be willing to marry anybody who isn’t looking for a fair, light-eyed virgin.” With this statement, she certainly gave a strong reply to the mother of all questions that Indian men usually ask from their to-be wives. But, is our society ready to digest this wishful thinking? Well, watch this video to find out if we are really independent as far as our attitude towards women liberalisation is concerned.

If this recently conducted survey in Delhi is anything to go by, then surely many of the Indian men still believe in the old school of thought, and consider it their birth right to have a virgin wife. What is even more shocking is that they feel it is not obligatory for them to be a virgin, but it is of supreme importance for their wives to be as pure as the sacred river Ganges. 
Reasons for this idiosyncratic hypocrisy
It has been going on in our culture since time immemorial that women have to prove their purity by passing the virginity test. If Goddess Sita and Queen Draupadi are respected, it is only because they passed the so called test of chastity. Unfortunately, these preconceived notions and the so called cultural values rule our choices till date.

Moreover, in some cases it is seen that men are brought up with such unjustified thoughts, and this has been instilled in their minds like rules. Also, ours being a patriarchy society, men are still considered dominant and the decision makers.
It is annoyingly true that men consider virginity as a symbol of faithfulness or fidelity in their wives. However, they fail to tell what is the connection between being virgin and being pure (from the soul also).

BJP rise to Congress slide: 5 takeaways from Maharashtra verdictComments
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) emerged as the largest party in the state by winning 122 out of 288 seats and is all set to form the next government in Maharashtra. The party that contested all seats with its smaller allies after it breaking its 25-year old alliance with Shiv Sena fell short of 25 seats to win simple majority of its own. It now has an option to reunite with Sena that won 63 seats or get support of Sharad Pawar led NCP that won 41 seats. Attributing its historic victory to charisma of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, BJP national president Amit Shah announced that the party will form government in Maharashtra.
Here are five takeaways from Maharashtra verdict:
 
1. BJP is the biggest gainer; Shiv Sena the biggest loser: They parted ways barely days before polling and may get together again to form the government. The debate about the lead partner — “big brother” status as it is often referred to — is, however, clearly settled now. 
 
2. Verdict vindicates Narendra Modi’s appeal; going it alone not so bad after all: After largely staying away from campaigning for by-elections, where the BJP got a not-so-stellar performance, the Prime Minister addressed 27 rallies in Maharashtra ahead of polling.
 
3. Big boost for Amit Shah, his game plan pays off: The BJP president, for long Modi’s key backroom player, is coming into his own. The outcome in Maharashtra and Haryana overshadows by-election losses in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.    
 
4. Congress slide: Party loses control of India’s financial capital Mumbai, faces further marginalisation with no state under control across north, west, east and central India. Saving grace: Party may have lost half of the seats it won in Maharashtra in 2009, but it has cut losses in more than two-thirds of the constituencies where it trailed in April-May Lok Sabha elections.
 
5. Silver lining for Shiv Sena: It can claim to be the rightful inheritor of the Bal Thackeray legacy as Raj Thackeray’s Maharashtra Navnirman Sena has been rendered irrelevant.

Khaps lose and CM goes out: 5 takeaways from HaryanaComments
The BJP on Sunday created political history in Haryana, by  being all set to form a government in the state for the first time on its own. The party, upsetting past trends, won 47 seats in the 90-member assembly. The party got 33.2% vote share in the state.
Here are the key takeaways from the elections in Haryana:
 
1. Big gainer BJP: Party rode the Narendra Modi momentum of the 2014 general election while crafting a new social engineering formula of consolidating non-Jat voters. Result--from 4 seats last time to 47 now (majority on its own) and power for the first time in the state.
 
2. Deft use of corruption plank: The BJP found ammunition in the controversial Robert Vadra-DLF deal to reinforce its charge of misrule against the Congress. Same handle came in handy to target the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD), whose chief Om Prakash Chautala is in jail in a teachers' recruitment scam.
 
3. Ally must deliver or fall by the wayside: The BJP dumped its ally Haryana Janhit Congress (HJC), which had drawn a blank in the Lok Sabha polls. Convinced that Kuldeep Bishnoi's fledgling HJC has a weak grip on its traditional non-Jat vote bank, Amit Shah shrewdly used the wrangling over seat-sharing to break off the alliance.   
 
4. No takers for Khap leaders: Voters rejected Khap leaders as political representatives. Known to issue bizarre diktats, none of the Khap leaders in the fray found favour with the voters.
 
5. Jats stand by Hooda, Chautala: Amid the drubbing, outgoing chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda and INLD supremo Chautala can take heart from the fact that the allegiance of Jats is still with them. Comprising 22% of the state's population, Jats account for more than one-fifth of the electorate.

Sex It all started 385 million years agoSex? It all started 385 million years ago
AFP  Paris, October 20, 2014
First Published: 00:47 IST(20/10/2014) | Last Updated: 00:55 IST(20/10/2014)
It may not have been love as we know it, but around 385 million years ago, our very distant ancestors -- armoured fish called placoderms -- developed the art of intercourse.
Advertisement
So suggest a team of evolutionary scientists, who point to the fossil of a placoderm species blessed with the name of Microbrachius dicki.
Measuring about eight centimetres (four inches) in length, M dicki lived in habitats in modern-day Scotland -- where the first specimen was found in 1888 -- and in Estonia and China.
 
Placoderms have previously been found to be the most primitive jawed animal -- the earliest known vertebrate forerunner of humans.
But they now have an even more honoured place in the book of life. Microbrachius is the first known species to copulate in order to carry out internal fertilisation, according to a paper published on Sunday in the journal Nature.
Male fish had bony, L-shaped genital limbs called claspers which transferred sperm into the female, a more effective way of reproduction compared to spawning in the water, the study says.
 
The females, for their part, developed small, paired bones with which they locked the male organs in place in order to copulate.
"'Microbrachius' means little arms, but scientists have been baffled for centuries by what these bony paired arms were actually there for," said John Long, a professor of palaeontology at Flinders University in Adelaide, Australia.
"We've solved this great mystery because they were there for mating, so that the male could position his claspers into the female genital area."
Until now, it was thought internal fertilisation occurred much later in the evolutionary tale of vertebrates. Covered with thick, bony plates covering the head and trunk, placoderms ruled the world's oceans, rivers and lakes for around 70 million years.
They were then wiped out around 360 million years ago in a mysterious mass extinction.
For decades, they were deemed by many palaeontologists to be a curiosity -- an evolutionary branch that failed. But work by Long and others found them to be far more important.
The critters handed on features such as jaws, teeth and paired limbs that are seen today in reptiles, birds and mammals, including humans.
If the new study is right, the "claspers," over hundreds of millions of years, evolved into the penis.
Microbrachius' copulatory skill was uncovered last year when Long stumbled across a fossil in a collection at the University of Technology in Tallinn, Estonia.
Males and females probably had sex side by side, with their bony jointed genitals locked together, according to the new investigation.
"This enabled the males to manoeuvre their genital organs into the right position for mating," Long said.
The position looked, well, rather weird, he admitted. "With their arms interlocked, these fish looked more like they are square-dancing the do-se-do rather than mating.".

Up to it Try these questions for admission to Oxfordprint
It’s considered one of the toughest universities to get into, and admission interviews at the University of Oxford invariably challenge potential students to think on their feet, think independently and laterally, and show an ability to apply theory.
The university has released some sample questions that may be asked at interviews to select students for undergraduate courses in the next academic year from September 2015.
Oxford is one of few universities who interview all applicants before admission, and end up finally admitting a fraction of those applying.
The interviews are an important part of Oxford’s admissions process, designed to give candidates the chance to show their real ability and potential.
Tutors challenge potential students with questions that may seem strange to some, but help bring out their potential. Many applicants go through mock interviews to prepare for the rigorous questions — and some questions can challenge the ablest of minds.
 
Samina Khan, acting director of Undergraduate Admissions at Oxford, said, “Interviews are not about reciting what you already know — they are designed to give candidates a chance to show their real ability and potential, which means candidates will be encouraged to use their knowledge and apply their thinking to new problems in ways that will both challenge them and allow them to shine”.
She added, “They are an academic conversation in a subject area between tutors and candidate, similar to the undergraduate tutorials which current Oxford students
attend every week.”
For example, students applying to study Biological Sciences might be asked why it matters if tigers become extinct, potential History students are asked to discuss whether the word ‘political’ has different meanings in different contexts, and applicants looking to study Materials Science may be asked to calculate the temperature in a hot air balloon necessary to lift an elephant.

GST roll-out likely in April 2016Comments
India’s biggest tax reform initiative — the Goods and Services Tax (GST) — could see a staggered implementation, starting with a nationwide unified tax system for goods from April 2016 and extended to services later.
India is currently fragmented into several disjoint markets, with each state levying a different set of taxes on goods and services.
If implemented, the GST can dramatically alter the tax administration by replacing this string of central and state levies such as excise, value-added tax and octroi with a single unified tax, thereby creating a common national market.
Under the new system, the Centre and the states will tax goods at identical rates and split the revenue equally. For instance, if 20% is the agreed rate on a certain product, the Centre and states will collect 10% each.
The same model will apply for services. Under current laws, only the union government taxes services.
Sources told HT the government is likely to introduce in the winter session of Parliament the Constitution amendment bill that will lay out the roadmap for GST’s implementation, first for products and later for services.
Implementation of the tax reform has been politically contentious with states fearing GST could rob them of fiscal powers and tax revenue.
For example, Maharashtra earns more than Rs. 13,000 crore annually from octroi while Gujarat, a highly industrialized state, gets about Rs. 5,000 crore from its share of the central sales tax (CST). Agrarian states such as Punjab and Haryana also earn more than Rs. 2,000 crore from purchase tax.
All these states fear they will lose these revenues once the GST is introduced.
Most states also want petroleum and liquor to be kept out of the new tax regime.
The Centre will likely offer a fresh Rs. 35,000-crore plan spread over three years after phasing out CST — a proportion of which goes to the states — to compensate them for revenue losses, sources said.
Over the last few years, the government has gradually brought down CST from 4% to 2% as a precursor to rolling out GST.  As an interim measure, the Centre has also periodically compensated state governments for revenue losses.
The first installment – Rs. 14,000 crore — of the new CST compensation plan is likely to be paid this financial year itself, with the balance over the next two years, sources said.
Last month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and finance minister Arun Jaitley along with top finance ministry officials discussed in detail the current status of the proposed indirect tax system.
A robust country-wide information technology (IT) network and infrastructure to make the implementation seamless across state boundaries is also expected to be ready by April 2016.   

RBI governor Raghuram Rajan wins Euromoney awardRBI governor Raghuram Rajan wins Euromoney award

India's central bank Wednesday said its governor Raghuram Rajan has been conferred Euromoney's 'Central Bank Governor' of the year award in Washington on Oct 10.
According to Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Euromoney, while announcing the award, recorded: "RBI Governor Rajan's tough monetary medicine combatted the storm ravaging the deficit-ridden economy in the recent emerging market crisis. Now, he is battling vested interests to arouse a sleepy financial system for over one billion people."
"As he confronted capital outflows, the rupee at record lows, and over-blown but palpable, fears India was marching towards an Asia-crisis style abyss, Rajan duly administered tough monetary medicine to ailing bond and currency markets."
Rajan is an internationally-renowned economist, who earned acclaim for his warnings in 2005 of an upcoming global crisis.
Last year in September, the Chicago University economist was appointed the governor for a three-year term by the last central government.
The Indian currency had plunged nearly 20% since May, 2013, and the country was facing its worst crises since 1991, when Rajan took over.
Rajan is also a prize-winning author of the book: "Fault Lines: How Hidden Fractures Still Threaten the World Economy".

TRAI issues recommendations on spectrum auctionTRAI issues recommendations on spectrum auction

The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) on Wednesday released recommendations on spectrum valuation asking the government to auction spectrum in the 900 and 1800 megahertz band.
Spectrum is airwaves that telecom operators use to transport voice and data, for consumers to communicate with each other.
The telecom regulator recommended that finance, defence and communications and IT should ensure availability of additional spectrum for commercial use.
“Unused spectrum in the defence band should not be kept idle,” said Rahul Khullar, chairman TRAI, releasing the recommendations online.
The suggestions also include auction of all spectrum available for commercial use in 2100 MHz band. This is a critical airwave for offering 4G services to consumers.
The regulator said that the auction should be carried out only after a clear road map is available — the availability of spectrum in 2100 and 900 MHZ.
It specifically pointed that "it should be held only after 2100 is cleared for commercial use from defence and 900 MHz from Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd".
Spectrum is a scarce resource and is released by the government for commercial use by operators.
The government hopes to raise more than Rs. 90,000 crore according to analysts. The last spectrum auction held in February this year generated more than Rs. 61,000 crore.
"Quite pleased with recommendations, we support this. The reserve price with regard to 1800 MHz has some aberration; this would lead to higher cost for consumers. There is also a need for correlation between the 900 and 1800 MHZ, in the reserve price for operators to price the service affordable, we are still waiting for a detailed analysis,” said Rajan Mathews, director general of Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), the apex body representing majority telecom operators.
When asked to comment a top official in the department of telecommunications said they are yet to receive TRAI's suggestions.
"We have not yet officially received the recommendations. The response will be given after we receive it."

iPhone junkies queue up for Apples midnight launchiPhone junkies queue up for Apple’s midnight launch

Sukh Raj Singh, a young entrepreneur in Delhi, has been promised by the authorised Apple reseller at Ambience Mall in the Capital’s Vasant Kunj area, that he will be among the first to get his iPhone6, within five minutes of the clock striking 00:00 hrs on Thursday night.
Singh is one of the thousands of such people across the country hoping to be proud owners of the latest iPhones on Friday. He was camping along with his friends and family at the mall since 10 pm on Thursday.
Sahil Lamba, a BDS student, was in queue at the Apple outlet in the M block market in Greater Kailash. “I booked it on the 7th of this month. I am excited, this is the first time I am making a mid-night purchase…I had only heard of it,” said Lamba.
In the West, and even in countries like China, the practise of queing up for Apple products is a ritual in its own right, and people hit shopfronts days ahead of product releases. The practice of pre-order and phased release was started to avoid this pressure on buyers, but in India, it is still a novelty.
Resellers have hence tried to ensure that the launch and first-day sale have all the elements to make it a memorable event for the buyer. For instance, music maestro AR Rehaman is expected to perform at one store in Chennai. Other outlets have called on regional celebrities and local actors to add to the atmosphere.’
“A young lady has booked 21 iPhones,” said a one of the four authorised distributors of Apple in Delhi. “She plans to give them as Diwali gift to family and friends.”
That is a hefty payout, considering that the cheapest of the six variants of the iPhone6 is priced at Rs. 53,500.
The iPhone 6 has 3 variants, priced at Rs. 53,500, Rs. 62,500 and Rs. 71,500 with memory of 32 GB, 64 GB and 128 GB respectively. The larger iPhone 6Plus is priced at Rs. 62,500, Rs. 71,500 and Rs. 80,500 respectively.
Apple’s current rollout is in 27 countries, including China, where the phone has had as many as 20 million advance bookings, according to unconfirmed reports. It also had an event in Cupertino, California,  on Thursday to unveil its latest operating system, the OS X Yosemite, available as free upgrade.

Indian generic drugmaker Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd said it has agreed to pay $39.75 million to settle litigation concerning its participation in Texas Medicaid, the US federal-state healthcare program for people with low incomes.
The litigation related to the manner in which Ranbaxy historically reported pricing data to Texas Medicaid for some drugs, Ranbaxy said in a statement on Thursday.
The payments will be made in tranches through August 2015, it said.
Ranbaxy in May said, without elaborating, it had made a provision of Rsa 2.38 billion ($38.57 million) in its first quarter results for "certain settlements done with the government authorities" in the United States.
Last month, the company said US federal authorities had sought details on how it reported pricing data for some products eligible for reimbursement under Medicaid.
Analysts on Thursday said they did not expect any future impact on Ranbaxy's earnings from the Texas settlement, citing the provision.
The company, which is in the process of being acquired by larger rival Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, said it "believes it fully complied with all the relevant laws."
Ranbaxy's Texas settlement comes after the company pleaded guilty last year to felony charges relating to drug safety.
It agreed to pay $500 million in civil and criminal fines under a settlement agreed with the Department of Justice.
Ranbaxy shares were up 0.6% at Rs. 602.50 at 0532 GMT in Mumbai. The broader NSE index was down 0.08%.

The rupee posted its biggest single-day loss in a month, hurt by data showing a widening trade deficit and a slump in local shares as part of a global market sell-off, but intervention from the central bank prevented steeper losses.
The local unit fell nearly 0.72% on Thursday and was the worst performer among Asian currencies as trading resumed after a holiday on Wednesday for state elections.
Worries that foreign investors would reduce their exposure are starting to weigh on sentiment, after strong buying in shares and debt had helped support the rupee so far this year.
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had been active in the market for most of the day, but stepped up intervention as the rupee threatened to breach the 62-mark, traders said.
"The rupee is playing catch-up with other Asian currencies as it was outperforming them some days ago," said Anindya Banerjee, currency analyst at Kotak Securities in Mumbai.
"When they have catching up to do, the rupee and stocks traditionally overdo it," he added, pointing out that the rupee and shares would continue to be under pressure in the coming sessions.
The partially convertible rupee closed at 61.8350/8450 per dollar compared with 61.41/42 on Tuesday, after touching 61.93 in intra-day trade. The fall was the biggest since Sept. 15.
The rupee was hurt after data on Tuesday showed India's trade deficit widened to $14.25 billion in September from $10.84 billion in August due to a jump in oil and gold imports.
Meanwhile, the BSE Sensex and the Nifty and fell more than 1% after foreign institutional investors sold a net $113 million on Tuesday, marking their third consecutive session of sales and raising fears they were turning more cautious about emerging markets.
In the offshore non-deliverable forwards, the one-month contract was at 62.22/32 while the three-month was at 62.84/94.

“We had 8 large deal wins — two in banking and finance, two in manufacturing and one each in four other verticals,” Chandrashekaran said. All geographies, including key markets US and Europe, showed growth while Latin America showed slight de-growth.
 
About Indian market he said: “Last quarter we saw growth in India market. We have now seen second consecutive quarter of growth. We feel India is back to growth again.”
TCS also announced the merger of its subsidiary CMC Ltd with itself. TCS holds 51.12% stake in CMC.

Shares of realty giant DLF on Thursday hit a fresh life-time low of Rs. 100 a piece, before bouncing back on bargain buying and gained over 15% from day's low.
In a tumultuous opening trade after being battered by nearly 30% in last trading session on the back of a Sebi order, the stock on Thursday opened near its day's low level at Rs. 100.10 and further slipped to Rs. 100.
However, the stock gained ground soon as brokers and traders saw value buying at such low levels, which is less than half the level of its 52-week high of Rs. 242.80 a piece.
The stock rose to as high as Rs. 115.85 in early morning trade, marking a gain of over 15% from opening lows. After paring some intra-day gains, the stock was trading 6% up at Rs. 111.20 at the BSE at 1130 hours.
The stock had slumped to Rs. 104.95 on Tuesday, the last trading session, after a Sebi order led to unprecedented sell-off in the company shares.
DLF shares are now trading with circuit limits, with the upper limit for the day fixed at Rs. 120.65 and the lower end at Rs. 94.50 at the BSE.
On Tuesday, as the stock suffered a severe drubbing, the company's market valuation had fallen by Rs. 7,438.67 crore. Out of this, the promoters took the biggest hit of about Rs. 5,500 crore, while overseas investors also saw the value of their holding plunge by nearly Rs. 1,500 crore.
There are 334 foreign institutional investors in the company who hold over 35 crore shares in the realty firm. The hit for small retail investors was little over Rs. 200 crore, while that for HNIs was Rs. 48 crore.
Sebi has barred DLF as well as its six top executives, including chairman and main promoter KP Singh, from the securities market for 3 years for "active and deliberate suppression" of material information at the time of its IPO.
Besides KP Singh, those barred from the markets include his son Rajiv Singh (vice chairman), daughter Pia Singh (whole time director), managing director TC Goyal, former CFO Ramesh Sanka and former ED (legal) Kameshwar Swarup.
DLF said it has not violated any laws and would defend itself against any adverse findings in the Sebi order. While the regulator has not imposed any monetary penalty, the prohibition order would bar DLF and the six persons from any sale, purchase or any other dealings in securities markets for a period of three years, including for raising funds.
DLF had over Rs. 19,000 crore of debt as on June 30, 2014, while its already-proposed fund raising plans include nearly Rs. 3,500 crore through issue of certain bonds to lower debts.
This is one of the rare orders by Sebi where it has barred a bluechip firm and its top promoter/executives. The order can be challenged at Securities Appellate Tribunal.
DLF is the largest real estate group in the country with nearly Rs. 10,000 crore annual turnover.

The BSE Sensex fell for a second consecutive session on Thursday, as companies seen most exposed to the global economy such as Hindalco Industries and Sesa Sterlite declined tracking a downturn in global markets.
Markets across the world remained weak on worries about global economic growth and the end of US stimulus.
Adding to the concerns, overseas investors sold a net $113 million on Tuesday, their third consecutive session of sales, raising fears they were turning more cautious about emerging markets after purchasing Indian shares through the year.
However, following exit polls after Maharashtra and Haryana elections, traders expect the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to form governments in the two states, giving a further push to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's reforms agenda.
The BJP is set to emerge as the largest party in the two state legislatures where it has traditionally been weak, exit polls showed.
"Today, the global cues were so bad and we have been seeing one-sided selling from overseas investors. However, we are expecting positive outcome from the two state elections, which will bring back some confidence among investors," said Suresh Parmar, head, institutional investors at KJMC Capital Markets.
The Sensex closed 1.33% lower or 349.99 points at 25,999.34, while the broader Nifty fell 1.47% to 7,748.20.
Markets were closed on Wednesday for state elections.
Metals and mining companies led the losses. Hindalco closed down 5.7% and Tata Steel ended 3.7% down on weak international prices. Sesa Sterlite closed 4.2% lower.
London copper hit a six-month low while iron ore futures DCIOcv1 in China and Singapore extended losses with mounting concerns over global growth.
Oil and gas explorers such as Oil and Natural Gas Corp ONGC.NS and Reliance Industries Ltd fell after international crude prices hit a four-year low.
Reliance fell 3.2%, while ONGC closed down 1.3%.
Sell-off was also seen in heavyweights as investors preferred to take profits. Larsen
& Toubro ended 1.1% lower and Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd closed down 2.8%.
However, DLF Ltd rebounded and closed up 5.2%, on value-buying after slumping 28.6% to a record low on Tuesday after the securities regulator banned it from the capital markets for three years over violations related to disclosures for its 2007 listing.

Under the new system, the Centre and the states will tax goods at identical rates and split the revenue equally. For instance, if 20% is the agreed rate on a certain product, the Centre and states will collect 10% each.
The same model will apply for services. Under current laws, only the union government taxes services.
Sources told HT the government is likely to introduce in the winter session of Parliament the Constitution amendment bill that will lay out the roadmap for GST’s implementation, first for products and later for services.
Implementation of the tax reform has been politically contentious with states fearing GST could rob them of fiscal powers and tax revenue.
For example, Maharashtra earns more than Rs. 13,000 crore annually from octroi while Gujarat, a highly industrialized state, gets about Rs. 5,000 crore from its share of the central sales tax (CST). Agrarian states such as Punjab and Haryana also earn more than Rs. 2,000 crore from purchase tax.
All these states fear they will lose these revenues once the GST is introduced.
Most states also want petroleum and liquor to be kept out of the new tax regime.
The Centre will likely offer a fresh Rs. 35,000-crore plan spread over three years after phasing out CST — a proportion of which goes to the states — to compensate them for revenue losses, sources said.
Over the last few years, the government has gradually brought down CST from 4% to 2% as a precursor to rolling out GST.  As an interim measure, the Centre has also periodically compensated state governments for revenue losses.
The first installment – Rs. 14,000 crore — of the new CST compensation plan is likely to be paid this financial year itself, with the balance over the next two years, sources said.
Last month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and finance minister Arun Jaitley along with top finance ministry officials discussed in detail the current status of the proposed indirect tax system.
A robust country-wide information technology (IT) network and infrastructure to make the implementation seamless across state boundaries is also expected to be ready by April 2016.

(Ebola continues to spread…)
BEIJING: Setting aside their strategic rivalry, the US and China today agreed to cooperate in stepping up efforts to control the raging Ebola epidemic in Africa.
Visiting Chinese State Councillor Yang Jiechi and US Secretary of State John Kerry, who met in Boston, agreed to enhance cooperation on fighting the Ebola epidemic, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang said.
Yang noted that Ebola, which continues to spread in West Africa, has become a threat to the public health and requires concerted efforts by the international community.
The United States and China have their respective advantages in fighting the deadly virus, Yang said.
China is willing to strengthen coordination and cooperation with the US as well as the international community to help the affected African countries, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.
Yang is currently touring the US to make preparations for President Barrack Obama's visit to Beijing next month. Obama will attend the 21-member Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in China.
The two sides are currently in talks to workout broad areas of cooperation despite their strategic rivalry.
Washington and Beijing have recently shown differences of opinion on matters related to territorial disputes between China and its neighbours in the South China Sea, and ongoing protests in Hong Kong.
Yang said the Chinese government has been closely following the development of the epidemic, and has provided assistance to the affected African countries and relative international organisations, Yang said.
He said that China will continue to support and provide assistance to West Africa in its fight against Ebola, along with the development of the epidemic and the need of the affected countries.
Besides contributing USD 53 million worth of aide to western African countries to fight Ebola, China has also sent teams of doctors to the affected countries to combat the disease.
China has also published a book on preventing and treating common diseases in Africa, highlighting the Ebola virus.

Experimental Ebola drug expected in Geneva ...Canada said in August it would give  Geneva-based World Health Organization 800 vials - each believed to contain about two doses - of  VSV-EBOV vaccine.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
GENEVA: Canada will start sending more than 1,000 doses of an experimental Ebola vaccine to Switzerland this week as part of the global fight against the deadly virus, a Geneva hospital said Sunday.
Trials of the vaccine on humans are expected to begin in Switzerland at the end of October or early next month, it said.
"The Canadian government has said it will begin sending the vaccine doses on Monday, so they should arrive in Geneva on Tuesday," said Agnes Reffet, spokeswoman for the Geneva University Hospital, HUG, where the vaccine will be stored.
Canada said in August it would give the Geneva-based World Health Organization 800 vials - each believed to contain about two doses - of the VSV-EBOV vaccine developed at the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg.
The UN health agency has identified two experimental vaccines that have shown promising results when tested on monkeys: The Canadian VSV-EBOV, licenced by US firm NewLink Genetics, and one made by British company GlaxoSmithKline (GSK).
Clinical trials of the NewLink vaccine began in the United States last week. The Canadian government said the results are due in December.
"You cannot transport this kind of product any which way," Reffet told AFP, when asked why it had taken so long for Canada to send the vials.
The vaccine must be stored at minus 80 degrees Celsius (-112 degrees Fahrenheit).
Canada said it would send the vials in three separate air shipments as a precaution in case of an accident or a temperature control failure.
The trials in Switzerland will be run by HUG, which has also been chosen by the Swiss government to care for Geneva-based employees of international aid organisations who might become infected with Ebola in the field.
There is no licenced treatment or vaccine against Ebola, which has killed more than 4,500 people in the outbreak centred in west Africa.
WHO said last month it hoped thousands of doses of the vaccines would be ready for use badly hit African countries by early next year, but GSK warned Friday that its vaccine, which has started some clinical trials, might not be ready for commercial use until late 2016.

Kiev and the West have previously charged that Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 was blown out of the sky in July by separatist fighters.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
BERLIN: German intelligence has accused pro-Russian rebels of shooting down a Malaysian passenger jet over Ukraine using missiles captured from government forces, a media report said Sunday.
Kiev and the West have previously charged that Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 was blown out of the sky in July by separatist fighters using a BUK surface-to-air system supplied by Russia, charges denied by Moscow.
But the head of Germany's BND foreign spy agency Gerhard Schindler said intelligence indicated the rebels had captured a BUK system from a Ukrainian base and fired a missile that exploded directly next to the plane, Spiegel magazine reported.
The Amsterdam-Kuala Lumpur flight crashed on July 17 as it flew over rebel-held territory in eastern Ukraine, killing all 298 people on board, 153 of them Dutch.
Schindler said Russian claims the missile was fired by Ukrainian soldiers and that a Ukrainian fighter jet was flying close to the Malaysia Airlines plane were false, according to Monday's edition of Spiegel.
He also said Ukrainian photos had been "manipulated", the magazine reported but did not elaborate on what the pictures showed, who had provided them or altered them.
Andrei Purgin, deputy prime minister of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic immediately rubbished the claim.
"These accusations against us are without any basis," he told Russia's Interfax news agency, adding that such missiles could "only be fired by well-trained experts."
American intelligence officials had in July said that the plane could have been shot down mistakenly by ill-trained separatists.
"The former miners who are today defending their country do not have the expertise to operate such a sophisticated system," he added.
Schindler presented his findings to parliamant's control committee overseeing German intelligence work on October 8.
An initial report by Dutch investigators issued last month found that the jet was hit by multiple "high-energy" objects but did not apportion blame.
The Russian-made BUK works by exploding directly outside the target and hitting it with a massive amount of high-velocity shrapnel.

Modi-led government can now go full blast for big reformsBJP
(The Modi administration…)
NEW DELHI: Fresh from its success in Maharashtra and Haryana and with no major electoral contests due in more than a year, the Narendra Modi government has room to press forward with reforms, beginning with the winter session of Parliament and the FY16 budget thereafter to deliver better economic growth and more jobs.
The Modi administration put some decisions on the backburner in the run-up to the crucial assembly elections in which BJP fared well. But with just the Jammu & Kashmir and Jharkhand assembly elections due in early 2015, the government now has the room to take tough policy measures. The next crucial state election will be towards the end of next year, in Bihar, where BJP will make a bid to wrest power from JD(U).
A start was made on Saturday evening itself, with the government announcing reforms on fuel pricing - decontrol of diesel and a higher natural gas price to incentivise exploration and production. A senior BJP leader told ET that there could be more big announcements in the coming days, a point that was affirmed by senior government officials.
"There is a clear signal by the government that it will press ahead with all long-pending reforms," said a top official involved in policy making. "Whatever reforms are needed will be carried out and it is prepared for it."
Siddhartha Sanyal, chief India economist at Barclays Capital, said, "There is a clear window till towards the end of 2015 where there are very few state elections." The next move could well be a political one with the expansion of the union cabinet and reshuffle of some portfolios. Major changes were effected in the bureaucracy last week just after the state elections were held, signaling that a team was being put in place for a burst of action aimed at reviving growth that looks to be losing momentum after a strong start amid an adverse global economic climate.
The government has also appointed a new chief economic adviser, Arvind Subramanian, besides naming Rajiv Mehrishi as economic affairs secretary. The economy expanded at a nine-quarter high of 5.7% in the April-June quarter but industrial production rose only 0.4% each in July and August.On the Modi government's agenda are a revival in investments, the auction of coal blocks cancelled by the Supreme Court, financial sector reforms based on the recommendations of the Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission (FSLRC), insurance legislation, implementation of the goods and services tax (GST), a coherent strategy on inflation, more labour reforms and administrative measures to make it easier to do business.
"Fertiliser subsidy is another key area where some action could be expected," said the official cited above. Leading economist Rajiv Kumar said the government will have its plate full.
"They need to do a lot between now and next budget to retain their credibility. If they do not, then investors will lose hope and it doesn't take much time in sentiment turning negative. Top of the list of reforms is GST and come what may they should get going with it," he said.
"Second is following up on the business environment — the whole focus should be on kickstarting investment," he added. "They also need to come out clean on the banking sector as there are a lot of misconceptions floating on NPAs (nonperforming assets) so that lending and borrowing can start," Kumar said.
  "The coal sector needs a thorough examination, not a knee-jerk reaction. (The government) needs to roll back nationalisation and put in place a robust regulation." It will help that the Sunday results will mean a boost of as many as seven seats in the Rajya Sabha, where the government currently lacks a majority.
To be sure, elections to the Upper House will only be held next in 2016 but the government numbers could get a quick immediate boost if parties formerly inimical to it lend their support. One of these is the Nationalist Congress Party, which has six seats in the house. Sanyal expects the government to continue to focus on the administrative side of things.
"This government's style has been to focus on fixing the nuts and bolts of the economy and executing developmental activities rather than making big-bang announcements. For example, they remain focused on ensuring that interministerial conflicts don't hold up development," he said.
The approach has good support even though analysts have pointed to the absence of so-called big-ticket reforms."Given that the lack of a well-functioning executive under the previous administration was a key driver of the slowdown in investment, this focus is critical for a revival of the 'right' kind of growth in India, in our view," Morgan Stanley said in a recent report listing it as three things the government needs to fix urgently. The other two are capitalisation of state-run banks and need to curb inflation.

Tata Motors  Jaguar Land Rover plans to set up factory in USTata Motors' Jaguar Land Rover plans to set up factory in US

JLR is capitalising on a turnaround in its fortunes after Tata acquired the struggling brand for around 1.3 billion pounds back in 2008.
LONDON: Tata Motors' owned Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) is working on an ambitious plan to set up a factory in the US, in a first for a British carmaker in the world's second-biggest automobile market.
The West Midlands-based luxury carmaker is reportedly talking to several southern states of America, including South Carolina, about building a plant in the US, The Sunday Times claimed today.
JLR is capitalising on a turnaround in its fortunes after Tata acquired the struggling brand for around 1.3 billion pounds back in 2008.
It is all set to open a 130,000-vehicle factory in China on Tuesday and later this month will launch its i54 engine plant in Wolverhampton - a 500-million-pound investment.
It has also signed a deal for a new factory in Brazil and is exploring three possible locations in Wales for a new logistics hub, though it is also considering a site in the Midlands.
Selling directly into the US would allow JLR to avoid high import tariffs and smooth the impact of fluctuating currency rates.
The newspaper believes it would probably receive significant start-up support from the chosen state, and could commit itself to building a factory that will eventually produce 200,000 cars a year.
The company has also been exploring the possibility of opening a factory in Mexico.
JLR sold about 55,000 cars in North America last year, an eighth of its 425,000 global sales.
Its target is to reach 1 million cars by the end of the decade.

How Modi and Amit Shah helped BJP romp home in Maha and Haryana pollsHow Narendra Modi and Amit Shah helped BJP romp home in Maharashtra and Haryana polls

Amit Shah
(Modi and Shah aimed for the…)
They went for the jugular, hit Haryana, missed Maharashtra narrowly but turned in a thoroughly impressive performance. So why did Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah take the audacious gamble of contesting alone in Maharashtra and Haryana?
But first, that little twinge of disappointment: BJP's top strategists and central leadership were confident of winning 150 or more seats in Maharashtra and a majority in Haryana. The tally for Maharashtra was, hence, a slight dampener.
Stay Single
ET spoke to several BJP strategists, including aides of Shah, to get a sense of the party strategy that unfolded after it broke its alliance with the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra and Kuldeep Bishnoi's party in Haryana. All leaders spoke on condition they not be identified. And all leaders spoke of Shah's ferocious commitment. Working frequently till 2 am, Shah had camped out at party headquarters in Dadar in Mumbai from September 22 to 29. He would catch a few hours of sleep every night at the Rang Sharda hotel nearby, where rooms are `1,500 a night — not the kind where ruling party chiefs spend their nights in.
BJP's Maharashtra strategy was based on three approaches: First, an early assertion it was not a junior partner in its alliance with Sena. Second, covering the whole of Maharashtra in quick time to make up for its minimal presence in parts of the state left to the Sena. Third, drafting leaders and campaign specialists from outside Maharashtra trusted by Shah and giving them responsibilities for sub-regions.
"We worked overtime for two weeks... compressing the whole campaign in that time," a party functionary said.
A number of BJP strategists said they realised "very early" that Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray was not prepared to concede ground. "The first meeting between Shah and Uddhav showed what will happen... there was no chemistry... Uddhav expected to be treated as the senior partner... He could not swallow a new BJP saying it wanted more seats," an aide of Shah told ET.
"Shah increasingly began to feel that BJP alone had a better chance. Shah's view was that if BJP contests 120 seats, its tally was likely to be around 80, but contesting all 288 may give the party 130-plus at least," the aide added. The BJP parliamentary board had asked Shah to keep the alliance alive but the tipping point was Sena's "absolute refusal to concede any more seats".
BJP had barely two weeks to put together an all-Maharashtra campaign, of which the hectic rallies by Narendra Modi, Shah and Singh became a critical element. Modi's appeal to the urban audiences being especially strong, with 42 per cent of Maharashtra being urban meant the impact of his speeches "was going to be considerable", said a party worker.
There was also "a massive organisational push" as it sought to create an organisational base where it barely had any presence, the person said. "We had to pick candidates and pick organisational champions for these areas," a BJP member said. "There were a minimum of 150 seats BJP had never contested in 25 years. Our organisational strength was only in 125 seats," a Shah aide said.
  Special teams were created for this purpose. Sunil Bansal, Shah's right-hand man in UP, was dispatched to Maharashtra to manage the campaign. Almost 700 BJP seniors and more than 4,000 party workers from all across India were sent to Maharashtra. The state was divided into 55 sub-regions and each was given a special focus.
Sena is OK
A BJP worker said the pitch was to ignore Sena's jibes at BJP and to emphasise the "greatness of Bal Thackeray and tell voters that BJP was a better inheritor of his legacy". "We didn't respond to Sena's targeting us for betrayal," this person said. "Our aim was to tell voters that Uddhav's Sena can't appropriate Bal Saheb's legacy... Modi and Shah's strategy was to make BJP the sole beneficiary of the anti-incumbency vote."
Haryana Hurricane
BJP leaders said Haryana was a mini version of Maharashtra. BJP senior leader Sushma Swaraj had strongly pitched for an alliance with Bishnoi, said one party senior. But Shah had not met Bishnoi even after the latter sought an appointment with him five times.
"Shah had made up his mind about Haryana as well... He did not agree with the Akali suggestion of allying with INLD either," a Shah aide said. His Haryana calculations depended on the consolidation of the anti-Jat vote in favour of BJP, this aide added.
A BJP member said Bhupinder Singh Hooda and Om Prakash Chautala had been winning elections by playing around with the Jat-Dalit combination. The anti-Jat vote was with BJP from the beginning this time. Meanwhile, Jat votes were won over by giving the maximum number of seats to candidates from the community — 27 out of 90.
Then came the Dera Sacha Sauda effect — 60-70 per cent of their supporters are Dalit. They have 72 lakh active followers. Shah is believed to have approached the Dera leadership directly. It destroyed the Jat-Dalit math of the opposition. This, topped with Modi's charisma and his message of fighting corruption, good governance and promise of development, resulted in a massive win.

Complacency a big danger for businesses: Rat...Complacency a big danger for businesses, says Ratan Tata

(Tata also said it is really…)
NEW YORK: Cautioning that "complacency" is a big danger for any business, Tata Group's Chairman Emeritus Ratan Tata has said that corporate leaders should keep injecting urgency without taking "cavalier risks".
In a commentary written for a publication of global consultancy McKinsey, Tata also said it is really important for companies to survive over the longer term and besides the ability to innovate, an attachment to good values also drives corporate longevity.
"One of the big dangers for any business is complacency; the challenge for leaders is how to keep injecting urgency. I think much depends on how good a CEO is at motivating his or her team and generating the sort of excitement that leads people to do things in different ways," Tata said while cautioning "that doesn't mean taking cavalier risks".
The commentary has been published in the 50th anniversary edition of the McKinsey Quarterly publication.
Ratan Tata served as the Chairman of Tata Sons, the group's holding company, for over two decades beginning 1991. He retired from the post on December 28, 2012 and now serves as Chairman Emeritus.
"One hundred years from now, of course, I expect Tata to be much bigger and more global than it is now. More important, I hope the group comes to be regarded as India's best, best in the way we operate, best in the products we deliver, and best in our value system and ethics," Tata said.
Founded by Jamsetji Tata in 1868, Tata group comprises over 100 operating companies, with operations in more than 100 countries across six continents. The group entities export products and services to over 150 countries.
On values, Tata said "It's something we have had throughout Tata's history and on which we never compromise. Values are in our DNA, and they have carried us into new markets, helped us redistribute our assets, and, ultimately, made us a successful global company".
Tata group entities are often featured in Fortune Magazine's most admired companies lists. UK-based Brand Finance has valued the Tata brand at USD 21.1 billion and ranked it 34th among the top 500 most valuable global brands in their global list for 2014.
"I hate to see major corporations disappearing from the scene because someone has cashed out, because the managers have been unable to escape their comfort zones, or because boards have not been sufficiently nimble to change with the times," Tata wrote.
Citing the importance of "managerial rotation", he said Tata group used to have managers who did not even rotate away from a single function, who started in manufacturing and finished in manufacturing or started in R&D and retired in R&D.
"Unilever is good at avoiding that, and we have learned from it," he added.
 
Tata said businesses should fight it out, whether the enemy is a competitor's new product, an industry-transforming innovation (such as transistors), or the impact of something clearly outside a company's control (like climate change).
"Disruptive events often provide the spark to change course or enter a new field, as opposed to allowing competitors to nibble at your feet," he said.
When previously protected Indian markets were opening up to foreign companies, some people tried to block those reforms at the time. But their impact now is visible everywhere, particularly in the automobile sector--all global car manufacturers are present in the Indian market.
"Open markets have encouraged local companies to adopt new technologies, to become more creative, to lower costs, and to improve offerings to the consumer," Tata said.

SIT on black money to help probe money trail in AgustaWestland chopper deal

AgustaWestland
(In order to widen its probe…)
NEW DELHI: The Special Investigation Team (SIT) on black money will assist in the probe into money trail of alleged kickbacks in the Rs 3600-crore AgustaWestland choppers deal with Enforcement Directorate seeking its help to send abroad about half-a-dozen judicial requests for cooperation.
Official sources said the ED wanted to send about six Letters Rogatory (LRs) to various foreign shores to probe the money trail in this case while the CBI has already got issued five such legal requests through a Delhi court.
"In order to avoid duplicity of task and asking of same questions by the two agencies, the ED has sought SIT's help in obtaining the LRs already sent by CBI to various countries in this case. The SIT , after reviewing the case, has agreed to write to CBI in this regard," sources said.
"Whatever has not been asked by CBI and is essential from the point of view of money trail would then be framed as questions of the LRs of the ED which will then approach a competent court for formal issuance," they said.
A special CBI court, in August this year, had issued LRs to the competent authorities of United Kingdom (UK), Switzerland, Singapore, United Arab Emirates(UAE) and British Virgin Island.
CBI sources, however, said they have not received any communication so far in this regard.
In order to widen its probe into the money laundering probe, the ED is mulling sending judicial requests to about six countries seeking information on bank accounts and transactions to detect the trail of alleged kickbacks money.
The agency has early this year filed a criminal case in the VVIP helicopter purchase deal under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). The agency till now has detected that over 170 'fake firms' were floated to route the alleged illegal funds between Indian and foreign firms.
The agency, sources said, wants to send LRs to Italy, Mauritius, the UK, Tunisia, Dubai and some other jurisdictions in Europe to piece together the flow of funds and money in this deal.
The ED is probing the case under the criminal provisions of PMLA and it has so far arrested businessman and lawyer Gautam Khaitan in this case.
The agency is in the pursuit to track Rs 400 crore of alleged bribe money which was purportedly paid as kickbacks for finalising the deal with the said company.

Market turmoil: A gift for mortgage refinanc...A sudden plunge in mortgage rates last week raised an urgent question for millions of Americans:
Should I refinance my mortgage?
Across the country, homeowners and would-be homeowners eager for a bargain rate fired off inquiries to lenders.
The opportunity emerged from the tumult that seized financial markets and sent stock prices and bond yields tumbling. Rates on long-term mortgages tend to track the 10-year Treasury yield, which fell below 2 percent for the first time since May 2013.
Accordingly, the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage, mortgage giant Freddie Mac reported, dipped below 4 percent to 3.97 per cent a tantalizing figure. As recently as January, the average was 4.53 per cent.
Ultra-low rates do carry risks as well as opportunities. Charges and fees can shortchange refinancers who are focused only on the potential savings. And falling rates are often associated with the broader risk of an economic slowdown that could eventually reduce the income that some people have to pay their mortgages.
Yet the tempting possibility of locking in a sub-4 per cent rate has a way of motivating people.
"It gets people excited," said Michelle Meyer, an economist at Bank of America. "It gets mortgage bankers excited. It gets prospective buyers excited."
The drop in rates could finally give homeowners like Issi and Amy Romem of Mountain View, California, the chance to refinance.
Amy Romem bought the condo at the peak of the housing boom for $400,000, using an adjustable-rate loan with an initial 5.875 per cent rate that would reset after 10 years. The reset would amount to an extra $400 a month on the condo, which the couple now rents, Issi Romem said.
"Seeing rates go down even more is something I wasn't expecting," he said. "It reminds me that I need to do this now, before interest rates do go up."
Before last week, many bankers, lenders and borrowers had assumed that home loan rates would soon start rising closer to a two-decade average of 6 percent. That was based on expectations that the Federal Reserve would start raising its key short-term rate next year a move that would likely lead to higher mortgage rates, too.
But that assumption fell suddenly into doubt as stocks plunged Monday and Wednesday amid fears about global economic weaknesses, the spread of Ebola and the threat of the Islamic State militia group in the Middle East.
Seeking safety, investors poured money into U.S. Treasurys. Higher demand drives up prices for those government bonds and causes their yields to drop.
The yield on the 10-year note traded as low as 1.91 per cent Wednesday before ending the day at 2.14 per cent. A stock market rally on Friday helped lift the yield to 2.20 per cent. That suggested that the moment to refinance might be fleeting.
"It's likely to be the last time we see these rates for a generation, if ever again," said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Realtor.com.
Even a slight drop in mortgage rates can translate into significant savings over the long run. For a median-priced home worth $221,000, a 0.5 percentage point decline in a mortgage rate would produce savings of $50 a month, according to a Bank of America analysis.
Still, it takes time for the savings to offset the costs of refinancing.
"There's no free lunch in this," noted Gary Kalman, executive vice president at the Center for Responsible Lending.
Lenders typically charge fees for paperwork on the loan and to pay for a home appraisal and title insurance, among other costs.
"You want to make sure the interest rate you're getting is dropping enough that it more than offsets whatever fees you may be paying," Kalman said.
Refinancing from a 5.5 per cent rate which some borrowers still have to 4 per cent would save $180 a month on a $200,000 mortgage. But the fees averaging around $2,500 mean it would take about 14 months to break even.
Research done this year by economists at the University of Chicago and Brigham Young University found that 20 per cent of eligible households failed to refinance when rates first made doing so profitable in late 2010. They essentially cost themselves $11,500 in potential savings.
Those who missed those late rates last year now have a second chance.
 
"When you get these little boomlets like we see now, most of that is what drives refinancing activity," said Bob Walters, chief economist at Quicken Loans.
While applications for refinancing were rising last week at Quicken, Walters added, it's unlikely that many would-be home buyers will be able to benefit. It can take buyers months to mobilize, because they need to first find a suitable house in the right neighborhood. That makes it hard for them to immediately snap into action when rates drop, though it might coax them into looking.
"It's a bonus if rates are lower," Walters said, "but it doesn't dictate the decision."

6 PIO-led firms among 100 fastest-growing b...Express Kitchens
(Companies were ranked overall…)
NEW YORK: Six firms founded and headed by Indian-origin persons are among the 100 fastest-growing businesses located in American cities, says a list by Fortune and The Initiative for a Competitive Inner City (ICIC).
The ICIC, founded by Harvard Business School professor Michael Porter in 1994, identifies, ranks, and spotlights annually the 100 fastest-growing businesses located in the inner cities of the United States and includes an eclectic group of innovative companies, including custom glass artisans, pet relocation specialists and beverage flavour generators.
Companies were ranked overall by revenue growth over the five-year period between 2009 and 2013 as well as within their respective industry categories.
Ranked 17th in the list FutureNet Group , a construction, environmental, technology and security services firm, with an India-born CEO Perry Mehta. The company's five-year growth rate is 498.2 per cent and its 2013 revenue was $97 million.
On the 30th position is software project development and infrastructure management firm InfoPeople Corporation headed by Shyam Gulati. It had a five-year growth rate of 381 per cent and registered 2013 revenues at over $10 million.
InfoPeople Corp, the New York-based firm, serves companies in the US and India, along with governments, utilities, and non-profit institutions.
Ranking 43rd on this Fortune list is the Seattle-based True Fabrications which was founded in 2003 by its CEO Dhruv Agarwal in his garage. The firm, a wine lifestyle brand and a marketer for thousands of wine retailers around the world, recorded a five-year growth rate of 305.6 per cent and with 2013 revenues standing at $23 million.
Express Kitchens , ranked 67th is headed by Max Kothari and has a five-year growth rate of 172.1 per cent. The Hartford based firm's 2013 revenue stood at 14 million dollars.
Since Express Kitchens' founding in 2002, it has grown to over 105 employees, seven locations, and it increasingly competes with industry titans Home Depot and Lowes on service and quality.
On the 68th spot is transportation and logistics firm Westcoast Trucking that recorded a five-year growth rate of 168.1 per cent. Its CEO Jay Patel founded the company to cater to the trucking and logistics requests for customers of his warehousing business.

SINGAPORE (AP) — Serena Williams says comments by the head of the Russian Tennis Federation referring to her and older sister Venus as "brothers" were bullying, sexist and racist, and that she supported the one-year suspension imposed by the WTA against the official.
Shamil Tarpischev was also fined $25,000 for making the comments on Russian television. He also said the sisters were "scary" to look at.
"I think the WTA did a great job of taking (the) initiative and taking immediate action to his comments," Williams said Sunday in Singapore ahead of her WTA Finals defense. "I thought they were very insensitive and extremely sexist as well as racist at the same time.  I thought they were in a way bullying. "
Asked whether he regretted his comments, Tarpischev told The Associated Press on Saturday at the Kremlin Cup that the program on which he spoke was "a humorous show." When asked about his ban, Tarpischev said: "I can't comment. I don't understand it."
In a statement released later by the Russian Tennis Federation, Tarpischev denied any "malicious intent" and said his quotes had been taken out of context.
The WTA said it would seek his removal as chairman of the Kremlin Cup tournament, which ends Sunday.
Russia's Maria Sharapova, also in Singapore for the WTA Finals, condemned her compatriot's comments.
"I think they were very disrespectful and uncalled for, and I'm glad that many people have stood up, including the WTA.  It was very inappropriate, especially in his position and all the responsibilities that he has not just in sport, but being part of the Olympic committee," she said.
Tarpischev has been chairman of the Kremlin Cup, Russia's only WTA event, for all of its 18 years as a women's tour event, and is also a member of the International Olympic Committee. During the 1990s, he was the personal tennis coach to Russian President Boris Yeltsin and served as his adviser on sports matters.
He made his comments during an appearance on a Russian talk show this month alongside former Olympic singles champion Elena Dementieva. When Dementieva was asked what it was like playing against the Williams sisters, Tarpischev interjected and called them the "Williams brothers." He also said that "it's scary when you really look at them."
Williams, the world number 1 at the age of 33, is going into the WTA Finals on the back of another stellar year, winning six titles including the US Open.  But she pulled out of the China Open earlier this month with a knee injury, triggering some concerns she might not make the Singapore.
The draw for the year-end competition — starting Monday at the 10,000-capacity Singapore Indoor Stadium — puts Williams in the Red Group with 23-year-old Simona Halep and 20-year-old Eugenie Bouchard as well as the more experienced Ana Ivanovic, the only one of her three opponents ever to beat her.
Williams said doctors only allowed her to start hitting the ball in practice again last week.
"They thought it was very bad for me to hit sooner than that," she said. "After that, I just, like I said, started training.  I was surprised at how well I was able to kind of jump back into it."
The White Group sees second-seeded Sharapova, the French Open champion, joined by Wimbledon winner Petra Kvitova, Caroline Wozniacki and Agnieszka Radwanska.

When Gannett Digital created an interactive feature for the Des Moines Register called Harvest of Change , it wasn’t just notable because it incorporated cutting-edge technology, virtual reality headset Oculus Rift. It’s an example of the work the company is doing to try to create that scale and speed with forward-looking applications that can play across the company.
The work comes out of the Gannett’s interactive applications group, a four-person team overseen by Anthony DeBarros that works out of Gannett headquarters in suburban D.C. (although they collaborate with design and information architecture teams at Gannett Digital.) As tech people infiltrate newsrooms, DeBarros is an example of the reverse — he’s a journalist who went over to the tech-heavy side (he started at Gannett 27 years ago writing obits and covering cops at the Poughkeepsie Journal). His boss, Mitch Gelman, vp of product for Gannett Digital, also has an editorial background as a former svp at CNN.com. Their job: Speed the spread of innovation throughout the company’s newsrooms at USA Today and 81 community dailies.
“Journalists and software developers work in different ways,” DeBarros said. At Gannett Digital, he went on, his experience helps him bridge the newsroom and the hard-core tech people. “I’m able to ensure the broader thinking is captured and well represented.”
While individual Gannett papers still have their own teams that work on interactive journalism, DeBarros’ mandate is to build big-scale, interactive products than can run across multiple properties.
“We’re right in with our peers in the things we’re doing with 2-D graphics, but one of the things we’re doing that is unique to Gannett — by virtue of our publishing platform — is we now have the ability to create an interactive application and publish it simultaneously across all those properties,” DeBarros said. “So we’re looking at what can we can do that has broad appeal and can be somewhat customizable.”
Last year, his group built a Storm Tracker that any paper could pull out and use to show local hurricane activity in real time. (“Every time there was a hurricane, some poor artist had to go into Photoshop and update the location and show a new map,” DeBarros said.) This year it created an election tracker that lets a paper showcase all 1,100 federal candidates, with data like bios, polling numbers and financial contributions.
Gannett wouldn’t share how many community papers have picked up those interactive features, although it revealed that another investigative project and interactive tool that DeBarros’ group worked on, Fugitive Next Door , was carried by 60 papers.
Harvest of Change was a new area for DeBarros, having never worked with virtual reality before. But the former journalist is always looking for innovative ways to tell stories. And using emerging media could reach younger readers who are less inclined to read a print newspaper than their parents are.
“Mitch has said, we have a lot of potential news consumers who have no interest in picking up a print newspaper or tuning in to watch a news broadcast,” he said. “But they are very interested in experiences like video gaming and immersive activity.”
The work comes as Gannett prepares to spin off its publishing business from its faster-growing broadcasting side early next year, which will likely put more pressure on the newspapers to improve their performance.
Scaling those editorial products is increasingly possible because the company, under its digital chief David Payne, has been breaking down silos between USA Today and its community newspapers with a common CMS and shared video production studio and news desk. Local Gannett papers have a USA Today section as their de facto national news coverage. Payne prides the digital group as a whole as acting like a startup. There are standing meetings, huddles at sofas instead of conference tables, a ping-pong table and a culture of continuous improvement.
Payne said he’s looking to the interactive applications group for the next generation of media storytelling products. While their efforts have so far only yielded products for the newsroom, products that also have use for advertisers is “our dream.”
The challenge will be finding other uses for those products across the company.
Dan Pacheco, who is chair of journalism innovation at Syracuse University and who consulted to Gannett on the Oculus Rift project, said the barriers to scaling these ideas aren’t technological (the tools are there and free to use), but the finding the right stories and people with the right skill sets.
“The pitfall here would be some newspaper says we want to get into this, we have this intern who’s good at photoshop but they’re not necessarily good at 3-D modeling,” he said. “Another pitfall is, you try to show something that’s cool about the environment and forget about the story. In terms of how to scale it across the company, it’s not going to be done by making a whole bunch of enterprise-level Harvest of Changes.”

Tata s Jaguar Land Rover plans to set up fac...Tata Motors' Jaguar Land Rover plans to set up factory in US
By PTI | 20 Oct, 2014, 07.45AM IST
Tweet
JLR is capitalising on a turnaround in its fortunes after Tata acquired the struggling brand for around 1.3 billion pounds back in 2008.
LONDON: Tata Motors' owned Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) is working on an ambitious plan to set up a factory in the US, in a first for a British carmaker in the world's second-biggest automobile market.
The West Midlands-based luxury carmaker is reportedly talking to several southern states of America, including South Carolina, about building a plant in the US, The Sunday Times claimed today.
JLR is capitalising on a turnaround in its fortunes after Tata acquired the struggling brand for around 1.3 billion pounds back in 2008.
It is all set to open a 130,000-vehicle factory in China on Tuesday and later this month will launch its i54 engine plant in Wolverhampton - a 500-million-pound investment.
It has also signed a deal for a new factory in Brazil and is exploring three possible locations in Wales for a new logistics hub, though it is also considering a site in the Midlands.
Selling directly into the US would allow JLR to avoid high import tariffs and smooth the impact of fluctuating currency rates.
The newspaper believes it would probably receive significant start-up support from the chosen state, and could commit itself to building a factory that will eventually produce 200,000 cars a year.
The company has also been exploring the possibility of opening a factory in Mexico.
JLR sold about 55,000 cars in North America last year, an eighth of its 425,000 global sales.
Its target is to reach 1 million cars by the end of the decade.

AirAsia India to start flights on Delhi-Mumb...AirAsia
("Now, we have decided to…)
NEW DELHI: The Indian unit of AirAsia will soon start flights from big cities, changing its strategy of connecting smaller cities to take on competition which followed the airline wherever it went since launch of operations earlier this year.
AirAsia India, which started with connecting cities like Chennai, Kochi, Goa, Chandigarh and Jaipur from its hub in Bangalore, plans to start operations from key cities like Delhi and Mumbai. The airline had earlier announced that it wouldn't operate from these cities because of high airport charge.
"We had earlier decided to operate between smaller cities and develop markets but the competition is following us everywhere. Now, we have decided to take on competition in their big markets like Delhi and Mumbai by announcing our flights soon," AirAsia India Chief Executive Mittu Chandilya said.
Since its launch, AirAsia has been facing severe competition from other domestic carriers. Days after it announced Bangalore as its hub, other airlines ramped up operations from there. Competition followed it on the Bangalore-Jaipur sector too, launching new flights. Analysts say AirAsia's new strategy will help it grow faster in India.
"The shift in strategy to bigger cities is a perfect move and will help the airline in more ways than one. It will fetch market share for the airline, help it break even much faster and, above all, will provide much better visibility to the airline," said Girish Jakhotiya, chief consultant at Jakhotiya & Associates, a strategy consultancy firm.
"Aggression is the best defence and AirAsia India is doing the right thing by moving into the competition's market to take them on." This change in strategy has, however, slowed the capacity-addition plan of the airline, which will now operate a fleet of five aircraft until end-December. It initially had a target to have 10 planes by the end of 2014, which was later cut to six.
"Now, the sixth aircraft comes only in January," said Chandilya. He said all AirAsia India's flights, with the exception of Bangalore-Chennai, are generating cash. "The Bangalore-Chennai flight is not making money because we are pricing it less due to competition from other modes of transport that are available in abundance between the two cities." AirAsia India, which started flight operations in this June, has been unable to meet its target of breaking even in the initial months itself.
The AirAsia Group recorded a Rs 25 crore loss in the second quarter for AirAsia India, consultancy Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation said in a report in August.

BSNL may seek Rs 2,000 crore grant to give up a part of spectrum

(BSNL is considering seeking…)
KOLKATA: State-run Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd is considering seeking government grant in return for relinquishing a slice of the premium 900 MHz spectrum which the telecom regulator wants to free up for the next round of airwave auctions.
A top BSNL executive told ET that the company is likely to seek a "near Rs 2,000-crore grant from the government to meet additional capex and network re-engineering costs" as a pre-condition to heeding the regulator's call and relinquishing 1.2 MHz of efficient 900 MHz spectrum in some 18 circles (barring Punjab) where its licences expire in 2015-16.
"It's technically possible to provide mobile coverage with five units of 900 MHz spectrum instead of our current 6.2 MHz allocation in each circle. But that would require BSNL to install at least 15,000-odd additional base stations across India and also entail additional investments in core networks to maintain coverage quality with reduced spectrum holdings," the executive said. The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) has suggested taking back a portion BSNL's 900 MHz airwaves to boost spectrum supply before conducting a sale and pre-empt over-bidding.
It has also proposed assigning 1.2 MHz of airwaves to the company in the less efficient 1,800 MHz band in Gujarat, West Bengal and Rajasthan circles where BSNL's spectrum holdings are below 3.8 MHz. In its recent spectrum pricing recommendations, Trai said BSNL's ability to offer mobile broadband services would not be hurt even if it is left with 5 MHz in the 900 MHz band once it converts such spectrum holdings into "liberalised form".
Another BSNL board member said the telco would dismiss Trai's suggestion if the government is not a position to fully compensate BSNL for meeting additional capex and network re-engineering costs. A senior official of the Department of Telecommunication (DoT) said the government would shortly "seek BSNL's views", like it did when Trai earlier this year called on the telco to return 50 per cent of its CDMA spectrum in the 800 MHz band.
"We can't simply take away a slice of BSNL's most efficient spectrum without eliciting its views on whether such a move would hurt their pan-India mobile operations and reduce long-term competitiveness vis-a-vis private operators, especially at a time when the government is exploring ways to strengthen the loss-making telco," the DoT official said.
Analysts feel Trai's recommendation is justified as it would free up extra 900 MHz spectrum that can be productively used for 3G services, but remain skeptical on DoT playing ball.
"Trai's recommendation (if accepted by DoT) will doubtlessly create an additional 5 MHz contiguous block in the 900 MHz band and will be very positive for telcos, but we aren't building in a benefit to incumbents, considering that similar past attempts by Trai haven't fructified," said Phillip Capital in a recent note to clients. Brokerage Credit Suisse said, "Taking back 1.2 units in the 900 MHz band from BSNL and adding it to the auctioned spectrum is a positive recommendation but is unlikely to be implemented so soon."

Govt to re-impose gold import curbs to check trade deficitBank of India
(The rule was relaxed by RBI…)
NEW DELHI: Barely months after gold import rules were eased, the government is looking to re-impose curbs as the country's insatiable appetite has led to a surge in the yellow metal coming into India, threatening to undermine the improvement in external balances.
The finance ministry's revenue department has flagged the issue and asked the department of economic affairs (DEA) and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to review the May 21 relaxation in the import rules issued by the latter.
The so-called 80:20 rule was relaxed in May by RBI at the behest of the finance ministry after jewellers, bullion dealers, authorised dealer banks and trade bodies sought easier rules. Under the 80:20 scheme, nominated agencies were allowed to import gold on the condition that 20% of the import would be exported. The easing of rules meant more entities were allowed to import gold.
The trade deficit worsened to an 18-month high of $14 billion in September following a 450% rise in gold imports as importers rushed to take advantage of lower prices. "Gold imports have risen since the norms were relaxed...
There is a concern," said a finance ministry official. "We have written to the DEA and the RBI."
In its May 21 review, the central bank allowed star and premier export houses to import the yellow metal subject to some restrictions. It also allowed banks and nominated agencies to provide gold metal loans for domestic use to jewellers and bullion traders. These rules were eased to facilitate gem and jewellery exports that had declined following the import curbs on gold.
Alarm bells have also been sounded by intelligence agencies and customs that see imported gold meant for export purposes getting diverted to the domestic market. Gold imports rose to $3.8 billion in September from $2 billion in August.The government wants to tread with caution and take pre-emptive measures rather than be forced to react later. With capital flows expected to remain volatile over fears of the US ending its bond purchases and starting monetary tightening sometime in 2015, the government wants to keep a leash on unproductive imports.
Experts agreed with the move. "Given the country's dependence on imported commodities and fluctuation in currency, government will take all steps to address any factor that seeks to threaten macroeconomic stability of the country," said DK Pant, chief economist, India Ratings. "Currency has also seen movement because of rising gold imports." India had in August 2013 imposed quantitative restrictions on gold imports because of its burgeoning current account deficit, which stood at $88 billion or 4.7% of GDP in 2012-13, increasing its vulnerability to capital outflows and weakening the rupee. The country also increased import duty on the yellow metal in phases. In January 2012, the government imposed an import duty equal to 2% of value of the commodity as against the earlier specific rate of.`300 per 10 grams. It subsequently raised this in phases to 10%.

How Indian entrepreneurs are giving it back ...How Indian entrepreneurs are giving it back to the ecosystem

(Indian entrepreneurs have…)
By Aditi Shrivastava, Madhav Chanchani and Harsimran Julka
BANGALORE: When Bangalore-based Milind Katti approached Mu Sigma CEO Dhiraj Rajaram to sell B2B lead generation services, their conversation turned to Katti's another startup that makes software to manage key B2B accounts. Enthused, Rajaram soon led a $750,000 angel funding into Demand Farm. The investment not only extended Demand Farm's survivability, but also saw Rajaram give regular feedback and Mu Sigma become its beta user.
Scores of Indian entrepreneurs, who have tasted hard-earned success, have started giving it back to the ecosystem by not only investing their time and money on young startups, but also becoming their early beta users, educating them on the pitfalls and making connections with other investors.
"This was a trend which was happening in Silicon Valley but has only started in India recently," said Mukul Singhal of SAIF Partners . "These entrepreneurs also have an operating experience, which is recent and more relevant compared with someone who built a company 30 years ago," Singhal added. However, it is not just validation of an idea but the execution learnings too that digital age entrepreneurs look for when they scout for money or advice from their seniors.
"The capital was helpful, but for me validation of product from Dhiraj and Mu Sigma was much more important," said Katti, who successfully launched the product a few months ago.
The success of companies in new-age sectors such as e-commerce, cloud, analytics and mobile applications, has made the young startups rely on those who have seen early success. Taxi aggregator Olacabs, founded by IIT Bombay alumni Bhavish Aggarwal and Ankit Bhati chose to raise a Rs 2-crore angel round in 2011 with participation from Snapdeal's Kunal Bahl and Rohit Bansal.
"In the early stages, one entrepreneur betting on another is a great validation of the idea," said Aggarwal, CEO of Olacabs. Snapdeal's co-founders held about 0.21% each as of August 15, this year in OlaCabs. Anupam Mittal, founder of matchmaking portal Shaadi.com, also held 1.5% in OlaCabs, as per latest data.
"They have lived the entrepreneurial life and hence bring valuable and real onground experience, which for first-time entrepreneurs is invaluable." The results show. Olacabs recently closed a Rs 250-crore Series C investment from Steadview Capital and Sequoia Capital, valuing it at nearly Rs 1,100 crore. Till five years ago, the mentoring and investment would be limited to global groupings such as those within the IIT network, where Silicon Valley-based seniors would invest in ventures of juniors or mentor them online or at coffee shops when visiting India.
With the growth of India's accelerator ecosystem and platforms that help entrepreneurs meet, the trend has seen a hockey stick curve. Mobile ad network firm In Mobi's co-founder and CTO Mohit Saxena met App Virality CEO Laxman Papineni at a Microsoft accelerator event in Bangalore recently.
"They needed help with hiring the right people and guidance on how to launch a global product," said Saxena, who then became a mentor to the startup. According to data from VCCEdge , angel and seed stage deals have been steadily rising — from 227 in 2012 to 240 in 2013. There were 135 seed and angel investments till August 2014, most of which were led by current and former entrepreneurs.
Eka Software CEO and co-founder Manav Garg has also backed startups such as StayZilla, social media newspaper Frrole and enterprise software maker Orange-Scape, all in their early phases. To discover more startups from other parts of the country, he has invested in Lets-Venture, a linkedin for startups and investors along with InMobi's other co-founder, Naveen Tewari.
"Our collective vision is to take the number of seed stage and Series A (first round of venture capital) deals in India from about 200 to over 1,000 in a couple of years," said Garg, 38. The growth in social media tools such as WhatsApp in the last few years has also encouraged entrepreneurs to give their valuable time, if not physically, then virtually.
"The Bansals of Flipkart are very approachable on Whatsapp and keep the door open for constant communication," said Deepit Purkayastha, co-founder of News in Shorts, a mobile app that gives out top news stories in 60-word portions.
The 23-year old raised seed investments from Flipkart cofounders last month. "For example, they helped us choose the right marketing channels," Purkayastha said. It also shortens their time to market.
"Instead of blindly exploring, it makes us more focused and effective." Myntra CEO Mukesh Bansal has backed grocery delivery chain Zopnow and co-invests in startups referred by Kae Capital. It's not only entrepreneurs with billion dollar valuation startups who have turned angels. Freshdesk Inc's co-founder Girish Mathrubootham and Toppr's Zishaan Hayath have also been backing startups.

(Last June, Intel created…)
BANGALORE: Intel Capital India , the corporate VC arm of one of the largest chipmakers in the world, said it is shifting its focus back to deep technology sectors, such as internet-of-things platforms, gesture technology, cloud computing and wearables, after backing several ecommerce ventures in the country.
The decision to switch lanes came about six-eight months ago, said Pradeep Tagare, director of Intel Capital in India. Last June, Intel created a $100-million (Rs 600-crore) global fund to finance perceptual computing projects, or those that use more senses like gestures and image recognition to interact with computers.
"We are taking a step back from internet companies. We have a fair exposure in the internet space, and lots of capital is going into it," said Tagare, whose firm has invested in companies like trip planning website Yatra.com and online health store Healthkart , among others. The shift in thinking marks a change for the ecommerce-obsessed Indian startup ecosystem, which has seen at least $1.8 billion pumped invested in across 40 deals this year alone, according to Venture Intelligence.
"The (ecommerce) ecosystem is well-funded," he said, adding that the firm would look at investing anywhere between $5 million and $10 million in hi-tech companies in the near future. Abhinav Aggarwal, co-founder of Trutech Webs , which sells gesture control technologies to Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Games, Vodafone and others, said he noticed a similar sentiment from VCs.
"Over the past three months or so, VCs are bored with ecommerce. It is over and done with. They are pretty excited with new companies coming up," said Aggarwal, 23, whose product was recognised by Intel as one of the top gesture platforms recently.
Kalaari Capital , which has invested in online lingerie retailer Zivame and Snapdeal, said it has stopped looking at horizontal players, as clear winners like Flipkart and Snapdeal have emerged. But the firm said vertical ecommerce solutions, looking at niche segments will be of interest to them.
"The market has been tremendously rewarding to the ecommerce companies, but they have challenges (in profitability). Even though B2B companies have none of the brand recall that ecommerce has, but have growth and profitability," said Kumar Shiralagi, managing director of Kalaari Capital. This may come as good news for companies both in the enterprise and wearable space. The former has always found it difficult to get customers in India, and could leverage a VC's global network, while gadget makers can now look beyond just the crowdfunding route.
Globally, about $1.1 billion was invested across 153 deals in 2013 in the internet-of-things space, according to research firm CB Insights. And the Indian ecosystem is also showing a similar trend. Two-year-old SmartBuildings, which has built out a smart energy management solution for commercial buildings, said it has already received a buy-out offer, and has five paying customers on board.
"The investors' change of heart is indicative of the general trend in the market," said Anil Gupta, CEO of SmartBuildings and a former COO of Aditi Technolgies. "Not just traditional VCs, even listed and private companies are showing interest," said Gupta.

(Prime Minister Narendra Modi carries…)
By Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay
Virat Kohli is not the first Indian cricketer to bemoan that people expect him to score runs in fifties or hundreds every time he goes to bat. Sachin Tendulkar carried the burden of the nation's expectation for two decades and it often proved heavy on his small frame. Prime Minister Narendra Modi carries a similar political load within his own party and shouldered it with aplomb during the parliamentary polls.
On Sunday, it appeared for the first time that Modi was not electorally all powerful as he failed to take the BJP to a clear majority in Maharashtra. Despite emerging as the largest party and near certain to head a government in the state for the first time, the verdict from the party will temper the aggression of Modi loyalists within the BJP. Predictably, while drum beaters have attributed the spectacular victory in Haryana to "nothing but Modi-wave", the reason for the shortfall in Maharashtra has been attributed to the absence of the BJP organisational network in large parts of the state. That the same argument holds true in Haryana has been conveniently ignored.
The impressive performance of the BJP in Maharashtra has been a bit of a dampener from the Modi-perspective because of the huge expectation that has been bestowed on his persona. Sunday's verdict demonstrates that there are still large parts of India where local issues and caste factor still plays an important role. India can't be considered to have returned to the phase of 'single elections' but continues to remain an 'aggregate' of hundreds (and thousands) of polls. In such a situation, one man cannot expect that his magic wand will sway voters.
BJP was traditionally a party that had a collective leadership. This characteristic was eroded with Modi's rise. Those who have a sense of unease because of Modi's overarching presence in the party, will attempt to use this verdict to argue that the High Command -heard for the first time in the context of the BJP - becomes more accommodative. Whether or not this sentiment resonates more loudly within the party is to be keenly watched.
Party veteran LK Advani no longer occupies an important position in the part hierarchy. Yet he remains a moral pivot of a large section of party leaders including several of Modi's peers. Ideally, Modi would want to work only with second generation of leaders that he has developed through this round of polls. But, the result from Maharashtra demonstrates that a new generation of leadership has to be groomed in states where local issues and caste factor is still dominant. The traditional hierarchy can be nudged aside in wave situations like the kind of that witnessed during the Lok Saba polls but it would be imprudent to consider it relevant in every poll.
When the alliance in Maharashtra was called off, it was labelled as a decision of Modi and Amit Shah. It appears that the BJP may succeed in forming a government without the support of the Shiv Sena but repeated post-verdict assertions of leaders that the Sena remained an ideological ally indicates that ideally large sections of the party would want to continue with the alliance. This may not happen eventually because of the distance the two parties have travelled from each other during the polls, but it will make Modi more circumspect while dealing with allies.
Despite a five-way split in Maharashtra, BJP could not secure a majority on its own though it polled close to 28 per cent votes. Modi may not just need well sewn alliances in important states like Bihar and UP but will also have to stitch his party with greater involvement and not force people to line up in awe as is his wont.
Given his personality and his dominance in government, no one will walk up to Modi and tell him that he can cannot take credit only for success but must also accept his share of responsibility when things do not go the BJP's way completely. If there is any takeaway for Modi from this round, it is a simple fact: not everything can be done by one man. He has to devolve more - both in organisation and in government.

Dallas hospital hit by Ebola losing patientsDallas hospital hit by Ebola losing patients and money
By Chris Isidore and Cristina Alesci   @CNNMoney October 17, 2014: 3:20 PM ET
 
Patients shun Dallas hospital hit by Ebola
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
Two-thirds of the beds sit empty in the Dallas hospital where a patient died recently from Ebola.
Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital has 900 beds, but is down to only 300 patients, a CDC official who was at the hospital told CNN. Hospital officials would not comment on that report.
Patients have shunned the facility after Thomas Eric Duncan died there last week, and two nurses who treated him also became infected with the deadly disease.
Before the crisis, the hospital had accounted for 17% of the $3.5 billion in annual revenue for its parent company, Texas Health Systems, according to credit rating agency Moody's. Presbyterian had been the second largest hospital among the 25 acute-care and short-stay facilities the chain owns.

The chain is taking a big financial hit from Presbyterian, but it has no plans to close the facility, a source familiar with hospital told CNN Friday.
Texas Health Systems had its credit rating upgraded by Standard & Poor's just this past June, and the source said the company has $3 billion in cash and other liquid assets, as well as a low debt level that will allow it to weather the financial storm. The company is in contact with the rating agencies about the ongoing situation.
 
Melinda Gates on Ebola: 'Vast inequities'
Moody's revised its outlook for the company to "developing" on Friday. That step is less severe than issuing a watch or a downgrade, but it still indicates concerns about the company's finances.
"The developing outlook reflects the uncertainty on the system's long-term financial performance, impact on financial resources and litigation risk following recent cases of Ebola at one of the system's flagship facilities," said Moody's.

Disappointing TCS, HCL Tech numbers leave IT defenceless

(Tata Consultancy Services…)
Tata Consultancy Services and HCL Technologies each declined about 9 per cent on Friday, the worst daily fall in at least five years and HCL Technologies each declined about 9 per cent on Friday, the worst daily fall in at least five years, amid investor concern over growth prospects after the financial performance of both software exporters in the September quarter missed analysts' expectations.
The 10-share S&P BSE IT index dropped 4 per cent while the benchmark Sensex gained 0.4 per cent. TCS reported revenue of $3,929 million for the quarter, compared with expectations of about $3,975 million. HCL Tech's revenue grew 1.9 per centsequentially to $1,433 million, lower than the analysts' estimate of over 3.5 per cent. HCL Tech fell 9.09 per cent to Rs 1,505.55 and TCS closed 8.73 per cent lower at Rs 2,444.90, the biggest losers on the IT index. Both companies said they were hurt by unfavourable cross-currency movements.
The dollar appreciated 3.4 per cent against the euro during the quarter from the preceding quarter, affecting the dollar revenue of IT exporters adversely. "The appreciation of the dollar against the euro wiped out over 130 basis points from the revenue growth," Anil Chanana , chief financial officer of HCL Technologies, told ET. "Barring this, the constant currency revenue growth was a healthy 3.2 per cent."
For TCS, apart from the currency hit, there was an unexpected slowdown in project rollouts. "Ramp-up of some of the projects did not happen as expected. We still delivered a robust sequential growth of 6.1 per centin volumes," said Rajesh Gopinathan, chief financial officer, TCS. Both TCS and HCL Tech reiterated optimism about future growth, backed by continued addition of clients, a stable pricing trend and higher employee intake during the September quarter.
CMC, another Tata group company, fell over 14 per cent to Rs 1,872.65 after its board approved its merger with TCS. As per the scheme of amalgamation, CMC shareholders will receive 79 TCS shares for every 100 CMC shares they own. The ratio as of Thursday's price was a 3 per centdiscount for CMC.
"The discount should have been higher, given CMC's lower growth and margin as compared to TCS, though this will have marginal impact on earnings," said Rumit Dugar, an IT analyst at Religare. As per Friday's closing price, the value of 100 CMC shares was Rs 1.87 lakh while 79 TCS shares were worth Rs 1.93 lakh.
All stocks on the IT index closed lower. Infosys, which fell 0.3%, declined the least. KPIT and Mindtree lost 2.27 per cent each, Tech Mahindra fell 1.28 per centand Wipro dropped 1.08 per cent. "IT stocks came under selling pressure as the Street reacted to TCS' outlook, which indicated that it may not be able to beat FY14 growth rate of 16.2 per cent," said Sanjeev Zarbade, VP at Kotak Securities.

Top-5 Sensex cos lose Rs 65 570 cr in m-capBSE
(TCS, the country's largest…)
NEW DELHI: Dragged down by IT bellwether TCS, the combined market valuation of top-five companies slumped Rs 65,570.45 crore last week.
While TCS, ONGC, RIL, Infosys and Sun Pharma saw losses in their market valuation, ITC, CIL, HDFC Bank , SBI and ICICI Bank made gains.
TCS, the country's largest software exporter, suffered a loss of Rs 45,883.21 crore to Rs 4,78,889.40 crore in its valuation.
The IT major had on Thursday posted 13.2 per cent jump in September quarter net profit at Rs 5,244 crore, which failed to meet market expectations.
The m-cap of RIL tumbled Rs 7,129.98 crore to Rs 3,03,454.27 crore, while ONGC lost Rs 6,202.73 crore to Rs 3,39,866.85 crore.
Sun Pharma's valuation tanked Rs 4,338.96 crore to Rs 1,65,243.04 crore and that of Infosys diminished by Rs 2,015.57 crore to Rs 2,21,302 crore.
On the other hand, CIL added Rs 10,737.82 crore to Rs 2,22,051.79 crore in its market cap, SBI (Rs 5,300.67 crore to Rs 1,88,308.13 crore), ICICI Bank (Rs 5,284.47 crore to Rs 1,74,251.70 crore).
HDFC Bank's valuation rose by Rs 4,430.28 crore to Rs 2,13,739.94 crore and that of ITC went up by Rs 598.07 crore to Rs 2,82,208.89 crore.
In the ranking of top-10 firms, TCS maintained its numero uno position, followed by ONGC, RIL, ITC, CIL, Infosys, HDFC Bank, SBI, ICICI Bank and Sun Pharma.
Over the past week, the BSE benchmark Sensex fell by 188.85 points to settle at 26,108.53.

PSU workers may have say in decision-makingIOC
(The policy proposal, an…)
NEW DELHI: After announcing several labour reforms last week, the Narendra Modi government is considering allowing workers to participate in board decision of state-run firms such as Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, Coal India, NTPC, Indian Oil Corporation and BHEL. The policy proposal, an initiative of the labour ministry, is expected to be initially confined to state-run enterprises, but its scope could be enlarged later to include private firms, government and industry officials said.
"The labour ministry is expected to initiate consultations with all stakeholders, including representatives of industry and labour unions from Monday," a source with direct knowledge of the development said. A similar proposal was initiated 34 years ago in the form of "the Participation of Workers in Management Bill", which was introduced in the Rajya Sabha in May 1990, but was put on the backburner by various governments because the industry vehemently opposed it, sources said.
Blue chip public sector companies such as ONGC , NTPC and IOC are still against the move while their respective administrative ministries are in-principle in favour of allowing workers' participation in management of the company, sources said. Executives in a state-run company said the move is impractical and workers' participation could make decision-making cumbersome.
"We are facing intense competition with global private firms. They have leaner management structures that help them in quick decision-making," one executive said requesting anonymity. "This is an extremely new thing and we will firm our views in due course," said a senior IOC executive, who is expected to attend the Monday meeting. IOC is representing public sector oil companies.
Industry representatives have a view that participation of workers in management should be limited to production levels only, that too in manufacturing industries, officials with direct knowledge of the matter said.
During past meetings, trade unions have assured that workers in management would not hinder decision making and use the policy for the purpose of bargaining, the officials said. Trade unions say workers' participation in management at all levels will help in increasing productivity and production. But they want to revamp the 34-year-old proposal to reflect current socio-economic reality, officials added.
"The NDA government is serious about labour reforms and believes that workers' participation would strengthen their bond with the management and their involvement with the company," an official in the labour ministry said requesting anonymity.

(Prime Minister Narendra Modi carries…)
By Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay
Virat Kohli is not the first Indian cricketer to bemoan that people expect him to score runs in fifties or hundreds every time he goes to bat. Sachin Tendulkar carried the burden of the nation's expectation for two decades and it often proved heavy on his small frame. Prime Minister Narendra Modi carries a similar political load within his own party and shouldered it with aplomb during the parliamentary polls.
On Sunday, it appeared for the first time that Modi was not electorally all powerful as he failed to take the BJP to a clear majority in Maharashtra. Despite emerging as the largest party and near certain to head a government in the state for the first time, the verdict from the party will temper the aggression of Modi loyalists within the BJP. Predictably, while drum beaters have attributed the spectacular victory in Haryana to "nothing but Modi-wave", the reason for the shortfall in Maharashtra has been attributed to the absence of the BJP organisational network in large parts of the state. That the same argument holds true in Haryana has been conveniently ignored.
The impressive performance of the BJP in Maharashtra has been a bit of a dampener from the Modi-perspective because of the huge expectation that has been bestowed on his persona. Sunday's verdict demonstrates that there are still large parts of India where local issues and caste factor still plays an important role. India can't be considered to have returned to the phase of 'single elections' but continues to remain an 'aggregate' of hundreds (and thousands) of polls. In such a situation, one man cannot expect that his magic wand will sway voters.
BJP was traditionally a party that had a collective leadership. This characteristic was eroded with Modi's rise. Those who have a sense of unease because of Modi's overarching presence in the party, will attempt to use this verdict to argue that the High Command -heard for the first time in the context of the BJP - becomes more accommodative. Whether or not this sentiment resonates more loudly within the party is to be keenly watched.
Party veteran LK Advani no longer occupies an important position in the part hierarchy. Yet he remains a moral pivot of a large section of party leaders including several of Modi's peers. Ideally, Modi would want to work only with second generation of leaders that he has developed through this round of polls. But, the result from Maharashtra demonstrates that a new generation of leadership has to be groomed in states where local issues and caste factor is still dominant. The traditional hierarchy can be nudged aside in wave situations like the kind of that witnessed during the Lok Saba polls but it would be imprudent to consider it relevant in every poll.
When the alliance in Maharashtra was called off, it was labelled as a decision of Modi and Amit Shah. It appears that the BJP may succeed in forming a government without the support of the Shiv Sena but repeated post-verdict assertions of leaders that the Sena remained an ideological ally indicates that ideally large sections of the party would want to continue with the alliance. This may not happen eventually because of the distance the two parties have travelled from each other during the polls, but it will make Modi more circumspect while dealing with allies.
Despite a five-way split in Maharashtra, BJP could not secure a majority on its own though it polled close to 28 per cent votes. Modi may not just need well sewn alliances in important states like Bihar and UP but will also have to stitch his party with greater involvement and not force people to line up in awe as is his wont.
Given his personality and his dominance in government, no one will walk up to Modi and tell him that he can cannot take credit only for success but must also accept his share of responsibility when things do not go the BJP's way completely. If there is any takeaway for Modi from this round, it is a simple fact: not everything can be done by one man. He has to devolve more - both in organisation and in government.

Establishing a healthy morning routine doesn’t have to be a massive task. Pick one new habit at a time, and slowly you can shift the way you feel at the start of every day. Here are the three little things that Emily Cordes – yoga teacher, web developer and entrepreneur – does in the morning to feel better and live well every day: 1. Gratitude. Even before leaving my bed I practice gratitude by thinking of one thing I’m thankful for. Someone I love, the awesome city I live in or the comfort of a good cup of tea. This positivity really helps shape my mood for the rest of the day. 2. Mindfulness. Mindfulness can leave you calmer, more focused and happier. Sit quietly, set a timer for 3 minutes and bring your attention back to your breath again and again. If you don’t have three minutes to spare, focus on just three full breaths sitting on the train on the way to work, or waiting at the traffic lights. 3. Movement. Roll out your yoga mat for a few rounds of sun salutations, or lace up your shoes and head out for a walk. Whether you have 2 minutes or 30, find time to get your body moving and stretch out after being still all night.

BJP scripts history in Haryana  to form its first govt in stateBharatiya Janata Party scripts history in Haryana, to form its first govt in state
Hitender Rao , Hindustan Times  Chandigarh, October 19, 2014

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won a resounding victory in Haryana on Sunday with an absolute majority of 47 seats in the 90-member assembly, putting it on course to form the party’s first government in the state on its own.

The party cashed in on the strong anti-Jat sentiment after 18 years of successive Jat chief ministers in the state, where the BJP has until now only been a junior partner in the Haryana Vikas Party (HVP) and Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) governments.
The BJP is expected to put forward a non-Jat leader’s name for the next chief minister of Haryana. Among the frontrunners for the top post are state BJP chief and senior leader Ram Bilas Sharma, 66, and sangh pracharak from Rohtak, Manohar Lal Khattar, 60, who won his debut election from Karnal with a huge.

Until now, the BJP was a fringe player in Haryana, with just four seats in the previous assembly. It relied on regional entities such as the late Bansi Lal’s HVP and Om Prakash Chautala’s INLD.
The BJP’s aggressive campaigning against political dynasties got a mixed response as the older sons of former chief ministers Bhajan Lal and Bansi Lal lost their seats but most members of the INLD clan managed to win in spite of their party's poor performance.
The dreams of the main opposition INLD, which was seeking to return to power after a decade of wilderness, were dashed, but two of three members of the Om Prakash Chautala family won their seats.
While senior INLD leader Abhay Singh Chautala won from Ellenabad, senior leader Ajay Singh Chautala’s wife, Naina, won from Dabwali. She is the first woman from the Devi Lal clan to have contested the polls.

However, Dushyant Chautala, the INLD's Hisar MP and grandson of former chief minister Om Prakash Chautala, lost to the BJP’s Prem Lata Singh, the wife of senior saffron party leader Birender Singh, who defeated him from Uchana Kalan.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other BJP leaders, including party chief Amit Shah, had aggressively campaigned in Haryana in the run-up to the polls, asking the voters to put an end to the rule of political dynasties in the state.

The party virtually swept the northern and southern parts of Haryana with 32 seats. The saffron wave was evident in the northern parts from Panchkula district to Panipat district, where the BJP candidates won 21 seats. In southern Haryana, it won 11 seats falling in Gurgaon, Rewari and Mahendergarh districts.
The party’s performance in the Jat heartland of Jind, Hisar, Rohtak, Sonepat, Bhiwani, however, was not impressive. Of the 25 Jat candidates fielded by the party, only six could win.

BJP to form govt in Haryana  largest party in MaharashtraComments
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) stormed to power in Haryana on Sunday and was set to form the government in Maharashtra as well, in a verdict that underlined Prime Minister Narendra Modi's indisputable role in helping expand the party's national footprint.
 
Both victories are historic for the BJP. In Haryana, where the party had never been a force, it won 47 seats in a 90-member assembly to take power on its own. In Maharashtra, it emerged as the single largest party, bagging 122 seats in the 288-member House — which is enough to form a coalition government on its own terms.

The party had taken a huge a gamble by going it alone in both states, which have either been traditional Congress strongholds or led by regional forces, but its decision to sever ties with its allies paid off.
 
Sunday's verdict sets the momentum for the party's campaign for a string of assembly polls over the next two years. It gives the BJP significant political leverage over the country's financial capital, Mumbai, and enhances its capacity for quick political mobilization in the region around the national capital, New Delhi.

Modi's intensive campaigning in both states helped the party, but its win was also partly a result of severe anti-incumbency sentiment against the Congress. Allegations of corruption and crony capitalism plagued both the Bhupinder Singh Hooda government in Chandigarh and the Congress-NCP alliance in Mumbai.
 
BJP president Amit Shah said the results were a vindication of the leadership of Modi who won a landslide victory in the April-May Lok Sabha elections.
"This is a reply to those who said after a few bypoll results that the Modi wave is over. It shows Modiji is the undisputed leader … the Modi wave is like a tsunami which has drowned everyone," he said.
As BJP supporters erupted in celebrations, the mood at the Congress camp was sombre. The grand old party suffered another humiliating defeat in the assembly elections after its worst-ever performance in the Lok Sabha elections earlier this year.
"We accept the verdict of people. People have voted for a change, after 15 years of our government in Maharashtra and 10 years in Haryana," Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi said in a statement.
He added the Congress will "work hard on the ground to once again earn the confidence of the people".
Highlights
 
 
The BJP's win was particularly stunning in Haryana where it leapt to a majority from just four seats in the previous assembly. The party's victory was largely a result of its decision to turn old caste equations on their head and mobilise non-Jat social groups in the state.
The saffron party won 47 seats, one more than the magic number. The Indian National Lok Dal (INLD), whose chief Om Prakash Chautala is in the Tihar jail in connection with a recruitment scam, came second with 19 seats.

The Congress won 15 seats, while the Haryana Janhit Congress (HJC) - BJP's estranged ally - bagged two seats.
In Maharashtra, the party's decision to campaign alone after snapping ties with its 25-year-old ally, the Shiv Sena, turned out to be a winning strategy as it established the BJP as the dominant partner. It was hoping for a majority win, but its showing was still impressive.
It had never contested more than 119 seats in the past and won more seats this time than it had ever fought earlier. Its vote share jumped from 14% to close to 28%, establishing the BJP as the clear senior partner in any future alliance.
 
The Sena, fighting alone in the polls, won 63 seats and hinted that it was ready for talks with the BJP. However, Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray also indicated that it will not approach the BJP on its own.  
Some reports said Uddhav congratulated Modi and BJP chief Shah after the writing on the wall was clear in signs that he too was warming up to the party.
Intense negotiations are expected over the next few days in the state, but Shah categorically said the BJP will form a government in Maharashtra. "There will be a BJP government and there will be a BJP chief minister in the state."
Read: BJP keen on Sena, but will drive hard bargain
Union Minister Nitin Gadkari, considered close to RSS leadership, has been offered the post of Maharashtra CM, party sources said.  They said Gadkari was reluctant but had been given a couple of days to decide; clarity is expected in a day or two.
Devendra Fadnavis, a fellow politician from Nagpur, is a strong contender for the job. The BJP’s parliamentary board has decided to send home minister Rajnath Singh to Mumbai as central observer to oversee the election of BJP legislature party leader.
 
The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) offered outside support to a BJP-led government, triggering talks of new political equations in the wake of the verdict. Sharad Pawar's NCP could bag just 41 seats in these elections.
Its past ally, the Congress, however, was the worst affected. It won just 42 seats, down from the 82 it was able to bag in 2009.

Assembly election results and reforms push may cheer markets

(Fund managers warn that…)
MUMBAI: The much-awaited reform push by the government over the weekend will come as a shot in the arm for the markets, which have been dragged down recently by renewed concern over slowing global growth, particularly in Europe. While the market is expected to open firm on Monday after the government's decision to deregulate diesel prices, upsides may be capped as the extent of the gas price increase, another long-awaited reform measure, has been lower than what the market was anticipating. Further, the assembly election results, broadly favourable to BJP, had been largely discounted by markets.
In the Maharashtra and Haryana elections, the market was expecting Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to form the government on its own. While the party managed a simple majority in Haryana, it will need outside support in Maharashtra to form a government.
"Both, elections results and deregulation of diesel prices, are broadly favourable but were expected and discounted partly by the market," said Saurabh Mukherjea, CEO, Institutional Equities , Ambit Capital. "I don't think there will be a huge reaction. But, yes, the market will gain a percent on Monday".
Echoing Mukherjea, Samir Arora, founder and fund manager of Singapore-based Helios Capital, said, "BJP's performance in both Maharashtra and Haryana is a positive for markets although some of this may be already discounted."
The decision to let diesel prices be set by the market is expected to send out positive signals to foreign investors — some of whom were losing patience on India after the government failed to announce the so-called big bang reforms. Scrapping the diesel subsidy is seen as key to reducing the fiscal deficit , which may prompt the Reserve Bank of India to consider rate cuts.
"Diesel price deregulation is a positive for market sentiment," said Sanjeev Prasad, senior ED and co-head, Kotak Institutional Equities.
On Friday, the Sensex rose 109 points, closing at 26,108.53. The Sensex had touched life-high of 27354.99 on September 8. But the Index has fallen 4.55% since then largely because of the weakening growth prospects in the world's major economies, notably in Europe, where some key economies appear close to tipping into recession .
Fund managers and analysts warn that if the situation in Europe worsens, the market would remain indifferent to pro-business steps undertaken by the government. Also, continued selling by foreign institutional investors, which have dumped shares worth about Rs4,000 crore so far in October, may keep the market on the edge. Shares of oil marketing companies could firm up on Monday on the back of the decision to deregulate diesel prices. But, analysts are still hesitant to 'rerate' the sector.
"It will have a moderate positive impact on the net profits of oil marketing companies if the government exempts them from bearing any net under-recoveries (gross under-recoveries less compensation from the government and upstream companies), which was around Rs 21 billion (Rs 2,100 crore) in FY2014," said Prasad. "The sharp reduction in overall subsidies should allow the government to exempt the OMCs and GAIL from bearing any under-recoveries."
Shares of companies such as Reliance Industries, ONGC and Oil India may see only limited upside, said analysts.
"Gas price increase is a modest positive as the revised price is not enough to incentivise meaningful investment in the Indian upstream sector by private companies," said Prasad. "The government has allowed a higher price for new deep-water discoveries, but it may still not be sufficient to incentivise investment in risky deep-water projects."

Revealed: Why Indian gold smuggling loses its shineWith seizures up, Indian gold smuggling loses its shine
Reuters –  Fri 17 Oct, 2014 5:16 AM IST

By Rajendra Jadhav and Meenakshi Sharma
MUMBAI (Reuters) - Gold smuggling into India, the world's second-biggest consumer of the precious metal, is becoming more risky for couriers following a surge in seizures and less profitable for the gangs behind the practice.
After being caught off guard by a jump in smuggling on the back of a hike in import duty last year, government agencies have stepped up seizures to the extent that couriers are demanding more money to carry in gold, according to customs intelligence officials and an industry analyst.
At the same time, a drop in the gap between local and global prices also means there is less profit to be made by smuggling in gold, giving banks more business and higher revenue for a government struggling to rein in a fiscal deficit.
"Gold smuggling was highly profitable ... but now with the drop in premiums and tight security, legal imports are increasing," said Milind Lanjewar, additional commissioner of customs intelligence at Mumbai international airport.
Seizures at the airport, one of India's biggest hubs, jumped almost nine fold to 604 kg in the period running from April to September 2014 against 70 kg in the same period a year ago. 
Customs and police have also got wise to some of the tricks used to bring in gold, such as adopting the methods used by drug smugglers by getting human mules to swallow nuggets or in one case hiding gold bars in dead cows.
"The risk of seizures has risen. Carriers are now demanding 287 rupees ($4.70) per 10 gram compared to 150 rupees last year," said Sudheesh Nambiath, a senior analyst at consultancy Thomson Reuters GFMS. Based on the estimate, a courier bringing in 1 kg of gold currently worth around $40,000 at world prices could earn $470 if not caught.
A customs official, who declined to be named, said smugglers risked a jail term of up to seven years, though he said such a penalty was rare and the main deterrent was confiscating gold.
CRASHING PREMIUMS
Premiums have crashed to around $12 an ounce over London prices, compared to a record of $160 last year after the imposition of a record high 10 percent import duty.
"Smuggled gold is still landing in the country, but the pace has been moderating due to lower premiums," said Daman Prakash Rathod, director with Chennai-based wholesaler MNC Bullion.
On other hand, India's legal gold imports surged 450 percent in September from a year ago to $3.75 billion.
"It is difficult to quantify, but certainly smuggling has gone down," said a leading gold dealer based in Dubai, one of the main sources of gold for smugglers to India.
The World Gold Council has estimated about 200 tonnes will be smuggled into India in 2014, versus 150-200 tonnes last year.
According to the industry body, Indian gold demand was 974.8 tonnes last year, second only to China.
But a Mumbai-based bank dealer said with little prospect of premiums rebounding smuggling in the December quarter could be half of last year's level based on the legal imports coming in for a period when demand rises due to festivals like Diwali.
 
OVERSHADOWING NARCOTICS TRADE
Indian customs officials appear to have got more on top of gold smuggling.
"Until 2012, intelligence agencies were focused on the narcotics trade as gold smuggling was negligible," said a government official who did not want to be named. "As smuggling rose, agencies gradually built a network of informers."
Whistleblowers who help bust illegal gold shipments can get a bigger reward in India than those who help catch cocaine and heroin smugglers.
A jeweller based in Kochi in the southern state of Kerala said that with gold smuggling already falling, any move to cut India's import duty even just by 2-3 percentage points would make the practice barely worth while.
Some in the gold industry expect that the duty could be cut after the peak demand season ends in December, while others argue a reduction is unlikely before March next year.
 

LIC ups stake in Infy; buys shares worth Rs 1 400 crLIC hikes stake in Infosys; buys shares worth Rs 1,400 crore

(State-owned life insurer LIC has…)
NEW DELHI: State-owned life insurer LIC has shored up its stake in Infosys to 4.45 per cent, purchasing shares that are worth about Rs 1,400 crore in the July- September quarter.
This is the second consecutive quarter of share purchase by LIC in the software services firm.
While the exact date of share purchased by LIC could not be ascertained, Infosys new CEO and Managing Director Vishal Sikka took charge of the company from August.
Life Insurance Corporation of India, the biggest institutional investor in the stock market, which held 3.25 per cent stake in Infosys during the January-March quarter, has increased holding to 4.45 per cent as of September 30, 2014.
During April-June quarter, LIC had 3.71 per cent stake in the country's second largest software services firm.
The state-run firm has been increasing its holding in Infosys since the January-March quarter.
Prior to that LIC had been reducing its stake in the software company since last year. It held 6.72 per cent stake in IT firm at the end of June 30, 2013, as per the latest data available with the stock exchanges.
Taking into account the current market value of Infosys shares, the 0.63 per cent hike in LIC's holding in the company would be worth about Rs 1,400 crore. Infosys shares closed at Rs 3,853.85 on Friday.
Sikka, the first outsider as well as not part of the co-founder's club to lead the Bangalore-based firm, was the head of technology and innovation department at German software giant SAP.
Also, mentor N R Narayana Murthy stepped down in June four years before his tenure was to end. He was brought back to head the IT major in June last year, following quarters of laggard performance. Since Murthy's return, Infosys had seen 11 top-level exits.
Apart from LIC, Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs), too, raised their holding in Infosys to 14.48 per cent during the July-September quarter of 2014 from 14.08 per cent in the preceding three months.
Besides, Foreign Institutional Investors raised their exposure in Infosys to 42.67 per cent from 41.58 per cent during the period.

(Overseas investors have…)
NEW DELHI: Overseas investors have pulled out a massive Rs 3,755 crore from the Indian stock market since the beginning of this month, mainly on account of profit booking.
In comparison, the debt market saw huge inflow of over Rs 10,200 crore during the period.
Foreign investors were gross buyers of equities worth Rs 32,484 crore till October 17 and sellers to the tune of Rs 36,239 crore, registering a net outflow of Rs 3,755 crore ($612 million), according to the latest data.
The outflow comes after overseas investments in the stock market hit 7-months low in September.
"We have witnessed an outflow in this month mainly due to profit booking and the market is also in a consolidation mode," CNI Research Head Kishor Ostwal said.
He further said that the long-term prospects of staying invested in India are still positive.
Overseas investors (Foreign Institutional Investors or Foreign Portfolio Investors) had pumped in a little over Rs 5,100 crore in Indian equity markets in September, making it the lowest net investment since February when they had infused Rs 1,404 crore.
Since the beginning of this year, foreign investors have infused a net amount of Rs 79,682 crore ($13.3 billion) into the share market , while they invested a net of Rs 1.28 lakh crore into the debt market ($21.3 billion).
From the beginning of June, FIIs along with sub-accounts and qualified foreign investors have been clubbed together by capital market regulator Sebi to create a new investor category called FPIs.

BCCI s damages bill to West Indies may touch $65mMore
BCCI's damages bill to West Indies may touch $65m
The BCCI's working committee will decide whether to go ahead with the claim at a meeting on October 21 in Hyderabad.

The BCCI is likely to claim damages of at least Rs 400 crore (US$65 million approx) from the WICB for West Indies having pulled out of the tour to India. The BCCI's working committee will decide whether to go ahead with the claim at a meeting on October 21 in Hyderabad.
West Indies had agreed to play five ODIs, a Twenty20 and three Tests in India, but pulled out after the fourth ODI, in Dharamsala, due to the players being displeased over a revision to their payment structure. This meant that the BCCI lost out on revenue for 17 match-days. Though Sri Lanka agreed to fill in for West Indies and play five ODIs in India in November, the BCCI will still lose income for 12 match-days for the 2014-15 season. The BCCI is likely to claim those damages from the WICB.
"We have referred the matter to our legal cell and asked them to let us know by 21st about how we can pursue the issue legally," BCCI secretary Sanjay Patel told ESPNcricinfo, declining to elaborate on the numbers since he said they were still being computed. "They [WICB] entered into a bilateral agreement with us, and they abandoned the tour due to their internal issues, so we will have to seek compensation. But, depending on the legal advice, the working committee will decide the future course of action."

For the 2013-14 season, revenue for each match-day of India's home series against West Indies was believed to be approximately Rs 33 crore. BCCI insiders revealed that the 2014-15 season's estimation was "around the same as last year". This would mean that the West Indies' pullout will result in BCCI losing at least Rs 396 crore.
According the agreements signed between Full Members for bilateral series, each board keeps the revenue generated for their home series and incur logistics costs from the time the visiting team arrives in the country till they board a return flight.
The BCCI's revenue is primarily generated through broadcast sponsorship, series-title sponsorship, team-title sponsorship, apparel sponsorship, minor share of advertising from host broadcaster, gate receipts and in-stadia advertising. Since the broadcast and series-title sponsorships deals are on a per match basis, irrespective of whether it's a T20, Test or ODI, that income is unlikely to be affected since the five cancelled matches against West Indies (three Tests, an ODI and a Twenty20) will be replaced by five ODIs against Sri Lanka. The apparel sponsorship deal is for a fixed amount, irrespective on the number of matches at home.
However, since the broadcaster's revenue through advertising is going to be affected with the loss of 12 match-days, including a full Test series, that will have an impact on the BCCI's coffers as the board gets a minor share of advertising revenue from the host broadcaster. Also, it is likely that Star India, the host broadcaster, may ask for a reduction in broadcast fees which they have been paying to the board. At the moment, Star India pays the BCCI Rs 43.20 crore per match.
The decrease in broadcast revenues will also impact the state associations since the BCCI distributes 70% of it equally amongst the 27 members who participate in the Ranji Trophy. Besides, if any of the five state associations that were allotted one of the cancelled games against West Indies don't get a game against Sri Lanka, they will also lose out on substantial income. The host associations get to keep income generated through ticket sales and in-stadia advertising.
BCCI members keen on cutting WI tours
Besides taking legal recourse for the loss of income, some BCCI members are also calling for a reduction in tours to the West Indies. While joint-secretary Anurag Thakur said the BCCI should cut "all ties" with West Indies, a majority of members believe the BCCI should do away with at least half of their tours to the Caribbean scheduled over the next eight years.
According to the draft FTP, India are supposed to play 10 Tests, 15 ODIs and four T20s over five series during the FTP cycle from 2015 to 2023. Four of these five series are scheduled to be played in the West Indies.
BCCI members are likely to demand that India should at least do away with the tours to the West Indies in 2016 and 2017, at the working committee meeting on October 21. India are supposed to play four Tests in the West Indies in July-August 2016, and then return in July 2017 to play five ODIs and a T20.

Markets to surge on Maharashtra verdict: ExpertsThe S&P BSE Sensex is expected to open higher for second consecutive session as the market will rejoice the BJP’s performance in Haryana and Maharashtra assembly elections
ET SPECIAL:
MUMBAI: The S&P BSE Sensex is expected to open higher for second consecutive session as the market will rejoice the BJP's performance in Haryana and Maharashtra assembly elections and the government's decision to deregulate diesel prices.
Analysts are expecting a positive start for the market tomorrow.
"Election results are good, diesel has been deregulated and the US market was up on Friday. It will translate into a gap-up start on the Nifty. We may see 50-60 points upmove on the Nifty and once it breaches resistance of 7,960, it will touch 8,000 in next few sessions," said Kunal Saraogi, CEO, equityrush.com.
However, the momentum will not last and the rally will be short-lived.
The BJP will be pleased with its performance in the Haryana assembly elections as it has emerged as the single largest party and will be able to comfortably form the government.
However, the results in Maharashtra have been a bit of a dampener. The party is short of half-way mark and will have to placate old ally Shiv Sena to form the government.
"Markets will have a lot of news to digest once it opens up tomorrow. You have election results, diesel price deregulation and gas price hike. BJP short of half-way mark in Maharashtra will be a dampener. I think there are enough factors for the market to correct. The gas price hike is positive but below market expectations," said Prakash Diwan, Director, Altamount Capital Management.
According to Saraogi, traders should not expect a new high this Diwali though we may see a bullish momentum overall. He cautions that though the US market has rebounded sharply, chart structures globally are not bullish and most of them have broken down.
However, market expert, A K Prabhakar is of the view that market momentum will continue.
"The election result will be a positive for the market. It will help BJP to increases numbers in Rajya Sabha. The reforms have started; diesel regulation, gas price hike and labour reforms are just the beginning. I expect gap-up opening for the market," said market expert, A K Prabhakar.
"It is not for the first time that FIIs are sellers in October. They will be back in November and December. Even if there is a sell-off, it will be absorbed," Prabhakar added.
Post election results, the government announced new gas price at $5.61 per mmbtu from $4.2 per mmbtu earlier. The diesel price has been deregulated and the prices are down by Rs 3.37 per litre in Delhi.
This new gas price hike will be effective from November 1, 2014 while the diesel price cut has come into effect.
"Our market has been resilient to sell-off in global markets on expectations of positive outcome in Maharashtra. Now, we may give-in and see a correction. Tomorrow, the market will be soft but post Diwali, next Monday, the market will see a correction and we may see the Nifty to slip to 7,500," Diwan added.
According to him, nobody is building fresh position because of FIIs exit we on the cash side. Till muhurat trading, things are expected to be benign. Global worries will also have an impact on the market now.
Economic data from China such as GDP and industrial production will be important triggers for global markets. Concerns of recession in Japan and Europe still remain.
However, correction will be good opportunity to buy.
Morgan Stanley is of the view that diesel price deregulation is a welcome move. New structure of gas pricing will boost E&P.
"New gas pricing announced a step in right direction. For ONGC/OIL india key things now to watch is operational efficiency and new subsidy sharing formula. For RIL Industries , CCEA decision to provide premium price for discoveries in deep water, ultra deep water is positive since most of new discoveries like MJ-1 , R-series is in deep water areas," said Morgan Stanley report.
"Government has taken a very long term view of 5-10 years where common man will be less burdened, industries like steel petrochemicals will get domestic gas instead of costly LNG and domestic gas producers will have incentive to produce more which will increase gas production in India," the report added.

Gas price
(Some officials of exploration…)
NEW DELHI: The Modi government's decision to raise natural gas prices to $5.6 per unit from $4.2 will significantly boost the earnings of ONGC, but private explorers who were pitching for higher rates and waiting for signals of eventual decontrol are disappointed.
Some officials of exploration companies, particularly in the private sector were disappointed and expressed concern that the price was not good enough to attract more investment. But ONGC Chairman DK Sarraf welcomed the decision and said every $1 increase in price would add Rs 4,000 crore in its annual top line and Rs 2,350 crore on the bottom line.
"The government's decisions to have a non-controversial gas pricing mechanism will encourage both the company and the industry to undertake exploration and development works," Sarraf told ET. The new gas price will not be applicable to Reliance Industries' KG-D6 production, as expected, because the company is in arbitration with the government.
RIL will get the old price unless it makes up for the shortfall in gas production, for which the oil ministry blames the company, while Reliance attributes the decline to geological reasons. But consumers will pay the new price.
"It is proposed that the difference between the revised price and the present price ($4.2 per mmBtu) would be credited to the gas pool account maintained by Gail India, and whether the amount so collected is payable or not to the contractors of this block would be dependent on the outcome of the award of pending arbitration and any attendant legal proceedings," the government said in a statement on Saturday evening.
For gas consumers, the decision is a breather because the increase is 75 per cent less than what was expected from the Rangarajan formula which the UPA regime had approved but could not implement. But consumers such as power plants are more concerned about the supply of natural gas, which has been falling, leaving many of their plants idle or sub-optimal.
"Natural gas supply is a bigger concern than pricing. State utilities are buying power produced from expensive imported natural gas to meet the demand in peak hours. It would be important to see if this revised price results in higher natural gas flow," said an executive with a Gujarat-based power project.
He added that power produced from natural gas at revised price will remain in the range of Rs 3 to RS 4 per unit and will continue to remain affordable for power utilities. Ashok Khurana, director general of Association of Power Producers, said the decision augured well for the power sector.
"Decision on natural gas price revision is a good development for the power sector since it eliminates uncertainty for the developers while exploration companies will also get higher returns on their investments," he told ET.
"It is far below than $8.4 proposed by the Rangarajan panel. Many discoveries will not be viable at this rate," an executive working for a private explorer said requesting anonymity. Association of Oil & Gas Operators (AOGO), whose members include global and domestic energy majors such as BG, BP, Eni, Cairn India, Reliance Industries and ONGC, expressed disappointment at the decision.
Sarraf said the gas pricing policy has taken care of deepwater discoveries which might not be economically viable at $5.61 per unit. The government has promised higher rates for future discoveries in deepwater regions.
"For all discoveries after this decision, in Ultra Deep Water Areas, Deep Water Areas and High Pressure-High Temperature areas, a premium would be given on the gas price to be determined as per the prescribed procedure," the government said in its statement on gas pricing. Industry is concerned that there is no clarity on the extent of premium, its basis of calculation, and the fact that this reinforces state control on natural gas prices.
Exploration firms say that gas should have the same pricing freedom as oil, which is sold at international rates from local oilfields. The government also expanded incentives for oil and gas firms in the northeast.

Pre-market: Nifty seen opening higher; may reclaim 7900 levelsGEPL Capital
NEW DELHI: The 50-share Nifty index is expected to open higher on Monday following positive trend seen in other Asian markets and SGX Nifty. Tracking the momentum, the index is expected to reclaim its crucial psychological level of 7,900 in trade today.
At 07:30 a.m., Nifty India stock futures in Singapore were trading points 124.50 higher at 7,943.50 indicating a gap-up opening on the domestic market.
Benchmark indices bounced back strongly on Friday supported by strong global cues. BSE's Sensex ended 109.19 points higher and closed at 26108.53, while NSE's Nifty rose 31.50 points to close at 7,779.7.
The weekly close for Nifty was still lower by just over a 1 per cent from previous week. The index ended below the key support level of 7,840 on a weekly closing basis, which confirms further weakness till at least 7,660.
The decline is highly possible as the price has confirmed the reversal after the warning signs that were in place for several weeks on the weekly chart in the form of negative divergences registered by the momentum measures.
"We recommend avoiding fresh longs till the time Nifty trades below the level of 7930. On any bounce back the index may now face resistance near 7,800 to 7,840 range," GEPL Capital said in a report.
"Higher up the level of 7,930 is a very strong resistance for the index and weakness would persist till the time 7,920 is not conquered decisively," added the report.
On Friday, US markets climbed more than 1 per cent, though the S&P 500 index posted its fourth straight weekly decline.
"The upbeat U.S. data has brought some calm to markets after a week of turbulence as signs of softening global growth rattled investors, sending volatility spiking to levels not seen in years," Reuters reported.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 24.5 points, or 0.15 per cent, to 16,117.24, the S&P 500 gained 0.27 points, or 0.01 per cent, to 1,862.76 and the Nasdaq Composite added 2.07 points, or 0.05 per cent, to 4,217.39.
Asian shares were trading higher. Japan's Nikkei 225 index which was trading 0.02 per cent higher at 14,741 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was trading 0.33 per cent higher at 22,982.
South Korea's Kospi index was trading 0.02 per cent higher at 1,916 and China's Shanghai index was trading 0.56 per cent lower at 2,342.

University disinvites journalist over EbolaSyracuse University disinvites journalist over Ebola fears
By Frank Pallotta   @frankpallotta October 17, 2014: 1:21 PM ET
Photojournalist Michel du Cille has been covering the Ebola outbreak for The Washington Post. An example of his work (above).
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
Photojournalist Michel du Cille was scheduled to appear before students at Syracuse University this week.
But his invite was rescinded on Thursday over concerns about his potential contact with the Ebola virus .
The Pulitzer Prize winning photojournalist had covered the outbreak in Liberia for The Washington Post last month. He returned from the area 21 days ago (the CDC's incubation period for the disease) and has shown no symptoms of Ebola.
However, it wasn't enough to allay fears at Syracuse, where du Cille was taking part in a fall workshop at its S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications.
The university chose caution because of the proximity of dates of his appearance and his visit to Liberia.
"This was a decision we made based on our concerns for students," Newhouse dean Lorraine Branham said. "It had been exactly 21 days on the day he was supposed to come up."
Related: Ebola is spooking Wall Street
Branham added that it wasn't a decision the university made lightly.
"We understand there's a lot of hysteria out there," she said. "We knew that there'd be students and faculty feeling panicky about this... we decided to err on the side of caution."
Related: UN asks $1 billion for Ebola, gets $100,000
For du Cille, the real disappointment was the loss of a teachable moment.
"What a missed opportunity to teach future media professionals how to seek out accurate hard facts; backed up with full details about the Ebola crisis," du Cille wrote on Facebook Thursday. "I guess it is easier to pull the hysteria and xenophobia cards."
Syracuse said it would have du Cille speak on this issue at the university in the future.
Examples of du Cille's work in Liberia are included below:

Sri Lanka to host next Test series against IndiaTweet
0
Sri Lanka, who were supposed to tour India for three Tests in August 2015, will now host the series, according to Nishantha Ranatunga, the SLC secretary.
"As we are obliging India with a five-match ODI series there next month, India are obliged to return the tour next year and we have switched the Test series," Ranatunga said.
The BCCI, however, is yet to confirm the swap. It is understood that the BCCI has held preliminary discussions with SLC in this regard. The proposal of switching the venue for the 2015 Test series will be put before the working committee for consideration, which will "finalise" the arrangement, according to a senior BCCI functionary.
India haven't hosted Sri Lanka for Tests since 2009. (AFP)
The decision to swap the hosting rights for the Test series has come in the wake of Sri Lanka agreeing to play a five-match ODI series in India after West Indies' pullout.
By hosting the three-Test series with India, SLC stands to make around $ 7-8 million, according to Ranatunga. There will be no ODIs or T20Is included in the itinerary.
India haven't hosted Sri Lanka for Tests since 2009 and the last time Sri Lanka hosted a India for Tests was in 2010, the series that marked the retirement of Muttiah Muralitharan.
The next available slot for a Test series between the two teams, as per the new FTP, is in August 2017 when Sri Lanka are scheduled to host India for a three Tests, five ODIs and one T20.

Diwali Shopping
(Supermarkets and consumer…)
NEW DELHI | KOLKATA | MUMBAI: Malls and markets in and around Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata have been teeming with shoppers scouring for Diwali gifts and grabbing the latest electronic items this weekend, bringing relief to traditional retailers facing an unprecedented heavy discounting onslaught from online retailers.
Supermarkets and consumer durable companies said it is a much better Diwali shopping season — when traditionally the biggest chunk of their annual sales takes place — than last year, thanks to improved consumer sentiments, although some smaller retailers have been impacted by big online sales.
"There is a good number of serious shoppers out there," said William Bissell, managing director at Fabindia. The retail chain of ethnic garments and furnishings has seen a 31 per cent year-on-year jump in its sales so far this Diwali season.
Vineet Jain, vice president for Big Bazaar in the Delhi region at Future Group , said, "Probably, today (Sunday) is going to be the best single-day sale for us in NCR (national capital region)." Even electronics retailers reported sales jump despite huge discounting offered by e-commerce companies such as Flipkart, Amazon and Snapdeal, thanks to the decision of top brands such as Sony, Samsung and LG to control supply of their top models to online stores.
"This weekend there has been huge rush in malls and parking spaces too are full after a long time, which is a good sign," said Ajit Joshi, CEO and MD at Tata Group's Infiniti Retail that owns Croma electronics retail chain.
"Sales have been extremely good, especially for large appliances like frost-free refrigerators and entertainment products like televisions and home theatres," he said. This festive season all top companies such as Apple, Sony, Samsung, LG and Lenovo have launched their flagship models, and mostly they were kept away from online stores.
"Some consumers were waiting in the wings for good offers during the ecommerce discount period but since they failed to get their desired product, they are back in the malls," a senior executive at a top electronics chain said on condition of anonymity. Consumer electronics firms have been banking heavily on this Diwali after poor performance last year when consumers shied away from making costly purchases due to the economic scenario and inflation, and marketers did not launch any big model then. Amar Babu, managing director at Lenovo India, said consumer sentiments have improved and the company expects a good season.
"After last year's Diwali, the market had become really tough but we are witnessing good demand since last 7-8 days," he said. Sony India said demand for its flat-screen televisions have soared by 40-50 per cent over the period before Diwali last year, helped by a sudden pickup in the last one week.
Sunil Nayyar, head of sales for Sony India, said the company targets 60-70 per cent sales growth this Diwali, led by heavy demand for flat-screen large televisions of 42-56 inches, which segment is expected to contribute 55 per cent of total sales. Garment retailers such as Pantaloons Fashion and Arvind Lifestyle Brands, too, said Diwali sales had a delayed start.
Offline retailers feel it's is no longer a month-long festive buying phenomenon as Diwali sales period has been shrinking each year. Less number of shopping days doesn't necessarily mean lower sales.
"While we saw delayed start to Diwali shopping this year, like-to-like sales growth has increased 10 per cent which we had aimed for," said Shital Mehta, chief executive officer at Pantaloons Fashion. "The growth was much higher at over 30 per cent on Saturday, which indicates that the next few crucial days leading to Diwali will also be good."
In fact, while people rushed to the malls in the weekend, they have had a near-deserted look during weekdays. J Suresh, managing director at Arvind Lifestyle Brands, said, "This Diwali, there has been a contrast of sorts with low sales during weekdays and better than expected demand on weekends." Meanwhile, some apparel and electronic retailers that had built up inventory for Diwali have been caught off-guard by the heavy discounting by e-commerce companies.

Global oil prices likely to touch to $60/bar...Aditya Birla Group
("Our economy will be back…)
MUMBAI: Egypt's former petroleum minister Osama Kamal said global crude oil prices are set to fall drastically, predicting afurther erosion of as much as a third in the coming days. "I expect crude oil prices to touch $60 per barrel. This will impact several economies," said Kamal, who was in Mumbai to address the top Aditya Birla Group executives. India is among the major investors in Egypt, with about a dozen firms employing over 35,000 locals there. "The Aditya Birla Group has one of the world's largest carbon black manufacturing units in Egypt. There is also a newly constructed polyester plant with a production capacity of 420,000 tonne per annum," he said.
Kamal said Egypt's economy is back on the path to recovery. "Our economy will be back on track in three years. The signs are already visible. Inflation is hovering around 8.2% and we have also controlled fuel consumption," he said, adding that the new social security programme has helped control food prices.
Egypt is implementing an ambitious plan of developing the Suez Canal Axis through a project involving ship building and maintenance yards, which will bring in $100 billion in investments into the country, he said.
He also said that Egypt's transition to civilian rule is progressing in accordance with the plan.

Sundays wins spray saffron hue across north  west IndiaSunday’s wins spray saffron hue across north, west India
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, October 20, 2014

Travel to north India and you will see a glimmer of Congress rule, as a junior partner or alone, in Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh. But drive past Punjab and Haryana, through Rajasthan and Gujarat, enter Maharashtra, drive down to Goa, return to the Indian heartland of Madhya Pradesh via Maharashtra and continue to Chhattisgarh — you will not have left saffron territory once.
With Sunday’s win, a large belt of the demographically sizeable  north and west India is now under the BJP’s grip.
Read: BJP set to rule Haryana, largest party in Maharashtra
The pattern is unmistakable. The Congress – India’s old natural party of governance – is losing state after state even as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), on an upward trajectory, is becoming the preferred choice for many.
A caveat is important. Four out of the five states in south India are outside the BJP ambit — it is only in alliance with the Telugu Desam Party in Andhra Pradesh.
Two of India’s biggest states, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, remain with regional parties. The east — West Bengal and Odisha — is with the Trinamool Congress and the Biju Janata Dal (BJD), and the BJP is not in power in any northeastern state.
Read: Single, successful: BJP upsets dynamics of alliance politics
But with the BJP set to form governments in Chandigarh and Mumbai, the number of state governments it has a stake in will go up to nine. In 1998, when Sonia Gandhi took over the Congress, her party was in power in four states.
By 2004, the party was governing 17 states, either alone or in alliance. And while it still has more states numerically than the BJP, this number is down to 12 states — of which two are in the south (Kerala and Karnataka) and six are in the northeast.
The BJP seems to be keenly aware of its weak spots. This is why party strategists say its focus will shift east. It will invest political muscle in Bihar, embark on an unprecedented campaign in West Bengal and Assam, before turning its focus back in 2017 on the state that gave it a majority in the Lok Sabha — Uttar Pradesh. If the winning pattern continues, be prepared for an even longer drive through saffron territory.

Reform measure GST roll out likely in April 2016Comments
India’s biggest tax reform initiative — the Goods and Services Tax (GST) — could see a staggered implementation, starting with a nationwide unified tax system for goods from April 2016 and extended to services later.
India is currently fragmented into several disjoint markets, with each state levying a different set of taxes on goods and services.
If implemented, the GST can dramatically alter the tax administration by replacing this string of central and state levies such as excise, value-added tax and octroi with a single unified tax, thereby creating a common national market.
Under the new system, the Centre and the states will tax goods at identical rates and split the revenue equally. For instance, if 20% is the agreed rate on a certain product, the Centre and states will collect 10% each.
The same model will apply for services. Under current laws, only the union government taxes services.
Sources told HT the government is likely to introduce in the winter session of Parliament the Constitution amendment bill that will lay out the roadmap for GST’s implementation, first for products and later for services.
Implementation of the tax reform has been politically contentious with states fearing GST could rob them of fiscal powers and tax revenue.
For example, Maharashtra earns more than Rs. 13,000 crore annually from octroi while Gujarat, a highly industrialized state, gets about Rs. 5,000 crore from its share of the central sales tax (CST). Agrarian states such as Punjab and Haryana also earn more than Rs. 2,000 crore from purchase tax.
All these states fear they will lose these revenues once the GST is introduced.
Most states also want petroleum and liquor to be kept out of the new tax regime.
The Centre will likely offer a fresh Rs. 35,000-crore plan spread over three years after phasing out CST — a proportion of which goes to the states — to compensate them for revenue losses, sources said.
Over the last few years, the government has gradually brought down CST from 4% to 2% as a precursor to rolling out GST.  As an interim measure, the Centre has also periodically compensated state governments for revenue losses.
The first installment – Rs. 14,000 crore — of the new CST compensation plan is likely to be paid this financial year itself, with the balance over the next two years, sources said.
Last month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and finance minister Arun Jaitley along with top finance ministry officials discussed in detail the current status of the proposed indirect tax system.
A robust country-wide information technology (IT) network and infrastructure to make the implementation seamless across state boundaries is also expected to be ready by April 2016.

ET Wealth: Find out if you should buy gold t...Can gold bounce back? Here's why experts feel that you should give yellow metal a miss this Diwali
Narendra Nathan, ET Bureau Oct 20, 2014, 10.33AM IST

Bafna
(While the one-year loss…)
What will you buy on muhurat day? Will you stock up on equities or will you go for gold? To some buyers, gold might appear very attractive right now. The domestic gold price is down more than 18% from its all-time high of Rs 33,265 per 10 gm recorded in August 2013. The past 15 months, in fact, have been devastating for gold investors. The price of the yellow metal has slipped, turning conventional wisdom on its head. Even now, analysts believe that gold faces headwinds that could take prices down in the near to medium term.
This is not good news for buyers getting ready for Dhanteras shopping. After all, their blind faith in gold had delivered handsome returns in the past decade. This changed last year, with gold churning out losses for investors who bought the yellow metal on the muhurat day in 2012 and held it till the 2013 Diwali. While the one-year loss on 2012 Diwali gold purchase was 4%, the loss till date from the 2013 Diwali gold purchase is 10%.
So, will you buy gold on Dhanteras this year? Experts say investors should give gold a miss this Diwali. Even if they want to buy gold for religious purposes, they should restrict their purchases to a small token quantity. Let us look at the global and domestic factors that are working against the yellow metal in the short and medium terms.
Strengthening dollar
International gold is traded in dollars, and if the greenback strengthens, the value of gold goes down. The dollar has strengthened 7% against other currencies in the past year (see chart). This is mainly because of fears that the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates. "International gold prices should fall by around 10% from current levels by March 2015," says Kishore Narne, associate director, Motilal Oswal Commodities Broker.
 
Falling inflation
Gold is a good hedge against inflation and global investors get on the gold train only when they fear that inflation will go up. After fears of inflation, the European Union (EU) region is facing the threat of deflation, mainly due to the fall in global commodity prices. The international crude oil (Brent variety) is now trading at $83 per barrel, a two-year low. Most global agriculture commodities are also at multi-year lows. The inflationary pressure has ebbed significantly in the US as well.
Investors deserting gold
Investors have also deserted the gold market. The gold holdings of the SPDR Gold Trust, the largest gold ETF in the world, are down 44% from their peak of 1,353 tonnes in December 2012. They don't see any upside potential now from the current levels. "Gold is no more in a buy zone. At best, it is in a hold zone," says Sudip Bandyopadhyay, president, Destimoney Securities. Domestic investors are also deserting gold because of the recent drop in price. "The investors who bought gold above Rs 30,000 are panicky," says Hasmukh Bafna, president of the Gold Chains and Jewellery Wholesalers Welfare Association. People shifting to investments such as stocks is another reason for this dullness in the domestic gold market. "People are still buying small quantities of jewellery, but the demand for gold bars and coins has almost dried down," says Prithviraj Kothari, president of the Bombay Bullion Association. However, analysts don't see a major downside because the current price is close to the mining cost. "Gold has a strong support at $1,180 because the gold mining costs are around $1,150," says C P Krishnan, whole time director, Geojit Comtrade.
Faltering demand
The consumption demand for gold is down partly due to the government's restrictions on imports. Domestic demand may bounce back once these restrictions are withdrawn, but the demand slowdown in China, the biggest gold consumer, may continue. "China has witnessed a moderation in purchases following the hectic buying in the previous year. This will be a drag on prices," says Naveen Mathur, associate director, commodities & currencies at Angel Broking.
Rupee may not weaken significantly
The domestic gold price is down 18% from its peak, but the international gold price is down by 35%. The decline of the rupee against the dollar had cushioned the fall of gold in the domestic market. Though the rupee may weaken more if the US Fed raises interest rates, the impact will be limited because the RBI is better prepared. The rupee has remained relatively stable in the Rs 60-62 per dollar range despite a significant jump in the Dollar Index in the past three months.

Modi wave again crushed opponents: Amit ShahPrint

Maharashtra: BJP keen on Sena  but will drive hard bargainComments
The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) sprang a surprise on Sunday by offering outside support for the BJP to form the government in Maharashtra, leaving the Shiv Sena little room to bargain with its former ally.

BJP sources said they would like to revive ties with the Sena, but the party was not prepared to accept too many demands. Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray said in the evening that he was yet to receive a proposal from the BJP.
 
Thackeray called up Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah to congratulate them on the party’s victory, signalling a thaw in the icy relationship. 
The BJP more than doubled its seat count in the state but fell short of majority in an election where it ran on its own after ending a 25-year-old coalition with the Sena.
 
“They (Shiv Sena) were not ready to give us three extra seats. It has been established who was right. But we did not break the alliance. We continued our support to them in the Mumbai municipal corporation and they remained a part of the Union government,” Shah told reporters.

The BJP’s tactics to contest more seats and get majority on its own may not have been a complete success but its strategy to prove itself a dominant force in Maharashtra was a hit. Its vote share jumped from 14% to 27% and the number of legislators went up from 46 to 122.
 
The party managed to increase its footprints in the state by contesting about 260 seats compared to 117 when it was in alliance with the Shiv Sena.
 
The Sena had softened its stance over the past two days saying there was no animosity between the two parties, but following the fractured mandate some of its leaders said the party could still get the chief minister’s chair.

The BJP parliamentary board which met in the evening studied the poll results and took note of the NCP's offer of unconditional support without giving it much importance.
 
It was decided in the meeting that home minister Rajnath Singh will go to Maharashtra and urban development minister Venkaiah Naidu to Haryana to elect the leader of the BJP legislature party in the two states.

The BJP is largely in favour of keeping the Shiv Sena on board to provide stability to the state government and the Maharashtra leadership has been asked to warmly reciprocate to any gestures from the Sena, sources said.
 
The details of how to reach out to the Sena are expected after a meeting of the BJP legislature party in Mumbai in the next two-three days. “Our first assignment is to elect a leader of the legislature party, who would be the next chief minister of the state. We are in no hurry to talk to the Sena,” a central office-bearer of the BJP said.
Sources said while the NCP's proposal has provided a cushion to the BJP, leaders were not inclined to bank solely on the support of the party that has been a bitter critic for many years.
 
Political analysts called the NCP’s offer a calculated move to impress the BJP which hit it hard in the poll campaign. While canvassing, Modi made Sharad Pawar’s party his prime target, accusing senior leaders of large-scale corruption.

PT Usha to get Gujarat athletes up and runningprint
India’s most successful sprinter, PT Usha, is set to take on a marathon mission to scout and groom sporting talent in Gujarat, in response to a request from Prime Minister Narendra Modi.  
Usha, nicknamed the Payyoli Express after the Kerala village where she was born, says the invite from Modi came last year when he was Gujarat’s chief minister.
 
“Since I was busy with the Commonwealth Games and Asiad, I couldn’t do much. Now, I will be going there next month to help them,” said the 50-year-old.
Usha won four gold medals and a silver at the 1986 Seoul Asian Games and missed a podium finish at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics by a fraction of a second.
The sprinter said she was really impressed with the sporting infrastructure in Ahmedabad and Vadodara. “The selection trial will be held in main cities of the state between November 9 and 15.  We are initially planning to select 30 (boys and girls) in the 11-14 age group. Apart from this, 10 older aspirants will also be inducted,” she said.
Modi, who has promised to foster a sporting culture in the country, said this week that the government was signing pacts related to sports expertise with various countries in its bid to provide athletes with better exposure and infrastructure.
Usha said she would help realise the PM’s dream of the country winning an Olympic gold in athletics. Her coaching and training mechanism will be similar to the Usha School of Athletics, which she founded in 2002 near her village in Kerala.
Since then her school has produced some of the country’s best athletes including Asian silver medallist Tintu Luka who was also a member of the 4X400 relay team that won gold in the Incheon Asiad, Sherbana Siddique and Jessy Joseph.
The Kerala institute that began with much fanfare is, however, battling a fund crunch. Though the state government provided land for the school, it failed to support the establishment further, Usha said.                                 
“Since it is a residential school we need at least Rs. 2 lakh for a junior athlete a year. Some sponsors do ease their wallets generously. But still, financial crisis has plagued us badly and we were on the verge of closure on several occasions,” said her husband V Sreenivasan, a former kabaddi player and swimmer.

BJP to form govt in Haryana  emerges as single largest party in MaharashtraComments
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) stormed to power in Haryana on Sunday and was set to form the government in Maharashtra as well, in a verdict that underlined Prime Minister Narendra Modi's indisputable role in helping expand the party's national footprint.
 
Both victories are historic for the BJP. In Haryana, where the party had never been a force, it won 47 seats in a 90-member assembly to take power on its own. In Maharashtra, it emerged as the single largest party, bagging 122 seats in the 288-member House — which is enough to form a coalition government on its own terms.

The party had taken a huge a gamble by going it alone in both states, which have either been traditional Congress strongholds or led by regional forces, but its decision to sever ties with its allies paid off.
 
Sunday's verdict sets the momentum for the party's campaign for a string of assembly polls over the next two years. It gives the BJP significant political leverage over the country's financial capital, Mumbai, and enhances its capacity for quick political mobilization in the region around the national capital, New Delhi.
Read: Sunday’s wins spray saffron hue across north, west India
 
Modi's intensive campaigning in both states helped the party, but its win was also partly a result of severe anti-incumbency sentiment against the Congress. Allegations of corruption and crony capitalism plagued both the Bhupinder Singh Hooda government in Chandigarh and the Congress-NCP alliance in Mumbai.
 
BJP president Amit Shah said the results were a vindication of the leadership of Modi who won a landslide victory in the April-May Lok Sabha elections.
"This is a reply to those who said after a few bypoll results that the Modi wave is over. It shows Modiji is the undisputed leader … the Modi wave is like a tsunami which has drowned everyone," he said.
As BJP supporters erupted in celebrations, the mood at the Congress camp was sombre. The grand old party suffered another humiliating defeat in the assembly elections after its worst-ever performance in the Lok Sabha elections earlier this year.
"We accept the verdict of people. People have voted for a change, after 15 years of our government in Maharashtra and 10 years in Haryana," Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi said in a statement.
He added the Congress will "work hard on the ground to once again earn the confidence of the people".
Highlights
 
 
The BJP's win was particularly stunning in Haryana where it leapt to a majority from just four seats in the previous assembly. The party's victory was largely a result of its decision to turn old caste equations on their head and mobilise non-Jat social groups in the state.
The saffron party won 47 seats, one more than the magic number. The Indian National Lok Dal (INLD), whose chief Om Prakash Chautala is in the Tihar jail in connection with a recruitment scam, came second with 19 seats.

The Congress won 15 seats, while the Haryana Janhit Congress (HJC) - BJP's estranged ally - bagged two seats.
In Maharashtra, the party's decision to campaign alone after snapping ties with its 25-year-old ally, the Shiv Sena, turned out to be a winning strategy as it established the BJP as the dominant partner. It was hoping for a majority win, but its showing was still impressive.
It had never contested more than 119 seats in the past and won more seats this time than it had ever fought earlier. Its vote share jumped from 14% to close to 28%, establishing the BJP as the clear senior partner in any future alliance.
 
The Sena, fighting alone in the polls, won 63 seats and hinted that it was ready for talks with the BJP. However, Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray also indicated that it will not approach the BJP on its own.  
Some reports said Uddhav congratulated Modi and BJP chief Shah after the writing on the wall was clear in signs that he too was warming up to the party.
Intense negotiations are expected over the next few days in the state, but Shah categorically said the BJP will form a government in Maharashtra. "There will be a BJP government and there will be a BJP chief minister in the state."
Read: BJP keen on Sena, but will drive hard bargain
Union Minister Nitin Gadkari, considered close to RSS leadership, has been offered the post of Maharashtra CM, party sources said.  They said Gadkari was reluctant but had been given a couple of days to decide; clarity is expected in a day or two.
Devendra Fadnavis, a fellow politician from Nagpur, is a strong contender for the job. The BJP’s parliamentary board has decided to send home minister Rajnath Singh to Mumbai as central observer to oversee the election of BJP legislature party leader.
 
The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) offered outside support to a BJP-led government, triggering talks of new political equations in the wake of the verdict. Sharad Pawar's NCP could bag just 41 seats in these elections.
Its past ally, the Congress, however, was the worst affected. It won just 42 seats, down from the 82 it was able to bag in 2009.

Nifty seen opening higher; may reclaim 7900 levelsGEPL Capital
NEW DELHI: The 50-share Nifty index is expected to open higher on Monday following positive trend seen in other Asian markets and SGX Nifty. Tracking the momentum, the index is expected to reclaim its crucial psychological level of 7,900 in trade today.
At 07:30 a.m., Nifty India stock futures in Singapore were trading points 124.50 higher at 7,943.50 indicating a gap-up opening on the domestic market.
Benchmark indices bounced back strongly on Friday supported by strong global cues. BSE's Sensex ended 109.19 points higher and closed at 26108.53, while NSE's Nifty rose 31.50 points to close at 7,779.7.
The weekly close for Nifty was still lower by just over a 1 per cent from previous week. The index ended below the key support level of 7,840 on a weekly closing basis, which confirms further weakness till at least 7,660.
The decline is highly possible as the price has confirmed the reversal after the warning signs that were in place for several weeks on the weekly chart in the form of negative divergences registered by the momentum measures.
"We recommend avoiding fresh longs till the time Nifty trades below the level of 7930. On any bounce back the index may now face resistance near 7,800 to 7,840 range," GEPL Capital said in a report.
"Higher up the level of 7,930 is a very strong resistance for the index and weakness would persist till the time 7,920 is not conquered decisively," added the report.
On Friday, US markets climbed more than 1 per cent, though the S&P 500 index posted its fourth straight weekly decline.
"The upbeat U.S. data has brought some calm to markets after a week of turbulence as signs of softening global growth rattled investors, sending volatility spiking to levels not seen in years," Reuters reported.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 24.5 points, or 0.15 per cent, to 16,117.24, the S&P 500 gained 0.27 points, or 0.01 per cent, to 1,862.76 and the Nasdaq Composite added 2.07 points, or 0.05 per cent, to 4,217.39.
Asian shares were trading higher. Japan's Nikkei 225 index which was trading 0.02 per cent higher at 14,741 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was trading 0.33 per cent higher at 22,982.
South Korea's Kospi index was trading 0.02 per cent higher at 1,916 and China's Shanghai index was trading 0.56 per cent lower at 2,342.

ET Wealth | Find out if you should buy gold ...Can gold bounce back? Here's why experts feel that you should give yellow metal a miss this Diwali
Narendra Nathan, ET Bureau Oct 20, 2014, 10.33AM IST

Bafna
(While the one-year loss…)
What will you buy on muhurat day? Will you stock up on equities or will you go for gold? To some buyers, gold might appear very attractive right now. The domestic gold price is down more than 18% from its all-time high of Rs 33,265 per 10 gm recorded in August 2013. The past 15 months, in fact, have been devastating for gold investors. The price of the yellow metal has slipped, turning conventional wisdom on its head. Even now, analysts believe that gold faces headwinds that could take prices down in the near to medium term.
This is not good news for buyers getting ready for Dhanteras shopping. After all, their blind faith in gold had delivered handsome returns in the past decade. This changed last year, with gold churning out losses for investors who bought the yellow metal on the muhurat day in 2012 and held it till the 2013 Diwali. While the one-year loss on 2012 Diwali gold purchase was 4%, the loss till date from the 2013 Diwali gold purchase is 10%.
So, will you buy gold on Dhanteras this year? Experts say investors should give gold a miss this Diwali. Even if they want to buy gold for religious purposes, they should restrict their purchases to a small token quantity. Let us look at the global and domestic factors that are working against the yellow metal in the short and medium terms.
Strengthening dollar
International gold is traded in dollars, and if the greenback strengthens, the value of gold goes down. The dollar has strengthened 7% against other currencies in the past year (see chart). This is mainly because of fears that the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates. "International gold prices should fall by around 10% from current levels by March 2015," says Kishore Narne, associate director, Motilal Oswal Commodities Broker.
 
Falling inflation
Gold is a good hedge against inflation and global investors get on the gold train only when they fear that inflation will go up. After fears of inflation, the European Union (EU) region is facing the threat of deflation, mainly due to the fall in global commodity prices. The international crude oil (Brent variety) is now trading at $83 per barrel, a two-year low. Most global agriculture commodities are also at multi-year lows. The inflationary pressure has ebbed significantly in the US as well.
Investors deserting gold
Investors have also deserted the gold market. The gold holdings of the SPDR Gold Trust, the largest gold ETF in the world, are down 44% from their peak of 1,353 tonnes in December 2012. They don't see any upside potential now from the current levels. "Gold is no more in a buy zone. At best, it is in a hold zone," says Sudip Bandyopadhyay, president, Destimoney Securities. Domestic investors are also deserting gold because of the recent drop in price. "The investors who bought gold above Rs 30,000 are panicky," says Hasmukh Bafna, president of the Gold Chains and Jewellery Wholesalers Welfare Association. People shifting to investments such as stocks is another reason for this dullness in the domestic gold market. "People are still buying small quantities of jewellery, but the demand for gold bars and coins has almost dried down," says Prithviraj Kothari, president of the Bombay Bullion Association. However, analysts don't see a major downside because the current price is close to the mining cost. "Gold has a strong support at $1,180 because the gold mining costs are around $1,150," says C P Krishnan, whole time director, Geojit Comtrade.
Faltering demand
The consumption demand for gold is down partly due to the government's restrictions on imports. Domestic demand may bounce back once these restrictions are withdrawn, but the demand slowdown in China, the biggest gold consumer, may continue. "China has witnessed a moderation in purchases following the hectic buying in the previous year. This will be a drag on prices," says Naveen Mathur, associate director, commodities & currencies at Angel Broking.
Rupee may not weaken significantly
The domestic gold price is down 18% from its peak, but the international gold price is down by 35%. The decline of the rupee against the dollar had cushioned the fall of gold in the domestic market. Though the rupee may weaken more if the US Fed raises interest rates, the impact will be limited because the RBI is better prepared. The rupee has remained relatively stable in the Rs 60-62 per dollar range despite a significant jump in the Dollar Index in the past three months.

Nigeria doubtful of girls  realease after Boko Haram  truce  breachedDoubt over Boko Haram 'ceasefire' after attacks
AFP
Maiduguri, Nigeria, October 20, 2014
First Published: 08:31 IST(20/10/2014)
print
Nigerian military and intelligence officials raised doubts on Sunday about the validity of a ceasefire with Boko Haram, with reports of fresh attacks and fighting in the country's northeast.
The chief of defence staff and a senior presidential aide announced on Friday that agreement had been reached to end hostilities and secure the possible release of more than 200 kidnapped schoolgirls.
Air Marshal Alex Badeh said he had instructed all armed forces' chiefs to ensure the "immediate compliance" with the development.
But a senior army officer in the violence-wracked northeast, who asked to remain anonymous, said: "Honestly, we are yet to receive any operational order on the ceasefire.
"As such, we are battle-ready and would confront the terrorists if we see them."
A senior intelligence official in the region also indicated to AFP that he had not received word about the purported ceasefire.
On Sunday evening, troops from the 7th Division of the Nigerian Army fought dozens of suspected members of Boko Haram in the town of Damboa in Borno state, witnesses and security sources said.
Earlier, a group of insurgents attacked the Borno town of Sabon Gida, said one military officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media.
"The fight was tough and it seems the insurgents wanted to destroy everything in Sabon Gida. They came around 5:00 pm (1600 GMT) and by 6:00 pm, the fight was over," added local trader Bilyaminu Aliyu.
Boko Haram took over Damboa, which is about 90 kilometres (56 miles) southwest of the Borno state capital Maiduguri, in July, destroying much of the town and forcing thousands to flee.
The group's leader Abubakar Shekau claimed that they left voluntarily but the military said they recaptured it in early August. Residents have since begun returning.
Attacks, abductions
Elsewhere, locals said that dozens of suspected Boko Haram gunmen had stormed the town of Abadam, north of Maiduguri near Lake Chad, on Thursday, before the supposed ceasefire.
A number of residents said at least 30 people were killed on Thursday and Friday -- after the purported deal -- while hundreds of others were forced to flee across the border into neighbouring Niger.
"We all heard of the ceasefire over the radio but it seems the insurgents are not perturbed at all," another resident, Mallam Babagana, said on Sunday.
"To me, they (the militants) don't even care about it because they increased their attacks from Friday, the very day the ceasefire was announced. By Saturday, they hoisted their flags."
Meanwhile, Enoch Mark, whose daughter and niece are among the 219 schoolgirls who have been held by Boko Haram since mid-April, said there had been another attack in neighbouring Adamawa state.
He said the attack, in the village of Wagga on Saturday, saw some 40 women abducted -- an established Boko Haram tactic in its bloody five-year insurgency.
On Friday, eight people were also killed on a road in the Borno state village of Shaffa near where a prominent Muslim leader, the Emir of Gwoza, was ambushed and killed by Boko Haram fighters in May.
Babagana said local hunters on their way to recover the bodies of the eight fought battles with militants on Saturday in Azul, also in the Hawul local government area.
"The unrelenting terrorists waylaid our members at around 9:00 am and serious fighting ensued," said Babagana, who heads a local vigilante group.
"We lost four of our members and we killed three terrorists."
Independent corroboration of attacks in the remote northeast are almost impossible, with communications devastated by the violence and access fraught with danger.
The police and the military have largely stopped communicating on attacks.

BJP rules out conceding CM post to Sena in MaharashtraEYE BROWSE
BJP rules out conceding CM post to Shiv Sena in Maharashtra
The BJP central leadership is not keen on going with the Shiv Sena because of the Uddhav Thackeray-led party's adamantine stance of keeping the chief minister's post with itself.
Yahoo India –  Sun 19 Oct, 2014
Print
MUMBAI: The Bharatiya Janata Party on Sunday virtually ruled out the possibility of conceding the Maharashtra chief minister's post to its former ally Shiv Sena for forming a coalition government in the state.
News reports suggested that the BJP central leadership is not keen on going with the Shiv Sena because of the Uddhav Thackeray-led party's adamantine stance of keeping the chief minister's post with itself.
At a press conference, BJP MP Kirit Somaiya stated that since the people of Maharashtra had reposed trust in the BJP, the government in the state will be led by the BJP.
"People have given us the responsibility and we will do whatever is needed to fulfil that responsibility. The government will be led by us," Somaiya said.
There is speculation that Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray is sticking with his demand to become the Maharashtra chief minister as the BJP has failed to get a simple majority and the state government can be formed only by a coalition.
The BJP is emerging as the single largest party in the 288-member Assembly, but is well short of a majority. Meanwhile, the Sena has is the second largest party in the state, but has almost 50 seats less than the BJP.
With the Sena not ready to relent, the BJP leadership is said to be keen to go along with the Nationalist Congress Party to form the government.
However, reports also said that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh is upset with the BJP's keenness to ally with the NCP. The RSS wishes that the two old friends, BJP and Shiv Sena, revive their alliance and form the government in Maharashtra.
Earlier, Somaiya said: "We thank the people of Maharashtra for their mandate in favour of good governance of Narendra Modi, his vision for development," Somaiya.
"For the first time in Maharashtra, BJP is going to reach a century of seats. The parties going to finish second, third and fourth will not have even half of what we are set to get," he said, quoted the PTI.
"We will form a mini-Modi government and execute his vision. We will think of taking support from parties which are ready to help us execute this vision," he added.

BJP may govern Maharashtra with NCP supportBJP may govern Maharashtra with NCP support
IANS India Private Limited/Yahoo India News –  Sun 19 Oct, 2014
Print
Mumbai: The BJP could rule Maharashtra after finishing as the single largest group in a hung house Sunday after the NCP offered unexpected "outside support" to it, leaving the runner up Shiv Sena high and dry.
There was no official response from the Bharatiya Janata Party to the NCP decision but it reduced the BJP's need to patch up with its estranged and long-time ally Shiv Sena, which it had dumped before the Oct 15 polls.
Nationalist Congress Party leader Praful Patel, a confidant of party strongman Sharad Pawar, said Maharashtra needed a stable government and so the NCP was ready to prop up a BJP government.
The dramatic announcement came just before the BJP leadership began a meeting in New Delhi to analyse its spectacular showing in Maharashtra and Haryana and amid speculation of renewed bonhomie between the BJP and the Sena.
Election officials said the BJP was set to win 119 seats in the 288-member assembly, far short of the 145 needed to secure a legislative majority.
With the NCP's expected 42 seats -- officials continued to count the millions of votes cast -- coming its way, the BJP can cross the threshold.
The Shiv Sena, which could end up with 61 seats, had earlier said that it was ready to make up with the BJP, a sentiment shared by some of its leaders, including L.K. Advani who called for a BJP-Sena rapprochement.
"I hope the BJP and Shiv Sena will come together," said Advani, one of those leaders who was not happy with the BJP decision to dump its ally of 25 long years after a row over seat sharing ahead of elections.
The Congress, which along with the NCP had ruled Maharashtra for 15 years until their alliance collapsed before this election, is expected to finish third in the state with 44 seats.
The BJP, which until now had played second fiddle to the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra assembly elections, credited the showing in the state to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's popular appeal.
"People of Maharashtra have shown faith in Modiji's agenda of good governance. We are thankful to the people," BJP leader Kirit Somaiya said.
"The second largest party (Sena) has just half of our strength."
Earlier, Maharashtra BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis told the media that while no discussions had taken place with the Sena, "if the need arises, we expect our friends to support us".
Shiv Sena leader Anil Desai said the acrimony between his party and the BJP was history.
Not anticipating a bonhomie between the BJP and NCP and thinking the BJP will seek his party's aid, Shiv Sena spokesman Sanjay Raut said: "Whatever happens, the chief minister will be from our party."
Raj Thackeray's Maharashtra Navnirman Sena cut a sorry figure in the state. It might end up with just three seats in the Maharashta legislature while independents and smaller parties could have 19 members.
Fadnavis, however, admitted that the BJP was "deeply hurt" over the manner the Sena targeted Modi and the BJP during the election campaign.
The NCP blamed the Congress for the impending rout.
"It all happened because of Chavan," NCP's Nawab Malik said, referring to former chief minister Prithviraj Chavan of the Congress.
"He had no understanding of the issues in Maharashtra, he did not take the right decisions, and he didn't act when he had to."
Chavan accepted responsibility for the Congress rout.
The NCP-Congress alliance came apart Sep 25, the same day the BJP dumped the Sena, triggering speculation that the NCP and BJP appeared to be in a secret deal.
As the BJP celebrated in Mumbai and New Delhi bursting crackers and distributing sweets, Maharashtra Congress chief Manikrao Thakre resigned.

The analysis company Gartner puts the Surface Pro in the same category — “premium ultra-mobile” computers as Apple’s MacBook Air laptops.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
If you were disappointed with Apple's low-key, same-but-better pitch for the new iPad last week, take heart: as it did with cell phones, Apple is just buying time until its next big imitative leap.
Samsung debuted its first, much maligned and hugely successful Galaxy Note — the first phone with a biggerthan-5-inch screen — in September 2011. For two years afterwards, Apple was content to present incremental improvements to the iPhone. Compared with the iPhone 5 , the iPhone 5s just added a fingerprint sensor and an improved camera (plus a few other features that most consumers didn't care about).
Meanwhile, Apple carefully observed the "phablet" market, watched other handset makers follow Samsung's example and erode its market share, and experimented with ways to make a big phone easier to navigate one-handed. It struck just when Samsung started posting lower profits, because of the increased competitive pressure.
It was a perfectly-timed attack and, after setting a first-weekend record — 10 million iPhones sold — iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are continuing their rampage. Apple chief executive Tim Cook said that the first sales month for the two new phones was the company's best ever "by a lot. A whole lot."
The iPad Air 2's most important improvements on last year's device are, again, a fingerprint sensor and a better camera. As with iPhone 5s in 2013, it may appear as if Apple is stuck in a rut of timid, incremental innovation. My bet, however, is that it's watching another innovator collect bumps, get bad reviews, then get things right. Once that innovator's success is assured, Apple will pounce.

BJP can approach us for support: Sena chiefPrint
MUMBAI: Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday puts the ball in Bharatiya Janata Party court to form a post-poll alliance, hours after the trends showed the BJP emerging the single largest party in Maharashtra.
On asked about giving support to the BJP to form state government, Uddhav told reporters, "They can get in touch with us if they want."
He added, "If they want, they can go join hands with the NCP."
The Sena chief said his party would not approach the BJP.
Maharashtra CM will be ours: Shiv Sena
The politically stable Maharashtra faced a hung assembly as the results of the 13th elections to the house trickled out Sunday afternoon.
The prime contender for power, the Bharatiya Janata Party, hovering at leads/victories in around 120 seats, was emerging as the single-largest party but falling far short of the crucial figure of 145 in the 288-member house.
Its former ally, the Shiv Sena, was smug with around 58 victories/lead and top party leaders dismissed outright any suggestions of a "Modi wave".
"There is no Modi wave...No," senior leader and former Lok Sabha Speaker Manohar Joshi said.
With a handicapped BJP, the Sena despite its small number was catapulted to the position of a "king maker", and also unequivocally made it clear who the "King" (next chief minister) would be.
"Whatever happens, the next chief minister would be Sena president Uddhav Thackeray," asserted party spokesperson and MP Sanjay Raut.
The BJP remained optimistic. "All options are open to form the next government in Maharashtra. The party high command will take a decision in the matter after the results are out," BJP vice-president Vinay Sahasrabuddhe said.
Realising the gravity of the situation, BJP ally Republican Party of India (A) spoke up, saying that in the present scenario, no government was possible without the support of Shiv Sena.
"It seems BJP is not getting a clear majority. Nothing can happen without Shiv Sena's support. Both BJP and Shiv Sena need to think about forming the government in the state," RPI (A) chief Ramdas Athawale told media persons here.
He also expressed regret over the BJP and Shiv Sena's decision to contest the elections independently. "If they had fought together, they would have secured absolute majority with around 225 seats together."
On the other hand, the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party scored 43 and 44 leads/victories respectively - unexpected by all forecasts - but effectively arrested what was predicted as BJP's solo march to victory.
Despite a mega-high profile campaign led by none other than Prime Minister Narendra Modi, several factors prevented the BJP from coming close to even a simple majority in Maharashtra.
Prime among them were its decision to snap the 25-year long alliance with the Shiv Sena just three weeks before the elections and its rejection of all "alliance politics" in future.
The move conveyed the impression that the BJP was attempting to destroy or control strong regional forces like Shiv Sena, which has strode like a Colossus in Maharashtra since the past 48 years.
For another, the shrill anti-Maharashtra tone of the campaign by all BJP leaders was exploited to the hilt by all the major parties - Sena, Congress, NCP and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena.
The reported plans of the BJP to reduce the economic importance of Mumbai by partially shifting or transferring major businesses out of the state also sounded alarm signals among the young voters, reflecting on their future employment prospects and related issues.
The BJP leaders also made it clear that they were in favour of a separate state of Vidarbha for more equitable development - a plan unanimously opposed by all other parties.
With the presence of Modi looming large everywhere, the state BJP did not have a "face" in the elections. In fact, there were too many "faces" vying for the coveted post of CM that sent confusing signals to the electorate.
Three parties - Sena, Congress and NCP - seemed to have derived some benefit of these shortcomings, especially as Maharashtra was being derided and compared to Modi's Gujarat, admittedly much smaller in terms of population, size and resources.
On this front, the MNS salvos against the BJP seemed to lack credibility, especially since its chief Raj Thackeray was an unabashed admirer of Modi before the May Lok Sabha elections.
Subsequently, after the Sena-BJP break-up, Raj also raised speculation about a possible post-poll rapprochement with his estranged cousin, Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray.
These strategies seemed to have seriously backfired as the MNS was swinging with leads/victories in barely four seats, down from the 13 it held in the previous assembly.
The surprise factor among the winners was the handsome performance by the Hyderabad-based All India Majlis-E-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM), which bagged three seats and was on the verge of bagging a fourth in the state.
In the midst of the ongoing counting process, the top BJP leadership was busy making friendly overtures to the Sena and opening backdoor negotiations with some other potential supporters, notably the NCP.
However, it became clear to the BJP that it would have to pay a heavy price to whoever chooses to support its endeavour to form the next BJP government in the state. (With inputs from agencies)

Arvind Subramanian: India s man in DCComments
“How do your pronounce your name?”
“Arvind Subramanian as Indians would say, or Subramaaanian (stressing the a-sound) as American would say,” said the India-born expert, injecting rare levity into a rather staid hearing.
India was in the dock and Subramanian was leading its defense at a hearing by the US International Trade Commission, and one of the commissioners wanted to get his name right.
Subramanian, a familiar figure on DC think-tank circuit, became a sounding board for other commissioners at the hearing, as they turned to him repeatedly for clarifications.
That was a bad time for India. Its trade policies, and intellectual property rights regime were under unrelenting attack by critics led by the powerful US chamber of commerce.
India fought back through its own lobbyists. But as a sovereignty issue, it would not depose before US bodies — the USITC or the US Trade Representative later.
Subramanian, an expert with the Peterson Institute of International Economics, and a host of other academics and some activists stepped forward on India’s behalf.
“Arvind was really effective,” said an Indian official, about his deposition at the USITC hearings that had continued for two days because of the crush of those wanting to depose.
The commission’s report, which is due any time now, will prove how effective Subramanian and others were, but, they had clearly turned it into a battle, at the least.
“As an economist, he is no ivory tower academic; he has spent his entire career toiling at the intersection of public policy and scholarship,” said Carnegie’s Milan Vaishnav.
The two of them have shared the stage at many discussions on India. And Subramanian, who went to St Stephen’s College in Delhi, has clearly been very impressive.
And effective. “Also I will claim a modest role in helping to achieve this outcome — I am referring to my testimony on this issue last month,” Subramanian said in a mail earlier this year.
The “outcome” he referred to was US Trade Representative’s Special 301 report for 2014 that did not designate India the worst trade offender as demanded by its critics.

Arvind Subramanian appointed India s new CEAArvind Subramanian appointed India's new CEA

Arvind Subramanian, Senior Fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, has been appointed as India’s new chief economic adviser (CEA), the government said Thursday.
Subramanian has been appointed as CEA “for 3 years on contract basis, in the pay scale of Rs. 80,000 from the date of appointment or superannuation, whichever is earlier,” a finance ministry statement said.
Read: Subramanian an excellent choice as CEA: Chidambaram
“I am absolutely honoured and privileged to come at this time,” Subramanian said in a brief interaction with reporters. “It is a time of great dynamism for Indian economy... to serve a government that had the mandate for reform and change.”
The CEA, a post that has been lying vacant since September last year after Raghuram Rajan took over as new Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor, is usually the main go-to person for advice for the finance minister on macro-economic matters and primary responsibilities, among others, include authoring the mid-year analysis and the Economic Survey.
Arvind Subramanian: India's man in DC
While the mid-year analysis is usually presented in Parliament during the winter session, the Economic Survey—the government’s official report card of the economy--is tabled just before the announcement of the annual budget.
This year’s Economic Survey was mainly piloted by Ila Patnaik, who was appointed as the principal economic advisor in the finance ministry in April.
HT was first to report on Subramanian’s likely appointment as India’s new CEA on August 11.
Subramanian, has written on growth, trade, development, institutions, aid, oil, India, Africa, and the World Trade Organisation (WTO). Foreign Policy magazine had named him as one of the world's top 100 global thinkers in 2011.
He has published widely in academic and other journals, including the American Economic Review (Papers and Proceedings), Review of Economics and Statistics,
Journal of International Economics, Journal of Monetary Economics, Journal of Public Economics, Journal of Economic Growth, Journal of Development Economics, Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Oxford Review of Economic Policy, International Monetary Fund Staff Papers, Foreign Affairs, World Economy, and Economic and Political Weekly.
He has advised the Indian government in different capacities, including as a member of the Finance Minister's Expert Group on the G-20 and has authored a book India's Turn: Understanding the Economic Transformation published in 2008 by Oxford University Press.
He obtained his undergraduate degree from St. Stephens College, Delhi; his MBA from the Indian Institute of Management at Ahmedabad, India; and his M.Phil and D.Phil from the University of Oxford, UK.
Another book Eclipse: Living in the Shadow of China's Economic Dominance was published in September 2011, and he is the coauthor of Who Needs to Open the Capital Account? (2012).
He was assistant director in the Research Department of the International Monetary Fund. He served at the GATT (1988–92) during the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations and taught at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government (1999–2000) and at Johns Hopkins' School for Advanced International Studies (2008–10).

Cos like Twitter and Uber Cabs use social media tools to recruit the right candidateCognizant
(Candidates are engaging…)
NEW DELHI: Uber Cabs and Twitter India are hiring. But unless you follow the right people on Twitter or are on their mailing list, you'll never know about it. These companies aren't putting out advertisements on their websites or using traditional recruitment companies to find them the best candidates; but have been sending out mailers and tweets to customers or followers.
The team for Twitter India has posted tweets inviting candidates to apply for a job in Mumbai. It reads: "Team @TwitterIndia is looking for an associate partnerships manager to join us. #ApplyNow."
Uber Cabs is looking for managers and has decided to go the non-traditional route to find them. In a mail to clients in Delhi, it said: "Are you fired up by the opportunity to move your city through data and analytics, world-class support and creative strategy? Come join us!" The company's general manager in Delhi, Gagan Bhatia, said people who have used their service are the ideal candidates since they are locals. "This is a fantastic tool to use for recruiting."
Social recruitment has taken off with a bang over the past year. "It's a quick process that helps short-listing candidates while doing some research on them. We help clients like Sula Vineyards and L'Oreal find junior to midand senior-level executives," said Zafar Rais, founder and chief executive at Mindshift Interactive, a digital outreach company.
According to Rais, about two million jobs are posted on Twitter every month and around 39% of all job seekers are on Twitter and 23% have leveraged Twitter in their job hunt. In addition to this, 45% of the Fortune 500 companies include links to social media on their career pages and 45% are hiring managers to use social media websites to check candidate backgrounds. The most popular social media or networking sites used for recruiting are LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and BranchOut.
And candidates, too, are getting smarter. They are engaging with brands, analysing activities on social media and then drawing out job offers from there.
  Companies like Aircel, Cognizant Technology Solutions, Expedia and HCL Technologies are conducting recruitment drives exclusively through social media platforms. Some of the other big names in the social recruitment space are Infosys and the Tatas, who use social HR as a tool to recruit prospective employees. Cosmetics brand L'Oreal launched its Facebook page 'L'Oreal Careers' and International Business Machines provides a 'Smarter Workforce' technology to help businesses capture and understand data from social media. HCL has saved over $500,000 on recruitment costs by leveraging LinkedIn.
One of the main reasons for the shift, say social media experts, is that the dynamics of the traditional recruitment processes are changing. "Social media has a pull factor. It helps engage prospective candidates and companies have to convince them to work with them. It helps get passionate and more committed candidates than someone who was pursued by an human resource manager," said Ankita Gaba, co-founder of social media knowledge website socialsamosa.com.
Sumana Samuk, account director at advertising company Ogilvy & Mather who looks at social media strategy for brands, said companies must be integrated with social media platforms. "Business will use this as a way forward to hire. It not only shortens the process of hiring but also saves cost for organisations. In addition to this, social profiles are representative, more or less of what the candidate is and it's good to do research on them before hiring."

How Modi  Shah cracked the polls | Early Diwali for BJP | CoverageHow Narendra Modi and Amit Shah helped BJP romp home in Maharashtra and Haryana polls
Rohini Singh, ET Bureau Oct 20, 2014, 07.05AM IST
Tags:
Amit Shah
(Modi and Shah aimed for the…)
They went for the jugular, hit Haryana, missed Maharashtra narrowly but turned in a thoroughly impressive performance. So why did Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah take the audacious gamble of contesting alone in Maharashtra and Haryana?
But first, that little twinge of disappointment: BJP's top strategists and central leadership were confident of winning 150 or more seats in Maharashtra and a majority in Haryana. The tally for Maharashtra was, hence, a slight dampener.
Stay Single
ET spoke to several BJP strategists, including aides of Shah, to get a sense of the party strategy that unfolded after it broke its alliance with the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra and Kuldeep Bishnoi's party in Haryana. All leaders spoke on condition they not be identified. And all leaders spoke of Shah's ferocious commitment. Working frequently till 2 am, Shah had camped out at party headquarters in Dadar in Mumbai from September 22 to 29. He would catch a few hours of sleep every night at the Rang Sharda hotel nearby, where rooms are `1,500 a night — not the kind where ruling party chiefs spend their nights in.
BJP's Maharashtra strategy was based on three approaches: First, an early assertion it was not a junior partner in its alliance with Sena. Second, covering the whole of Maharashtra in quick time to make up for its minimal presence in parts of the state left to the Sena. Third, drafting leaders and campaign specialists from outside Maharashtra trusted by Shah and giving them responsibilities for sub-regions.
"We worked overtime for two weeks... compressing the whole campaign in that time," a party functionary said.
A number of BJP strategists said they realised "very early" that Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray was not prepared to concede ground. "The first meeting between Shah and Uddhav showed what will happen... there was no chemistry... Uddhav expected to be treated as the senior partner... He could not swallow a new BJP saying it wanted more seats," an aide of Shah told ET.
"Shah increasingly began to feel that BJP alone had a better chance. Shah's view was that if BJP contests 120 seats, its tally was likely to be around 80, but contesting all 288 may give the party 130-plus at least," the aide added. The BJP parliamentary board had asked Shah to keep the alliance alive but the tipping point was Sena's "absolute refusal to concede any more seats".
BJP had barely two weeks to put together an all-Maharashtra campaign, of which the hectic rallies by Narendra Modi, Shah and Singh became a critical element. Modi's appeal to the urban audiences being especially strong, with 42 per cent of Maharashtra being urban meant the impact of his speeches "was going to be considerable", said a party worker.
There was also "a massive organisational push" as it sought to create an organisational base where it barely had any presence, the person said. "We had to pick candidates and pick organisational champions for these areas," a BJP member said. "There were a minimum of 150 seats BJP had never contested in 25 years. Our organisational strength was only in 125 seats," a Shah aide said.
  Special teams were created for this purpose. Sunil Bansal, Shah's right-hand man in UP, was dispatched to Maharashtra to manage the campaign. Almost 700 BJP seniors and more than 4,000 party workers from all across India were sent to Maharashtra. The state was divided into 55 sub-regions and each was given a special focus.
Sena is OK
A BJP worker said the pitch was to ignore Sena's jibes at BJP and to emphasise the "greatness of Bal Thackeray and tell voters that BJP was a better inheritor of his legacy". "We didn't respond to Sena's targeting us for betrayal," this person said. "Our aim was to tell voters that Uddhav's Sena can't appropriate Bal Saheb's legacy... Modi and Shah's strategy was to make BJP the sole beneficiary of the anti-incumbency vote."
Haryana Hurricane
BJP leaders said Haryana was a mini version of Maharashtra. BJP senior leader Sushma Swaraj had strongly pitched for an alliance with Bishnoi, said one party senior. But Shah had not met Bishnoi even after the latter sought an appointment with him five times.
"Shah had made up his mind about Haryana as well... He did not agree with the Akali suggestion of allying with INLD either," a Shah aide said. His Haryana calculations depended on the consolidation of the anti-Jat vote in favour of BJP, this aide added.
A BJP member said Bhupinder Singh Hooda and Om Prakash Chautala had been winning elections by playing around with the Jat-Dalit combination. The anti-Jat vote was with BJP from the beginning this time. Meanwhile, Jat votes were won over by giving the maximum number of seats to candidates from the community — 27 out of 90.
Then came the Dera Sacha Sauda effect — 60-70 per cent of their supporters are Dalit. They have 72 lakh active followers. Shah is believed to have approached the Dera leadership directly. It destroyed the Jat-Dalit math of the opposition. This, topped with Modi's charisma and his message of fighting corruption, good governance and promise of development, resulted in a massive win.

NEW DELHI: Indian markets are expected to trade higher on Monday tracking positive trend seen in other Asian markets.
Nifty has taken support from its 100 DMA and witness a bounce. However, the index failed to cross the crucial 7800 level indicating that pressure may continue to remain in Nifty.
"Nifty can see a meaningful upside if it closes above the psychological 7800 mark," LKP said in a report.
"However, the next trigger for the markets will come from the outcome of State elections that will be announced on 19th October," added the report.
Here is a list of thirteen stocks which are likely to be in focus today:
IOC , HPCL , BPCL: The government announced its biggest reform yet as it decontrolled diesel, which will immediately become cheaper by Rs 3.35 a litre, raised gas prices to $5.61 a unit from next month and said cooking gas customers in 54 districts will get subsidy in their bank accounts from next month even if they do not have an Aadhaar card.
Infosys: State-owned life insurer LIC has shored up its stake in Infosys to 4.45 per cent, purchasing shares that are worth about Rs 1,400 crore in the July- September quarter.
IFCI: State-owned IFCI , which lends to large projects, is planning to raise up to Rs 2,000 crore by selling bonds through a public issuance of non-convertible debentures or NCDs with maturities of five, seven and 10 years. The securities will offer 9.80-10% in different categories.
ITC: Government has received 72 proposals from various companies including Adani Group, ITC and Future Group for 17 food parks to be approved in the next two-three months.
Central Bank of India, IDBI Bank: The country's state-owned banks, weighed down by bad loans and lacklustre profits, could within months begin the sale of billions of dollars of unwanted assets to help raise cash needed to meet tougher regulation.
Coal India: State-owned Coal India has so far signed 162 fuel supply agreements (FSAs) with power plants. The government had earlier directed the coal major to sign supply pacts with power projects of 78,000 mw capacity. As many as 172 FSAs are to be signed in this regard.
MOIL: Moil Ltd paid Rs 42.08 crore dividend for 2013-14 to the Government for its 71.57 per cent stake in the country's largest manganese ore producer.
JSPL: CBI has registered a fresh case of alleged cheating and corruption against Jindal Steel and Power Limited among others in connection with its probe into coal blocks allocation probe.
Canara Bank: The bank will raise up to Rs.85 crore through qualified institutional placement (QIP) in the current fiscal. It received Finance Ministry nod on Friday for raising equity capital of Rs.80 crore (eight crore shares of Rs.10 each)
Tata Motors Ltd: Tata Motors' owned Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) is working on an ambitious plan to set up a factory in the US, in a first for a British carmaker in the world's second-biggest automobile market.

How to pick and hold the six categories of stocks
Sanket Dhanorkar, ET Bureau Oct 20, 2014, 08.00AM IST

BPCL
(Peter Lynch identified…)
Legendary stock market investor Peter Lynch identified six categories of stocks: slow growers, stalwarts, fast growers, cyclicals, turnarounds and asset plays.
Find out the strategy you need to employ to pick and hold these stocks based on their classification:
1. Slow growers: These are stocks of typically large and established companies that are not expected to grow faster than the overall economy. They will rarely yield a big return on investment, but are known to provide regular and hefty dividends. Since there is little scope for expansion, cash is returned to shareholders. These can be identified by a low trajectory of earnings growth, usually 5-7%. Utilities are among the best examples of slow growers.
Action key
These can be good dividend yield plays. The regular dividend payouts can provide a constant stream of revenue.
Do not expect a huge capital appreciation as the earnings growth is muted.
Stocks: Power Grid Corporation, HUL
2. Stalwarts: This category also includes stocks of large companies, but they are able to grow at a fairly fast clip of 10-15% earnings growth. They are able to maintain a decent earnings growth even during downturns, mostly due to the nature of their offerings. FMCG, information technology and pharmaceutical companies are classic examples. Though not star performers, they can generate healthy returns when bought at the right price.
Action key
Should form a part of your core portfolio as they offer protection during bad times and yield decent returns in bull markets.
Since these are usually expensive, buying at the right time is crucial.
Stocks: ITC, TCS, Infosys
3. Fast growers: These mostly include stocks of smallsized firms growing at an aggressive pace of 20-25% a year. They can generate huge returns and even become multibaggers within a relatively short span of time. However, they also carry a considerably higher risk.
Action key
Your portfolio should have 20-30% allocation to these stocks. Go only for companies that have strong balance sheets and are not heavy on debt.
Again, do not overpay for growth. Remember that these can see a steep price fall when growth falters.
Stocks: Page Industries, Motherson Sumi
 
4. Cyclicals: Companies in this stock basket tend to exhibit inconsistency in revenue growth. They are likely to perform in line with the broader economy or industrial cycle in a predictable pattern. The earnings growth can vary from 5-6% during downturns to 18-20% during upturns. Stock prices also move erratically based on the stage of the economic cycle that the company is passing. The companies in automobile, construction, metals, industrials and banking space are prime examples.
Action key
Timing is everything. You may suffer huge losses if you buy a cyclical stock at the wrong point in the cycle.
Investors must learn to detect signs of a business that is beginning to pick up or they will take a hit. Employ strict stop loss strategy while buying the stock.
Stocks: Tata Steel, Hindalco
5. Turnarounds: This includes stocks that have been badly hammered in the market for a variety of reasons, but are in a position to rebound quickly. The share price can spike if a new company makes strategic investment or a new leader takes over. If you are able to identify a turnaround stock at the right time, you can make outsized returns within a very short span of time. Satyam Computers is the best example of a turnaround stock. Although these stocks have the potential for huge gains, the risks are equally high.
Action key
Keep a close eye on crucial actions by distressed companies. For instance, any meaningful reduction in debt through sale of non-core assets or other means is a positive trigger.
Be very selective. These have the potential for huge gains, but not all troubled firms can effect a turnaround.
Stock: Wockhardt
6. Asset plays: These are stocks of companies that own key assets, which sets them apart from other companies but are mostly overlooked by the market. The firm may have a huge cash reserve that might come in handy during a downturn or may own large real estate that has not been valued properly. However, finding these assets and assessing their value requires good knowledge of the company that owns the assets.
Action key
Patience is key to investing in these companies since it may be a while before the market catches on to them.

US airdrops arms to Kurds in Syrian town of KobaneUS airdrops arms to Kurds in Syrian town of Kobane
AFP
The American military for the first time airdropped weapons, ammunition and medical supplies to Syrian Kurds in the battleground city of Kobane, US Central Command said on Sunday, in a move likely to anger key ally Turkey.
A C-130 cargo aircraft conducted "multiple" airdrops of the supplies provided by Kurdish authorities in Iraq.
The supplies were "intended to enable continued resistance against ISIL's attempts to overtake Kobane," CENTCOM said in a statement referring to Islamic State fighters.
The United States and its Western allies have been pressing Turkey to take a more direct role in taking on IS fighters in Kobane, but Ankara is reluctant to arm Kurds and intervene militarily against the militants, fearing an effective fighting force from its historic foes on its border.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan earlier rejected calls for his country to arm the main Kurdish party in Syria, describing the group as a terrorist organization, linked to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has waged a 30-year insurgency for self-rule in southeastern Turkey.
But in a call, Erdogan and US President Barack Obama pledged to "strengthen cooperation" against IS in Syria.
American-led warplanes launched 11 air strikes near Kobane on Saturday and Sunday, CENTCOM said, helping Kurdish fighters repulse a new IS attempt to cut their supply lines from Turkey.
So far, US forces have conducted more than 135 airstrikes against IS in Kobane alone.
"Combined with continued resistance to ISIL on the ground, indications are that these strikes have slowed ISIL advances into the city, killed hundreds of their fighters and destroyed or damaged scores of pieces of ISIL combat equipment and fighting positions," CENTCOM said.
"However, the security situation in Kobane remains fragile as ISIL continues to threaten the city and Kurdish forces continue to resist."
CENTCOM Commander General Lloyd Austin has warned that the city could fall.
Kobane's Kurdish defenders have been under IS assault for more than a month.
From Saturday into Sunday morning, 31 IS militants died in the battle, said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
Coalition air strikes near Kobane hit 20 IS fighting positions, five IS vehicles and two IS-held buildings, according to CENTCOM.
The Observatory, which has a network of sources inside Syria, said 15 fighters were killed in the air strikes, while 16 others died in ground clashes along with seven Kurdish fighters.

(Post elections, the government…)
MUMBAI: The S&P BSE Sensex opened nearly 400 points higher on the back of gains in banks, capital goods and banks, as the market rejoiced BJP's victory in recently held assembly elections. Rally in global markets following better economic data in the US also boosted sentiment.
The BJP has got a majority in Haryana and will form the government for the first time in the state. It has emerged as the single largest party in Maharashtra but will have to patch-up with old ally Shiv Sena to form a government.
Meanwhile, post elections, the government announced slew of reform measures such as diesel price deregulation and hike in natural gas price hike.
"The subsidy on diesel finally moves out. To what extent it brings down the deficit is left to be seen and whether or not the RBI will look at cutting rates is another question. The hike in natural gas prices was lower than street expectation but is expected to boost the sector as more prospects could be considered for drilling. The big question is what happens if crude prices shoot up later," said IIFL report.
At 09:16 a.m.; the 30-share index was at 26,466.44, up 357.91 points or 1.37 per cent. It touched a high of 26,501.04 and a low of 26,434.16 in trade today.
The Nifty was at 7,891.60, up 111.90 points or 1.44 per cent. It touched a high of 7,898.40 and a low of 7,888.70 in trade today.
The S&P BSE Midcap Index gained 1.49 per cent and the S&P BSE Smallcap Index was 1.32 per cent higher.
Among the sectoral indices, the S&P BSE Bankex surged 2.15 per cent, the S&P BSE Capital goods Index was 1.88 per cent higher, the S&P BSE Metal Index rose 1.29 per cent and the S&P BSE Oil & gas Index moved 1.11 per cent higher.
ONGC (up 5.21 per cent), GAIL (up 2.65 per cent), HDFC (up 2.59 per cent), HDFC Bank (up 2.51 per cent) and Axis Bank (up 2.49 per cent) were among the Sensex gainers.
Reliance (1.19 per cent) and Hero MotoCorp (0.78 per cent) were the only losers.
The market breadth was positive on the BSE with 1,001 gainers against 145 losers.
The Asian markets have surged following a rally on the Wall Street on Friday. The Nikkei 225 rallied 3.53 per cent, Seoul Composite was 1.48 per cent higher and Taiwan Weighted advanced 1.40 per cent.

BJP ready to do whatever it takes to form next govtBJP ready to do whatever it takes to form next govt in Maharashtra
Dharmendra Jore , Hindustan Times  Mumbai, October 20, 2014

Comments
 A deficit of 23-25 seats to make the all-important 145 mark has dampened the spirits of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) camp, but it has definitely made senior leaders work even harder to form a government on their own.
With a strong leader like Amit Shah at the helm in New Delhi, the state unit has set its sights on the next move.
For they know that Shah, along with his mentor PM Narendra Modi, will ensure a stable government is put in place, sooner or later. All possibilities, including the extension of President’s rule in the state or poaching a group of MLAs from other parties is also being considered.
A quick-fire decision by Amit Shah to select a CM candidate on Monday itself has sent out signals to the Shiv Sena and all other parties.
 He left no scope for state leaders to make any mistake by addressing a press conference.
The move is expected to work in the BJP’s favour as high-decibel state leaders will not unnecessarily anger possible allies (read the Shiv Sena).
Shah took it upon himself to defuse the tension between the ex-allies, but maintained a tough stand that no further compromise would be made to sacrifice the local leadership.
The BJP’s parliamentary board was sensitive in choosing Rajnath Singh, home minister and former national president, who had made sincere efforts to woo the Sena before Shah became the party chief.
Other than ensuring the party gets the support it needs, Singh will have another task at hand.
He is expected to coordinate with senior state leaders, who are fighting for the CM’s post ever since the party sniffed a victory.
 He will fathom the sentiment among the party’s elected members on Monday before conveying the name(s) of the CM candidate.
“I am going to Maharashtra tomorrow to decide on the BJP legislature’s party leader,” Singh told reporters in New Delhi.
Addressing the media in New Delhi, Shah ruled out any alliance with the Nationalist Congress Party, which is ready to offer unconditional support to the BJP.
“The NCP did not talk of becoming our partners in the government.
 It is just willing to support us unconditionally. That’s all.”
Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray told mediapersons he was not approached by the BJP for support, and his party would not approach it with any proposal.
But he said he would consider a proposal (from BJP) if it is sent to him.”
Maharashtra BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis expected the BJP’s friends to support his party.
In the meantime, seeing their party coming to the power, CM aspirants within the party have started intensely lobbying for the top job.
 The leaders who are close the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) have urged the BJP’s ideological guardian to ensure their entry to the sixth floor of Mantralaya.
Some leaders are in touch with legislators who would be asked for their preference on Monday.
 The respective regional leaders will keep their flock together to garner support before Rajnath Singh.
A senior BJP leader, however, said even a leader without any strong backing of MLAs may get the job if deemed fit by the high command.

Record 7-lakh vote margin for Mundes daughter  slimmest of 3 for Cong MLAPritam Munde wins by record 7 lakh votes
HT Correspondents , Hindustan Times  Mumbai/Chandigarh, October 20, 2014
First Published: 09:38 IST(20/10/2014) | Last Updated: 12:17 IST(20/10/2014)
Some results were too close to call and a few were easy, but two stood out after vote count in Maharashtra and Haryana on Sunday.
 
Pritam Munde, the second daughter of late BJP leader Gopinath Munde, scripted Lok Sabha history in winning the Beed seat in Maharashtra in a by-election by a record margin of nearly 700,000 votes.
 
The slimmest margin came from Haryana. Jai Tirath Dahiya, the Congress’ sitting MLA from Rai assembly segment in Sonepat district, won by three votes. Inderjeet Dahiya of the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) came in second.
 
First, the high. The record for a maximum victory margin in Lok Sabha polls was held by Anil Basu of the CPI-M. He had won by 592,502 votes from Arambagh in West Bengal in the 2004.
 
Pritam, 32, polled 922,416 votes while trouncing former Congress minister Ashok Patil by 6,96,321 votes, poll officials said.
 
The Beed bypoll was necessitated following the death of Gopinath Munde in a road accident in Delhi in June this year.
 
In Haryana, 62-year-old Jai Tirath polled 36,703 votes as against his 68-year-old INLD rival Inderjeet Dahiya’s 36,700, as per the result declared by the election department.
 
Jai Tirath’s margin is, however, not the slimmest in Indian elections. There have been a few one-vote margin wins including Congress leader CP Joshi’s controversial loss to BJP’s Kalyan Singh Chouhan from Rajasthan’s Nathdwara assembly segment in 2008.
 

Nigeria doubtful of girls  release after Boko Haram  truce  breachedDoubt over Boko Haram 'ceasefire' after attacks
AFP
Maiduguri, Nigeria, October 20, 2014
First Published: 08:31 IST(20/10/2014)
print
Nigerian military and intelligence officials raised doubts on Sunday about the validity of a ceasefire with Boko Haram, with reports of fresh attacks and fighting in the country's northeast.
The chief of defence staff and a senior presidential aide announced on Friday that agreement had been reached to end hostilities and secure the possible release of more than 200 kidnapped schoolgirls.
Air Marshal Alex Badeh said he had instructed all armed forces' chiefs to ensure the "immediate compliance" with the development.
But a senior army officer in the violence-wracked northeast, who asked to remain anonymous, said: "Honestly, we are yet to receive any operational order on the ceasefire.
"As such, we are battle-ready and would confront the terrorists if we see them."
A senior intelligence official in the region also indicated to AFP that he had not received word about the purported ceasefire.
On Sunday evening, troops from the 7th Division of the Nigerian Army fought dozens of suspected members of Boko Haram in the town of Damboa in Borno state, witnesses and security sources said.
Earlier, a group of insurgents attacked the Borno town of Sabon Gida, said one military officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media.
"The fight was tough and it seems the insurgents wanted to destroy everything in Sabon Gida. They came around 5:00 pm (1600 GMT) and by 6:00 pm, the fight was over," added local trader Bilyaminu Aliyu.
Boko Haram took over Damboa, which is about 90 kilometres (56 miles) southwest of the Borno state capital Maiduguri, in July, destroying much of the town and forcing thousands to flee.
The group's leader Abubakar Shekau claimed that they left voluntarily but the military said they recaptured it in early August. Residents have since begun returning.
Attacks, abductions
Elsewhere, locals said that dozens of suspected Boko Haram gunmen had stormed the town of Abadam, north of Maiduguri near Lake Chad, on Thursday, before the supposed ceasefire.
A number of residents said at least 30 people were killed on Thursday and Friday -- after the purported deal -- while hundreds of others were forced to flee across the border into neighbouring Niger.
"We all heard of the ceasefire over the radio but it seems the insurgents are not perturbed at all," another resident, Mallam Babagana, said on Sunday.
"To me, they (the militants) don't even care about it because they increased their attacks from Friday, the very day the ceasefire was announced. By Saturday, they hoisted their flags."
Meanwhile, Enoch Mark, whose daughter and niece are among the 219 schoolgirls who have been held by Boko Haram since mid-April, said there had been another attack in neighbouring Adamawa state.
He said the attack, in the village of Wagga on Saturday, saw some 40 women abducted -- an established Boko Haram tactic in its bloody five-year insurgency.
On Friday, eight people were also killed on a road in the Borno state village of Shaffa near where a prominent Muslim leader, the Emir of Gwoza, was ambushed and killed by Boko Haram fighters in May.
Babagana said local hunters on their way to recover the bodies of the eight fought battles with militants on Saturday in Azul, also in the Hawul local government area.
"The unrelenting terrorists waylaid our members at around 9:00 am and serious fighting ensued," said Babagana, who heads a local vigilante group.
"We lost four of our members and we killed three terrorists."
Independent corroboration of attacks in the remote northeast are almost impossible, with communications devastated by the violence and access fraught with danger.
The police and the military have largely stopped communicating on attacks.

India may benefit from a legalized gambling marketIndia may be poised to benefit from a broadly legalized gambling market

Andyz Fish & Chips
(Around $60 billion is spent…)
On a Thursday evening, as the peak-hour traffic begins to build in east Bangalore, a group of 20-something friends enter a three-storey commercial complex on the periphery of Indiranagar, a posh residential suburb.
The ground floor of this building houses a popular vegetarian restaurant, frequented by large families. This group, though, has no interest in a leisurely meal. Instead, they are headed three floors up to Andyz Fish & Chips, one of a dozen new poker rooms that have mushroomed across India's IT Capital.
Riding on a Karnataka High Court judgment a year ago that declare d poker as a predominant game of skill and not one of chance, these entrepreneurs have set up these rooms across the length and breadth of the city, attracting dozens of youth who have familiarized themselves with the game online.
A few months later, it was the turn of a court to give rummy a stamp of legality — in a judgment, the Karnataka High Court quashed charges against 19 persons who were arrested on charges of gambling for playing rummy. Like in the case of poker, the court reckoned that rummy too was a game of skill, not chance.
Fish & Chips
There's no board to direct you to Andyz, which sounds more like a restaurant but for those who play the game, both 'fish' and 'chips' are poker-speak — the former for a novice and the latter are the tokens that masquerade as money.
As the rest of the city makes its way home at around 7.30 pm, two tables are well into their games of poker. Andyz has half a dozen tables (including one for VIP members with cushioned leather chairs in a room) and, on weekends, you can expect at least five of them to be busy. "Everyone who comes here has tried online poker first, but now wants a taste of the real thing," says Andy Morgan, co - founder of the club. "We have 300 members and we're adding to this list daily."
Over the past couple of years, India's legal system — state by state — has been opening up to the possibilities of more legitimate avenues for gambling. For example, in September this year, the Supreme Court sought the Union government's thoughts on viewing online rummy as a game of skill — and therefore a more legal operation — rather than a decidedly illegal game of chance.
Elsewhere, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh ruled that poker for stakes was a game of skill and therefore kosher. Sikkim runs an online and legal lottery system. Most visibly, lakhs of rupees are bet legally on horse races daily across India.
This interest is hardly a shock for regular punters, who have for decades been trying their hands at games of skill and chance. Every year, around Diwali, these games peak, as people flock to house parties for an assortment of card games, with money wagered between friends and family informally.
  Time to Take a Chance
If the popularity of poker clubs in Bangalore is any indication, then India may be ideally poised to benefit from a more broadly legalized gambling market, backed with stringent law enforcement (with the creation of gaming commissions as in the UK) and the opportunity to funnel crores of rupees from underground networks.
According to regulars, there is still a very limited opportunity in India to gamble legally for players who have honed their skills online and want to make a splash in the real world.
Some do try their hand at casinos in Goa and Sikkim, but many prefer to hit the gaming houses in Bangkok, Singapore (with just two large legally sanctioned casinos in Marina Bay Sands and Resorts World Sentosa) or the Monte Carlo of the Orient — Macau.
The erstwhile Portuguese colony generated $45 billion in gambling revenues in 2013, barely a decade after making a concerted push into the market (although the Portuguese had legalized gambling way back in the 1850s).
Macau's meteoric rise has left old favourites in the US, Las Vegas and Atlantic City behind. As the legal tide turns, regular players hope that India can slowly unshackle itself from the past and emerge as an alternative destination for gambling.
The first signs of this movement are already visible — thanks to the internet, thousands of players between 18 and 40 years are well versed in games such as poker and rummy both online and offline — while legalization is prompting the establishment of new clubs.
"There's plenty of interest and excitement around these games and a stronger legal framework will only push more people to consider legal avenues," says Morgan of Andyz. The Karnataka High Court's ruling a year ago gave the gambling market a big fillip, prompting the setting up of a raft of new clubs. "This is an entirely legal operation," says KN Suresh, about the Indian Poker Association (IPA), of which he is the secretary and co-founder.

Jaydev Mody: Meet the undisputed casino king of IndiaDelta Corp, the company focused on casinos in Goa and promoted by Jaydev Mody, has built The Deltin in Daman.

Save precious time tracking your investments
The courtyard at The Deltin in the coastal union territory of Daman tries to recreate the feel of a beachside resort. The long and curved pool with a bar at one end and sunbeds on the edge that allow guests to dip their torsos in water also has a beach-like slope to wade into.
Like on Indian beaches, sometimes guests do wade right in, wearing t-shirts, banyans or even long flowing nightgowns. For a five-star hotel, this isn't a pretty sight. So, a staff member gently requests a guest to don swimwear, only to face the materteral retort: "Do you expect us to wear bikinis?"
Daman, a former Portuguese colony, actually has its own swimwear for women, easily available in the markets near Devka beach. Inspired by the salwar kurta, the innovative swimwear works well with the conservative clientele in the swimming pools of Daman's hotels.
The beach town — often called a mini-Goa — has a church of Bom Jesus (Goa has the Basilica), and small Portuguesebuilt forts on either side of the Daman Ganga that flows through to the Arabian Sea. Devka is not much of a beach, largely rocky, with little sand — but has all the hotels around it.
The better beach, Jampore, has no hotels around, and offers cheap thrills such as horse and camel rides. The real attraction of Daman is the availability of cheap liquor — in the middle of Gujarat where it is prohibited.
Weekend evenings turn this heritage town into a quaint drinking joint preferred by the Gujarati folk and visitors from Mumbai.
Hard-drinking American comedian WC Fields once famously said: "I spent half my money on gambling, alcohol and wild women. The other half I wasted."
Tourists to Daman have enough of the grog and, although 'wild women' will remain a fantasy at best, they will soon get a chance to spend their money (perhaps even more than half ) on Fields' other not-so-trivial pursuit of gambling.
Daman, a mix of European heritage and Gujarati ethos, now awaits its first casino, which will be housed in The Deltin; the casino can be up and running within three months of getting a licence.
Delta Corp, the company focused on casinos in Goa and promoted by Jaydev Mody , has built The Deltin in Daman.
Set away from both the beaches, the hotel got its five-star certification a month and a half back and has now applied for a casino licence.
The Deltin, spread over 10 acres, is the only five-star hotel in the town, and the casino of course will be — an appropriate metaphor the only game in town.

Govt must launch enquiry into Air India aircraft dealModi government must launch enquiry into the aircraft deal that ruined Air India

(In the years prior to the…)
By: Jitender Bhargava
The sordid story of the humongous aircraft purchase for Air India that led to its financial ruin has again taken centre stage after Vinod Rai, former CAG, looks deep into the deal in his just released book Not Just An Accountant.
Praful Patel, who was aviation minister then and widely believed to be the man behind the deal, continues to deny his role — you only had to watch Times Now the other day to see his "spirited" defence. His defence, however, falls flat before those conversant with the actual events surrounding the deal.
In 2005, the year in which the aircraft order was placed, Air India, had an annual revenue of Rs 8,000 crore. The cost of the 68 aircraft (18 short haul and 50 long haul) ordered was Rs 39,000 crore. Even the best airlines operate on wafer-thin profit margins.
Read Praful Patel's defence
Simple arithmetic will show that Air India, which had to finance the aircraft by availing loans because it had no reserves (the government was pitching in only with less than 2% of the cost), would have to bear an interest burden of up to Rs 2,000 crore annually as the delivery of planes began in July 2007.
Remember, in the years prior to the order, Air India was making only a modest profit. It did not require a genius to see a financial tragedy was waiting to unfold.
Compliant Board
Nonetheless, the Air India board "recommended" the acquisition. This happened after Patel asked the Air India brass in a meeting on August 2, 2004 to revisit its earlier acquisition plan of 28 aircraft (18 short haul and 10 long haul). The board had earlier recommended purchase of only 10 long-haul aircraft because the Air India management had said the Net Present Value would be positive for an order of this size.
In other words, the 10 planes were all that Air India could afford. It is bewildering why the board did not question how then could the NPV be positive for 50 long-haul aircraft.
Only Sunil Arora, a board member by dint of being chairman of Indian Airlines, questioned the flaw. The silence of the management and representatives of the ministry on the board can be explained due to fear of reprisal — additional secretary V Subramanian was shunted out within two hours of asking basic questions on the business plan, financing etc.
The internal dynamics of how board meetings were conducted in Patel's era could provide some answers. In a letter to the cabinet secretary on June 2, 2005, Arora shared instances of blatant ministerial interference. He also described how a key meeting was held. He said board members received a notice on December 21, 2004 that a meeting will be held the next day in Delhi as an aircraft maker had raised the possible impact of changes in specifications on the deal.
  No agenda papers were made available to members. A decision was still taken. Clearly, this calls Patel's bluff when he says that neither he nor the ministry was connected with the nuts and bolts of the aircraft acquisition. The story doesn't end here.
Patel, as he said in his recent TV interview, requested the prime minister to constitute an Overseeing Committee and an Empowered Group of Ministers (EGoM) to examine the deal.
However, the minutes of the meetings reveal that the two committees looked only at the concessions/discounts from the vendor and technical details. There is no mention of the Overseeing Committee discussing the number of aircraft recommended for purchase — which is the crux of the problem.
Besides seeking concessions from the vendor, the EGoM took two key decisions. To quote the minutes: "In pursuance of the above discussions, the proposal contained in para 10 of the note for EGoM is approved".
This 'note' came from the aviation ministry. The other decision — "Air India will place the entire order for 68 aircraft with Boeing on firm basis" — was devastating for the airline as its own eventual proposal and the one by the aviation ministry (endorsed by the Public Investment Board) were for buying 18 short haul aircraft and 35 long-haul aircraft and retaining 15 as options.
Who is the Mastermind?
Patel has said it was former finance minister P Chidambaram's decision (Chidambaram headed the EGoM) to order all aircraft on firm basis. If we were to believe that, it displays the casualness with which such a critical decision — the cost of 15 more long-haul aircraft was nearly $2 billion — was taken.
Could Chidambaram have taken a decision without going through the financial implications? Wasn't it Patel's responsibility to brief the EGoM members of the deal's implications? The minutes make no mention of the decision being thrust on an unwilling Patel.
Rather, he happily announced the deal after the meeting. There are too many mysteries surrounding the aircraft deal. But who was instrumental in forcing Air India to buy the aircraft? If Praful Patel really wishes to dispel the widespread belief of his dubious role in ruining Air India financially, he should be the one seeking a probe. Let us hope the new damning revelations in Rai's book will force the Narendra Modi government to launch a full probe.

An afternoon in October. Lunch time. I am hungry. There's a lavish spread on the mahogany table. But I am not eyeing anything. For, I yearn for a scrumptious sandwich quivering with melted cheese and a dollop of greens. Suddenly, a dapper Earl pops in my head. A tall Earl in silk breeches, curly mop, powdered nose hunched over a pack of cards playing cribbage with his boisterous friends. And when his tummy growls with hunger, he orders his valet to get beef between two slices of bread. The Earl loathes being pulled away from cribbage — he abhors greasy cards and a fork in hand. The valet slaps beef between bread for John Montagu , the 4th Earl of Sandwich. So outlandish was this bread/beef lunch idea that everyone started ordering "just like sandwich". And lo! the world's fave lunch was born. Now, you know why the Earl was popping in my head. Naah! Not because I was craving for a sandwich. October calls for an Earlrewind. It is the International Sandwich Month.
Hold on, before the Earl runs away with all the credit for creating the now-staple lunch. History will drag you back to 110 BC and to a rabbi called Hillel who stashed herbs, apple slices and nuts between two matzos. History stays silent about what Hillel called his concoction but his stuffed matzos were the earliest version of what we now call sandwich. In the Middle Ages, Europeans were eating trenchers — stale, coarse bread was used as a plate. Trenchers cannot pass off as sandwich precursors because the rich diners fed the food-soaked bread to dogs or beggars. What probably had a farresemblance to modern sandwich is the way the Dutch ate thin slivers of sliced meat over bread which lay on butter. The English, however, were not eating open sandwiches. Not in the 17th century. When the Brits did start stashing meat between bread, it only had rogues and gamblers as takers. The scoundrels hated food interruption and greasy fingers. That's why they loved sandwiches.

vember 24, 1762, 'sandwich' first appeared in Edward Gibbons Journal where he rambles about "I dined at the Cocoa Tree.... upon a bit of cold meat, or a sandwich". Gradually, the easy-to-make food slid onto the late-night dinner meal of the aristocrats and later as American supper. The simple humble modern sandwich that was born out of a man's whim is now a worldwide $27 billion industry. The UK sandwich market is worth £3 billion — that's 1.8 billion sandwiches annually running off counters in subways or cafes.
You can never count how many sandwiches are downed with beer and pop every day. Forgive me for dragging you into semantics, but can you really define a real sandwich? Not everything stuffed with meat, rice, beans or other ingredients is technically a sandwich. Calling burritos, tacos or quesadillas sandwiches is pure blasphemy. No, I am not promulgating these sandwich rules. Hear it from a court in Boston. The court ruled that a 'sandwich' should include at least two slices of bread.
Sticking to semantics, sandwiches are also star-struck, adding fancy prefixes to their prosaic name. Like, Hugh Hefner sandwich. The one served at Heimerhaus in Hollywood. What do you think it would boast of most? Well, a lot of breast: turkey and ham with chutney and Jack cheese.
The Woody Allen at New York's Carnegie Deli is a towering mess of corned beef and pastrami; Mark Zuckerberg at Mr Bartley's in Harvard comes with Boursin cheese, bacon and a side of sweet potato fries. Alfred Hitchcock at an old school Huntington Beach lunch spot is ham and provolone, smeared with mustard and served on a French roll. Al Gore at Two Bears Deli in Michigan is healthy, hearty and oh so eco! — tomato wheat wrap crammed with mixed greens, feta cheese, dried cherries and walnuts.
Too Many to Count
Even if the sandwich sheds the glitter of famous names, it is still not as simple as picking up a few ingredients and stuffing between two slices of bread. It can be elaborate, artsy or a feast in itself. You have heard of the common BLTs, PB&Js and the BBQs. That's bacon, lettuce, tomato; peanut butter and jam; and barbecue chicken or pork. However, if you ever try to count all sandwiches on all the menus, you sure shall go breathless. The US-based Foodservice Research Institute has diligently collected sandwich stats. Like a sandwich census. In hot sandwich category, there are 10,089 varieties to pick from; there are 2,922 types of cold sandwiches (Indian sandwiches are only 0.2% of total cold sandwich menu share). The most popular cold sandwich is the tuna salad sandwich, accounting for 8.8% share of cold sandwiches on the menu. The grilled cheese sandwich is the leading hot sandwich and hogs 3.6% share in that category listed on the American menu.
The sandwich types range from cheese melt to pastrami, fried fish, calzone, meatball, beef taco, Philly cheesesteak and corned beef reuben. Then, there's Dagwood sandwich which was created by Dagwood Bumstead of the comic strip Blondie by Murat Bernard 'Chic' Young. Dagwood is a sandwich made with many layers of bread, meats, cheese, lettuce, tomato, condiments, etc. And, of course, the Muffuletta, a submarine type sandwich that originated in New Orleans around 1910. It is made with a round loaf of Italian bread, split and layered with sliced Provolone cheese, salami and ham, topped with 'olive salad' — chopped green olives, pinientos, celery, garlic, capers, oregano, parsley, olive oil and red wine vinegar. Add to the list the Po'Boy (short for Poor Boy) and Sloppy Joe (created in Iowa as a "loose meat sandwich" by a chef called Joe). Muffuletta seems exotic. If you want anything more unusual, turn to chef Martin Rozario of Quote Bar and Lounge, New Delhi. He puts falafel in an open sandwich while chef Amit Dash of Courtyard by Marriott, Gurgaon, rustles up an unusual seafood salad Panini wherein he mayo-mixes calamari, prawns cooked with celery, leek with pesto and spreads them over Panini bread. In The Park Calangute, Goa, sous chef Kapil Muchandi happily makes a Moongachi gathi and copra sandwich that has sprouted beans, onion, tomato, ginger and garlic. Even curry leaves! All this cooked and spread over brown bread that is slathered with mayo. Over the years — from Hillel to Montagu to now — the sandwich has stepped beyond being merely an easy lunch or supper. It has spawned an entire world around itself. Nations have sandwich associations, sandwich magazines, sandwich designers, innovators, and even a much-coveted annual International Sammies Award (lovingly called The Sammies). Quite like the London Fashion Week, The Sammies showcase new trends in sandwich design and what's going to be on the high streets next year. Plain Jane and Frumpy Joe sandwiches do not make it to the The Sammies. It is allglam and innovation. Sandwiches have to scrape through regional heats for a ticket to the finals. In The Sammies you can actually imagine a pretty sandwich walking up to the podium and receiving a designer or innovator award. In 2013, Sandwich Designer of the Year winner was Catherine Lear . Her Platinum winning sandwich was a prosciutto and asparagus melt in grilled sourdough bread, oozing melted mozzarella and crisp asparagus spears.
The 'In' Sandwich
Like fashion, the sandwich also hops through trends. Will avocado be the new ham this season? Will duotone sandwiches still be on the platter or will they be forgotten? Will pricey artsy sandwiches with condiments as paint daubs survive economic meltdowns? Will Rubik Cubewich (that resembles Ru sided bread art sandwich) find takers? So many different kinds. Just one life to eat. Sigh! I know of typography sandwiches (bread shaped like an alphabet) but I could never put sandwich and geometry on the same plate. Never thought of a sandwich theorem or an inane geometrical mash of a sandwich. But there's one — Ham Sandwich Theorem. This is what it is: given globs of ham, bread, and cheese (in any shape), placed any way you like, there exists one flat slice of a knife (a plane) that will bisect each of the ham, bread and cheese. Put simply, you can share a sandwich with a friend so that both get exactly the same amounts of all three globs.
Forget the globs. Or their symmetrical, proportional cut. In the International Sandwich Month, I need no theorems to kill a sandwich hunger pang. Two slices of bread. Melted cheese. Micro-greens. Tomato. Lettuce. Onion. There, my sandwich is ready. My hunger is conquered. I am sandwich satiated!

Daily consumption of sugary drinks may age you fasterSugary drinks may age you faster

Soda consumption might promote disease independently from its role in obesity, according to researchers from the University of California, San Francisco.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
WASHINGTON: Daily consumption of a 20-ounce sugar-sweetened soda is associated with 4.6 years of additional biological ageing - effects that are comparable to that of smoking - a new study has warned.
Soda consumption might promote disease independently from its role in obesity, according to researchers from the University of California , San Francisco who found that drinking sugary drinks was associated with cell ageing.
The study found that telomeres - the protective units of DNA that cap the ends of chromosomes in cells - were shorter in the white blood cells of survey participants who reported drinking more soda.
The length of telomeres within white blood cells - where it can most easily be measured - has previously been associated with human lifespan.
Short telomeres also have been associated with the development of chronic diseases of ageing, including heart disease, diabetes, and some types of cancer.
"Regular consumption of sugar-sweetened sodas might influence disease development, not only by straining the body's metabolic control of sugars, but also through accelerated cellular ageing of tissues," said Elissa Epel, professor of psychiatry and senior author of the study.
"This is the first demonstration that soda is associated with telomere shortness," Epel said.
"This finding held regardless of age, race, income and education level. Telomere shortening starts long before disease onset.
"Further, although we only studied adults here, it is possible that soda consumption is associated with telomere shortening in children, as well," Epel said.
Based on the way telomere length shortens on average with chronological age, the UCSF researchers calculated that daily consumption of a 20-ounce soda was associated with 4.6 years of additional biological ageing.
This effect on telomere length is comparable to the effect of smoking, or to the effect of regular exercise in the opposite, anti-ageing direction, according to UCSF postdoctoral fellow Cindy Leung, from the UCSF Center for Health and Community, lead author of the study.
The authors cautioned that they only compared telomere length and sugar-sweetened soda consumption for each participant at a single time point, and that an association does not demonstrate causation.
The UCSF researchers measured telomeres after obtaining stored DNA from 5,309 participants, ages 20 to 65, with no history of diabetes or cardiovascular disease, who had participated in an ongoing health survey in the US, called the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, during the years 1999 through 2002.

Eating breakfast increases young adults' levels of a brain chemical associated with feelings of reward, which may reduce food cravings and overeating later in the day.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
NEW YORK: If you wish to prevent obesity, eat breakfast every day as skipping the first meal of the day increases food cravings and eventual weight gain.
Eating breakfast, particularly meals rich in protein, increases young adults' levels of a brain chemical associated with feelings of reward, which may reduce food cravings and overeating later in the day, research showed.
"Our research showed that people experience a dramatic decline in cravings for sweet foods when they eat breakfast," said Heather Leidy, an assistant professor of nutrition and exercise physiology at University of Missouri in the US.
"However, breakfasts that are high in protein also reduced cravings for savoury - or high-fat - foods. On the other hand, if breakfast is skipped, these cravings continue to rise throughout the day," Leidy added.
Understanding the brain chemical and its role in food cravings could lead to improvements in obesity prevention and treatment.
Leidy studied the effects of different breakfasts on participants' levels of dopamine, a brain chemical involved in moderating impulses and reward, including food cravings.
"Dopamine levels are blunted in individuals who are overweight or obese, which means that it takes much more stimulation - or food - to elicit feelings of reward; we saw similar responses within breakfast-skippers," Leidy said.
Participants in the study were young women with an average age of 19. However, Leidy said the findings may be generalised to a larger population of adults.
The study was published in the Nutrition Journal .

Govt overestimated Air India s capability: Praful PatelAir India
(ET Magazine contacted former…)
ET Magazine contacted former aviation minister Praful Patel to respond to the issues raised in Bhargava's article. He refused to respond to the article per se but defended the aircraft acquisition and the processes followed by the aviation ministry while pushing the deal. Excerpts:
There was no wrongdoing. It was a collective decision of the government.
I accept that we overestimated the capability of Air India to carry out the aircraft acquisition plan.
The government provided sovereign guarantee for the acquisition.
The EGoM cleared the acquisition, which was finalized by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs.
All processes, including informing the Comptroller and Auditor General of India and Chief Vigilance Commissioner with the entire set of documents, were adhered to while clearing the acquisition.
In 2012, when I ceased to be aviation minister, the government did not revoke the deal. It actually decided to purchase 20 of the 27 Dreamliners from Boeing. It could have cancelled the order because of the delays in delivery of the planes. Air India need not have paid fines for pulling out of the deal; rather, the airline could have imposed fines on Boeing for the delays.
Air India's old planes have been phased out while new ones have joined the fleet. Now, nearly 10 years after the order, 15 of the total 68 planes ordered have still not joined the fleet. So, the net addition of planes remains zero. In other words, the Air India fleet size today remains the same as it was in 2005.
I haven't stopped anyone from probing the deal. Let anyone bring out the facts or proof that the acquisition was mala fide.

Turnaround: AI proposes shift from sale and leasebackA-320 neo
(While leaseback turns out…)
NEW DELHI: Air India is proposing to shift from sale and leaseback to outright purchase of 15 of the 27 Dreamliner aircraft it has ordered, in a bid to save about $225-300 million as part of the turnaround plan.
A proposal to this effect has been sent to the government for approval, as the national carrier feels that the shift to the outright purchase system would provide a much better internal rate of return, airline officials said here.
While leaseback turns out to be more expensive in the long run, an airline does not get the benefit of the residual value of an aircraft after its lease expires as it is enjoyed by the lessor, they said.
Sale and leaseback is a financial transaction where one sells an asset and leases it back on a long term and continues to use it without owning it.
The sources said the redelivery cost (after the lease expires) of a widebody aircraft like the Dreamliners is very high at almost $20 million while for narrow-bodies it is about $10-12 million.
Such high redelivery costs would be avoided if the planes are owned by the company, the officials said.
Air India, which has seven aircraft on leaseback and has offered five more through that process, now plans to turn to the outright purchase mode for the remaining 15, they said.
At present, the airline has a total of 17 Dreamliners in its fleet with one more slated to be delivered in December. The last of these planes is to be delivered by September 2016.
Under the future global accounting system International Financial Reporting Standards which would become mandatory for all nations in a few years, all long-term leases would have to be shown as both assets and liabilities which would also enhance the burden on the airline's aircraft leases, the sources said.
Air India is also evaluating whether to induct the latest Airbus A-320 neo (New Engine Option) aircraft into its fleet after 2017, which the manufacturer claims to be a major fuel-saving airplane.
In one of the largest orders in terms of number of aircraft, IndiGo had last week ordered 250 of these A-320 neos.
On the financial front, Air India's financial and operational parameters have shown a marked improvement between April and September this year, registering an 11 per cent growth in network revenue at Rs 8,114 crore up from Rs 7,289 crore reported during the same period last year.
The airline was able to achieve this despite the period being a lean season when most airlines report a decline in the number of passengers carried.
The passenger load factor at 73.5 per cent on domestic and 74.8 per cent on international sectors exceeded the target of 73 and 74 per cent respectively, thus increasing the yields at a time of stiff competition posed by the no-frill carriers and their low fare offers, the officials said.

Inflation down but economy still not out of woodsYou are here: Home > Collections
Inflation is down & crude prices have fallen sharply, but the economy is not out of woods. Why?
Avinash Celestine, ET Bureau Oct 19, 2014, 10.06AM IST

Consumer Price Inflation
(Nitsure points out there…)
With both retail and wholesale prices dropping sharply in the recent months, anticipation is higher than ever of that long-awaited event — a cut in interest rates by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
Consumer price inflation is currently at about 6.5%, seemingly within the comfort zone for the RBI's target of getting prices down to 8% by January. Many analysts, though, see little hope of a rate cut at any point in the next few months at least.
"The RBI has been fighting a fiveyear battle with inflation," says Rupa Rege Nitsure, chief economist with the Bank of Baroda. "That battle is not going to end that easily."
To be sure, as Nitsure points out, there are good reasons to believe that the decline in inflation in the past couple of months may be purely an artefact of the numbers.
Inflation between September and November last year rose by over two percentage points to close to 12%. Because of this high 'base effect', as statisticians call it, part of the drop in recent months was only to be expected.
"The inflation rate for November will see the lowest number in five years," says Nitsure. "But expect inflation to rise after that."
The RBI is likely to wait and watch for a few months on whether inflation is coming down and will stay low before finally taking a call on interest rates.
India Impact
But there are other concerns as well. The global economy is weak, with the International Monetary Fund cutting its latest global growth forecasts. The notable exception here is the US, which has seen improved growth in recent months with the US unemployment rate falling to 6.1% in August, a level not seen since 2008.
This would normally be seen as a good thing, but markets also take it as a sign that growth increases the risk of inflation rising well above what the US central bank would see as comfortable, forcing it to raise interest rates. "In fact, that's a key risk right now," says economist Abheek Barua, currently with think tank ICRIER.
Analysts see a possible rate hike by the Federal Reserve by the second or third quarter of 2015.
But why should that matter to the Indian economy? A hike in US interest rates, or even the mere expectation among investors, has led to outflows of foreign investor money from emerging markets back to the US. This has happened with little regard to the state of individual markets at that time.
 
"India may do a bit better relative to other Asian markets, but we are still quite vulnerable," says Barua. Even the other big positive for the Indian economy in recent months — the sharp fall in crude oil prices — takes on a more ominous tone when seen in this light.
The decline in prices of crude and other commodities may be just the first signs of this 'capital flight' back to the US, though other factors such as the weakness in key economies of Europe and China have certainly played a role. "The question could well be as to which market is next," says Barua.
Even weak global commodity prices in themselves have an ambiguous effect on the Indian economy. It's good for consumers, but not so good for farmers who can expect relatively meagre earnings across a range of key crops as global prices remain soft. That hurts the earnings of around half the workforce who earn a living from agriculture, and therefore the rural economy.
Structural Issues
An outflow of portfolio capital from the Indian markets would inevitably be seen as having a negative impact on the rupee. Indeed, in real terms, when the differences in inflation rates between India and the rest of the world are taken into account, the rupee is seen as 'overvalued' against key currencies and ripe for a fall. If this does happen, the sharp fall in the price at which India buys crude oil (currently at around $87 per barrel) would be offset partly by a weaker exchange rate.
These 'macro' risks are quite apart from the broader structural issues with the Indian economy, which the new government has only begun to address. As Nitsure points out, apart from industrial growth, bank credit too remains very weak. "Though the government has been active in clearing stalled projects, corporates are still in a wait-and-watch mode," she says. The fall in inflation is a good sign, but the economy is hardly in the clear.

Govet deregulates diesel; prices to be linked to marketGovernment deregulates diesel; prices to be linked to market

(Rs 3.37  a litre cut…)
NEW DELHI: The government announced its biggest reform yet as it decontrolled diesel, which will immediately become cheaper by Rs 3.35 a litre, raised gas prices to $5.61 a unit from next month and said cooking gas customers in 54 districts will get subsidy in their bank accounts from next month even if they do not have an Aadhaar card.
The gas price is based on a new formula that excludes costly LNG prices from the calculation, making the increase 75% lower than the price from the Rangarajan formula, which would have doubled the rate to $8.4 per unit. The UPA regime had cleared the Rangarajan price but the Election Commission had blocked it. The government also announced a premium, to be calculated later, on the price of gas from future discoveries in challenging areas like deep-water, and highpressure or high-temperature zones.
Oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan said Reliance Industries will still get the current rate of $4.2 per unit from its producing fields in the KG-D6 block because the company is in arbitration with the government. "Customers of KG-D6 gas will have to pay the new price. But the operator will get the old price for their gas, which is $4.2 per unit. The difference will be kept in a gas pool account operated by Gail India until arbitration is over," Pradhan said.
The long-awaited reform in diesel prices, which will make the fuel cheaper for the first time in five years, along with renewed efforts to target cooking gas subsidy, will help control the subsidy burden, help finance minister Arun Jaitley control the fiscal deficit and catalyse the fuel retailing sector, where Reliance Industries, Essar Oil and Shell India will challenge the near-monopoly of state-run firms in the sector.
The price of natural gas, currently $4.2 a unit, has been increased by a much smaller extent than the UPA government's unimplemented decision to double it to $8.4 per unit. Prices will be revised once in six months. The new price is in the range of what the power ministry had sought but below what the exploration industry deems attractive to spend big money in the hunt for new fields.
Essar Oil welcomed the deregulation of diesel. LK Gupta, MD & CEO, Essar Oil, said: " We welcome the government's decision to deregulate diesel. This will not only help in controlling the fiscal deficit, but also be advantageous for consumers as they will now pay market rates for the fuel which is lower by more than Rs 3 per litre . This will also leave more money with upstream companies for investment in exploration & production, thereby enhancing our efforts for energy security for the country." The hike in natural gas price will raise compressed natural gas (CNG) used in automobiles by Rs 4.25 per unit in Delhi and piped natural gas (PNG) by Rs 2.6 per unit.

Carmakers refrained from increasing prices for the eight straight month in October, the longest such stretch in the Indian market.

Prices | Financials | Company Info | Reports
NEW DELHI: Carmakers refrained from increasing prices for the eight straight month in October, the longest such stretch in the Indian market, although the stability isn't linked to the slowdown as much as it is to incentives in the form of excise duty cuts by the government to stimulate demand. Maruti Suzuki India, the biggest car company with a 45 per cent share of the domestic market, hasn't raised prices since December 2013.
South Korea's Hyundai , the second-largest auto company in the country, increased prices last in February, before the government reduced excise duty. According to data compiled by ET from the market, none of the carmakers increased prices as they sought to propel car sales, except for notional rate changes for models such as Ford EcoSport and Toyota Etios. The 4-6 per cent excise duty cuts in the interim budget in February boosted demand and inadvertently helped the government tame the industry on prices. As a result, the industry was able to overcome a record two years of declining sales and sell more cars in the first half of this financial year.
"The decade's worst slowdown has pushed the automakers to rethink about their overall game plan in India. Moreover, the pricing strategy is something which is generally a counter to revelry and currently none of them are willing to weaken down their positioning in the recovering market," says Amit Kaushik, principal analyst (autos) at IHS Automotive , a global consultancy firm.
Unlike the past two years, the market has recovered. About 8.8 lakh passenger cars were sold in the April-September period, a 4.09 per cent increase from a year earlier. Companies, which are offering higher discounts to attract customers, are waiting to see if the excise benefits will be extended beyond December.
"It's a Catch-22 situation for the car manufacturers. While the December sword of excise hike is hanging, most of the industry players are delaying price hikes to avoid any backlash from the government," said a senior car company executive, preferring not to be identified.
The industry had received flak from the government when it hiked prices in January 2009, after excise duty was reduced in December following the global financial crisis.
"It was a different situation then as the industry was reeling under instant decline in sales following the US financial crisis that plunged all the major markets into a crisis. Indian carmakers had increased prices in January 2009, but then there was also huge pressure on inputs while the scenario is different now as most critical commodities - rubber, petroleum, alloys - are either flat or have declined in absolute prices," said a senior functionary with an automotive body.
Data shows that car sales dropped 7 per cent to 18.95 lakh units in 2013 as the economy slowed and manufacturers hiked prices to offset input and commodity cost pressures. This year, consistent overall growth is likely to keep the industry in positive territory, although automakers are reeling under unprecedented discounts and high marketing expenditure.
"Discounts are on an average around 20 per cent higher over the last year. But still we avoided any price hikes this year as it could have derailed consumer sentiment and also there was a moral pressure to pass on the benefits of excise duty reductions to customers," a senior Maruti Suzuki executive said. Most car companies expect the excise duty benefits to be extended beyond December, which may result in stable car prices and keep the current positive momentum going into the new year.

ONGC, HPCL rally upto 9% post gas price hike, diesel deregulation; RIL in red
ECONOMICTIMES.COM Oct 20, 2014, 03.40PM IST
(State-run oil explorers…)
NEW DELHI: State-run oil companies such as ONGC, HPCL rose over 8 per cent in intraday trade on Monday, after the Modi government raised natural gas prices to $5.6 per unit from $4.2 which will significantly boost the earnings of ONGC and deregulated diesel.
However, private explorers such as Reliance Industries may be disappointed because the new gas price will not be applicable to RIL' KG-D6 production, as expected, because the company is in arbitration with the government.
Reacting to the news, ONGC rose as much as 8.7 per cent, followed by Oil India Ltd which was up 5 per cent in trade. State-run oil explorers such as BPCL rose 7.2 per cent, HPCL rose 8.7 per cent to hit its fresh 52-week high of Rs 534 and IOC which rose 7.9 per cent.
State-run oil & gas companies such as IOC traded 6.1 per cent higher at Rs 388, BPCL was up 6.7 per cent to Rs 709.80 and HPCL traded 7.4 per cent higher at Rs 528.
Reliance Industries slipped as much as 2.7 per cent in trade, but managed to recoup losses and was just trading 0.7 per cent lower at Rs 931. It hit a low of Rs 912.75 and a high of Rs 941.80 in trade today.
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley over the weekend said that the price from November 1 will be $5.61 per mmBtu on heat value the fuel will generate on gross calorific value (GCV) basis.
The new price will be determined on Gross Calorific Value (GCV) basis and reviewed every six months against the quarterly price changes approved by the previous UPA government based on Rangarajan committee recommendation.
The revised gas price would be applicable to all gas produced from nomination fields given to ONGC and OIL India, New Exploration and Licensing Policy (NELP) blocks, some pre-NELP blocks and coal-bed methane blocks.
State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp will rake in about Rs 1,950 crore in additional profit this fiscal from the 46 per cent rise in natural gas prices announced by the government, ET reported.
According to analysts, announcements made by the government are beneficial for ONGC as well as for Oil India Ltd, while neutral for Reliance Industries (RIL).
RIL will get the old price unless it makes up for the shortfall in gas production, for which the oil ministry blames the company. However, Reliance attributes the decline to geological reasons, said the ET report.
"ONGC / OIL are preferred picks on the back of these announcements," CLSA said in a report. However, these developments are neutral for Reliance Industries, added the report.

(Post elections, the government…)
MUMBAI: The S&P BSE Sensex opened nearly 400 points higher on the back of gains in banks, capital goods and banks, as the market rejoiced BJP's victory in recently held assembly elections. Rally in global markets following better economic data in the US also boosted sentiment.
The BJP has got a majority in Haryana and will form the government for the first time in the state. It has emerged as the single largest party in Maharashtra but will have to patch-up with old ally Shiv Sena to form a government.
Meanwhile, post elections, the government announced slew of reform measures such as diesel price deregulation and hike in natural gas price hike.
"The subsidy on diesel finally moves out. To what extent it brings down the deficit is left to be seen and whether or not the RBI will look at cutting rates is another question. The hike in natural gas prices was lower than street expectation but is expected to boost the sector as more prospects could be considered for drilling. The big question is what happens if crude prices shoot up later," said IIFL report.
At 09:16 a.m.; the 30-share index was at 26,466.44, up 357.91 points or 1.37 per cent. It touched a high of 26,501.04 and a low of 26,434.16 in trade today.
The Nifty was at 7,891.60, up 111.90 points or 1.44 per cent. It touched a high of 7,898.40 and a low of 7,888.70 in trade today.
The S&P BSE Midcap Index gained 1.49 per cent and the S&P BSE Smallcap Index was 1.32 per cent higher.
Among the sectoral indices, the S&P BSE Bankex surged 2.15 per cent, the S&P BSE Capital goods Index was 1.88 per cent higher, the S&P BSE Metal Index rose 1.29 per cent and the S&P BSE Oil & gas Index moved 1.11 per cent higher.
ONGC (up 5.21 per cent), GAIL (up 2.65 per cent), HDFC (up 2.59 per cent), HDFC Bank (up 2.51 per cent) and Axis Bank (up 2.49 per cent) were among the Sensex gainers.
Reliance (1.19 per cent) and Hero MotoCorp (0.78 per cent) were the only losers.
The market breadth was positive on the BSE with 1,001 gainers against 145 losers.
The Asian markets have surged following a rally on the Wall Street on Friday. The Nikkei 225 rallied 3.53 per cent, Seoul Composite was 1.48 per cent higher and Taiwan Weighted advanced 1.40 per cent.

According to experts, after securing majority in both the states, the Narendra Modi government has more room now to press forward with reforms, beginning with the winter session of Parliament and the FY16 budget thereafter
"The market has given a thumbs-up as the BJP has won Haryana State assembly polls and is the single largest party in Maharashtra. The result would add heft to the already formidable political weight of the Prime Minister," says Ajay Bodke, Head- Investment Strategy & Advisory, Prabhudas Lilladher.
"Markets hope that this strengthening of his hand would embolden Mr. Modi to roll-out aggressive reforms that had enthused global & domestic investors into driving up the Indian equity market to dizzying heights this calendar year," he added.
Tracking the momentum, the 50-share Nifty index also managed to reclaim its crucial psychological level of 7900, supported by gains in oil & gas, capital goods, auto and banking stocks.
At 1:07 p.m.; the 30-share index was at 26,402.31, up 293.78 points or 1.13 per cent. It touched a high of 26,517.90 and a low of 26,399.84 in trade today.
The Nifty was at 7877.80, up 98.10 points or 1.26 per cent. It touched a high of 7,905.95 and a low of 7,872.20 in trade today.

Cabinet deregulates diesel price: What this means to youIndia ends diesel controls, raises gas prices
Reuters –  Sun 19 Oct, 2014 9:07 AM IST
Print
By Nidhi Verma
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The government on Saturday lifted diesel price controls and raised the cost of natural gas, giving market forces greater sway as it seeks to attract energy investment, boost competition and cut subsidy costs.
The decisions marked an acceleration in reform measures by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who won a landslide general election victory in May and was buoyed by a strong showing in two state elections this week.
Lower prices of diesel and a smaller-than-expected rise in local gas rates will help Modi fulfill an election pledge to curb inflation and pull India's economy out of its longest slowdown since the 1980s.
"Henceforth, like petrol, pricing of diesel will be market determined," Finance Minister Arun Jaitley told a news conference after Modi chaired a cabinet meeting.
A litre of diesel will cost about 5.7 percent, or 3.37 rupees ($0.05), less for consumers from Sunday, while prices of locally produced gas will go up by a third from next month.
The first cut in diesel prices across the country in more than five years, triggered by falling global oil prices, will help further ease inflation that is already tracking lower.
Diesel makes up nearly half of India's fuel demand and its usage is set to rise as Modi wants to boost the employment-generating manufacturing sector to generate growth and jobs.
 
PAINLESS GAIN
A fall in global oil prices, down more than 20 percent from this year's June high, means that ending costly diesel subsidies will save the government money without hurting consumers.
India imports more than 70 percent of its oil needs and every $10 a barrel fall in prices lowers retail inflation by 0.2 of a percentage point and wholesale inflation by half a point, experts estimate.
Diesel deregulation will significantly reduce subsidy payouts by Oil and Natural Gas Corp, GAIL (India) Ltd and Oil India Ltd.
These companies sell crude and refined products to state refiners at discounted rates to partly compensate them for losses on fuels sales at regulated prices.
The move to market-based pricing will boost the role of private players like Reliance Industries and Essar Oil in India's retail arena.
Such companies do not receive federal support for selling diesel at discounted rates and currently sell via state refiners despite having their own sales infrastructure.
"It is a good move. This will create competition in the market and will benefit consumers, government ... and help upstream companies invest more funds for exploration," said L.K. Gupta, managing director of Essar Oil.
 
GAS PRICES
The government has reworked the gas pricing formula approved by the previous Congress-led government and restricted the rise in local gas prices to $5.61 per mmBtu from Nov. 1. The prices will be revised after every six months.
The previous government had suggested for raising domestic gas prices to $8.4 per mmBtu from the current $4.20 per mmBtu.
"This price will take into consideration the fact that there is sufficient incentive for drilling and investment and also it is not excessively burdensome as far as consumers are concerned," Jaitley said.
About 80 percent of the additional revenue due to revision in gas prices will go to state run companies ONGC and Oil India.
Reliance and its partners BP and Canada's Niko Resources will not get the benefits of the price rise for gas produced from its D1 and D3 gas fields in the east coast deepwater D6 block, where output has fallen drastically and is way below the promised volumes.
Reliance is currently locked in arbitrations with the government over its D6 block.
Reliance and its partners will deposit the differential between $5.61 and $4.20 in a separate fund until the arbitration is resolved, said Oil Minister Dhramendra Pradhan.

  Sleek, classy, elegant and handy, the Alpha scores high on design, says Vipul Vivek.  Samsung's Galaxy Alpha left me in a bind: The phone is not another offering from Samsung to make captive users at every point possible in the price range.  The company has priced the Alpha high and ensured that the design and functions don't make users feel shortchanged.  The Alpha might lack a few features of the S5 or the Note series. Even so, it is every inch a flagship, or at least ...

Protecting the legacy of Lutyens Bungalow ZoneProtecting the legacy of Lutyens Bungalow Zone
Reshmi R Dasgupta, ET Bureau Oct 18, 2014, 06.16AM IST

10 Janpath
(Saving the purported example…)
It is an urban legend - as no one anyone knows has ever given a first-hand account - that Sonia Gandhi's 10 Janpath is one of the most (if not the only) unspoilt government villas in New Delhi's Lutyens Bungalow Zone (LBZ). The floors are the original modest cement mosaic, and the rooms, fireplaces, doors, windows and verandahs remain true to the broad vision of Sir Edwin Landseer Lutyens and Sir Herbert Baker.
Indeed, it is said that the CPWD - used to bowing to the outre extravagances of the political heavyweights allotted the spacious bungalows - are amazed at her reluctance to alter the character of her secluded abode. Had she wanted, it could have become a marble, glass and parquet palace to rival anything that south or west Delhi 'colonies' can put up, that too at public expense.
This anecdote has been prompted by the fact that Delhi's guardians in their wisdom have asked Unesco to bestow a Heritage City tag on the Capital's two imperial avatars - Shahjahanabad and LBZ. That would presuppose a genuine intention among all concerned to preserve the original character of the two conurbations. But there is little in the LBZ at least, to support that contention.
Saving the purported example of 10 Janpath - and the frozen-in-1984 residence of Sonia Gandhi's mother-in-law and clear style mentor, the late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi - few other Lutyens bungalows (and their occupants, past and present) have retained their pristine appeal. Indeed, the past decade or so has witnessed a boom in altered interiors, as the powerful have been spoilt for choice.
Rare and expensive marbles from all over the world, parquet both real and laminated, air-conditioning and lighting of all kinds, the best imported sanitaryware, kitchen gadgetry and accessories can be procured and installed by willing parties, if the VIPs want, Lutyens' vision be damned. And so they had been, as the bungalows' new National Democratic Alliance occupants discovered when they moved in.
Apparently warned by the spartan new prime minister not to embark on the usual remodeling exercise that follows every change of government, many NDA ministers and appointees were gobsmacked by what already lay behind the simple whitewashed exteriors of the LBZ mansions. The abodes of particularly powerful former occupants could put Dubai's most blingy concoctions to shade.
Some LBZ beneficiaries had hidden behind the fig leaf that they spent their own money to embark on reckless renovations. Others were more brazen and grandly drew attention to the modcons their ingenuity and unlimited resources had brought to those benighted bungalows of a bygone era. But public money or private, nobody baulked at altering the basic character of their residences.
That is unconscionable if the intention is to preserve the intrinsic heritage character of a city. If, for instance, Red Fort's Diwan-i-Khas was to be glassed in and airconditioned, plus saddled with unaesthetic extensions on the plea that the weather and the need to accommodate more people necessitated it, would it be accepted? No. Yet the same argument holds good for radically altering structures in LBZ.
There is a case to upgrade bathrooms from thunderboxes, but covering the walls in onyx instead of tiles surely cannot be condoned. If the Mughals and the British Raj's elites (no slouches when it came to their creature comforts) could make do with these buildings without dozens of air-conditioners and acres of false ceilings and parquet floors, why should these become sine qua non for latter day elites?
The words of Spiderman's Uncle Ben, "with great power comes great responsibility" have even been quoted by former PM Manmohan Singh. The Lutyens era bungalows' show plenty of evidence of exactly the opposite. So much so that Lutyens' grand-daughter on a visit to this city some years ago had also been saddened by the bungalows deviating from her ancestor's vision.
President Pranab Mukherjee has shown what thoughtful preservation and restoration can achieve when it comes to Lutyens' magnum opus, Rashtrapati Bhavan. Now it is time for NDA ministers and appointees to undo what decades of excess had wrought on the other residences of the Lutyens Bungalow Zone stretching out below the palace on Raisina Hill. Only then will it deserve Unesco's heritage city tag.

BJP dethrones Congress in HaryanaPrint
Chandigarh: The BJP Sunday said it will form the government in Haryana with early trends indicating it was winning in 48 of the 90 seats. This is the first time that the BJP is likely to come to power in the state on its own.
The party started on a winning note with the first result being declared in Haryana going to its kitty.
Veteran BJP leader Anil Vij won from the Ambala Cantt seat by a convincing margin of 15,462 votes.
"We will form the next government in Haryana. We will get two-thirds majority," BJP leader Abhimanyu said in Hisar.
The ruling Congress, staring at a rout, drew solace with the result of the Jhajjar (reserved) seat going in its favour. Education minister and Congress candidate Geeta Bhukkal won the seat with a margin of 26,854 votes.
If the BJP wins a clear majority in the assembly, this will be an achievement given the fact that the BJP had won only for assembly seats in the 2009 assembly polls.
BJP in-charge Haryana Kailash Vijayvargiya: "People of Haryana wanted a change. Our party cadres and leaders worked very hard. The credit for our success has to go to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah."
On the question of BJP having too many candidates aspiring to be the next chief minister in Haryana, Vijayvargiya said: "The party will collectively decide the next chief minister. He will be someone who will be acceptable to all sections in Haryana."
A party needs to win 46 seats to get a simple majority in the house.
Election officials counting the mass of votes polled Oct 15 said the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was clearly ahead of its two main rivals, the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) and the ruling Congress.
The INLD was ahead of others in 21 seats and the Congress in 14. The Haryana Janhit Congress (HJC) and others led in three and five seats respectively.
Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda was leading from his Garhi Sampla-Kiloi seat.
Union minister Sushma Swaraj's sister Vandana Sharma was also leading from the Safidon seat.
INLD leader and Hisar MP Dushyant Chautala was trailing over BJP candidate Premlata Singh by over 4,000 votes in the high-profile Uchana Kalan assembly seat.
Counting of votes for the 90 seats in Haryana began Sunday morning to decide the fate of 1,351 candidates, including 116 women.
A record 76.54 percent of Haryana's 1.63 crore electorate voted in the assembly polls this time.

Mystery shoppers: Way to check service standardsREAD MORE ON » WeMark Group | Sunday ET | Secret Shoppers | Redquanta | PVR cinemas | Pankaj Guglani
Welcome to the covert, cloak-and-dagger world of the mystery shopper, whom hospitality chains, retail outlets, banks and several other consumer-focused businesses around the world — and now in India — depend on to check out the service standards and employee integrity of their staff
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
Anshuman Malik frequently checks into five-star hotels in India and abroad. During his stay, Malik indulges in some eccentric and some downright fraudulent activities. For instance, before giving his clothes for laundry he fills a trouser pocket with two `100 notes. Then he bribes the bartender to waive off half his bill and, after ruling out complimentary breakfast, he casually queues up, picks up a plate and helps himself. Then he walks out silently without paying the bill.
On such visits, Malik is accompanied by his wife and children. A closer look at this well-dressed guest who takes the management of luxury hotel brands around the world for a ride would reveal that, at such times, he conveys the focus and studious concentration of a man on duty rather than the disarming charm of a conman. Malik observes everything around him, the quality of the food, the courteousness of the hotel staff — even the hand prints on glass doors.
Malik also records the time taken by the chauffeur to find him in a crowd at the airport and after locking the door to his suite, he checks under the bed and the carpet and inspects the bathroom to check out hygiene standards. Unobtrusively, he also video and audio records conversations with hotel staffers using his cellphone.
Having stayed at the hotel for four days, when it comes to paying the bill, Malik — a senior hotel management professional — hands over a letter from the top management of the hotel chain; the letter identifies him as a mystery shopper carrying out an audit.
Solving the Mystery
Welcome to the covert, cloak-and-dagger world of the mystery shopper, whom hospitality chains, retail outlets, banks and several other consumer-focused businesses around the world — and now in India — depend on to check out the service standards and employee integrity of their staff.
In India, the mystery shopping business is in its infancy but quickly picking up pace. The industry is estimated to be worth around `70 crore and employs over 2 lakh people on a part-time basis. Many brands have realized a few bitter truths about their standards after such an audit.
Malik lets on that he has encountered some shocking practices at some of the most well-known hospitality brands in India. "There are several bars at five-star hotels in India where the bartender will make the bill disappear if you pass on a handsome tip. The money that I left in my pocket before handing out for laundry went unreturned at some of the best known hotels in the country," he says.
The best hotel that he has audited is the Grand Hyatt in Dubai. "At the sprawling hotel, wherever you may go, the hotel staff will greet the guest by his/her name — it's incredible to see so many people remember and greet you personally. The standards maintained by the staff too were exactly how they were supposed to be." Incidentally, Malik, a senior hospitality industry professional, once audited a hotel while he was on his honeymoon.
For his efforts, the mystery shopping company that assigned him for the audit — through the hotel — takes care of the travel and hospitality bills apart from which he is also paid up to Rs 30,000 per audit.

Exec sedans: Rs 11-19L price segment but few takersTweet
In the past two financial years, India’s passenger vehicle sales have been on skid row, with sales dropping in virtually every segment
In the past two financial years, India's passenger vehicle sales have been on skid row, with sales dropping in virtually every segment. But one that took a particularly bad beating is the executive sedan segment — defined as five-seater sedans that are 4,700-5,000 mm in length and in the Rs 11-19-lakh price band.
From peak unit sales of 47,991 in 2010, sales of cars in this segment — which include Fiat's Linea, GM's Optra and Cruze, Hyundai's Elantra, Renault's Fluence, Skoda's Laura and Octavia, Toyota's Corolla and Volkswagen's Jetta — contracted to almost a third to 17,073 in 2013. The entire passenger vehicles market in contrast grew by 7.46% in this period.
And although the car market has seen a smart comeback — sales of passengers vehicles between April and September are up 4.25% from the year-ago period — the executive sedan slice of the pie is not keeping pace. "I don't see a revival in this segment in the near future," says Deepesh Rathore, cofounder of Emmaaa, an auto consultancy.
According to data from industry body Society for Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM), between April and September, domestic sales in the segment cumulatively stood at 10,151. In September, sales were a paltry 1,850, over a third of those coming from the new Toyota Corolla. Honda, once a dominant player in the segment, pulled the plug on Civic in 2012. Just seven out of the 12 car manufacturers in the country today have a presence in this segment. "We have no plans to get into the Civic segment. We had seen the squeeze coming sometime back and we had to prioritize our investments," says Gnaneswar Sen, senior V-P (sales and marketing), Honda Cars India Ltd.
There are two important reasons why the decline in this segment deserves attention. One, globally this segment holds enormous significance for auto MNCs across the board as this is the entry-level segment in big car markets like the US. In fact, Corolla has long been one of the top-selling models. Two, while the dip in this segment mirrors sluggish sales in the industry, it also reflects some broader changes that have been happening as far as consumers and the industry are concerned.
Identity Crisis
"This segment has fallen between two stools," says Homrazd Sorabjee , editor, Autocar India. The lower-level C-segment sedans (Honda City, Ford Fiesta, Nissan Sunny, among others) have increasingly upgraded themselves, offering 90% of what executive sedans offer at 70% of the price, adds a senior auto industry executive who did not want to be named. For example, the fourth-generation City — launched in January and starting at Rs 7.42 lakh for the petrol version (ex-showroom Delhi) — is plush, spacious and feature rich. Before that in 2011, Hyundai launched Verna, which, besides its fluidic design, was the first to offer an automatic diesel engine in this segment.
With the C-segment offering nearly the same as executive sedans, status-conscious buyers began looking for more luxury and premiumness. Examples: the Accord and Camry. Or, even beyond, to the luxury car makers such as Audi, BMW and Mercedes, which had lowered the entry threshold. For example, Audi will soon launch A3 sedans in the Rs 22-27-lakh bracket. These shifts are best exemplified by the strategy of Honda, which phased out the Civic to focus on segments below (the City) and above (the Accord) the executive sedans.
Changing Tastes
Almost around the same time, Indian car buyers began to develop a taste for sports utility vehicles (SUVs), which as a segment has grown rapidly — from 3.67 lakh units in 2011-12 to 5.25 lakh units in 2013-14. Today, it comprises a little over a fifth of the passenger vehicle industry, and there are 42 SUV models competing in the market. "At that price [of an executive sedan], customers are exploring different body styles in the MPV [multi-purpose vehicle] and SUV segment," says Sorabjee.
So, does the executive sedan segment have a future? Experts think so. "The decline [in the segment] has bottomed out," adds Sorabjee. As consumer demand picks up and the passenger car market matures in India, niches like executive sedans will start to gain traction. And experts expect more launches in this segment.
"Value addition and new launches in this segment were limited. I think that will change," says N Raja, senior V-P (sales and marketing), Toyota Kirloskar Motors. Already, with the launch of the new Corolla earlier this year, Toyota has seen its sales improve. Corolla's monthly sales have moved up from an average of 300 before the relaunch to 791 now. "We have a two-month waiting period. I expect our monthly sales to go up to 1,000 units soon," adds Raja.
On the supply side, there are multiple reasons why auto companies will continue to have a presence in this segment. One, this is the entry-level segment in mature markets like the US. Almost every MNC — from Toyota, Honda, Hyundai, VW to Ford and GM — has a strong model presence in this segment. Says Rakesh Srivastava, senior V-P (sales and marketing), Hyundai Motors India: "We are a strong player in this segment. And we have the models and the technology to maintain our strong presence." Also, for most auto companies, the presence in this segment does not require too much investment or attention. With the indigenization level typically around 60% in these models, costs and resources required to sustain a presence is low. So, while sales have petered out, it may still be early days to etch the epitaph of the executive sedan.

We are not a cheap car maker and will never be: Thierry LespiaucqTweet
Volkswagen Group aims to get solid market share in segments where it has a presence and be among the top three, says MD Thierry Lespiaucq.
The Volkswagen Group, which has revenues of $197 billion, is aiming for global market leadership in the passenger vehicle market by 2018. India contributes a mere 1% of VW's overall global sales. However, this could change as Europe's largest car maker is finally getting back into the investment mode in India.
Having worked for global majors like GM, Toyota and Renault-Nissan, Thierry Lespiaucq joined Volkswagen Group in 2004. He has spent a decade at VW, with the last four years in Mexico -which has incidentally, in a short span, become the largest importer of made-in-India Ventos. Lespiaucq took over as the MD of Volkswagen Group Sales India in May 2014. In an interview to ET, Lespiaucq says India will be among the top 10 markets for the VW Group, but clarifies immediately: "We are not a cheap manufacturer and will never be." Edited Excerpts:
What is your view on the position of VW Group in India?
The Volkswagen Group is amongst the biggest companies in the world and each of its brands is successful in various parts of the globe. But the group is relatively new to India. Skoda was the first to enter, followed by Audi, VW, Lamborghini and Porsche.
The Indian market has seen significant growth in the past and being a new player, we need to be humble.
As for individual brands of the group, Audi is now offering a more or less full range of products and has done extremely well in the luxury-car segment. Skoda has a very good history and the Volkswagen brand is just starting. A sharp drop in rupee and euro had forced the group to enter the pause mode. The visibility now is clear, we know exactly where we want to go and we will grow in India. So has your company released the pause button?
Yes. We have made investments. Our factory is now investing in assembly lines for engines. We are planning, models for the future, facelifts and modifications. The factory is also playing a strong role in exports, which is supporting the business. The volumes have now stabilised and it has formed a good basis to grow.
Is it a challenge that Skoda has the premium position in India, a space where VW leads globally?
Skoda did a good job and we are not going to drag them down. Volkswagen, on its part, will have to build its image here and bring it at a par with that in other parts of the world. What Volkswagen lacks are products, that is the only point, then everything will be balanced. Even today people consider Polo as a premium hatchback as it is well manufactured, safe, high on quality materials and consequently a position is created. We need to bring back products like Passat and Touareg to build our image. `
How do you ensure that group companies don't compete with each other?
That is difficult to answer. I have seen other groups try to manage a big portfolio of brands and many of them failed. My experience says, you need to leave your brands and give them freedom. However, in the background, we need to ensure that we are optimising our resources, but the brands have to be free to decide for themselves. I have never seen anything being enforced from one brand to the other. That is the key to our success.
What are the potential opportunities for the group?
This market is a huge A00 market (entry-level cars), we don't have a relevant `A00' offering, but there is a big A00 notchback (sub-four-meter se dan), which is quite a significant por tion of the market. We are thinking of doing something in that sub segment. So an A0 segment hatch (Polo), A0 notch (sub-4 meter se dan), and a segment notch (Vento).When we make growth plans for the group, we have to ask for small SUVs.
We also need to bring back the Passat into the Indian market. It may be a 2000 units market, it may not be big, but we need to use it as an image building exercise. As for Skoda, it already has quite an extensive portfolio. If exchange rates gets better, Skoda will get better. At the end of the day, the vision of this group is to be strong in the segments it decides to sell. So we will definitely forget about the segments where we are not strong. Don't expect me to say, we will be number 1 in India. For that you need to have an A00 hatchback, a cheap notchback and a cheap 'A0 SUV'. We are not a cheap manufacturer and will never be. The vision is to get solid  market share in the segments in which we have a presence, and be amongst the top three.
What is the future of the Lamborghini and Porsche brands?
We only have completely built imports. They face heavy taxes. In this market, they could really grow if there are free trade agreements (FTAs) with EU nations.

Modi continues to be king with impressive performanceOctober 19, 2014, 11:54 am IST TK Arun in Cursor | India , Times View | ET

The election results from Haryana and Maharashtra are positive affirmation of Modi’s continuing grip on the electorate’s imagination. The Modi wave has swept through Haryana, demolishing the Congress, the Indian National Lok Dal and two other parties that do not now even deserve to be listed by name. From a strength of 4 seats in the 90 member Haryana house, the BJP has now acquired a majority on its own, thanks primarily to Modi’s personal appeal. The BJP does not even have a recognisable leader in Haryana.
In Maharashtra, the BJP story is less compelling, although impressive. The BJP has emerged as the single largest party but falls short of a majority. In fact, if the non-BJP parties want to spite the BJP, they can form a government with Sena at the helm and the others in alliance or offering outside support.
But Modi has conclusively demonstrated that his judgment that the BJP has become more popular than the Shiv Sena and deserves to be the dominant partner in their alliance has been vindicated. The party’s vote share has doubled to about 32% and the credit legitimately goes to Modi than to any regional leader of the party.
However, the stridency of his attack on the Sena during the campaign shows that Modi believed that the BJP would get a majority on its own. That gamble has not paid off. Now, he would have to make that phone call to Uddhav Thackeray to make peace and form the government it is theirs to form together in Maharashtra. The fact that the Shiv Sena’s Anand Geete continues to be a member of the Union government shows that neither the BJP nor the Sena has any hostility towards the other sharp enough to rule out coming together once again in Maharashtra.
The Maharashtra result is notable for the Congress retaining about 50 seats, even in its current state of being completely discredited, leaderless at the state-level and at the Centre and wholly clueless about how to revive itself after being knocked out in the Lok Sabha elections. This means that a Congress-free India, which the BJP has declared to be its medium-term goal, will be quite tough.
For the BJP, its dependence on one man, their mascot, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has increased. In the process, it has emerged the largest party in Maharastra, broken the dominance of caste in Haryana politics and positioned itself as a party still on the ascendant.
It is time for the government to Centre to turn its mind to taking the tough decisions such as slashing subsidies and boosting investment in the economy, without having to worry about short-term political costs.

Assembly verdict 2014: Era of coalition politics here to stayOctober 19, 2014, 1:25 pm IST Abheek Barman in Folk Theorem | India , Times View | ET

In her darkest hour, hounded by political opponents after the Emergency, Indira Gandhi used to refer to Rabindranath Tagore’s 1905 song, ‘Ekla Chalo Rey.’ It was a call to the Congress faithful to go it alone without friends or allies. It might have worked for her then, but in contemporary Indian politics, the formula isn’t going to work anytime soon.
At least, that’s the verdict from Maharashtra, India’s second most electorally important state after Uttar Pradesh. Till noon on Sunday, preliminary lead and trends showed the BJP, which had broken a 25 year old alliance with Shiv Sena, would not be able to form a government on its own.
Conversely, it also showed that Congress could have formed the government, given the BJP-Sena split, if its alliance with Sharad Pawar’s NCP had not broken up. Every party has to learn a lesson from this. The era of coalition politics, which the Narendra Modi ‘wave’ was to have swamped, is again likely to be back in vogue.
This was first hinted at in Bihar, where during bye elections in the recent past, rivals Lalu Yadav, Nitish Kumar and the Congress joined hands to win handsomely.
After trading insults and contesting fiercely against each other, it is hard to say how the BJP and Sena will patch up – as they must – to form a government in Maharashtra. Someone will have to swallow their pride in public and that is a tough ask in politics. But given the fluidity of Maharashtra politics today, anything is possible.
Even something as weird as a NCP government supported from outside by the Congress and Sena cannot be ruled out. The NCP’s politics has always been transactional, the Congress might argue that it is trying to keep the BJP from power and the Sena might cite the insults heaped on its supreme boss by the BJP as the reason to do so. The Sena will, of course, demand a share of power.
The result in Haryana, a much smaller state, where the BJP seems to be coming to power on its own steam was more predictable. The public perception was that the Bhupinder Hooda regime that had ruled for 10 years was ridden by graft and hand-in-glove with builder lobbies. The Chautala clan, descendants of the once-powerful Devi Lal, is handicapped by their past: in and out of jail, the patriarch has been politically hobbled.
The other clans of Bansi Lal and Bhajan Lal are in steeper decline, as their descendants struggle to maintain a foothold in politics. But Haryana also proves that the logic of alliances can triumph all so-called waves.
The Election Commission’s preliminary vote share numbers show that an alliance between the Congress and the Chautala’s INLD, say, could easily have routed the BJP in this election. Realists might say that this is a tough task – the egos of Hooda and Chautala are too big to fit in one room.
But these are problems which the top leaders of parties are supposed to predict and resolve. The Gandhis, at the helm of the Congress, were strangely passive and unresponsive to the party’s demands in the run up to the elections. Better strategy and a little more flexibility with potential allies could have turned the current outcomes on their heads. J&K and Jharkhand will go to polls soon. Let’s see if parties wake up to the logic of alliances.

Its a vote for change not for Narendra ModiOctober 19, 2014, 12:57 pm IST Rajesh Ramachandran in Polibelly | India , Times View | ET

The Maharashtra polls have proven beyond any doubt that there is no surge of game-changing goodwill in favour of any one political person, any longer. Had there been a Modi wave or tsunami, BJP should have won a comfortable majority or, at the very least, it should have come close to the half way mark of 145.
Congress had conceded defeat before the polls had begun with the half-hearted campaign never taking off. Sharad Pawar’s NCP had ensured that there would be no alliance with Congress, thereby facilitating a four-cornered contest that favoured BJP. And Shiv Sena leader Uddhav Thackeray was no match for Prime Minister Narendra Modi nor were the Sena’s strategists, in the absence of Bal Thackeray, a patch on the BJP-RSS combine.
Yet, Modi’s 25-30 election campaign rallies, the most done by any leader in these assembly polls, could not take the party to simple majority. So, the results only reflect the mood of the people of the state after 15 years of Congress-NCP rule, mired in allegations of corruption. People wanted change and they got it.
Just five months ago, Sena and BJP had won 42 out of 48 seats in the Lok Sabha polls and this should have translated itself into about 260 MLAs in the 288-seat strong assembly. BJP, which had won 23 out of the 24 Lok Sabha constituencies, should have retained about 130 seats in the assembly on its own. But both Sena and BJP could not repeat their performances in the Lok Sabha polls proving once again that the mood of the nation has changed in the last four months.
Sure, the voters have voted out the Congress-NCP government. But the defeat is not as comprehensive as it was, say, in Rajasthan or Delhi last year or Haryana now. In fact the Maharashtra defeat of the Congress-NCP combine is no endorsement of a Modi wave, but a big swing in favour of the most viable political alternative. And if Sena and BJP had stayed together, they would have swept the polls repeating the earlier Lok Sabha performance.
In Haryana the only viable option was BJP, not Congress with the Vadra-Hooda scandals and not definitely a party led by someone in jail for corruption. When corruption is the poll plank, the corrupt have to be voted out and the Haryana poll results only signify the success of the anti-corruption election campaign. Probably, even AAP, as self-proclaimed anti-corruption crusaders, could have made a mark in the Haryana assembly elections had they contested polls.
It always feels good to say, ‘I told you so.’ After BJP’s dismal performance in the assembly by-polls in Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Gujarat, I had written on September 16 that the Modi wave had ebbed. http://blogs.economictimes.indiatimes.com/Polibelly/modi-wave-is-over/

Up to it Try these questions for admission to Oxford Universityprint
It’s considered one of the toughest universities to get into, and admission interviews at the University of Oxford invariably challenge potential students to think on their feet, think independently and laterally, and show an ability to apply theory.
The university has released some sample questions that may be asked at interviews to select students for undergraduate courses in the next academic year from September 2015.
Oxford is one of few universities who interview all applicants before admission, and end up finally admitting a fraction of those applying.
The interviews are an important part of Oxford’s admissions process, designed to give candidates the chance to show their real ability and potential.
Tutors challenge potential students with questions that may seem strange to some, but help bring out their potential. Many applicants go through mock interviews to prepare for the rigorous questions — and some questions can challenge the ablest of minds.
 
Samina Khan, acting director of Undergraduate Admissions at Oxford, said, “Interviews are not about reciting what you already know — they are designed to give candidates a chance to show their real ability and potential, which means candidates will be encouraged to use their knowledge and apply their thinking to new problems in ways that will both challenge them and allow them to shine”.
She added, “They are an academic conversation in a subject area between tutors and candidate, similar to the undergraduate tutorials which current Oxford students
attend every week.”
For example, students applying to study Biological Sciences might be asked why it matters if tigers become extinct, potential History students are asked to discuss whether the word ‘political’ has different meanings in different contexts, and applicants looking to study Materials Science may be asked to calculate the temperature in a hot air balloon necessary to lift an elephant.

Real gas price for companies to be $6.2/unitReal gas price for companies to be $6.2 per unit

 Industrial consumers will actually pay about $6.17 per unit for domestic gas instead of $5.6 announced by the government on Saturday because of changed parameter for determining heating value in the new formula.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
NEW DELHI: Industrial consumers will actually pay about $6.17 per unit for domestic gas instead of $5.6 announced by the government on Saturday because of changed parameter for determining heating value in the new formula.
The government on Saturday announced a new pricing formula on the basis of recommendations of a panel of secretaries. The new formula made several changes in the mechanism suggested by a panel under C Rangarajan that was approved by the UPA government .
The key change in the new formula is a shift from net calorific value (NCV) to gross calorific value (GCV) for calculating the price for each unit of gas. Calorific value is the quantity of heat produced by burning one unit of fuel at constant pressure and at zero-degree temperature.
Gross calorific value assumes that moisture present in fuel turns into vapour, which adds to heating during combustion. Net calorific value is the actual heating users get and assumes that there is heat loss from moisture turning into vapour during combustion. As a result, the heating property under GCV is higher than NCV and entails a 10% lower price for each unit of fuel.
The existing gas price of $4.2 per unit is on the basis of NCV. The gas sale purchase agreements between sellers and buyers specify the price on the basis NCV. Now that the government has changed the heat value parameter to GCV, the actual price on the ground would be higher by 10%, or $6.17 per unit, marking nearly 45% increase against 33% indicated in $5.61 announced by the government.
TOI had on June 24 first reported that the government was looking at a price of $5.5-6.8 per unit.
Gas sellers are now expected to change the pertinent terms in tune with the new formula. "It is not a complicated thing (to change the heat value parameter) in the agreements. On the ground it would mean broadly adding 10% to the new price," an executive, who deals with such matters for a gas seller said on condition of anonymity.
The fact, however, is that even under the GCV regime, the new price would be much lower than $8.4, or double the present price, estimated on the basis of Rangarajan formula.
Oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan had on Saturday said PM Narendra Modi made it clear that common man should be protected from any major impact from the gas price hike.
Pradhan said CNG and PNG suppliers (such as Indraprastha Gas Delhi) would see how much they can absorb, gas transporter GAIL would look at pruning transportation charge wherever possible and states would be urged to lower taxes to avoid any sharp rise in CNG or PNG prices.
The new price appears acceptable to power and fertilizer industries also. Though the cost of power from gas-fired stations is estimated to rise by 45-55 paise per unit, the impact on overall tariffs would be minimal since such type of plants account for about 7% of generation capacity.

Sensex surges on BJP's election win; top 20 trading ideas

Narendra Modi
(BJP has got a majority in…)
NEW DELHI: The S&P BSE Sensex rose as much as 409 points in trade on Monday, after the government announced slew of reform measures such as diesel price deregulation and hike in natural gas price, post victory in recently held elections in Maharashtra & Haryana.
The BJP has got a majority in Haryana and will form the government for the first time in the state. It has emerged as the single largest party in Maharashtra but will have to patch-up with old ally Shiv Sena to form a government.
According to experts, after securing majority in both the states, the Narendra Modi government has more room now to press forward with reforms, beginning with the winter session of Parliament and the FY16 budget thereafter
"The market has given a thumbs-up as the BJP has won Haryana State assembly polls and is the single largest party in Maharashtra. The result would add heft to the already formidable political weight of the Prime Minister," says Ajay Bodke, Head- Investment Strategy & Advisory, Prabhudas Lilladher.
"Markets hope that this strengthening of his hand would embolden Mr. Modi to roll-out aggressive reforms that had enthused global & domestic investors into driving up the Indian equity market to dizzying heights this calendar year," he added.
Tracking the momentum, the 50-share Nifty index also managed to reclaim its crucial psychological level of 7900, supported by gains in oil & gas, capital goods, auto and banking stocks.
At 1:07 p.m.; the 30-share index was at 26,402.31, up 293.78 points or 1.13 per cent. It touched a high of 26,517.90 and a low of 26,399.84 in trade today.
The Nifty was at 7877.80, up 98.10 points or 1.26 per cent. It touched a high of 7,905.95 and a low of 7,872.20 in trade today.

Sehwag  Yuvraj wont make World Cup squad: GangulyTweet
0
New Delhi: Former Indian captain Sourav Ganguly said Saturday that age has caught up with dashing batsmen Virender Sehwag and Yuvraj Sigh, ruling out the duo from making the cut in the team that will try to defend their World Cup title. The tournament will be co-hosted by Australia and New Zealand from Feb 14 to Mar 29.
"They were great players, one of the best I have seen but time catches up with everyone and so is the case with Viru and Yuvi," Ganguly said at the Aaj Tak conclave Salaam Cricket here.
Ganguly added that time is running out for the two veterans to stage a comeback into the team.
"It will be difficult for Sehwag and Yuvraj to play in this World Cup because the tournament is so near and Dhoni won't make many changes in the side," added the former left handed batsman who led India to the 2003 World Cup final.
Ganguly, who captained India in 147 One-Day Internationals (ODI), feels that India's performance in the upcoming quadrennial event will depend on how Virat Kohli and Suresh Raina perform.
"Virat has done well in overseas conditions. He has played match-winning innings in South Africa and Australia. Lot will depend on him. If he does well India will put up a good show. Raina has done very well recently. He has been consistent but it will also be a challenge for him to carry that form in Australia," concluded the 42-year-old.

Chandni Chowk: Delhi s favourite for festive shoppingChandni Chowk: Delhi's Mughal era heritage bazaar a favourite for festive shopping

From Kinari Bazaar and Dariba Kalan, to Bhagirath Palace and Khari Baoli, the hectic shopping spree at the different markets of Chandni Chowk starts more than a fortnight before Diwali
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
It's Diwali season and time again for frenzied shoppers — not just from the capital, but from National Capital Region (NCR) and even neighbouring states of Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Haryana — to flock to Chandni Chowk, Delhi's Mughal era heritage bazaar that is touted as one of Asia's largest wholesale markets.
From Kinari Bazaar for blingy embellishments and Dariba Kalan for jewellery to suit all pockets, to Bhagirath Palace for fairy lights and Khari Baoli for dry fruit, the hectic shopping spree at the different markets of Chandni Chowk starts more than a fortnight before Diwali and extends right up to the year-end wedding season.
"Traditionally, it has been business worth thousands of crores of rupees a day during the Diwali season," says Pawan Kumar, a Chandni Chowk trader and president of the Federation of Sadar Bazar Traders Association. "But this year we are facing a big problem of import shipments [of Diwali goods] from China being delayed due to red tape. They are very slow in reaching us here in Delhi," adds Kumar, who is a big importer from China.
The renovation and redevelopment work in Chandni Chowk, under the aegis of the urban development ministry, is the other obvious problem. "Recently, the arterial road has been dug up and people find it very difficult to come here with their vehicles," laments Sushant Jain , whose family owns Ghantewala Confectioners, a traditional mithai shop that dates back to 1790.
ggest that consumers — hunting for everything from traditional mithai to Chinese lights — have given up on Chandni Chowk. Bhagirath Palace, for instance, a half-a-kilometre stretch with over 2,500 registered shops selling only lights and lighting equipment, is packed. "Chinese LEDs are the hottest selling items this year," says Rajesh Rana , who owns three shops in the area. For his part, Rana uses the opportunity to draw a rather politically incorrect parallel between the Chinese lights and the three Japanese scientists who won the Nobel Prize in physics for LED technology.
About a kilometre away, at the fireworks and crackers market behind the iconic Jama Masjid, Chinese goods are not popular. Almost all the 50 shops in the area carry signage boycotting Chinese fireworks; here all supplies come from Sivakasi in Tamil Nadu.
Business at Khari Baoli, the traditional spices market near the famous Fatehpuri Masjid, is slowly picking up and Akshay Kumar , who owns a wholesale and retail outlet here, hopes that in the last few days before Diwali, there will be more people visiting the market to buy gift baskets for friends and family. He is worried that the high prices may deter buyers. They don't seem to be.

India needs a  quinoa revolution  to solve malnutritionWhy India needs a 'quinoa revolution' to solve malnutrition, diabetes and cardiac problems

Hollywood stars glorified it, NASA de-mystified it. It is now up to India to embrace the healthy food and check malnutrition

By Srinivasa Rao
You should develop a project that can make a big impact." So said Narendra Modi , the then chief minister of Gujarat, in our one- to-one meeting, as we chatted about various topics, including alleviating malnutrition in India. My friends in Gujarat had enabled this lengthy thought-provoking discussion with him.
Ever since, I have been based in my true home India, with only short visits to my other home in New York. I started exploring all possible ideas in the realms of both technology and food, with the single-minded focus of reducing malnutrition. At the suggestion of my physician daughter, my wife, also a physician, introduced quinoa, a grain crop and a species of goosefoot grown primarily for its edible seeds, as a healthy food in our cuisine.
It took an 'aha' moment for me to start looking at its value in the context of alleviating malnutrition. That discovery led me to Bolivia, the mecca of quinoa. I met many Bolivians to understand the grain, science, production, processing and its impact on nutrition and economy.
Time for Next Revolution
The White Revolution in India made the country milk-sufficient and the largest producer in the world while generating rural employment. India needs another such revolution to reduce malnutrition. India's malnutrition is over 45% among children and 70% among pregnant women. It is eroding the productivity of the country by 4-6% of GDP.
Since India's Independence, four revolutions — wheat, milk, pharma and IT — put us on the path of prosperity. But healthcare remains a missed opportunity alongside manufacturing, tourism and nuclear energy.
Today, India tops global charts in malnutrition and also diabetes. Excess carbohydrates lead to diabetes. Lack of adequate food or inadequate nutritive value in the food causes malnutrition. Quinoa could be the silver bullet that addresses both these issues.
What is Quinoa?
Quinoa is a seed of plant Chenopodium quinoa and is spinach's close cousin. It has been cultivated in the Andean regions of South America for more than 7,000 years. Colonization by Europeans suppressed the crop. It took two scientists at National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) — Dr Greg Schlick and Dr David L Bubenheim — to put quinoa back on the map when they concluded in their research that "quinoa has desirable food qualities for long-term space missions — high protein and desirable amino acid composition".
The year 2013 was declared as the International Year of Quinoa by Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations as a recognition of the "crop's resilience, adaptability and its potential contribution in the fight against hunger and malnutrition". FAO hopes that quinoa is destined to carry the task of both boosting food security and providing economic growth to small-scale farmers as the crop does not make much demand on soil fertility, water and labour. The demand for quinoa increased 18 fold in the last decade with annual production scaling 100,000 tonnes. It did not hurt when some Hollywood celebrities revealed that quinoa was their "superfood."
But thanks to such revelations and the increased demand, the price has multiplied seven fold to $10 a kg. Apart from its nutritive values, it is proven that quinoa has the ability to uplift farmers from poverty. Bolivian government officials, scientists and businessmen told me that reverse migration from cities to rural areas is happening so as to grow royal quinoa.
A Superfood
Quinoa's average protein content (15%) surpasses that of wheat (12%) and rice (6%). It has high-quality protein and wellbalanced amino acids with vitamins and minerals, iron in particular. Quinoa is gluten free and good for people with digestive disorders. Dr AA Dixit's (Department of Sociomedical Sciences, Columbia University, New York) team reported that "quinoa replacement with one serving of white rice in diet can prevent obesity and cardiovascular disease". It can be consumed like a staple food, replacing wheat or rice, unlike other protein-rich foods.
'Big Project' for the PM
Even if India grows quinoa at 1% of annual production of rice and wheat, it will be 2 million tonnes. Its economic value can be $10 billion (Rs 60,000 crore) at current prices. India needs several million tonnes of quinoa a year to meet the requirement of its diabetics, cardiac patients and malnourished children. This can be another cash crop for millions of farmers. India has 130 agro-climatic zones and several of them can be suitable for quinoa.
Today there is enough data to emphatically claim that quinoa can be 'The Big Project' for making a 'Big Impact'. It has the potential to be the next revolution and the solution for malnutrition, diabetes and cardiac problems. While doing so, it can help small farmers and boost commercial exports. With so much at stake, can India afford to miss the quinoa bus?

(Under its flagship National…)
NEW DELHI: Government is planning to link the universal health assurance scheme for providing medical treatment to all citizens with Aadhaar number to check ghost beneficiaries and fraudulent claims.
Under its flagship National Health Assurance Mission (NHAM) which will be launched shortly, government has planned to cover the entire population.
"The government has planned to seed Aadhaar numbers with its universal health programme NHAM. The experts think that this would help in keeping a check on any fraudulent insurance claims or ghost beneficiaries under the scheme," a source privy to the development said.
As per experts, since Aadhaar provides proof of identity of person based on biometrics details including iris scan and finger prints, there will be remote chance of fraudulent insurance claims after seeding the unique identification number with the scheme.
According to the source, the idea of seeding Aadhaar numbers with the universal health coverage for all citizens in India is likely to be approved as government wants to launch a fool proof insurance cover.
The highlights of the proposed NHAM include 50 essential drugs with a package of diagnostics and about 30 AYUSH drugs to be made available to all citizens at government hospitals and health centres across the country.
A package of preventive and positive health information will also be made available to all citizens and the health insurance will be a built-in feature of the mission.
As per media reports, the government now wants to provide Aadhaar number to all prisoners.
Besides there are plans to use Aadhaar for direct transfer of various benefits including fuel and food subsidies into the beneficiaries' bank accounts.
Under Aadhaar projects, around 69.54 crore unique identification numbers have been issued by the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI).
Government has approved the Phase-V of Aadhaar project which allows it to enrol residents in four more densely populated states comprising Uttar Pradesh, Bihar , Uttarakhand and Chhattisgarh , having population of around 40 crore.
Now the government wants UIDAI to generate Aadhaar numbers for the entire population by June next year.

Go church-hopping in Velha GoaYahoo Lifestyle/ThinkStock - The Se Cathedral is symbolic of Portuguese power and pride
By R Niranjan Das
A lovely morning ride on my hired Royal Enfield took me from Anjuna Beach to Velha Goa, the Portuguese name for Old Goa and one commonly used by people of that region. From Panjim, along with the Enfield, I had the Mandovi River for company through villages like Ribander, until I reached the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Old Goa. As I rode from Panjim, the landscape, houses, people and everything changed. Though crowded, Velha Goa with its cathedrals, churches, chapels and convents still holds an old world charm and the prominence of Christianity cannot be ignored.
Basilica of Bom Jesus, Velha Goa
Built by the Bijapur Sultans in the 15th century, the city was colonized from the 16th to the 18th century by the Portuguese before they abandoned it in the 18th century after it was hit by an epidemic of plague. Its beautiful structures, though, remain.
Basilica de Bom Jesus in Velha Goa.
Basilica De Bom Jesus, with its imposing facade and baroque architecture, stands tall. It was the first of the churches I visited. The basilica’s dark colour and imposing size set it apart. Though it might seem dilapidated at first look, with its reddish brown colour, ornamented pillars and magnificent carvings, the structure stands rock solid even after 400 years. Dedicated to Infant Jesus, this grand church also treasures the mortal remains of St Francis Xavier, which are taken out for public viewing once every ten years. The interior of the basilica has a lot of art, murals and numerous altars to captivate visitors.
As I came out of the Basilica, a few meters away stood the white Se Cathedral of Santa Catarina. Dedicated to St Catherine of Alexandria, it was once considered the largest cathedral in Asia. Built in Portuguese architecture, it was constructed to portray the power and fame of the Portuguese. The cathedral also houses many altars and paintings and the large Golden Bell.
From Se Cathedral I moved to the Church of St Francis of Assisi, which has baroque-style architecture with beautiful frescoes on the walls and ceilings. The church also houses some brilliant 17th century wall paintings. Next to it is an archaeological museum displaying ancient statues and portraits.
Half a kilometer away is the beautiful Viceroy's Arch next to Mandovi quay. Built in the 16th century, the arch must have been witness to thousands of people landing on Goan shores. Near the arch is the Gateway of the palace of Adil Shah. Built before the arrival of the Portuguese, it is all that survives of the palace.
St Cajetan Church in Velha Goa. From the gateway I walked towards the immaculate Church of St Cajetan, built in Corinthian architectural style using laterite blocks with two towers on either side of the main dome. The interiors of the church are neat and its altar is one of the most beautiful ones I have ever seen.
I walked further towards the Basilica of Bom Jesus. As if from nowhere appeared the Chapel of St Catherine, which appeared to be abandoned and dilapidated. Alfonso de Albuquerque built it in the early 16th century when he took over possession of Goan territory.
In a different direction but not far away from de Bom Jesus are the Towers of St Augustine church. Built in the early 16th century this church was over a period of time abandoned and neglected, which led to the fall of the vault and the body of the church in mid-19th century. By the mid 20th century every part of the church had collapsed except for one of the four towers and this, today, is the sole remnant.
The sole standing tower of St Augustine Church Beside the Augustine tower is the Convent of Santa Monica and a Christian museum, which is definitely worth a visit.
A few meters away from Santa Monica and the Augustine tower is the Church of Our Lady of Rosary. Built in the 16th century it has a mix of Renaissance and Gothic architecture. The view of the Mandovi River from the church is spectacular.
There are many more churches, museums and other structures in Old Goa to excite the traveller but this piece covers only the most-visited ones.

Digital will be multi-billion dollar busine...Digital
(The company is winning market…)
Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is looking to gain clients in Latin America and expand its platforms and digital business to power future growth, CEO N Chandrasekaran told ET in an interview. The company is winning market share from competitors in the traditional application data management business, while winning new projects in digital, he said. Edited excerpts:
What are the next big areas for growth for TCS ? Which new businesses should we expect to touch $1 billion first?
The way to look at digital is that it's a multi-billion dollar business, but there will be different components like big data analytics, cloud, customer experience, analytics at a vertical level, there will be Internet of Things, all of these will make up the digital business.
In the early days of e-commerce we had an offering called e-business — which had business intelligence, CRM (customer relationship management) and things like that — and as that grew, each of them contributed billions of dollars. So, from a growth perspective, Japan is already at $500 million plus. Hopefully, in two to three years, it will go to $1 billion. Digital will be a multibillion dollar business, but which part of digital will reach a billion first, I won't say. But on a combined basis, it will be a multi-billion dollar business.
Tata Consultancy Services has been investing in platforms around new technologies in digital and the Internet of Things. How are they performing?
All our platforms are growing, but they are growing in the $10-20 million range. So, if I give the numbers, they will be very small. We have to wait for them to scale.
Will Tata Consultancy Services crack newer technologies through acquisitions or will you build your own base?
Tata Consultancy Services will do both. There is a core technology and we use these technologies to build platforms to serve an industry or a horizontal. So, we will continue to invest in and build those platforms. That is not to say we will never buy, if there is the right opportunity, we will buy one or two. But otherwise we have invested and built those platforms, we have to scale those platforms.

Revival plan on cards for gas-based power pl...Essar Power
(Developers of about 16,000-mw…)
NEW DELHI: After the big-ticket oil sector reforms, the government is turning to the power sector to help banks. Developers of about 16,000-mw stranded gas-based power plants will be able to service their debt, if a joint proposal of the power and oil ministries is approved by the Union Cabinet.
The government proposes to increase the fixed cost of the gas-based plants at Rs 1.10 per unit of electricity while keeping the tariff at Rs 5.50 per unit, which will allow the operating companies to meet their financial obligations. This will prevent the idling projects, put up at an investment of Rs 64,000 crore, from turning non-performing assets.
The proposal will benefit power plants of Lanco Infratech , Essar Power , Reliance Power , GVK Group and GMR Energy , among others. The fixed cost cap has been raised from Rs 0.85 per unit planned earlier by the two ministries. The proposal has been made after major power companies conveyed their willingness to the government to forego part of their fixed costs.
The fixed cost of Rs 1.1 per unit are much less than the actual average fixed cost of about Rs 2 per unit that the companies incur in operating the projects. Fixed costs increase when the projects are under-utilised.
"We plan to allow companies to recover around Rs 1.1 per unit as fixed cost from sale of electricity from the gas-based projects. This will help in capping the overall tariff from gas-based stations at Rs5.5 per unit while enabling the companies to repay banks," a senior government official said.
As per the proposal being prepared jointly by the ministries of oil and power to bailout power plants idling due to acute scarcity of domestic gas, power companies will be supplied domestic and imported gas enough to operate their plants at 40 per cent capacity.
Any additional gas produced in the country in the next four years will be supplied to the power stations along with imported liquefied natural gas. State-run GAIL India will be the pool operator. The gas will be supplied at an average 'pooled' price of domestic and imported gas, while the electricity tariff from the plants will be supplied at Rs 5.5 per unit to power distribution companies.
The scheme, to be put before the Cabinet Committee of Economic Affairs for approval, also proposes to subsidise firms operating the gas-based power stations from the National Clean Energy Fund made of a cess collected from coal miners. The plan includes simplifying procedure for availing customs duty waiver on LNG and scrapping value added tax and central sales tax collected by states.
Presently, there is a 5.15 per cent customs duty on imports as most developers are unable to avail the waiver benefits due to technical problems. Value added tax varies from 0-26 per cent in various states. The central sales tax is levied by the central government but collected by states. The government plans to subsidise gasbased plants located in states that have agreed for the waiver.
Gas transporters Gail India and Reliance Gas Transportation Infrastructure Ltd will be asked to take 20 per cent cut in pipeline tariff which will help them improve utilisation of pipelines. GAIL will also be asked to halve marketing margin to $0.1 per million British thermal units. The government has already appointed a committee to examine a debt restructuring and moratorium scheme for stranded power plants. The committee headed by India Infrastructure Finance Company Ltd chief Santosh Nayyar and constituting officials of various banks will submit its report to the government by November 7.

Gas price: ONGC to profit by over Rs 4000 crorePrint
>
New Delhi, Oct 19 (IANS) In a first reaction from the exploration industry to the new natural gas price announced Saturday, state-run oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) said the company stood to increase its profits annually by Rs.2,000 crore.
"Every $1 rise in gas price increases our revenues by Rs.4,000 crore and net profit by Rs.2,350 crore," ONGC chairman D.K. Sarraf told reporters here.
For the five months of current fiscal, ONGC stands to benefit about Rs.1,950 crore, while a $2 increase in gas price will result in the company's net profits going up by about Rs.4,700 crore, Sarraf added.
The government Saturday announced that the price from Nov 1 will be calculated on the heat value gas will generate on gross calorific value (GCV) basis.
As per the GCV methodology, the current $4.2 per unit, which is on net calorific value (NCV) basis, will rise to $6.1.
Sarraf is also hopeful of further hikes to gas rates that will be revised every six months, with the next revision being on April 1.
In its presentation to the Committee of Secretaries tasked to revise the gas price, ONGC had said it needs $6-7.15 per unit to break even on gas it plans to produce from its KG basin blockand a price of between $5.25-17.80 per unit to break even on production planned from seven small fields in the western offshore.
"As per the formulation approved by the CCEA, upward revision in gas prices will be approximately 75 percent less as compared to the price arrived at using Rangarajan formula," said a Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs release announcing the revised formula.
Industry, which was quick to welcome diesel deregulation as a highly progressive move, has generally not reacted to the new gas price, because it has been asking for at least its doubling to a little over $8 per unit.
"The price of fuel products such as diesel should reflect the true market value and this would also encourage all users to economise on their diesel consumption and hence align with the objective of promoting environmentally sustainable growth," Sidharth Birla, president of industry chamber FICCI, said in a statement.
Regarding the new price applying to gas from the Reliance Industries' (RIL) KG basin fields in the eastern offshore, the cabinet decided that as the matter was under arbitration, RIL would be paid the earlier price of $4.2 per unit till the shortfall quantity of gas is made good.
The arbitration concerns the penalty imposed by the oil ministry on the company for failing to meet output targets from the RIL-led consortium's D-1 and D-3 fields in the KG-D6 eastern offshore block to the extent of 1.9 trillion cubic feet of gas.

New Delhi: Congress workers staged a protest outside the party's office in Delhi on Sunday appealing to party vice-president Rahul Gandhi to take the initiative of bringing his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra into politics.
Carrying posters which read 'Priyanka lao Congress bachao' (Bring Priyanka save Congress)', the protestors demanded that Priyanka should enter into active politics and support her brother Rahul.
"All Congress workers today appeal to Rahul Gandhi that he should take the initiative of bringing Priyanka Gandhi into politics. It's important to get her into politics so that she can support Rahul and refrain Prime Minister Narendra Modi from turning his dream of a Congress free India into reality," said a Congress worker.
He added that the Congress resides in the heart of every individual, and added that it needs a direction which should be guided by Priyanka and Rahul.
Moreover, reacting to the early trends of assembly elections which show the Congress losing in both Maharashtra and Haryana, he said, "Seeing the early trends, Prime Minister Modi's dream seems to come to reality, but we need to stop that. I can assure you that had Priyanka fought from Maharashtra and Haryana then these wouldn't have been the results and they would have been in Congress' favour."
The Congress worker further said that if Rahul Gandhi doesn't listen to their appeal, they will continue to protest and stage 'dharnas' all over the country. (Agencies)

ONGC, HPCL rally upto 9% post gas price hike, diesel deregulation; RIL in red
ECONOMICTIMES.COM Oct 20, 2014, 03.40PM IST
(State-run oil explorers…)
NEW DELHI: State-run oil companies such as ONGC, HPCL rose over 8 per cent in intraday trade on Monday, after the Modi government raised natural gas prices to $5.6 per unit from $4.2 which will significantly boost the earnings of ONGC and deregulated diesel.
However, private explorers such as Reliance Industries may be disappointed because the new gas price will not be applicable to RIL' KG-D6 production, as expected, because the company is in arbitration with the government.
Reacting to the news, ONGC rose as much as 8.7 per cent, followed by Oil India Ltd which was up 5 per cent in trade. State-run oil explorers such as BPCL rose 7.2 per cent, HPCL rose 8.7 per cent to hit its fresh 52-week high of Rs 534 and IOC which rose 7.9 per cent.
State-run oil & gas companies such as IOC traded 6.1 per cent higher at Rs 388, BPCL was up 6.7 per cent to Rs 709.80 and HPCL traded 7.4 per cent higher at Rs 528.
Reliance Industries slipped as much as 2.7 per cent in trade, but managed to recoup losses and was just trading 0.7 per cent lower at Rs 931. It hit a low of Rs 912.75 and a high of Rs 941.80 in trade today.
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley over the weekend said that the price from November 1 will be $5.61 per mmBtu on heat value the fuel will generate on gross calorific value (GCV) basis.
The new price will be determined on Gross Calorific Value (GCV) basis and reviewed every six months against the quarterly price changes approved by the previous UPA government based on Rangarajan committee recommendation.
The revised gas price would be applicable to all gas produced from nomination fields given to ONGC and OIL India, New Exploration and Licensing Policy (NELP) blocks, some pre-NELP blocks and coal-bed methane blocks.
State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp will rake in about Rs 1,950 crore in additional profit this fiscal from the 46 per cent rise in natural gas prices announced by the government, ET reported.
According to analysts, announcements made by the government are beneficial for ONGC as well as for Oil India Ltd, while neutral for Reliance Industries (RIL).
RIL will get the old price unless it makes up for the shortfall in gas production, for which the oil ministry blames the company. However, Reliance attributes the decline to geological reasons, said the ET report.
"ONGC / OIL are preferred picks on the back of these announcements," CLSA said in a report. However, these developments are neutral for Reliance Industries, added the report.

Ten management and entrepreneurship lessons from Virender Sehwag

Anil Kumble
(Son of a grain merchant,…)
NEW DELHI: Son of a grain merchant, Virender Sehwag, 35 is now known nicknamed as the Nawab of Najafgarh with several cricket world records under his belt. At a TieCon 2014 event held in the capital, last evening, MakeMyTrip founder Deep Kalra interviewed star cricketer Virender Sehwag on his journey from the bylanes of Najafgarh to the Indian cricket team. Here are 10 management and entrepreneurship lessons from Virender Sehwag, 35, drawn from his cricket career and beyond. Excerpts from the talk:
1. On managing tough people: "If there are people who can't be managed its best to leave them alone. They can work wonders for your company or team if not managed. There are people who don't like to be micro-managed. I think am one of them."
2. On lean patches and failures in life: "In hard times and lean patches of life, run the company if not for yourself but for your loved ones. That's what I did in my lean patch. After return from a match in Bangladesh, when I was going through a lean form, I would run daily from about 11 am-2 pm for two months. I lost weight and also spent time with my wife. Do what you really love to do and things would definitely fall back in place."
3.On his journey to the Indian team: "My father would ask me why do I travel 45 km every day to Ferozshah Kotla from Najafgarh in Delhi heat with that big cricket kit. I would tell him give me some time and I will show you what I can achieve. When I started playing for India, people would say see its Sehwag's father walking. He felt real proud."
4. On his entrepreneurial venture - Sehwag International School - "I am playing cricket as I can invest back in my school when I can and am able. My father told me once to build a school where poor kids can study for free. Am working towards that. I am speaking at this event also to get marketing mileage for that venture."
5. On how to handle a negative person: "...Just walk away. I prefer not to stay around such people. I stay away from negativity as far as I can."
6. On his best captain: " Anil Kumble ," "Because he let me be - just me. And showed full confidence in me. One evening he came to my room and told me and (Gautam) Gambhir, play freely as I am with you and nobody can touch you for the next few test matches. It was a big thing for a captain to come to my room and tell me that. "
7. On Playing with Sachin. "I felt I was playing with a 'lion'. Opening with him instilled confidence in me. It also helped me score as the bowlers would only focus on getting Sachin out. Nobody would focus on me!"
8. On sledging: "Once Michael Clarke start sledging Sachin on an Australia tour calling things like he is getting old and should return back. I sledged him back telling him that Sachin had so many test hundreds under his belt that he hadn't played matches. I sledged back asking him the breed of pup he was. Sometimes it works. Though it doesn't work on older and matured people."
9. On hiring for a company: "It's not necessary that a person with more experience and higher salary will work more or give more benefit to your company than a person who is drawing one-fifth and has less experience."
10. On team building: "I would rather chose a team with 4 star players than all stars who may not work with each other due to ego issues."

Corporate Service Corps
(Besides providing young…)
It's going to be a busy month for Mamtha Sharma, country head for Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), IBM India. As we write this, a contingent of nine IBM-ers from nine different countries is descending on Barmer, Rajasthan, for an agri-development project that aims to increase the yields of pomegranate and other fruits that grow in this arid, oil-rich district. The team is a part of IBM's Corporate Service Corps (CSC) initiative, which sends middle management executives to the far corners of the world to lend their skills to social development programs. The nine in Barmer — from the USA, UK, Philippines, Australia, Canada, Hungary, Brazil, Argentina, Israel — have been preparing for months, but a little administrative hand-holdingl helps in the initial stages. One of Sharma's jobs is to set the ball rolling by introducing her team to the people from Bharatiya Agro Industries Foundation and TechnoServe, the two NGOs they will be working with. In the course of the next four weeks, she hopes everyone would have gained something from the project. "Our people benefit as much as the NGO, by working in a multi-cultural team in a place they have never been before. IBM gains in terms of leadership development and the NGO benefits from the knowledge and experience IBM brings," she says.
Started in 2008, the CSC program sends some of IBM's most promising executives to work pro bono on social sector projects in Asia, Africa and Latin America. In India, IBM-ers from around the world have worked with organisations like SEWA in Ahmedabad, Kalamandir in Jamshedpur and the Chennai Municipal Corporation, offering skills in technology, strategy formulation, project management and marketing. Executives from IBM India , for their part, have been sent to Latin America and Africa to gain experience in a different milieu. Such is the prestige of the program that IBM receives ten times the number of applications it needs. "Last year we received 5,000 applications globally for 500 positions. The CSC gains in reputation every year as returnees narrate their experiences and recommend it to others," says Sharma.
The IBM CSC is now being emulated by corporates the world over, such as SAP in Germany , which launched its own version, called the Social Sabbatical Program (SSP) in 2012. In the first year, SAP received 80 applications for 30 postings in three countries. Last year, it received 320 applications for 70 postings in five countries. "The experiential learning that the SSP provides is critical to building next-gen business leaders, who need to know how to operate across regions and cultures," says SAP's global CSR head Alexandra van der Ploeg. "Besides, it addresses the millenium generation's desire to use their skills for a greater good. It provides a sense of purpose."
SAP offers NGOs expertise in technology, business processes and strategy formulation. Last year, when it sent a team to Bangalore to work with the Parikrma Humanity Foundation in the area of education for underprivileged children, it chose participants who were specialised in strategy. "Like most NGOs, Parikrma has been driven by the founder, but it now needs a second rung management team. Our people looked at its internal processes and developed a strategy to help the organisation scale up," says van der Ploeg.
SAP is now playing evangelist and recently organised a workshop on social sabbaticals in Berlin for the benefit of other companies in Europe. One of the aspects it stresses is how the program helps business. Besides providing young leaders an opportunity to immerse themselves in the markets of the future, it also helps local subsidiaries make a connection with the society they operate in. "The people in SAP India offices in Bangalore now have a permanent relationship with Parikrma. The program provides local SAP offices a proof point that we recognise our social responsibilities," says van der Ploeg.
The biggest challenge for a global corporate seeking to engage in CSR in developing economies is finding the right NGOs to partner with. Stepping in to bridge the gap is Pyxera Global, an American non-profit organisation that has been in the business of pairing corporates with NGOs, government agencies and universities for over two decades. In India, Pyxera Global is headed by Kabi Sherman, a former IBM systems analyst who went on to work with Dhirubhai Ambani in the Reliance Industries' CSR arm for five years, setting up computer labs in 51 municipal schools in Mumbai. Sherman was responsible for bringing IBM's CSC initiative to India and says, "The idea of pro bono work has always been there in law and accountancy, where professionals provide free services for those who can't afford to pay. The revolutionary idea that IBM introduced was pro bono teams. Then it became something of mutual benefit. Corporates now benefit from it as much as the NGOs."

Goldratt Consulting
(If you are not improving…)
His father, the late Eliyahu Goldratt shot into the global spotlight with Goal, a book that launched the theory of constraints (TOC) into the world. Rami Goldratt continues his father's work by helping companies improve their response time to the market using TOC as a systems management tool. India is the second biggest centre for Goldratt Consulting and he makes sure he keeps his finger on the pulse of the country, coming down once every few months. Goldratt was in Pune recently to conduct a session on breakthrough innovation using TOC at the Tata Management and Training Centre . In a conversation with CD, he spoke of the new challenges companies are facing and using TOC in a VUCA (volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous) world. Edited excerpts:
How would you explain TOC to someone who is new to the concept?
If I need to summarise TOC in one word it would be focus. There are always many areas that can be improved, however not everything that can be improved should be improved. Focus starts with what not to do. Usually when we think about focus it's about what to do but TOC is about what to stop doing. Many of our improvement efforts aren't aimed at the constraints of the business - what limits the business from doing more. If you are not improving something that's limiting the business from doing more, the business will not do more. TOC is about how to identify the right constraint and then giving you the right set of tools to open it.
How is TOC relevant in a VUCA world?
Let's take the consumer goods industry and uncertainty. We need to forecast the sales of a certain product in a certain place in a certain time.
Based on this we would know how much to produce. One would expect that over time our ability to make an accurate forecast would improve with more information on recorded consumption and more sophisticated IT tools but reality shows us it's exactly the opposite—it's getting worse. We have more and more surpluses and shortages. This is because there are three dynamics in consumer behaviour that makes it almost impossible to predict accurately.
The first is that consumers are becoming more sensitive to get the products they want and this puts pressure on retailers to work with wider assortments else they will lose sales. The wider the assortment, the harder it is to have a good forecast of what you will sell because you'll stock more units and managing the depth of this inventory becomes difficult. The second is consumer tolerance. Consumers are willing to wait less and less for the product to become available which means that retailers need to have it in the stores not in the warehouse.
Finally, product life is becoming shorter with new products constantly being introduced and retailers needing to offer discounts to sell the older version. This puts a lot of pressure on brands. Unless the new launch is a star product like the iPhone, there will be a clash between your old and new offerings. All this makes our ability to forecast and have the right inventory impossible.
So the only way for companies to survive is to reduce the reaction time to market since it's impossible to have an accurate forecast. You need to capture signals from reality of what is selling and react to it as fast as possible. Companies that can't dramatically improve response times will not exist in the future.
Earlier having a fast response time was a luxury; now it's a necessity. In TOC we remove operational constraints that block the flow and improve response times, whether in marketing, operations or production.
What are the typical constraints you come across?
The main constraint is often policy driven. What typically increases response times is working with bigger batches. In procurement if you wait longer before placing an order, response time would naturally increase. However, companies want to accumulate all orders to get a good deal. What they don't notice is that every such incident increases their response time. This is one major constraint that is hurting the flow.
How do you manage the constraints once you identify them?
One major obstacle to flow causing project delays happens not in the execution, but the planning stage. When setting timelines, people will give an extended buffer - typically 50% — to be reliable. The problem is that people end up using this buffer period whether they need it or not, and are likely to overshoot it as issues crop up towards the end. A project is a chain of tasks and to ensure that it finishes on time, the project manager needs to make sure each task finishes on time. As the manager, you have to take the individual 'safety' out of the equation and use it as part of the overall project buffer.

Innovated in India  shoes: Now you never get lost(The idea of including the differently-abled into…)
By: Jyoti Pande Lavakare
First came the sleek, fashionable, inclusive and wearable technology with a cause:
Lechal, the innovative, bluetooth-enabled haptic shoe (haptic technology recreates the sense of touch via vibrations).
Then came even greater innovation: in thinking through and deciding upon the actual process of manufacturing that tech-embedded shoe — right here in India — using differently-abled people. When both product and process innovation become so integrated in the overall philosophy of the company that you can't separate one from the other — it's about inclusion as much as about profit — it truly becomes the coolest thing.
But let's begin from the beginning. At an elementary level, Lechal shoes appear to intersect the worlds of sci-fi and magic — with a bit of James Bond thrown in. If you wear these shoes, you can never get lost — even if you're blind.
And while they're doing their job liberating you from ever having to read a map, look at a screen or ask for directions, they're also telling you the distance to your destination, the number of steps you've walked, biked or run, calories you've burnt, fitness levels and other metrics.
Additionally, they can track activities, set customised fitness targets, workout sessions and milestones and motivate you via audio or screen, transferring all this data seamlessly to your smartphone. And because they're on your feet, they're more accurate than other wearable technology that offers similar information.
Lechal came into being for a noble cause — to help the visually challenged navigate with Google maps through the use of haptics and digital mapping. And although it has since become more inclusive — to include those who are not visually challenged — Lechal's original intention remains priority.
Lechal (a rough translation from Hindi would be "take me along") signals the wearer through vibrations, the intensity and duration of which vary to correlate with the distance to an upcoming turn. So, it will vibrate longer the closer you are to your turn. The intensity can be pre-set to custom requirements. It also syncs up with smartphones through an app to provide a variety of other navigational metrics and fitness information.
Innovated in India
Here's how it works: the insoles are embedded with removable sensors powered by two rechargeable lithium polymer batteries which sync with mobile apps like Google maps. Directions are relayed through haptic feedback through vibrations either in the left or the right shoe.
  Now let's get to the innovative thought in the manufacturing process. When Lechal pre-orders opened in February, its founding team of Krispian Lawrence and Anirudh Sharma was still focused mainly on fine-tuning their innovative product and hadn't got around to thinking through the manufacturing process.
At that time, they had 12 different manufacturers and suppliers in China who were manufacturing and assembling the shoe according to their specifications.
"Our initial product only said 'innovated in India'," Lawrence said in a phone interview from Secunderabad, where he has just leased a factory to locate his manufacturing unit. That itself is laudable, as India and China are usually seen as backend sweatshops rather than centres of innovation.
But it was only after they'd tinkered around, fine-tuned and refined the final version of their product that they turned their attention to the manufacturing process.
By this time, they already had 40,000 online pre-orders — which translate into immediate revenues of roughly $6 million at a price point of $150 per pair. For the two co-founders, who set up Ducere Technologies, built the prototype in 2011 and raised $2 million as seed capital, the innovation had just begun.
Last month, they concluded negotiations to lease a turnkey factory for the start-up to begin its own manufacturing right here in India, a timely alignment with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 'Make In India' exhortation.
"It (the factory) is around 25 km from Secunderabad," says Lawrence, and they will soon begin the process of modifying it with wheelchair access and other disability aids so that they can hire as many differently-abled people as possible.
Lawrence and Sharma's business plan plays to the strengths of the differently-abled on a large scale — on the assembly line, on the factory floor and in quality control.
There's a sound rationale to these hirings: after all, who can do a repetitive job requiring high focus and precision better than someone on the autism spectrum; and which person's touch would be more sensitive in testing for quality than one who cannot see?
Add to this the social and financial benefits of including a previously non-productive demographic into the workforce along with the dignity of earning their own living, and the decision becomes priceless.

Not many designers to tailor products for startups now

(At a time when product start…)
When Ashwini Asokan returned to India earlier this year to launch artificial intelligence startup Mad Street Den after an illustrious career in media and design in the US, she was shocked by the lack of design talent equipped to meet her needs. She soon realised that she was not alone in facing this dilemma. "I can't tell you the amount of people who have emailed me in the last two months looking for designers," she says.
Sumit Saurav, founder of youth creative platform CampusDiaries, has been hunting for two user experience designers for the past five months -to no avail. "We are looking for someone who understands user experience from a visual point of view, but who can also convert that into code," he says. "We've hired one person who is not trained."
At a time when product start ups are emerging from the country and companies are waking up to the importance of design in all aspects of business, India is facing a serious shortage of quality designers. Experts point to two main reasons for this -one, few institutions in the country train designers in all aspects, and two, most good designers find freelancing much more rewarding than a regular job.
"A lot more entrepreneurs are understanding the need for design -from designing the business itself to its product, brand, the user experience, and systems," says Sonia Manchanda, founder of globally-reputed design firm Idiom. "But there are very few Indian institutions that train designers holistically in all these aspects."
For decades, the only institution that provided quality design training was the National Institute of Design in Ahmedabad, established in 1961. While some 30 design schools and institutes have popped up in recent years, including the DJ Academy of Design in Coimbatore and an extension of the New York-based Parsons School of Design in Mumbai, they are yet to find their feet. Meanwhile, a fledgling army of freelance designers spread across the country is working out of their homes.
Global freelancing platform Elance lists almost 30,000 Indians specialising in design and multimedia, while Dribbble, a platform specifically for designers, lists 848 Indian professionals. Charging from $10 up to $35 an hour for their services to international clients, few of these designers find startups, who can barely afford to offer Rs . 50,000 per month, attractive.
"If I were part of a company, especially a product company, I would have to work on a sin gle project at a time for a very low salary," says Prem Kumar, a Chennai-based freelancer who has been designing websites since 2008. Even as a newcomer to the industry, he says he made Rs 8 lakh within a few months.
Job satisfaction is also a big pull for designers to freelance. "I start the project, complete the project, deliver it, and am present to help out if there are any problems. I cherish that," explains web designer Nitika Jain, whose 14-year portfolio boasts of a diverse range of clients, from an event fundraising firm in Ireland to a wedding services company in India.
"Although I have received many job offers at firms of all sizes, I never opted for it for the sake of convenience and the comfort of being at home -I can work and earn while taking care of my two small kids," she says.
An MBA graduate in international business, Jain also offers service engine optimi sation services, and is expanding into mobile app development.
Asokan of Mad Street Den says that while design consciousness in on the rise, Indian companies don't treat designers well and are known to bully them.
"These freelancers have had the opportunity to make so much money with so much freedom; no one wants the abuse that comes with being a part of an Indian tech company," she says.
But many international companies have started giving design a lot of importance in recent years. Some major venture capital firms in the US have brought design partners on board.
John Maeda, president of the top-ranking Rhode Island School of Design, became a partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers; while Irene Au, former user experience head at Yahoo, took up the role of operating partner at Khosla Ventures earlier this year. Google Venture has five design partners.
Meanwhile, there is movement to connect and advance the Indian design community, through numerous initiatives ranging from social design workshops to font-centred symposiums.
Also, there is BeaglesLoft, a new space intended to nurture a community that brings together design and technology by featuring art installations, theatre performances, and design evenings.
Asokan plans to hold a series of design hackathons around the country herself. "These kids are really hardworking and willing to learn; they are taking on the challenge of moving on and producing something," she says.
"This is the kind of community we need to tap into to create the design community that we need. I would hate to see our design community run on another cheap outsourcing model coming out of India."

(The last year's TiE-Aspire Achievers…)
NEW DELHI: Back in the summer of 2013, the snow-capped peaks of the mighty Himalayas was like a distant dream for 13-year-old Malavath Poorna , staying at a remote Telangana village.
A year later, Poorna became the world's youngest female climber to have scaled the Mount Everest.
Extraordinary stories like these, of three young girls, hailing from few of the most impoverished pockets of the country, were celebrated at The Indus Entrepreneurs (TiE) Entrepreneurial Summit 2014 at an event here today.
Along with Malavath Poorna, Sushma Verma (14), the youngest Indian matriculate; and Kusum Kumari (14), football team member of not-for-profit organisation Yuwa, which made waves at two football tournaments in Spain last year were presented the 2014 TiE-Aspire Young Achiever awards.
The audience, comprising mainly of corporate leaders, were caught in rapt attention as the girls narrated their stories of grit, courage and determination in finding success fighting fierce societal objections and official apathy.
"Initially villagers ticked off my parents for wearing shorts while playing football and later on they tried to dissuade them from sending me to Spain saying that I will be sold there," said Kusum who wants to be the "first university student of her village".
According to father of Sushma, who matriculated at the age of seven years, is pursuing Msc in Microbiology now. Her father said the family could first spot her talent when she recited the Ramayana at the tender age of two.
Sushma, who directly took admission in class nine, "wants to be a doctor" although she first wants to pursue Phd.
Amit Bhatia of Aspire Human Capital Management, said, "Their journeys were not easy but their grit, determination and exceptional talent paved the way for their success. Their stories are inspirational, so are their dreams."
The last year's TiE-Aspire Achievers were maritime sailor Abhlilash Tomy , hockey player Rani Rampal and Paralympic High-Jumper Girisha HN.

BJP ready to do whatever it takes to form next govt in MaharashtraBJP ready to do whatever it takes to form next govt in Maharashtra
Dharmendra Jore , Hindustan Times  Mumbai, October 20, 2014
First Published: 09:24 IST(20/10/2014) | Last Updated: 09:58 IST(20/10/2014)
Comments
 A deficit of 23-25 seats to make the all-important 145 mark has dampened the spirits of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) camp, but it has definitely made senior leaders work even harder to form a government on their own.
With a strong leader like Amit Shah at the helm in New Delhi, the state unit has set its sights on the next move.
For they know that Shah, along with his mentor PM Narendra Modi, will ensure a stable government is put in place, sooner or later. All possibilities, including the extension of President’s rule in the state or poaching a group of MLAs from other parties is also being considered.
A quick-fire decision by Amit Shah to select a CM candidate on Monday itself has sent out signals to the Shiv Sena and all other parties.
 He left no scope for state leaders to make any mistake by addressing a press conference.
The move is expected to work in the BJP’s favour as high-decibel state leaders will not unnecessarily anger possible allies (read the Shiv Sena).
Shah took it upon himself to defuse the tension between the ex-allies, but maintained a tough stand that no further compromise would be made to sacrifice the local leadership.
The BJP’s parliamentary board was sensitive in choosing Rajnath Singh, home minister and former national president, who had made sincere efforts to woo the Sena before Shah became the party chief.
Other than ensuring the party gets the support it needs, Singh will have another task at hand.
He is expected to coordinate with senior state leaders, who are fighting for the CM’s post ever since the party sniffed a victory.
 He will fathom the sentiment among the party’s elected members on Monday before conveying the name(s) of the CM candidate.
“I am going to Maharashtra tomorrow to decide on the BJP legislature’s party leader,” Singh told reporters in New Delhi.
Addressing the media in New Delhi, Shah ruled out any alliance with the Nationalist Congress Party, which is ready to offer unconditional support to the BJP.
“The NCP did not talk of becoming our partners in the government.
 It is just willing to support us unconditionally. That’s all.”
Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray told mediapersons he was not approached by the BJP for support, and his party would not approach it with any proposal.
But he said he would consider a proposal (from BJP) if it is sent to him.”
Maharashtra BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis expected the BJP’s friends to support his party.
In the meantime, seeing their party coming to the power, CM aspirants within the party have started intensely lobbying for the top job.
 The leaders who are close the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) have urged the BJP’s ideological guardian to ensure their entry to the sixth floor of Mantralaya.
Some leaders are in touch with legislators who would be asked for their preference on Monday.
 The respective regional leaders will keep their flock together to garner support before Rajnath Singh.
A senior BJP leader, however, said even a leader without any strong backing of MLAs may get the job if deemed fit by the high command.

Pritam Munde wins by record 7 lakh votes  thin margin of 3 for Cong MLAPritam Munde wins by record 7 lakh votes
HT Correspondents , Hindustan Times  Mumbai/Chandigarh, October 20, 2014
First Published: 09:38 IST(20/10/2014) | Last Updated: 12:17 IST(20/10/2014)
Some results were too close to call and a few were easy, but two stood out after vote count in Maharashtra and Haryana on Sunday.
 
Pritam Munde, the second daughter of late BJP leader Gopinath Munde, scripted Lok Sabha history in winning the Beed seat in Maharashtra in a by-election by a record margin of nearly 700,000 votes.
 
The slimmest margin came from Haryana. Jai Tirath Dahiya, the Congress’ sitting MLA from Rai assembly segment in Sonepat district, won by three votes. Inderjeet Dahiya of the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) came in second.
 
First, the high. The record for a maximum victory margin in Lok Sabha polls was held by Anil Basu of the CPI-M. He had won by 592,502 votes from Arambagh in West Bengal in the 2004.
 
Pritam, 32, polled 922,416 votes while trouncing former Congress minister Ashok Patil by 6,96,321 votes, poll officials said.
 
The Beed bypoll was necessitated following the death of Gopinath Munde in a road accident in Delhi in June this year.
 
In Haryana, 62-year-old Jai Tirath polled 36,703 votes as against his 68-year-old INLD rival Inderjeet Dahiya’s 36,700, as per the result declared by the election department.
 
Jai Tirath’s margin is, however, not the slimmest in Indian elections. There have been a few one-vote margin wins including Congress leader CP Joshi’s controversial loss to BJP’s Kalyan Singh Chouhan from Rajasthan’s Nathdwara assembly segment in 2008.
 

Doubt over Boko Haram  ceasefire  after attacksDoubt over Boko Haram 'ceasefire' after attacks
AFP
Maiduguri, Nigeria, October 20, 2014
First Published: 08:31 IST(20/10/2014)

Nigerian military and intelligence officials raised doubts on Sunday about the validity of a ceasefire with Boko Haram, with reports of fresh attacks and fighting in the country's northeast.
The chief of defence staff and a senior presidential aide announced on Friday that agreement had been reached to end hostilities and secure the possible release of more than 200 kidnapped schoolgirls.
Air Marshal Alex Badeh said he had instructed all armed forces' chiefs to ensure the "immediate compliance" with the development.
But a senior army officer in the violence-wracked northeast, who asked to remain anonymous, said: "Honestly, we are yet to receive any operational order on the ceasefire.
"As such, we are battle-ready and would confront the terrorists if we see them."
A senior intelligence official in the region also indicated to AFP that he had not received word about the purported ceasefire.
On Sunday evening, troops from the 7th Division of the Nigerian Army fought dozens of suspected members of Boko Haram in the town of Damboa in Borno state, witnesses and security sources said.
Earlier, a group of insurgents attacked the Borno town of Sabon Gida, said one military officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media.
"The fight was tough and it seems the insurgents wanted to destroy everything in Sabon Gida. They came around 5:00 pm (1600 GMT) and by 6:00 pm, the fight was over," added local trader Bilyaminu Aliyu.
Boko Haram took over Damboa, which is about 90 kilometres (56 miles) southwest of the Borno state capital Maiduguri, in July, destroying much of the town and forcing thousands to flee.
The group's leader Abubakar Shekau claimed that they left voluntarily but the military said they recaptured it in early August. Residents have since begun returning.
Attacks, abductions
Elsewhere, locals said that dozens of suspected Boko Haram gunmen had stormed the town of Abadam, north of Maiduguri near Lake Chad, on Thursday, before the supposed ceasefire.
A number of residents said at least 30 people were killed on Thursday and Friday -- after the purported deal -- while hundreds of others were forced to flee across the border into neighbouring Niger.
"We all heard of the ceasefire over the radio but it seems the insurgents are not perturbed at all," another resident, Mallam Babagana, said on Sunday.
"To me, they (the militants) don't even care about it because they increased their attacks from Friday, the very day the ceasefire was announced. By Saturday, they hoisted their flags."
Meanwhile, Enoch Mark, whose daughter and niece are among the 219 schoolgirls who have been held by Boko Haram since mid-April, said there had been another attack in neighbouring Adamawa state.
He said the attack, in the village of Wagga on Saturday, saw some 40 women abducted -- an established Boko Haram tactic in its bloody five-year insurgency.
On Friday, eight people were also killed on a road in the Borno state village of Shaffa near where a prominent Muslim leader, the Emir of Gwoza, was ambushed and killed by Boko Haram fighters in May.
Babagana said local hunters on their way to recover the bodies of the eight fought battles with militants on Saturday in Azul, also in the Hawul local government area.
"The unrelenting terrorists waylaid our members at around 9:00 am and serious fighting ensued," said Babagana, who heads a local vigilante group.
"We lost four of our members and we killed three terrorists."
Independent corroboration of attacks in the remote northeast are almost impossible, with communications devastated by the violence and access fraught with danger.
The police and the military have largely stopped communicating on attacks.

Mountain-sized comet Siding Spring whizzes past Marsprint

A comet the size of a small mountain whizzed past Mars on Sunday, dazzling space enthusiasts with the once-in-a-million-years encounter. Isro on Thrusday had repositioned its Mars Orbiter Mangalyaan to avoid collision.
The comet, known as Siding Spring (C/2013 A1), made its closest encounter with Mars on Sunday at 2.27pm (1827 GMT), racing past the Red Planet at a breakneck 126,000 miles (203,000 kilometres) per hour.
At its closest, Siding Spring was 87,000 miles (139,500 kilometers) from Mars -- about a third the distance between Earth and our moon.
Before the comet passed, it could be seen in space racing toward the brightly illuminated Red Planet, trailed by a cloud of debris. 
Scientists said the comet's passing offered a unique chance to study its impact on Mars's atmosphere.
"What could be more exciting than to have a whopper of an external influence like a comet, just so we can see how atmospheres do respond?" asked Nick Schneider, the remote sensing team leader from Nasa's MAVEN mission to Mars.
"It's a great learning opportunity."
Apart from India's maiden spacecraft mission Mangalyaan, Nasa's fleet of Mars-orbiting satellites and robots on the planet's surface were primed for the flyby of the comet, hoping to capture the rare event and collect a trove of data for Earthlings to study.
'Mangalyaan in good health'
India’s Mars Orbiter Mission Mangalyaan is in good health post the encounter with comet Siding Spring on Sunday night.
“We had taken all precautions by changing the orientation of the spacecraft. Post encounter, the systems have been found to be working well.   We have done systematic observations of the comet and  will soon get the data and the images,” Dr Kiran Kumar, director, Space Application Center, told HT.
“The event will happen next year too. The Black Out will take place when the satellite goes behind Mars. The White Out will occur when the Sun will come very close to Mars. Both these phenomenon may throw an affect on the receptive system on the spacecraft.”
Maintaining that the functioning of the spacecraft can extend beyond six months, he said, "We have sufficient fuel and we have to wait and watch.”
MAVEN, Nasa's latest Mars orbiter, too reported back to Earth in "good health" after spending about three hours ducking a possible collision with the comet's high-velocity dust particles, the US space agency said.
"We're glad the spacecraft came through, we're excited to complete our observations of how the comet affects Mars, and we're eager to get to our primary science phase," said MAVEN principal investigator Bruce Jakosky.
"Mars Odyssey hard at work now to image #MarsComet Siding Spring, after closest approach & before dust tail hits," Nasa said on Twitter, referring to one of its robotic spacecraft.
'Duck and cover'
The ball of ice, dust and pebbles is believed to have originated billions of years ago in the Oort Cloud, a distant region of space at the outskirts of the solar system.
The comet is around one mile wide and is only about as solid as a pile of talcum powder.
As it hurtled through space it created a meteor shower and shed debris -- mostly dust and pebbles -- which scientists had feared could damage valuable spacecraft.
"All it takes is a little tiny grain of sand traveling at that speed and you've got damage to solar arrays, or your propulsion line or critical wires," said Schneider.
Before the comet entered the red Planet's orbit, NASA moved its Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, Mars Odyssey and MAVEN to avoid damage by the comet's high-speed debris.
This artist's concept handout shows NASA's Mars orbiters lining up behind the Red Planet for their "duck and cover" maneuver to shield them from comet dust that may result from the close flyby of comet Siding Spring (C/2013 A1). (AFP Photo)
"#MarsComet flyby not over yet. Mars passes thru dust tail... while orbiters #duckandcover on far side," the agency tweeted.
The comet has traveled more than one million years to ake its first pass by Mars, and will not return for another million years, after it completes its next long loop around the sun. \
The comet was discovered by Robert McNaught at Australia's Siding Spring Observatory in January 2013.
Its flyby of Mars is not likely to be visible to sky watchers on Earth.

BJP s victory in assembly elections could take markets to dizzying heights: AnalystYou are here: Home > Collections > Coal
Victory in assembly elections will embolden PM to roll-out aggressive reforms: Ajay Bodke, Prabhudas Lilladher
ECONOMICTIMES.COM Oct 20, 2014, 01.33PM IST
(The market has given a thumbs-up…)
MUMBAI: The BJP victory in assembly elections will embolden Prime Minister Narendra Modi to roll-out aggressive reforms that has enthused global & domestic investors into driving up the Indian equity market to dizzying heights, says Ajay Bodke, Head- Investment Strategy & Advisory, Prabhudas Lilladher.
In an email response to www.economictimes.com, Bodke said declining commodity prices spells bonanza for India as import bill will shrink sharply narrowing trade & current account deficit.
ET: Will the market rally as BJP has won in Maharashtra & Haryana?
Ajay Bodke: The market has given a thumbs-up as the BJP has won Haryana State assembly polls and is the single largest party in Maharashtra. The result would add heft to the already formidable political weight of the Prime Minister.
By holding extensive rallies across both the States, Mr. Modi can claim to have turned the fortunes of his party in the States single-handedly. It is especially noteworthy as previously BJP did not have extensive presence in these States and Mr. Modi has sought votes on the synchronization of development plank between his government at the Centre and the prospective majority State Governments of the BJP.
Markets hope that this strengthening of his hand would embolden Mr. Modi to roll-out aggressive reforms that had enthused global & domestic investors into driving up the Indian equity market to dizzying heights this calendar year.
Investors hope that the window between now and the Budget in February 2015 would see some long-pending decisions in crucial sectors like Oil & Gas (gas pricing), fleshing-out of the auction process for de-allocated coal blocks, decontrol of diesel and steps to progressively reduce other subsidies albeit at moderate pace in items like domestic LPG, kerosene and nitrogenous fertilizers.
More aggressive follow-up on rolling out an inclusive GST (including land and liquor which has been sought to be kept out by vested interests thus negating the impact of a comprehensive GST to certain extent), pushing crucial legislative agenda in the Winter Session like de-nationalization of coal, increase in FDI cap in Insurance, diluting the draconian Land Acquisition Bill, increasing flexibility in stifling labour laws etc.
ET: The RBI Governor has raised concerns over growth in coming quarters. There is slowdown in China. Japan and Europe may see recession. What does it mean for Indian markets?
Ajay Bodke: Any severe global slowdown is bound to impact the expected rate of recovery in India as slowing exports in our key market destinations could impact trade & current account deficit as well as the dislocation that may be caused if large scale risk aversion were to lead to massive capital outflows.
However, slowing growth in China, Japan & Europe has led to massive demand destruction in many commodity prices with crude oil prices plummeting by over 25 per cent YTD and a similar trend being witnessed in other industrial commodities like iron ore, thermal coal, coking coal etc.
Agri-commodities are also trading at multi-year lows. This weakening commodity cycle has spelt havoc for many commodity-exporting economies like Brazil, South Africa, Indonesia, Russia etc. which have seen their aggregate demand collapsing and adding to their macro-economic woes.
  On the other hand, it spells bonanza for commodity-importing economies like India (India imports roughly 80 per cent of its crude oil requirements besides thermal coal, LNG etc) whose import bill will shrink sharply narrowing its trade & current account deficit.
This would also lower the fuel & fertilizer subsidies of the government helping it contain fiscal deficit and help upsteam oil companies like ONGC, OIL, GAIL to post better numbers due to lower losses. Rising global commodity prices fuel imported inflation, similarly falling commodity prices would act to lower imported inflation and thus create conditions for the RBI to adopt a more accommodative monetary stance by lowering interest rates earlier than expected.
This can help improve aggregate demand and aid improvement in margins for Corporate India. Rising earnings momentum can spur expansion in valuation multiples fuelling rally in Indian equities. Falling inflation & interest rates can also fuel rally in bond markets.
Not only would weak global commodity prices improve the macro-economic indicators as stated above but it would also make India more attractive as an Investment destination vis-a-vis other emerging markets. This can lead to a torrent of FII inflows that can be harnessed by Corporate India to repair balance-sheets by raising more equity resources in the secondary market and companies can lower their debt to equity ratios.

Sensex surges on BJP's election win; top 20 trading ideas

Narendra Modi
(BJP has got a majority in…)
NEW DELHI: The S&P BSE Sensex rose as much as 409 points in trade on Monday, after the government announced slew of reform measures such as diesel price deregulation and hike in natural gas price, post victory in recently held elections in Maharashtra & Haryana.
The BJP has got a majority in Haryana and will form the government for the first time in the state. It has emerged as the single largest party in Maharashtra but will have to patch-up with old ally Shiv Sena to form a government.
According to experts, after securing majority in both the states, the Narendra Modi government has more room now to press forward with reforms, beginning with the winter session of Parliament and the FY16 budget thereafter
"The market has given a thumbs-up as the BJP has won Haryana State assembly polls and is the single largest party in Maharashtra. The result would add heft to the already formidable political weight of the Prime Minister," says Ajay Bodke, Head- Investment Strategy & Advisory, Prabhudas Lilladher.
"Markets hope that this strengthening of his hand would embolden Mr. Modi to roll-out aggressive reforms that had enthused global & domestic investors into driving up the Indian equity market to dizzying heights this calendar year," he added.
Tracking the momentum, the 50-share Nifty index also managed to reclaim its crucial psychological level of 7900, supported by gains in oil & gas, capital goods, auto and banking stocks.
At 1:07 p.m.; the 30-share index was at 26,402.31, up 293.78 points or 1.13 per cent. It touched a high of 26,517.90 and a low of 26,399.84 in trade today.
The Nifty was at 7877.80, up 98.10 points or 1.26 per cent. It touched a high of 7,905.95 and a low of 7,872.20 in trade today.

Top ten stocks which can give upto 98% return by next Diwali
ECONOMICTIMES.COM Oct 20, 2014, 12.39PM IST
We have collated a list of ten trading ideas, from different experts, which can give up to 98% return in the next 12 months or by next Diwali:
Analyst: Rahul Shah, Vice President -Equity Advisory Group, Motilal Oswal Securities
DCB: Target price set at Rs 110
DCB's new management restructured its balance sheet, improved underwriting standards with more focus on secured loans and other stringent criteria for loan approvals. NPA has showed steady improvement over FY10-14, with GNPA falling from 8.8% in FY09 to 1.7% in FY14.
DCB's current valuations of 1.7x FY15E P/ABV and 11x FY15E P/E do not reflect the bank's ability to scale up its redefined business model. We attach a fair P/ABV multiple of 2.3x FY15E, a 25% premium to comparable peers (small to medium sized banks) owing to higher advances growth, superior NIM, improving asset quality, robust earnings growth and improvement in return ratios.
Analyst: Daljeet S Kohli - Head of Research IndiaNivesh Securities
Reliance Industries Ltd: Target price set at Rs 1274
Reliance Industries would be one of the biggest beneficiaries of proposed hike in natural gas price. We believe successful discovery in MJ1 well and exploration in R-Series gas field in KG D6 block would help ramp up the production of natural gas in the next 2-3 years.
Despite a fall in international prices, petrochemicals margin would remain firm in the near term, driven by INR weakness and increase in polymer customs duty. The company's US$4bn pet coke gasification project remains on schedule for implementation by FY16 end, which will likely help in expansion on operating margin of refining business. Further, shale gas and retail business are also showing remarkable growth and likely to be a key revenue and profitability driver going ahead.
Ashiana Housing Ltd: Target price set at Rs 202
Ashiana Housing Ltd (AHL) is a unique asset light developer, with strong focus on pursuing real estate business in Tier II and III cities. Despite its focus on Tier II & III cities, AHL's financial health has not been majorly impacted by the recent economic slowdown.
We expect AHL to report FY16E RoE and RoCE of 35 per cent each. AHL is likely to report 149 per cent top-line CAGR during FY14-16E (to nearly Rs 6.9 bn), on the back of 3 projects entirely getting completed (Tree House, Utsav and Anantara) and some phases of the remaining 7 projects getting completed (Ashiana Town, Rangoli Gardens, Aangan, Gulmohar Gardens, Navrang, Vrinda Gardens, Dwarka and Umang).
We expect AHL to report 192 per cent PAT CAGR during FY14-16E. With substantial chunk of 6.8 mn sq. ft. of ongoing projects reaching revenue recognition threshold, we expect revenue visibility to sharply improve from here on.
 
Capital First Ltd: Target price set at Rs. 360
CFL has emerged as one of the fastest-growing NBFCs, backed by 1) clear management strategy and expertise in retail segment, 2) increasing focus on retail which is least impacted by slowdown in economy, 3) moving towards less risky segments like mortgage, consumer durables and two wheeler financing, and 4) strong promoter backing of Warburg group.
Further getting out of non-profitable business like securities and commodity broking in the last financial year and focus on core business of financing will be the key positive for the company.
We believe CLF is well placed to move on to the next stage of growth. Going forward, the company aims to focus on improving productivity from existing network. Thus, leveraging the cost to income ratio is likely to result in a healthy bottom-line growth.
Meghmani Organics Ltd: Target price set at Rs.34
Meghmani Organics Ltd, a leading global generic agrochemicals player and one of the largest blue pigments producers in the world, is seeing a significant business turnaround after many years of dismal performance.
With uptick in agrochemical cycle, the following triggers should lead to business turnaround: (1) margin expansion on the back of stabilization of recently commenced facilities, (2) better profitability in absence of incremental capex should lead to commencement of debt repayment, (3) With permissions in place from state-level Pollution Control Board, Meghmani is well positioned to ramp-up operations to peak capacity.
Also, (4) Implementation of stringent pollutions norms in China makes Indian agrochemical and pigments business attractive, and (5) ability to attract new order wins from MNC clients given that all safety and environment certifications are in place.
On account of industry down cycle and levered balance sheet of the company, the Meghmani stock has been trading at lower 1-year forward EV/EBITDA multiple of 3.9x. With revival in business cycle, we have assigned 5.9x EV/EBITDA multiple to arrive at FY16E based price target of Rs 34/share.

Oil may touch $60  | How to gain from falli...Aditya Birla Group
("Our economy will be back…)
MUMBAI: Egypt's former petroleum minister Osama Kamal said global crude oil prices are set to fall drastically, predicting afurther erosion of as much as a third in the coming days. "I expect crude oil prices to touch $60 per barrel. This will impact several economies," said Kamal, who was in Mumbai to address the top Aditya Birla Group executives. India is among the major investors in Egypt, with about a dozen firms employing over 35,000 locals there. "The Aditya Birla Group has one of the world's largest carbon black manufacturing units in Egypt. There is also a newly constructed polyester plant with a production capacity of 420,000 tonne per annum," he said.
Kamal said Egypt's economy is back on the path to recovery. "Our economy will be back on track in three years. The signs are already visible. Inflation is hovering around 8.2% and we have also controlled fuel consumption," he said, adding that the new social security programme has helped control food prices.
Egypt is implementing an ambitious plan of developing the Suez Canal Axis through a project involving ship building and maintenance yards, which will bring in $100 billion in investments into the country, he said.
He also said that Egypt's transition to civilian rule is progressing in accordance with the plan.

Sensex surges 392 points on diesel decontrol  assembly poll resultsSensex vaults 321 points on diesel deregulation
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  Mumbai, October 20, 2014

Diwali came early to Dalal Street on Monday with both the Sensex and Nifty marking their biggest daily gains in more than one week after the Narendra Modi government's energy reforms led to a rally in shares of oil retailers, while wins by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Maharashtra and Haryana assembly elections raised expectations of more reforms.
The 30-share BSE Sensex rose 21.32 points, or 1.23%, to 26,429.8. The broader Nifty surged 99.70 points, or 1.28%, to end at 7,879.40.
Hindustan Petroleum jumped 7.4%, Bharat Petroleum rose 4.5%, while Indian Oil gained 3.8%.
Auto stocks also moved higher, as removal of price controls on diesel is seen helping demand for cars. Maruti Suzuki India gained 2%, Ashok Leyland ended up 2.1% and Mahindra and Mahindra rose 0.6%.
The International Monetary Fund further raised sentiment by predicting that India is poised to become a $2-trillion economy this year, with its GDP size crossing $3 trillion in 2019.
"The gods are really smiling on India this time," said Nandan Chakraborty of Axis Capital. "Macro factors such as rains, low crude prices have been very helpful. But, the government has also shown intent by going ahead with reforms."
Recently, global crude oil and other commodity prices have fallen to four-year lows, which may change India's twin deficits favourably, given that the country is a net commodity importer.
"The markets are reacting to GDP expansion and the improved prospects from exports," said Shankar Sharma of securities firm First Global. "Software, pharma and auto are still the main factors that will pull the Indian economy," he told HT over the phone from Dubai.
Foreign brokerages are also upbeat on India's prospects (see graphic). "Investor sentiment is likely to improve as the government is seen as more reform-oriented," a Nomura report said.
"The Modi administration has embarked on one of its biggest reforms over the weekend to modernise the economy," said Mole Hau of BNP Paribas.

Govt s reforms aimed at ensuring ease of biz...Indo-American Chamber of Commerce
("Some of those steps, if…)
CHENNAI: The NDA government's proposed economic reforms aimed at ensuring ease of business in the country will encourage more global firms to set up shop and expand here, US Ambassador to India Kathleen Stephens said. The proposals may have been still in the early stage, "but the kind of programme the new government has laid out, of increasing the ability of foreign companies to invest here in India" will raise the country's standing as an investment destination, she told reporters here last evening.
One of the challenges India faced was that it was standing low in the ease of doing business according to global indicators, she said. However, the efforts by the Narendra Modi government in the areas of transparency and land acquisition among others, if implemented, will encourage more investment, she said. "Some of those steps, if they are taken, I think that will encourage not only American firms, but others, many of whom have already done business and want to expand," she said. India offered many advantages in manufacturing base "but you need to have the infrastructure to do it," she added.
The US envoy, who earlier addressed members of the Indo-American Chamber of Commerce (IACC) in her first visit to the city after assuming charge, outlined the growing bilateral relations in many areas even as she pointed out the two countries' willingness to forge more relations in the areas of security, Defence and civil aviation, among others.
Stephens particularly singled out terrorism as a common challenge faced by the two countries and said this was an area of mutual cooperation.
This was not only discussed during Modi's recent visit to the US but also when US Secretary of State, John Kerry , visited India in June this year, she said.
The US missions in India had last year issued over 800,000 visas of all descriptions and "I believe we will soon reach the milestone of one million visas issued in a calendar year," possibly in 2015, she said. Stephens said that US supported India's efforts to secure a "rightful and natural place" in the world.

Sensex up over 300 points on elections  reformsSensex rises 1.23 percent on reforms, election boost
Reuters –  Mon 20 Oct, 2014 4:44 PM IST

By Abhishek Vishnoi
MUMBAI (Reuters) - The BSE Sensex and Nifty rose more than 1 percent on Monday to mark their biggest daily gain in more than one week after the government's energy reforms led to a rally in oil firms, while wins by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Maharashtra and Haryana elections raised expectations for more reforms.
Removal of diesel price controls and a rise in natural gas prices provided much needed credibility to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's reform agenda, which had come under scrutiny as mere promises, some investors said. His BJP's election gains are also likely to encourage Modi to step up the pace of such reforms.
Diesel deregulation paves the way for a sharper decline in inflation indicators, and investors now expect the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to cut rates 2-3 quarters ahead of consensus expectations.
Gains also tracked higher global stocks, with strong U.S. data and encouraging third-quarter earnings easing concerns about the pace of global economic recovery and raising appetite for riskier assets.
"Government has no choice but to go for reforms, while falling inflation augurs well for rates," said G. Chokkalingam, founder of Equinomics, a research and fund advisory firm.
India is in a structural bull market so buy on dips, added Chokkalingam.
The benchmark Sensex rose 1.23 percent, or 321.32 points, to end at 26,429.85.
The broader Nifty rose 1.28 percent, or 99.70 points, to end at 7,879.40, closing above the psychologically important 7,800 level.
Both indexes marked their biggest daily gain on Monday since Oct. 9.
State-run oil and gas companies led the gainers after government ended diesel controls and raised gas prices on Saturday.
Hindustan Petroleum Corp jumped 7.4 percent, Bharat Petroleum Corp rose 4.5 percent, while Indian Oil Corp gained 3.8 percent.
Oil explorers also surged. Oil and Natural Gas Corp rose 5.5 percent and Oil India gained 1.6 percent.
Auto stocks were also higher, as removal of price controls on fuel is seen helping demand for cars.
Maruti Suzuki India gained 2.1 percent, Mahindra and Mahindra rose 0.6 percent and Ashok Leyland ended up 2.1 percent.
JSW Energy gained 3.6 percent as increase in local gas prices is expected to benefit coal-based power producers.
Idea Cellularrose 4.7 percent ahead of its results later in the day.
However, conglomerate Reliance Industries ended 0.3 percent lower as the gas price hike was seen lower than expected.

Victory in assembly elections will embolden PM to roll-out aggressive reforms: Ajay Bodke, Prabhudas Lilladher
ECONOMICTIMES.COM Oct 20, 2014, 01.33PM IST
(The market has given a thumbs-up…)
MUMBAI: The BJP victory in assembly elections will embolden Prime Minister Narendra Modi to roll-out aggressive reforms that has enthused global & domestic investors into driving up the Indian equity market to dizzying heights, says Ajay Bodke, Head- Investment Strategy & Advisory, Prabhudas Lilladher.
In an email response to www.economictimes.com, Bodke said declining commodity prices spells bonanza for India as import bill will shrink sharply narrowing trade & current account deficit.
ET: Will the market rally as BJP has won in Maharashtra & Haryana?
Ajay Bodke: The market has given a thumbs-up as the BJP has won Haryana State assembly polls and is the single largest party in Maharashtra. The result would add heft to the already formidable political weight of the Prime Minister.
By holding extensive rallies across both the States, Mr. Modi can claim to have turned the fortunes of his party in the States single-handedly. It is especially noteworthy as previously BJP did not have extensive presence in these States and Mr. Modi has sought votes on the synchronization of development plank between his government at the Centre and the prospective majority State Governments of the BJP.
Markets hope that this strengthening of his hand would embolden Mr. Modi to roll-out aggressive reforms that had enthused global & domestic investors into driving up the Indian equity market to dizzying heights this calendar year.
Investors hope that the window between now and the Budget in February 2015 would see some long-pending decisions in crucial sectors like Oil & Gas (gas pricing), fleshing-out of the auction process for de-allocated coal blocks, decontrol of diesel and steps to progressively reduce other subsidies albeit at moderate pace in items like domestic LPG, kerosene and nitrogenous fertilizers.
More aggressive follow-up on rolling out an inclusive GST (including land and liquor which has been sought to be kept out by vested interests thus negating the impact of a comprehensive GST to certain extent), pushing crucial legislative agenda in the Winter Session like de-nationalization of coal, increase in FDI cap in Insurance, diluting the draconian Land Acquisition Bill, increasing flexibility in stifling labour laws etc.
ET: The RBI Governor has raised concerns over growth in coming quarters. There is slowdown in China. Japan and Europe may see recession. What does it mean for Indian markets?
Ajay Bodke: Any severe global slowdown is bound to impact the expected rate of recovery in India as slowing exports in our key market destinations could impact trade & current account deficit as well as the dislocation that may be caused if large scale risk aversion were to lead to massive capital outflows.
However, slowing growth in China, Japan & Europe has led to massive demand destruction in many commodity prices with crude oil prices plummeting by over 25 per cent YTD and a similar trend being witnessed in other industrial commodities like iron ore, thermal coal, coking coal etc.
Agri-commodities are also trading at multi-year lows. This weakening commodity cycle has spelt havoc for many commodity-exporting economies like Brazil, South Africa, Indonesia, Russia etc. which have seen their aggregate demand collapsing and adding to their macro-economic woes.
  On the other hand, it spells bonanza for commodity-importing economies like India (India imports roughly 80 per cent of its crude oil requirements besides thermal coal, LNG etc) whose import bill will shrink sharply narrowing its trade & current account deficit.
This would also lower the fuel & fertilizer subsidies of the government helping it contain fiscal deficit and help upsteam oil companies like ONGC, OIL, GAIL to post better numbers due to lower losses. Rising global commodity prices fuel imported inflation, similarly falling commodity prices would act to lower imported inflation and thus create conditions for the RBI to adopt a more accommodative monetary stance by lowering interest rates earlier than expected.
This can help improve aggregate demand and aid improvement in margins for Corporate India. Rising earnings momentum can spur expansion in valuation multiples fuelling rally in Indian equities. Falling inflation & interest rates can also fuel rally in bond markets.
Not only would weak global commodity prices improve the macro-economic indicators as stated above but it would also make India more attractive as an Investment destination vis-a-vis other emerging markets. This can lead to a torrent of FII inflows that can be harnessed by Corporate India to repair balance-sheets by raising more equity resources in the secondary market and companies can lower their debt to equity ratios.

Malgalyaan takes cover as mountain-sized comet whizzes past Marsprint

A comet the size of a small mountain whizzed past Mars on Sunday, dazzling space enthusiasts with the once-in-a-million-years encounter. Isro on Thrusday had repositioned its Mars Orbiter Mangalyaan to avoid collision.
The comet, known as Siding Spring (C/2013 A1), made its closest encounter with Mars on Sunday at 2.27pm (1827 GMT), racing past the Red Planet at a breakneck 126,000 miles (203,000 kilometres) per hour.
At its closest, Siding Spring was 87,000 miles (139,500 kilometers) from Mars -- about a third the distance between Earth and our moon.
Before the comet passed, it could be seen in space racing toward the brightly illuminated Red Planet, trailed by a cloud of debris. 
Scientists said the comet's passing offered a unique chance to study its impact on Mars's atmosphere.
"What could be more exciting than to have a whopper of an external influence like a comet, just so we can see how atmospheres do respond?" asked Nick Schneider, the remote sensing team leader from Nasa's MAVEN mission to Mars.
"It's a great learning opportunity."
Apart from India's maiden spacecraft mission Mangalyaan, Nasa's fleet of Mars-orbiting satellites and robots on the planet's surface were primed for the flyby of the comet, hoping to capture the rare event and collect a trove of data for Earthlings to study.
'Mangalyaan in good health'
India’s Mars Orbiter Mission Mangalyaan is in good health post the encounter with comet Siding Spring on Sunday night.
“We had taken all precautions by changing the orientation of the spacecraft. Post encounter, the systems have been found to be working well.   We have done systematic observations of the comet and  will soon get the data and the images,” Dr Kiran Kumar, director, Space Application Center, told HT.
“The event will happen next year too. The Black Out will take place when the satellite goes behind Mars. The White Out will occur when the Sun will come very close to Mars. Both these phenomenon may throw an affect on the receptive system on the spacecraft.”
Maintaining that the functioning of the spacecraft can extend beyond six months, he said, "We have sufficient fuel and we have to wait and watch.”
MAVEN, Nasa's latest Mars orbiter, too reported back to Earth in "good health" after spending about three hours ducking a possible collision with the comet's high-velocity dust particles, the US space agency said.
"We're glad the spacecraft came through, we're excited to complete our observations of how the comet affects Mars, and we're eager to get to our primary science phase," said MAVEN principal investigator Bruce Jakosky.
"Mars Odyssey hard at work now to image #MarsComet Siding Spring, after closest approach & before dust tail hits," Nasa said on Twitter, referring to one of its robotic spacecraft.
'Duck and cover'
The ball of ice, dust and pebbles is believed to have originated billions of years ago in the Oort Cloud, a distant region of space at the outskirts of the solar system.
The comet is around one mile wide and is only about as solid as a pile of talcum powder.
As it hurtled through space it created a meteor shower and shed debris -- mostly dust and pebbles -- which scientists had feared could damage valuable spacecraft.
"All it takes is a little tiny grain of sand traveling at that speed and you've got damage to solar arrays, or your propulsion line or critical wires," said Schneider.
Before the comet entered the red Planet's orbit, NASA moved its Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, Mars Odyssey and MAVEN to avoid damage by the comet's high-speed debris.
This artist's concept handout shows NASA's Mars orbiters lining up behind the Red Planet for their "duck and cover" maneuver to shield them from comet dust that may result from the close flyby of comet Siding Spring (C/2013 A1). (AFP Photo)
"#MarsComet flyby not over yet. Mars passes thru dust tail... while orbiters #duckandcover on far side," the agency tweeted.
The comet has traveled more than one million years to ake its first pass by Mars, and will not return for another million years, after it completes its next long loop around the sun. \
The comet was discovered by Robert McNaught at Australia's Siding Spring Observatory in January 2013.
Its flyby of Mars is not likely to be visible to sky watchers on Earth.

Capital First Ltd: Target price set at Rs. 360
CFL has emerged as one of the fastest-growing NBFCs, backed by 1) clear management strategy and expertise in retail segment, 2) increasing focus on retail which is least impacted by slowdown in economy, 3) moving towards less risky segments like mortgage, consumer durables and two wheeler financing, and 4) strong promoter backing of Warburg group.
Further getting out of non-profitable business like securities and commodity broking in the last financial year and focus on core business of financing will be the key positive for the company.
We believe CLF is well placed to move on to the next stage of growth. Going forward, the company aims to focus on improving productivity from existing network. Thus, leveraging the cost to income ratio is likely to result in a healthy bottom-line growth.
Meghmani Organics Ltd: Target price set at Rs.34
Meghmani Organics Ltd, a leading global generic agrochemicals player and one of the largest blue pigments producers in the world, is seeing a significant business turnaround after many years of dismal performance.
With uptick in agrochemical cycle, the following triggers should lead to business turnaround: (1) margin expansion on the back of stabilization of recently commenced facilities, (2) better profitability in absence of incremental capex should lead to commencement of debt repayment, (3) With permissions in place from state-level Pollution Control Board, Meghmani is well positioned to ramp-up operations to peak capacity.
Also, (4) Implementation of stringent pollutions norms in China makes Indian agrochemical and pigments business attractive, and (5) ability to attract new order wins from MNC clients given that all safety and environment certifications are in place.
On account of industry down cycle and levered balance sheet of the company, the Meghmani stock has been trading at lower 1-year forward EV/EBITDA multiple of 3.9x. With revival in business cycle, we have assigned 5.9x EV/EBITDA multiple to arrive at FY16E based price target of Rs 34/share.

India lagging behind in medical research: PM...India lagging behind in medical research, says PM Narendra Modi

("India is lagging behind…)
NEW DELHI: Noting that India is way behind in the field of medical research , Prime Minister Narendra Modi today said much more needs to be done and asked doctors passing out from AIIMS to give back to society which has "contributed" in making them what they are.
He also asked doctors to work among the poor in far-flung areas at least for a week in a year.
"You are so lucky to have studied in an institution like AIIMS. I leave you in hope that as children of mother India you will give back to society which has given you so much love...," he said at at 42nd convocation of the institute.
Modi said Indian doctors have made a name for themselves world over but the country was far behind other countries in the field of research.
"In the field of research we should become more conscious towards case history. We should record the case history of patients and it can give us valuable information in two-three years. It may be possible that some among you could become a research scientist," he said.
In an apparent reference to Health Minister Harsh Vardhan's remark that over 40 percent of AIIMS doctors go abroad for work, Modi said he was not aware if the thought of giving back crossed their mind as the country diverted budget from different sectors to their field, which made them what they are.

Ashok Leyland Stile: First DriveAshok Leyland Pantnagar plant crosses one lakh production landmark
The Nissan  NV200  is a brilliant platform. Ever since it was introduced back in 2009, it's been winning many awards and accolades around the world and recently has even been selected as the replacement for the venerable New York taxi. Last year, India received its very own NV200 in the form of the Evalia - a worthy, if yet understated passenger van to take on the likes of the Toyota  Innova. Now however, it's Ashok Leyland's turn at taking a crack at the passenger MPV market with its very own Evalia based contender - the Stile.
 
Ashok Lelyand is probably one of the most famous names in India when it comes to the transport industry. It is nigh on impossible to travel even a few kilometers down any of our highways and not see one of the company's commercial vehicles keeping the nations economy running, plying goods from one city to the other. But this is really the first time Ashok Leyland  is trying its hands at the rather more whimsical passenger car market. That being said, having a joint venture with Nissan  (which we've already seen before in the for of the Dost) is the perfect stepping stone in the company's attempt at this segment, though it really isn't going to be an easy task in any way.
 
 
 
As soon as you look at the Stile, you realize that this is an Evalia - there's really no mistaking that. But on closer inspection, it becomes evident that Ashok Leyland  has put in quite a bit of effort to differentiate the Stile from its Nissan  badged twin. From the get go, it is clear that the Stile is not as premium as the Evalia, but that's ok... It's not meant to be. Now this can be a good thing and a bad. While the Stile is meant to provide all that the Evalia does at a much more affordable price point, it really does beg the question of whether it can take on the undisputed segment leader, the Toyota  Innova, and make as much as a dent in its market share. But that is another question for another day.
 

Hero upgrades its motorcycle and scooter line-upTVS overtakes Hero in scooter sales
Indian two-wheeler giant Hero MotoCorp which had earlier announced that it would be up-dating its product portfolio and it kept its word, as unveiled 15 new models and variants based upon its existing line-up with aesthetic and technological upgrades.  Starting off proceedings is the new variant of its bread and butter bike, the Splendor iSmart. The latest iteration of the Splendor boasts a segment first i3S technology (Idle Stop and Start System) which is a start-stop system that shuts the engine down while the bike is at idling and in neutral, while it automatically starts the engine as soon as the clutch is depressed and first gear is selected.
 
This innovative technology goes on to further improve the already impressive fuel efficiency of the Splendor.  Apart from this clever technology, the Splendor iSmart gets revised styling, which includes new body panels, graphics, paint schemes and refreshed instrumentation cluster. Other offerings like the new Splendor Pro, Super Splendor, Passion Pro HF Dawn and HF Deluxe have also been updated with new graphics, re-styled instruments and side stand indicator. The HF Deluxe Eco now sports air foils on the crash guards, new aerodynamic mirrors and low friction tyres for improved fuel efficiency. In the 125cc-segment, both the Glamour and Glamour FI bikes have been endowed with reworked graphics to make them more visually appealing. 
 

Over 2 000 cases of theft in Delhi Metro in past four yearsOver 2,000 cases of theft in Delhi Metro in past four years
Faizan Haidar , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, October 20, 2014
First Published: 07:45 IST(20/10/2014) | Last Updated: 07:49 IST(20/10/2014)
Comments
Despite extensive CCTV coverage and heavy security deployment across its premises, Delhi Metro has witnessed a whopping 2,707 cases of thefts in the past four years.
Ironically though, the police have been able to solve only 483, or less than 20%, of such cases.
Apart from this, there have been 7,000 non-cognisable reports that have been filed at various Metro police stations, a majority of which continue to remain unsolved. Police said in 70% of the theft cases, the stolen items are mobile phones and thieves manage to sell these off almost immediately.
“The rate of solving theft cases is very poor in Delhi Metro and in the end it is the commuters who suffer. Cases of such thefts are only growing, which shows that the police have failed to crack down on thieves in Delhi’s most reliable mode of public transport,” said Zishan Haider, director of social organisation Public Protection Movement, who had filed an RTI to procure information related to cases of theft inside the Delhi Metro.
Metro has eight police stations — Kashmere Gate, Rithala, Shastri Park, Kalkaji, Yamuna Bank, Raja Garden, Qutub Minar and Airport.
According to the response to Haider’s RTI, Kashmere Gate has witnessed the most number of cases of theft (657 in total) in 2014. In 2013, the number stood at 388 at the same police station and in 2012 the number of cases registered was 64.
“We have prepared a list of pickpockets who have been active in Metro to solve more cases,” said Sanjay Bhatia, DCP (railway).
 Another major problem, which he said could be a reason behind the high number of unsolved cases, was a severe shortage of staff, a fact that was also highlighted in the RTI.
“They (The CISF) don’t have the sanctioned strength and the proposal to induct more personnel is pending for a long time. Over 25 lakh passengers travel daily in Delhi Metro and they must feel safe,” said Haider. 
Unlike territorial police stations, the jurisdiction of a Metro police station is spread over a long distance. For passengers travelling in Metro, lodging a complaint of their missing items has always been a bad experience.
Apart from setting up new police stations, the Delhi Police are in the process of opening police booths at all important Metro stations across the city.

Congress decimation a repeat of Lok Sabha polls; it needs to buoy upCongress decimation a repeat of Lok Sabha polls; it needs to buoy up
Vinod Sharma , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, October 20, 2014

The Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) victory in Maharashtra might be pyrrhic. But it’s no reason for the Congress to rejoice. The outcome of assembly polls in the state and Haryana is for the party a replication of the 2014 Lok Sabha results.
In neither province is the Congress even the second largest party -- leave alone being anywhere close to getting recognised as the principal Opposition in Haryana. Trailing behind the INLD there and the Shiv Sena -- that logged the second highest tally in Maharashtra -- its rump status is beyond doubt. So is its political isolation.
HT Explains: Understanding Modi wave and Congress rout in Haryana
The NCP, which parted company with the Congress just before elections, made a paradigm shift soon after the poll picture became clear. It announced “unconditional” outside support for the BJP, stranded a step away from a simple majority in the 288-strong legislature. The move illustrated the adage that “self-interest” is the only constant in politics.
Regardless of the BJP’s response, the unilateral NCP overture is proof as much of its opportunism as of the Congress’s depleted political relevance. The nine states that it now governs have a bare 77 seats in Parliament.
Compare that with the BJP’s expanse. It rules on its own strength or shares power with regional allies in MP, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Chhattisgarh, Goa, Haryana, Punjab, Andhra and Maharashtra.
The BJP-RSS are breathing down the Congress’s neck even in the three relatively bigger states where it has power: Karnataka, Kerala and Assam. The vulnerability of its political base there is too tangible to be missed.
The saffron parivar has strong ground-level presence in Karnataka that it once ruled, and is well on the way to building a formidable base in Assam. Kerala looks an exception to the rule. But there too, the BJP surprised itself by standing second in the 2014 Thiruvananthapuram parliamentary polls.
Of greater political significance are instances of CPM cadres shifting loyalty to the saffron camp in Kerala. Many observers consider that a fallout of the Marxists’ subtle application of religious glue to keep their backward Hindu base against the Congress’s Christian-Muslim-forward caste social amalgam.
If the Congress indeed is critically ill, these are signs of potential multiple organ failure. About time it stopped refusing treatment, entail as it may not just life-saving surgery but a radically changed political lifestyle.
The sooner it happens, the better. For around the corner are elections to assemblies in Jharkhand and Jammu and Kashmir. An unequal contest these might be -- the BJP high on steroids, the Congress needing the elixir of life.

PT Usha accepts Modi s invite to get Gujarat athletes up and runningprint
India’s most successful sprinter, PT Usha, is set to take on a marathon mission to scout and groom sporting talent in Gujarat, in response to a request from Prime Minister Narendra Modi.  
Usha, nicknamed the Payyoli Express after the Kerala village where she was born, says the invite from Modi came last year when he was Gujarat’s chief minister.
 
“Since I was busy with the Commonwealth Games and Asiad, I couldn’t do much. Now, I will be going there next month to help them,” said the 50-year-old.
Usha won four gold medals and a silver at the 1986 Seoul Asian Games and missed a podium finish at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics by a fraction of a second.
The sprinter said she was really impressed with the sporting infrastructure in Ahmedabad and Vadodara. “The selection trial will be held in main cities of the state between November 9 and 15.  We are initially planning to select 30 (boys and girls) in the 11-14 age group. Apart from this, 10 older aspirants will also be inducted,” she said.
Modi, who has promised to foster a sporting culture in the country, said this week that the government was signing pacts related to sports expertise with various countries in its bid to provide athletes with better exposure and infrastructure.
Usha said she would help realise the PM’s dream of the country winning an Olympic gold in athletics. Her coaching and training mechanism will be similar to the Usha School of Athletics, which she founded in 2002 near her village in Kerala.
Since then her school has produced some of the country’s best athletes including Asian silver medallist Tintu Luka who was also a member of the 4X400 relay team that won gold in the Incheon Asiad, Sherbana Siddique and Jessy Joseph.
The Kerala institute that began with much fanfare is, however, battling a fund crunch. Though the state government provided land for the school, it failed to support the establishment further, Usha said.                                 
“Since it is a residential school we need at least Rs. 2 lakh for a junior athlete a year. Some sponsors do ease their wallets generously. But still, financial crisis has plagued us badly and we were on the verge of closure on several occasions,” said her husband V Sreenivasan, a former kabaddi player and swimmer.

Live: Sena ready to offer support to BJP  say sourcesPrint
The BJP performed superbly in the Haryana and Maharashtra polls. The party is set to form a government in both the states. While Haryana is easy as it has a simple majority there, Maharashtra is proving to be a bit difficult as it has only 122 seats and needs 145 to form the government. Hectic parleys are on between various parties to form the government. Who will the BJP ally with?

Sentencing in Dhaula Kuan gangrape case todayComments
A Delhi court on Monday sentenced five men to life imprisonment for abducting and gangraping a call centre worker about four years ago, a sensational case that first drew attention to safety of women working late shifts in the city.
The gang rape of the 30-year-old woman, known as the Dhaula Kuan gang rape, transfixed the city for weeks and was one of the first cases that highlighted growing sexual violence against women in Delhi, where thousands of women work in call centres.
Additional sessions judge Virender Bhat also imposed a Rs. 50,000 fine on Usman, Shamshad, Shahid, Iqbal and Kamruddin to be paid to the woman to compensate for the trauma.The judge said the fine will be handed over to the rape survivor who was traumatised into leaving her lucrative job after the incident.
While the verdict was being read out, Shahid lost consciousness and had trouble breathing. He was taken away to the medics by police. His family had a breakdown outside the courtroom as they watched him being taken away.
The judge's order on the sentence echoed the words of the public prosecutor Satwinder Kaur who had urged the court to hand out the maximum punishment of life imprisonment, saying the men had a criminal record.
The court agreed with Kaur, saying "rape is a serious blow to the honour and dignity of the victim". It added that "a liberal attitude shown towards the offenders, particularly rape convicts by imposing meagre sentences or taking a sympathetic view merely on account of family background ....is against the societal interest".
Police say the men abducted the woman on November 24, 2010 while she was walking home with a colleague near Dhaula Kuan after being dropped off by an office cab after midnight.
They grabbed the women, threatened them with a country-made pistol and tried to force them into their vehicle, but the victim’s friend managed to escape after a brief struggle and call police. The five men drove to west Delhi’s Mangolpuri where they took turns raping her and then dumped her on an isolated road.
After the incident, Delhi Police ordered call centres in the NCR to drop female employees home safely and provide them security while travelling at night. The department also instructed PCR vans to be visible on roads and one officer to remain outside every such vehicle at all times.
Defence counsel Amit Srivastava told the court his client, Usman, had an alibi for the night: he was at a hospital for his youngest daughter’s birth. The judge dismissed the submission, saying it was "too late in the day to raise a fresh alibi".
The defence had also requested that the time served by the convicts -- nearly four years -- should be taken into account during the sentencing and they should be released at the earliest as the men were the sole bread winners for their families.

Top ten stocks which can give upto 98% return by next Diwali
ECONOMICTIMES.COM Oct 20, 2014, 12.39PM IST
We have collated a list of ten trading ideas, from different experts, which can give up to 98% return in the next 12 months or by next Diwali:
Analyst: Rahul Shah, Vice President -Equity Advisory Group, Motilal Oswal Securities
DCB: Target price set at Rs 110
DCB's new management restructured its balance sheet, improved underwriting standards with more focus on secured loans and other stringent criteria for loan approvals. NPA has showed steady improvement over FY10-14, with GNPA falling from 8.8% in FY09 to 1.7% in FY14.
DCB's current valuations of 1.7x FY15E P/ABV and 11x FY15E P/E do not reflect the bank's ability to scale up its redefined business model. We attach a fair P/ABV multiple of 2.3x FY15E, a 25% premium to comparable peers (small to medium sized banks) owing to higher advances growth, superior NIM, improving asset quality, robust earnings growth and improvement in return ratios.
Analyst: Daljeet S Kohli - Head of Research IndiaNivesh Securities
Reliance Industries Ltd: Target price set at Rs 1274
Reliance Industries would be one of the biggest beneficiaries of proposed hike in natural gas price. We believe successful discovery in MJ1 well and exploration in R-Series gas field in KG D6 block would help ramp up the production of natural gas in the next 2-3 years.
Despite a fall in international prices, petrochemicals margin would remain firm in the near term, driven by INR weakness and increase in polymer customs duty. The company's US$4bn pet coke gasification project remains on schedule for implementation by FY16 end, which will likely help in expansion on operating margin of refining business. Further, shale gas and retail business are also showing remarkable growth and likely to be a key revenue and profitability driver going ahead.
Ashiana Housing Ltd: Target price set at Rs 202
Ashiana Housing Ltd (AHL) is a unique asset light developer, with strong focus on pursuing real estate business in Tier II and III cities. Despite its focus on Tier II & III cities, AHL's financial health has not been majorly impacted by the recent economic slowdown.
We expect AHL to report FY16E RoE and RoCE of 35 per cent each. AHL is likely to report 149 per cent top-line CAGR during FY14-16E (to nearly Rs 6.9 bn), on the back of 3 projects entirely getting completed (Tree House, Utsav and Anantara) and some phases of the remaining 7 projects getting completed (Ashiana Town, Rangoli Gardens, Aangan, Gulmohar Gardens, Navrang, Vrinda Gardens, Dwarka and Umang).
We expect AHL to report 192 per cent PAT CAGR during FY14-16E. With substantial chunk of 6.8 mn sq. ft. of ongoing projects reaching revenue recognition threshold, we expect revenue visibility to sharply improve from here on.
 
Capital First Ltd: Target price set at Rs. 360
CFL has emerged as one of the fastest-growing NBFCs, backed by 1) clear management strategy and expertise in retail segment, 2) increasing focus on retail which is least impacted by slowdown in economy, 3) moving towards less risky segments like mortgage, consumer durables and two wheeler financing, and 4) strong promoter backing of Warburg group.
Further getting out of non-profitable business like securities and commodity broking in the last financial year and focus on core business of financing will be the key positive for the company.
We believe CLF is well placed to move on to the next stage of growth. Going forward, the company aims to focus on improving productivity from existing network. Thus, leveraging the cost to income ratio is likely to result in a healthy bottom-line growth.
Meghmani Organics Ltd: Target price set at Rs.34
Meghmani Organics Ltd, a leading global generic agrochemicals player and one of the largest blue pigments producers in the world, is seeing a significant business turnaround after many years of dismal performance.
With uptick in agrochemical cycle, the following triggers should lead to business turnaround: (1) margin expansion on the back of stabilization of recently commenced facilities, (2) better profitability in absence of incremental capex should lead to commencement of debt repayment, (3) With permissions in place from state-level Pollution Control Board, Meghmani is well positioned to ramp-up operations to peak capacity.
Also, (4) Implementation of stringent pollutions norms in China makes Indian agrochemical and pigments business attractive, and (5) ability to attract new order wins from MNC clients given that all safety and environment certifications are in place.
On account of industry down cycle and levered balance sheet of the company, the Meghmani stock has been trading at lower 1-year forward EV/EBITDA multiple of 3.9x. With revival in business cycle, we have assigned 5.9x EV/EBITDA multiple to arrive at FY16E based price target of Rs 34/share.

DOW DROPS 350 POINTSStock market scare as Dow drops 460 points
By Heather Long   @byHeatherLong October 15, 2014: 4:08 PM ET
 
Markets go for a wild ride
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
It's another "look out below" day in the stock market.
The Dow plunged as much as 460 points Wednesday afternoon before pulling back a bit, although a 173 point loss isn't anything to cheer. There wasn't an obvious trigger. Ebola and Europe's sour economy are clearly worrying. Earnings have been so-so, and retail sales data out this morning was disappointing.
October has been a brutal month, erasing most of the 2014 stock market gains. The Dow is negative for the year, and CNNMoney's Fear & Greed Index is showing extreme fear.
Most investors are better off not obsessing about the day to day market moves.
But if you're keeping an eye on the numbers, here are three critical stats to watch. There is no "magic number" that triggers a sell-off, but these indicators would be big red flags.
1. We're near a correction, but not there yet
Only a month ago, the S&P 500 index closed at an all-time high of 2,011. At its worst point on Wednesday, the index was down around 9.5% since that September high. That's rough, but it's not quite the 10% drop that would constitute a true correction, let alone the 20% drop that would signal a bear market.
Related: Stocks should fall more. Corrections are normal
Keep an eye on this number: 1,810. If the S&P 500 slips below that, we're in a correction. As of Wednesday afternoon, the S&P is hovering around 1,860.
(For those who like numbers, at the nadir of the financial crisis in March 2009, the S&P 500 closed below 700).
2. Volatility is back: It's getting windy, but not quite gale force wind levels
The VIX volatility index is currently at about 23.
Most days the stock market moves a little bit higher or lower. For instance, the S&P 500 moved less than 0.2% on Tuesday. But since the end of October, the stock market has had numerous "wild swings" where it shifts more than 1% (or even more than 2% in some cases).
Related: Is it time to exit stocks?
That's referred to as volatility. The VIX Index is the main measure of volatility. It has spiked about 80% in the past month -- a huge jump. The VIX was all over the place on Wednesday, but settled around 26. That's a lot higher than the 12 to 13 it was at a month ago.
But the unofficial alarm bell is when the VIX hits the 30 mark. It crossed that line briefly Wednesday before falling back.
3. Investors are putting money into bonds. It's debatable whether it's a 'freak out'
When investors get scared, they don't run to mom, they run to bonds, especially U.S. government bonds. The yield on the 10-year Treasury is a good indicator of just how many people are seeking the safe arms of the bond market.
When the yield falls, you know people are gobbling up bonds.
In the middle of September, the yield on the 10-year Treasury was around 2.6%. On Tuesday it was at 2.2%. That's a quick drop, but the real indicator of a meltdown would be for the yield to drop to 2% or even below.
Sure enough, on Wednesday, the yield fell below that mark several times, although it ended the day above 2.1%.
Dropping below that "magic two" number isn't unheard of . It happened in early 2013 and in 2012 when Europe was in the midst of a debt crisis and America's economic recovery was looking uncertain.
Market jitters are clearly back, but we're not quite in a "correction" yet.

Slowest China growth in five yearsChina is poised to report its slowest growth since the financial crisis
By Sophia Yan   @sophia_yan October 16, 2014: 9:29 PM ET
HONG KONG (CNNMoney)
China's economy is likely to have clocked its worst quarter in more than five years, according to a CNNMoney survey of economists.
Gross domestic product is forecast to have expanded by 7.2% in the third quarter, compared to the same period last year, according to a median estimate of 15 economists. That puts economic growth at its slowest pace since the first quarter of 2009, and well short of 7.5% expansion in the second quarter.
Economists surveyed expect full-year growth to come in at 7.3%, below the government's 7.5% target . Economic growth is forecast to dip further to 7% in 2015.
The National Bureau of Statistics will announce official third quarter GDP figures on Oct. 21.
China averaged growth of around 10% a year over the past three decades, pushing it up the list of biggest economies and boosting household wealth. But now, the pace of economic expansion is languishing -- China recorded GDP growth of 7.7% in the last two years, versus 9.3% in 2011 and 10.5% in 2010.
 
Russia eyes China after Europe snub
China's GDP growth remains the most comprehensive gauge of the country's economic health -- an important number to watch as the government works to reform the world's second-largest economy and shift to consumption-driven growth after years of exponential expansion.
Recent poor key economic data has added to concerns that China will fail to meet its growth target. While the government has previously said its willing to accept growth around 7.5%, it has continued to adopt incremental measures to boost the economy.
Related: The Shanghai Free Trade Zone is a dud
Six out of 10 economists surveyed identified the real estate sector as the biggest risk to the Chinese economy. After years of breakneck development, the sector now suffers from excess supply, slack investment and falling home prices.
"Given the challenging outlook of the housing sector, we expect Beijing to put forth more selective easing in order to avoid the worst," said Societe Generale's Wei Yao.
Experts are also sounding the alarm over ballooning corporate debt, according to the CNNMoney survey.
A few Chinese companies have defaulted on their debt in recent months-- a previously unheard of phenomenon -- and no government bailouts are in sight.
Worries have also escalated over the use of unconventional financing. Some firms, for example, have been using copper as collateral to secure loans. Experts are concerned that some companies are even using the same copper stockpiles to take out multiple loans, borrowing far more than they can repay.
Related: Half of China's wealthy plan to leave
Although rumors have persisted that Beijing may replace central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan, most economists say that any move to replace Zhou would be made because he is already past retirement age, and not because of policy disagreements.
Such a personnel change is unlikely to happen this year, and isn't expected to bring a policy shift -- the priorities of presumed successor Guo Shuqing align with those of Zhou, said Mizuho analysts.
Six out of eight economists say that the Chinese economy will see no or limited short-term impact from pro-democracy protests that have shaken Hong Kong over the last three weeks.
In the long run, if Hong Kong " loses its reputation as a trusted gateway for foreign capital to enter China, then it could hurt Chinese firms' access to cheap foreign capital, and potentially hold back ... other financial reforms," said Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics.

U.S. markets expected to bounce at openStocks: 4 things to know before the open
By Alanna Petroff   @AlannaPetroff October 17, 2014: 5:14 AM ET
Click chart for in-depth premarket data.
LONDON (CNNMoney)
It looks like it's time for a bounce after days of gut-wrenching volatility in the stock market.
Here are the four things you need to know before the opening bell rings in New York:
1. Comeback time: U.S. stock futures were definitively higher and most European markets were rising by more than 1% in early trading.
Investors are clearly feeling steadier after panic flooded the markets over the previous few days. The Nasdaq briefly hit correction territory on Thursday, signaling a 10% decline from a recent peak.
Even though markets had a wild ride on Thursday, stocks settled down at the end of the day and the indexes closed with only minor changes. The Dow lost 25 points, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq edged into positive territory.
CNNMoney's Fear & Greed index still shows investors are feeling extremely fearful.
Over in Asia , the main stock markets were mixed at the close of the week.
Related: China is poised to report its slowest growth since the financial crisis
2. Earnings and economics: Investors are waiting for General Electric ( GE ), Morgan Stanley ( MS ) and Honeywell ( HON ) to report quarterly earnings before the opening bell.
The U.S. government will post housing start data for September at 8:30 a.m. ET. The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index comes out at 9:55 a.m.
3. Stock market movers -- Google, Urban Outfitters, Rolls Royce: Shares in Google ( GOOGL , Tech30 ) are slipping premarket after the company's quarterly results showed third-quarter sales came in short of expectations. It also reported another decline in the average amount paid by advertisers when a user clicks on an ad.
Shares in Urban Outfitters ( URBN ) are plunging by 13% premarket after the retailer warned that third quarter earnings will be squeezed.
Rolls-Royce ( RYCEY ) is having a tough day on the London markets. Shares in the aircraft engine-maker are falling by about 8% after the firm warned that market conditions have deteriorated and some big customers are delaying and canceling orders because of Russian trade sanctions .
4. Shoes and shares: Shoemaker Jimmy Choo debuted on the London stock market Friday. Shares were relatively flat in early trading. The company picked the ticker symbol "CHOO".

Stock market panic takes a timeoutStock market panic takes a timeout
By Matt Egan   @mattmegan5 October 16, 2014: 4:53 PM ET
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
Apparently all Wall Street needed to end its panic attack was a little money printing talk.
U.S. stocks ended another wild day of trading mostly unchanged, rebounding from an early 200-point plunge on the Dow that was sparked by fears of a global slowdown.
The big comeback was triggered by a Federal Reserve official who suggested the central bank could abandon its plan to pull away the easy money punch bowl that's been juicing stock prices for years.
"The market loves free money. If the Fed wants to print it, we go higher. Don't fight it," said Joe Saluzzi, co-head of trading at Themis Trading.
Fed officials are clearly taking notice of the extreme turbulence that has hit the markets in recent days due to fears about Europe's economy, the Ebola outbreak and plunging oil prices. Just look at Wednesday, when the Dow plummeted as much as 460 points but ended the day down "only" 173 points.
The wave of selling over the past month has left all three major indexes flirting with their first "correction" in years.
The Nasdaq briefly hit correction territory on Thursday, signaling a 10% decline from a previous closing high. But it's since bounced back from those levels.
Despite closing off its lows, the Dow did fall 25 points Thursday. That means it's closed lower for six days in a row for the first time since August 2013. The S&P 500 ended virtually unchanged.
Related: This is NOT another financial crisis
Fed to the rescue? The bulls on Wall Street launched their comeback after James Bullard, president of the St. Louis Fed, told Bloomberg News the Fed should weigh delaying the end to quantitative easing, or QE. The bond-buying experiment that has helped send stocks to record highs and had been poised to end this month.
A decision by the Fed to keep the program going would represent a big 180 and a positive for stocks and other risky assets that have benefited from the stimulus.
"This big flip flop from the guy I refer to as 'the Godfather of QE' is a game changer," Michael Block, chief strategist at Rhino Trading Partners, wrote in a note to clients. "This is a powerful signal that the Fed remains accommodative and is concerned with asset prices and volatility enough to consider the seemingly unthinkable step of continuing and even growing QE from current levels."
Wall Street will be listening very closely to Fed chief Janet Yellen's speech Friday morning. Signs that she is worried about the recent economic developments could give stocks a further boost.
Related: Has the Fed run out of ammo?
Not all gloom & doom: Besides more magic from the Fed, stocks received support from a number of positive U.S. data points.
There's fresh evidence the job market is getting healthier. Claims for first-time unemployment benefits tumbled last week to the lowest level since April 2000.
"I think it speaks loudly about the sturdiness of the labor market. That's the underpinning of a self-sustaining economic recovery," said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott.
The better economic headlines may have helped boost crude oil, which took a break from its month-long plunge to close over 1% higher.
That was good news for the beaten-down energy sector of the stock market, which was actually the best performer on the day. So was a $5.4 billion sale of wells by Chesapeake Energy ( CHK ), which surged 17%.
Also, a number of major companies reported quarterly earnings that exceeded expectations. Shares of Delta Air Line ( DAL )s and UnitedHealth ( UNH ) rallied on their earnings beats. Delta soothed Ebola jitters by saying it's not seeing a drop in demand due to the deadly virus.
European jitters persist: The early selloff was fueled by more worries about European growth, which has slowed to a near halt. Some countries, including even economic powerhouse Germany, are teetering on the brink of recession.
Markets in France and Germany retreated and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 tumbled nearly 3%. Virtually all European markets are now in correction territory.
New problems are also emerging in the high-debt nations on Europe's periphery. Greece's stock and bond markets have been in free fall this week and Spain held a bond auction that failed to meet its target.

Baby Boomers overexposed to stocksBaby Boomers are overexposed to stocks in this rocky market
By Melanie Hicken   @melhicken October 17, 2014: 10:07 AM ET
 
Biggest retirement mistakes
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
Even though they've seen their fair share of stock market crashes, many Baby Boomers are betting a big chunk of their retirement savings on stocks -- leaving them exposed to major losses in today's rocky market.
Among 60-to-65 year olds, 30% have invested almost all of their savings in stocks, while 52% have more than 70% of their nest egg in stocks, according to an analysis of 10,000 users (split among three different age groups) of FeeX, which helps users find lower investment fees.
Getting help
That's a risky move.
For a well-balanced portfolio, financial planners say that savers in this age group should have no more than 60% of their assets in stocks. The rest should be split among more conservative assets like bonds and money market funds that can cushion the blow of sell-offs like the one we're currently in.
Related: Asset allocation: Fix your mix
Amid fears surrounding Ebola and slowing global growth, both the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Index are down more than 5% from a month ago, and some experts say it could signal the start of a market correction, when the market drops by at least 10%.
While there's no way to know which direction stocks will go, older investors simply don't have the time to ride out such big market fluctuations.
"If you're a couple of years away from retirement, you're really rolling the dice," said Erik Laurence, vice president of marketing and business development at FeeX.
Related: What the heck should the Fed do now?
When stocks are plunging, age-appropriate allocations can help shield older investors from such steep losses, said Scott Tiras, a Houston-based Ameriprise financial adviser who works mainly with older clients.
"Diversification is so important...especially for someone who is going to be dependent on that portfolio sooner rather than later," he said.
So what's an overexposed Boomer to do?
Now is the time to check those 401(k) statements closely and make sure you have the appropriate asset mix. To help you figure out what that mix should be, try taking this risk tolerance quiz or using our asset allocation calculator.
If you find that you're too heavily weighted in stocks, let the current market volatility serve as a friendly reminder to put a more conservative strategy in place.

Yes, that may mean selling at a loss compared to a few months ago. But stocks are still relatively flat for the year. And they're leaps and bounds higher than they were in 2008.
Of course, you could also hold tight and see what happens in coming weeks and months. But in that case, "the market might do the re-balancing for you," said Judith Ward, a senior financial planner at T. Rowe Price.

Time to shop  til you drop for cheap stocksBy Paul R. La Monica   @lamonicabuzz October 16, 2014: 1:16 PM ET
 
Yes, it's time to go shopping for stocks
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
Stocks are on sale. The market's sharp pullback should have investors excited instead of doing their best Chicken Little impersonation.
You read that correctly. While your heart may be telling you it's time to get out of the market, panicking while stocks are plunging has historically been the wrong thing to do .
Time and time again, savvy investors like Warren Buffett and the late Sir John Templeton made a killing by purchasing bargain stocks after big drops.
Templeton was famous for saying that his investing philosophy was to buy when others were "despondently selling" and sell when others were "avidly buying."
The trouble is that many stocks that have fallen on hard times have done so for very good reasons. A cheap stock might be too good to be true -- the market's version of the house that Tom Hanks and Shelley Long bought in "The Money Pit."
Experts even have a phrase for beaten down stocks that deserve to be in the dumps: a value trap. (Cue Admiral Ackbar from "Return of the Jedi: It's a trap! )
To avoid getting caught in one of these, I ran a stock screen with some nifty software from FactSet so I could find high-quality companies trading at outlet mall prices.
Related: When will companies stop hoarding cash?
How to find the bargains: Now I realize that not everyone has access to such tools. Fortunately, there are several great stock screens you can use online for free.
The Nasdaq has a really solid one that's powered by Zacks. A site called Finviz.com has a good one too. The finance sites of both Google and Yahoo also have such tools. And if you have an online brokerage account, there's a good chance that you can access one there too.
I encourage any long-term investor to play around with some screens. Looking at raw data eliminates much of the emotion that can cause you to make bad mistakes.
For my screen, I started by looking for companies that are technically in a bear market. They are at least 20% below their 52-week highs.
I then made sure that the companies have relatively little debt and also pay dividends. Strong balance sheets and a willingness to reward investors with cash payments is a sign of quality.
I also set up the screen to find companies trading at reasonable valuations (a price-to-earnings ratio of less than 15 based on earnings estimates for 2015) that should also be able to post healthy levels of profit growth.
Here are some of the companies that made it through my vetting process.
1) Time to go on autopilot? Several auto-related companies popped up, including major carmakers GM ( GM ) and Honda ( HMC ). A couple of parts makers also met all my criteria: Johnson Controls ( JCI ), Magna International ( MGA ) and BorgWarner ( BWA ).
This makes sense. Despite serious economic problems in Europe, the automotive industry should continue to do extremely well in the United States. Sales are strong and if gas prices keep plunging , that could help make trucks and SUVs more popular as well.
2) Sifting through the tech wreck: Tech stocks have fallen harder than the broader market -- and many momentum techs should be pulling back because their valuations were, to be blunt, absurd. I'm looking at you Netflix ( NFLX , Tech30 ), Amazon ( AMZN , Tech30 ) and Twitter ( TWTR , Tech30 )!
But several tech stocks that are not trading at 2000 dot-com bubble levels look attractive. SAP ( SAP , Tech30 ) is cheap and remains a powerhouse in business software. And two companies that should continue to benefit from the mobile revolution are flash memory chip company SanDisk ( SNDK ) and Gorilla Glass owner Corning ( GLW ), are definitely bargains right now.
3) Check out the retail bargain bin: Drugstore king Walgreen ( WAG ) is a great value right now. Investors seem a little too concerned by the fact that it wasn't able to lower its tax bill with its acquisition of European pharmacy chain Alliance Boots .
Two other well-known retailers made the cut. Gap ( GPS ) and Best Buy ( BBY ). Investors may be overreacting to the news that the Gap's CEO is stepping down next year and that sales hit a rough patch lately.
 
Mind The Gap: Stock plummets as CEO departs
As for Best Buy, I'll readily admit the company still faces tough competition from the likes of Amazon and Wal-Mart ( WMT ). But Best Buy is not RadioShack ( RSH ). The company actually has a successful turnaround strategy in place. Profits are growing after all. The stock got ahead of itself last year and now appears to be reasonably priced as investors recognize the risks.
4) Black gold: Yes, crude prices have plunged. But the sell-off in energy stocks appears to be massively overdone. So it's no surprise that many leading oil companies are on the list.
Oil services titan Schlumberger ( SLB ) looks attractive. Ditto for shares of Chinese energy giant PetroChina ( PTR ) as well as big U.S. refiners Valero ( VLO ) and Marathon Petroleum ( MPC ).
Now does this mean that these stocks are guaranteed to go up in the next few days or weeks? Of course not. The broader market sell-off may not be done yet.
But investors (not traders) looking to scoop up blue chips for the long haul should be salivating right now: 20% off sales like this don't happen that often.
Reader Comment of the Week! Why do I heart Twitter so much? Because there are tons of smart people using it.
I often find great story ideas there. Case in point. Aaron Levitt tweeted this to me Wednesday afternoon.
"Everyone keeps forgetting that 2011 was a down year for stocks. Started off great, finished in the red."
I remembered that 2011 had that nasty correction. But I forgot it was so bad that stocks actually went down that year. And that inspired me to write a piece about how this stock slump is a lot more like 2011 than 2008 .
So thanks, Aaron! But I wonder what you are going to do after the next Fed meeting? The "Keep Calm and Taper On" background image on your profile page is going to need to change!

Coming soon: Call Starbucks  and have your latte waitingNew Starbucks app will have your latte waiting

Starbucks for life
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
For those of you who just can't wait to spend $4 for your Venti latte, Starbucks is about to allow customers to pre-order and prepay for their daily caffeine hit using a mobile app.
The service, aimed at attracting customers who are put off by the lines during the morning rush, will debut in the Portland market later this year and be rolled out to stores nationally in 2015, the company announced Thursday.
Related: Starbucks workers gets raises, new dress code and a snack
The announcement comes about a week after Square , which makes mobile payment technology, unveiled an app that also allows users to order coffee using their phone so that it's ready and paid for when customers arrive. But for now, it only works at a few coffee shops in New York and San Francisco.
Starbucks ( SBUX ) already has a smartphone app which allows customers to make mobile payments, including tipping their baristas . Starbucks said it will also enhance its loyalty program and rewards for customers using the app.
There is growing demand for online payment options by consumers. Mobile payments are likely to reach $3.5 billion this year, according to research firm eMarketer, and is forecast to soar to $118 billion annually within four years. Apple ( AAPL , Tech30 ) is set to start its own mobile payment system, Apple Pay , on Monday.

(The PM ran a gruelling campaign,…)
By Suresh Prabhu
Five months ago, a new star was born on the Indian political horizon. He came from virtually nowhere and occupied the centre stage in national politics by creating history. BJP's electoral victory was unique, for not only was it the first time in India's political history that BJP won a majority on its own in Parliament but also for the first time in 30 years that a single party had won a majority. It was also a first nationwide victory for a leader whose influence, up until a few months prior to the election, was confined to a state and who in turn became a national hero and won seats for his party in almost all parts of the country, despite having been in national politics for a very short period of time. For the first time, a person not from any dynastic family had become the prime minister solely on his own merit.
The series of firsts does not end there. If we consider the state election results, BJP has emerged as the primary force in either state and has for the first time won a majority on its own in Haryana and has emerged as the single largest party in Maharashtra with more than 120 seats, having left all other parties behind in its wake. The PM ran a gruelling campaign, campaigning probably for the first time as extensively for a state election, and staked his personal stature on its outcome. In a democracy, it should be natural for a leader to seek the people's mandate in the form of an endorsement of his leadership. But the fact that Modi did that even for a state election shows his supreme confidence in the innate support of the electorate for what he stands for. The way the electorate has voted in Maharashtra and Haryana have proved him right. In Maharashtra, BJP got one-third of the votes and over 40 per cent of the seats. It has created new phenomena in Indian politics.
From 1971 onwards, Indira Gandhi had won elections for her party by appealing to voters on her personal charisma. Modi has succeeded in establishing himself as an unchallenged leader on the national level by expanding the base of his party in all states. This result is not only an alarm bell but poses a serious existential threat to another national party, Congress. For not only has it now been reduced to its lowest ever tally in Parliament, it is facing a massive erosion in its vote share. The party is losing allies and governments in states at an alarming pace. In Maharashtra, Congress vote-bank politics has boomeranged as is evident from SP and AIMIM garnering large number of votes. Even in the tribal belts, Congress has lost its traditional support. In fact, in Maharashtra, Congress also lost in areas dominated by scheduled castes. In fact, the party lost in all the four regions of Maharashtra; but particularly its losses are severe in Vidarbha, which has traditionally been the bedrock of Congress support. During the post-emergency election, Vidarbha returned Congress MLAs in such large numbers that Nashikrao Tirpude became deputy CM, because even if in other regions Congress had fared poorly, Vidarbha stood behind Indira Gandhi.
It is alarming for Congress that the middle class in urban areas has turned its back to the party in successive elections. This result would provide a huge fillip for Modi to take bold decisions to bring economy back on track. Modi can now move on with his ambitious agenda to set India on a high growth trajectory.

The stock ended the day in red at 934.75; down 0.36 per cent, on the BSE.
Among other things, the government increased natural gas price to US$5.6 from US$4.2/mmbtu. The Cabinet modified the Rangarajan formula approved by previous UPA government to bring down the increase in rates from $8.4 to $5.61.
The price increase by 33 per cent to US$5.6/mmbtu will reset every six months instead of three months earlier.
However, Reliance Industries will continue to get current $4.2 rate till it makes up for shortfall in output from KG-D6 block.
"The gas price decisions may leave a tinge of disappointment for Reliance, though, unless the government clarifies its stance on price premiums for undeveloped deep and ultra-deep discoveries," said Barclays Equity Research report.
"The announcements may disappoint Reliance, though, as it will still realize the older US$4.2 for D1-D3 output, with the revenue differential flowing to an escrow, till the arbitration on output shortfall is concluded. This may take years although the GCV linkage will still raise effective prices to US$4.6 for now, in our view."
The rise in gas prices may not be enough for Reliance to commit new capital to E&P projects, say analysts.
CLSA in its post election report says the big bang reforms will be neutral for Reliance Industries. ONGC and Oil India are preferred picks on the back of these announcements, the brokerage said.

Tata Steel s recent plans credit positive: M...Corus Group Plc
(Tata Steel's decision to…)
NEW DELHI: Tata Steel's decision to sell its long product business in the UK and its bank debt refinance plan will be credit positive and alleviate funding pressure, Moody's Investors Service said today.
"The sale would be credit positive for Tata Steel UK Holdings (TSUKH) because it would dispose off loss-making assets, while its refinancing alleviates funding pressure for the next six years," the financial research firm said in its Credit outlook for the company.
"Moreover, having sorted most of TSUKH's challenges, Tata Steel, its parent, can now solely focus on growing its more profitable Indian business," it added.
Last week, Tata Steel said it has begun negotiations to sell TSUKH's long products business to global commodities giant Klesch Group. The negotiations involve several UK-based assets including its Scunthorpe steelworks as well as other distribution and downstream operations in France and Germany.
Scunthorpe, with a capacity of 4.5 million tonnes, has been underutilised compared to its other steelworks, driving down the margins of the group. Prospects for the European long-steel sector are grim, it said, adding TSUKH's other assets are doing better.
TSUKH also announced the refinancing of its bank debt through a term loan and revolving credit facilities of Euro 3.1 billion. This bank debt was originally incurred with the Euro 13 billion acquisition of Corus Group plc (unrated) in 2007.
The new financing structure lengthens TSUKH's debt maturity profile, and has no covenant for most of its duration," it said.
"With smaller, more specialised operations and completed refinancing, we believe TSUKH's drag on Tata Steel will recede and allow management to focus on growing its very profitable Indian business. We expect Tata Steel India to maintain its volume growth and strong profitability with EBITDA per tonne of around $260," Moody's Investor Service said.
Early next year, Tata Steel India is slated to open the first phase of the Odisha project, which will add 3 million tonnes of crude steel capacity.
"This will bring the capacity of the Indian business to 10 million metric tonnes, or 50 per cent of Tata Steel's total capacity. When Tata Steel India acquired Corus in 2007, this proportion was 15 per cent," it said.

Sensex surges over 300 pts; expect a cracker of a rally after DiwaliStrong start to Diwali week, markets on track to hit fresh highs in November

(The government announced…)
NEW DELHI: After closing on a subdued note last week, the Indian markets managed to surge over 400 points in trade on Monday in the run-up to Diwali, after the government announced a slew of reforms in the oil & gas sector, which can trigger the next leg of rally in the markets.
The government announced a slew of reform measures, such as diesel price deregulation and hike in natural gas price, post the victory in recently-held elections in Maharashtra & Haryana.
The BJP has got a majority in Haryana and will form its government for the first time in the state. It has emerged as the single largest party in Maharashtra, but will have to patch up with old ally Shiv Sena to form a government.
With less than two trading sessions away from this Diwali and eight sessions left in the month of October, market gurus are hopeful that benchmark indices should be able to hit fresh record highs in the month of November.
"The election win will help the BJP increases numbers in Rajya Sabha , which will help in passing reforms. The key reforms have started. Diesel regulation, gas price hike and labour reforms are just the beginning," said market expert A K Prabhakar .
"The government is behaving like a corporate - the way reform process is going forward," he added. Even though FIIs remain net sellers in the month of October, the trend is likely to change in November, added Prabhakar, who thinks that fresh highs for the Nifty can come in the second week of November when FIIs turn net buyers.
Both the Sensex and the Nifty recorded their respective fresh life-time high on 8th September 2014. The BSE Sensex recorded its all-time high of 27354.99 and the Nifty hit a fresh record high of 8180.2.
Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have pulled out a massive Rs 3,755 crore from the Indian stock market since the beginning of this month, mainly on account of profit booking.
Prabhakar is of the view that this is not the first time that FIIs have become net sellers in October. In the last 10 years "we have witnessed a similar trend, because they have to meet their maturity date."
The market has given a thumbs-up as the BJP has won the Haryana State assembly polls and is the single largest party in Maharashtra. The result would add heft to the already formidable political weight of the Prime Minister.
"By holding extensive rallies across both the States, Mr. Modi can claim to have turned the fortunes of his party in the States single-handedly," said Ajay Bodke, Head- Investment Strategy & Advisory, Prabhudas Lilladher.
"Markets hope that the strengthening of his hand would embolden Mr. Modi to roll out aggressive reforms that had enthused global & domestic investors into driving up the Indian equity market to dizzying heights this calendar year," he added.
The S&P BSE Sensex has plunged over 500 points so far in the month of October, as of data collected on 17 October. The weakness in the index was largely led by a sell-off in global markets, including India.
Many factors have been blamed for this recent global equity correction, including growth fears, Ebola and the Middle East tensions. But analysts say that the correction is more of a short-term phenomenon and long-term investors should look at buying on dips.
"This is consolidation and corrective phase going on for the market on account of volatility in global markets due to drifting global growth and other macro issues," said Siddharth Sedani, Vice President (Portfolio Management Service) at Microsec Capital Ltd.
"We reiterate that post this assembly election results, the government would have a strong go on business and reforms which may bring visible changes on the ground and improve earnings of the corporates in the quarters to come," he added. Sedani is of the view that the markets are heading upwards and may hit fresh highs going forward.

3 black eyes in the U.S. job market3 black eyes in the job market
By Patrick Gillespie   @CNNMoney October 17, 2014: 9:27 AM ET
A man holds a sign saying he will work for food.
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
A casual glance at the job market makes it appear that things are a lot better. The unemployment rate was 7.2% a year ago. Now it's 5.9%.
But there's a dark side to this recovery: Millions of people are still unemployed or underemployed.
A close look at three types of frustrated job seekers underscores why the American economy is still struggling.
1. The 'glass is half-empty' workers: Part-time jobs remain a big problem. Over seven million Americans want full-time work, but can only find part-time hours.
Statisticians dubbed this group "involuntary part-time workers."
There are 54% more part-time workers now than when the recession began in December 2007. In other recent recessions, the number of part-timers peaked and then quickly dropped. Since this recession ended, it peaked and is now trickling down very slowly, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Related: Are you a part-time worker? Share your story with CNN
Part-time employment raises questions about the quality of jobs people are finding in the recovery.
"It's one of the big differences between the labor market during this recovery and this crisis compared with previous business cycles," said Jeremy Lawson, chief economist at asset management firm Standard Life Investments in Boston. "It's a group of people that would like a different type of job, but this is the only one they can get."
2. The 'I'm done' crowd: Some job seekers want work, but see such dim chances of employment, they stopped looking for a job four weeks ago. For a slew of reasons — skills, age or no available work — these would-be workers have stopped searching for jobs. These are discouraged workers.
The number of discouraged workers is down considerably from its peak in December 2010. But unfortunately, the current number, about 700,000, is almost double what it was when the recession began.
Discouraged workers represent only a fraction of the issue though. The "missing," workforce that government data does not capture is significantly higher. Missing workers are not employed or looking for jobs because of poor employment prospects, according to a report from the Economic Policy Institute in Washington, a left-leaning think tank.
"We're talking about over 5 million workers who should be in the workforce if we had a healthy economy, but have dropped out over the past four or five years" says Josh Bivens, a labor economist at EPI.
Related: Yellen: Economy still needs Fed stimulus
3. The 'lost workers': People who can't find work for months represent one of the most concerning indicators of the current job market.
At the start of the recession, 17% of all unemployed people were out of work for six months or longer. In September, almost a third of the unemployed population was jobless for half a year or more.
Although long-term unemployment has declined a bit recently, policymakers are still concerned. The Obama administration announced new measures this week to help long-term unemployed workers find jobs.
Related: Janet Yellen wants you to get a raise
Examined a little closer, long-term unemployment is becoming a bigger issue for women. About 35% of long-term jobless workers were women in 2007. Now that number is 44%, according to a recent study by the Congressional Budget Office. Still, men make up the majority of people looking for work for six months or more.
The impact of long-term unemployment goes beyond money.
"To look unsuccessfully for work for over a year, a year and a half, is, psychologically, very discouraging" says Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution in Washington. Once government unemployment benefits run out, "Many people temporarily or permanently give up the search."
Economists say the job market will continue to improve, but may take years for these economic wounds to fully heal.

Should you buy gold this Diwali | Smart ways to buy the yellow metal on DhanterasCan gold bounce back? Here's why experts feel that you should give yellow metal a miss this Diwali
Narendra Nathan, ET Bureau Oct 20, 2014, 10.33AM IST

(While the one-year loss…)
What will you buy on muhurat day? Will you stock up on equities or will you go for gold? To some buyers, gold might appear very attractive right now. The domestic gold price is down more than 18% from its all-time high of Rs 33,265 per 10 gm recorded in August 2013. The past 15 months, in fact, have been devastating for gold investors. The price of the yellow metal has slipped, turning conventional wisdom on its head. Even now, analysts believe that gold faces headwinds that could take prices down in the near to medium term.
This is not good news for buyers getting ready for Dhanteras shopping. After all, their blind faith in gold had delivered handsome returns in the past decade. This changed last year, with gold churning out losses for investors who bought the yellow metal on the muhurat day in 2012 and held it till the 2013 Diwali. While the one-year loss on 2012 Diwali gold purchase was 4%, the loss till date from the 2013 Diwali gold purchase is 10%.
So, will you buy gold on Dhanteras this year? Experts say investors should give gold a miss this Diwali. Even if they want to buy gold for religious purposes, they should restrict their purchases to a small token quantity. Let us look at the global and domestic factors that are working against the yellow metal in the short and medium terms.
Strengthening dollar
International gold is traded in dollars, and if the greenback strengthens, the value of gold goes down. The dollar has strengthened 7% against other currencies in the past year (see chart). This is mainly because of fears that the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates. "International gold prices should fall by around 10% from current levels by March 2015," says Kishore Narne, associate director, Motilal Oswal Commodities Broker.
 
Falling inflation
Gold is a good hedge against inflation and global investors get on the gold train only when they fear that inflation will go up. After fears of inflation, the European Union (EU) region is facing the threat of deflation, mainly due to the fall in global commodity prices. The international crude oil (Brent variety) is now trading at $83 per barrel, a two-year low. Most global agriculture commodities are also at multi-year lows. The inflationary pressure has ebbed significantly in the US as well.
Investors deserting gold
Investors have also deserted the gold market. The gold holdings of the SPDR Gold Trust, the largest gold ETF in the world, are down 44% from their peak of 1,353 tonnes in December 2012. They don't see any upside potential now from the current levels. "Gold is no more in a buy zone. At best, it is in a hold zone," says Sudip Bandyopadhyay, president, Destimoney Securities. Domestic investors are also deserting gold because of the recent drop in price. "The investors who bought gold above Rs 30,000 are panicky," says Hasmukh Bafna, president of the Gold Chains and Jewellery Wholesalers Welfare Association. People shifting to investments such as stocks is another reason for this dullness in the domestic gold market. "People are still buying small quantities of jewellery, but the demand for gold bars and coins has almost dried down," says Prithviraj Kothari, president of the Bombay Bullion Association. However, analysts don't see a major downside because the current price is close to the mining cost. "Gold has a strong support at $1,180 because the gold mining costs are around $1,150," says C P Krishnan, whole time director, Geojit Comtrade.
Faltering demand
The consumption demand for gold is down partly due to the government's restrictions on imports. Domestic demand may bounce back once these restrictions are withdrawn, but the demand slowdown in China, the biggest gold consumer, may continue. "China has witnessed a moderation in purchases following the hectic buying in the previous year. This will be a drag on prices," says Naveen Mathur, associate director, commodities & currencies at Angel Broking.
Rupee may not weaken significantly
The domestic gold price is down 18% from its peak, but the international gold price is down by 35%. The decline of the rupee against the dollar had cushioned the fall of gold in the domestic market. Though the rupee may weaken more if the US Fed raises interest rates, the impact will be limited because the RBI is better prepared. The rupee has remained relatively stable in the Rs 60-62 per dollar range despite a significant jump in the Dollar Index in the past three months.
Import duty to come down

Shiv Sena goes into huddle as BJP keeps Uddhav Thackeray guessing on govt formationComments
The RSS on Monday  increased the suspense on government formation in Maharashtra by saying it was up to the  BJP to accept or turn down the NCP's offer of unconditional support.
Talking to media persons after the conclusion of a three-day conclave, Sah Sarkaryavahak Bhaiyyaji Joshi said it "was best left to the BJP to take a call on the basis on merit."
"This is a political issue and should be left to the BJP," he said while answering a question on whether it was morally right to go with Sharad Pawar's NCP after targeting it during the campaign.
Meanwhile Sharad Pawar tweeted the NCP would not compromise with fundamentals and that the unconditional support to BJP was to ensure that Maharashtra gets a stable government.
Earlier in the day Shiv Sena leaders were in a huddle on what terms to set for joining a BJP-led government in Maharashtra.
The BJP right now has not fully revealed its cards on whether it would ask the Sena to join  the government or accept the outside support offered by Sharad Pawar's NCP.
With just 23 short of majority, the BJP's gameplan clearly is to wear down the Sena and make it put up as less demands as possible, including one for the post of chief minister on a rotational basis.
The visit of union home minister Rajnath Singh, who was to attend a crucial BJP meeting here Monday , has been deferred.
"The new date would be announced later," leader of Opposition in legislative council Vinod Tawde said.
 
BJP has appointed Singh and senior leader J P Nadda as central observers to choose its legislature party leader in Maharashtra.
The Sena however continued to put up a brave fact, taking a swipe at Narendra Modi in its editorial in party mouthpiece Saamna saying the "wave" seen during the campaign had lost its force.
Expressing doubts over the survival of the state amid a hung house, it said the BJP, Congress and NCP benefited from multi-cornered contests.
"Break up of the Sena-BJP alliance and division of votes due to four and five-cornered fights in all seats benefited BJP as well as Congress-NCP. The Sena-BJP split benefited Congress-NCP.
Watch: Modi deserves credit for BJP's victory in Maharashtra, says Majid Memon
Given the Lok Sabha results, both these parties could not have won more than 25 seats together," the editorial said.
The Shiv Sena will not comment on how it views the results as of now, because what is important is the view of the "all powerful voters" who gave a fractured verdict, it said.
"With no party getting a clear majority, there are doubts how the state will survive because of the instability," the editorial said.
Taking a swipe at Modi and the BJP, the editorial said the "wave" seen during the campaign had lost its force even before reaching the shores.
In some places, there was more foam and less water in the wave," it quipped.

Access to electricity in India has no impact on climate change

Climate Change
(Pachauri added, expanding…)
LONDON: Improving household electricity access in India over the last 30 years contributed only marginally to the country's total carbon emissions growth during that time, according to a new study.
While increased energy access is widely agreed to be an important goal for development efforts, such as the UN Sustainable Energy for All Initiative, the climate impacts of increased access to electricity have been unclear.
The study is the first to examine the impact of electricity access on carbon dioxide emissions using two sources of retrospective data.
"This study shows that the climate impacts of expanding access are in fact very small," said Shonali Pachauri , from the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis ( IIASA ) in Austria, who conducted the study.
However, she added, expanding low-carbon energy technologies in developing countries would bring many co-benefits beyond climate mitigation.
While India still lacks electricity access for much of its population - around 400 million people - the country has vastly increased access in the last 30 years, researchers said.
From 1981 to 2011, household electricity access in the country improved from around 25 per cent to between 67-74 per cent of the population, an increase of approximately 650 million people.
"India is at a similar stage to many other developing countries in terms of energy access, So we believe that these findings will be applicable on a broad scale to other developing countries," said Pachauri.
Using two data sources, the study found that improved electricity access in India from 1981 to 2011 accounted for approximately 50 million tonnes of CO2, or 3-4 per cent of the rise in total national CO2 emissions.
Since electrification also tends to lead to increased wealth and participation in the economy, it can also lead to additional increases in emissions from indirect energy use through consumption.
Pachauri found that when she took these factors into account, household electricity use would account for 156 to 363 million tonnes CO2, or 11 to 25 per cent of emissions growth in the country.
However, even with increased electricity use, Indian households still use less electricity than Chinese households, and less than 10 per cent of households in the US.
Researchers said that even though the emissions growth from expanded energy access is small, low carbon energy sources have additional benefits for developing countries and should be encouraged.
"Energy access is fundamental to development: it brings improvements to all aspects of life, including education, communication, and health," said Pachauri.
The study was published in the journal Nature Climate Change .

Everybody tried to find faults in me  says Preity ZintaEverybody tried to find faults in me, says Preity Zinta

Earlier this month, Preity Zinta tweeted that she had thrown a man out of a movie theatre for refusing to stand up for the National Anthem. It didn’t go down well with those on the social media platform.
However, when we met the actor at the Mumbai Film Festival, and brought up the subject, Preity claimed, “…about four people wrote negative things”.

You received flak after tweeting that you forced a man to leave a theatre for not standing up for the National Anthem.
People inside the theatre objected when this person didn’t stand for the National Anthem. I supported their stance. I come from a defence background. My father fought wars for this country, and my brother is at the border now. I shouldn’t really have to justify my action. Also, there was no flak. There were about four people who wrote negative things, but thousands of others who spoke in support.
You also took to Twitter to refute speculations that you were selling your stakes in Kings XI Punjab (the Indian Premier League team Preity co-owns).
It’s unfortunate that I had to come out and say it, and that people speculated otherwise.
Detractors have labelled some of your recent acts publicity stunts. Does that bother you?
In India — although I love this country — women have to fight extra for everything... If you invest in something, people say somebody else might have done it for you. It’s as if a woman is not capable of doing anything on her own. But I have always taken a stand for things that I felt were right. But I felt like everybody suddenly tried to find faults in me.
What’s keeping you from signing new films?
I don’t want to repeat myself, or do the same stuff I did 10 years ago. I will do films only if they appeal to me. Currently, I am busy with two-three different projects.
What are these projects?
You will know soon.
A number of Bollywood celebrities lent their support to the present edition of the Mumbai Film Festival (MFF). What’s your take on that?
We, as actors, go to different parts of the world to attend film festivals. So, I think we should appreciate and be there for our own festival as well. Today, I am what I am because of this industry. It is my duty to come out and support it.

Live: No decision yet on pact with BJP  says SenaPrint
The BJP performed superbly in the Haryana and Maharashtra polls. The party is set to form a government in both the states. While Haryana is easy as it has a simple majority there, Maharashtra is proving to be a bit difficult as it has only 122 seats and needs 145 to form the government. Hectic parleys are on between various parties to form the government. Who will the BJP ally with?

Sensex up over 300 points; cracker of a rally on the cards post DiwaliStrong start to Diwali week, markets on track to hit fresh highs in November

Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML)Gross mortgage lending £18.6 billion in August, says CML
18 Sep 14
The Council of Mortgage Lenders estimates that gross mortgage lending reached £18.6 billion in August. This is 5% lower than July (£19.7 billion) but 13% higher than August last year (£16.4 billion) and the highest lending total for an August since 2008 (£19.3 billion).
Commenting on market conditions in this month’s Market Commentary, CML chief economist Bob Pannell observes:
"The narrative of recovering house purchase and buy-to-let activity continued through August. However, it is important to be aware that this picture is being flattered by strong seasonal factors through the summer period.
"A gentle slowing of lending activity may now be in prospect, as a result of the continuing impact of tighter lending rules and a softening of the London market."
Notes to editors
1. The Council of Mortgage Lenders' members are banks, building societies and other lenders who together undertake around 95% of all residential mortgage lending in the UK. There are 11.1 million mortgages in the UK, with loans worth over £1.2 trillion.
2. The Council of Mortgage Lenders does not publish statistics for mortgage approvals. The data in our monthly mortgage lending press release and gross lending press releases relate to mortgage advances only. A mortgage approval is the firm offer to a customer of a specific amount of credit secured against a particular property. A mortgage advance is the total amount of loan actually provided to the buyer, by the lender.
3. Next month's gross mortgage lending press release and market commentary will be published on Monday 20 October 2014.
 

UN asks $1B for Ebola  gets a tiny fractionUN's $1 billion fast-track fund for Ebola falls woefully short

Melinda Gates on Ebola: 'Vast inequities'
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
Days after United Nations Secretary Genera Ban Ki-moon highlighted the slow response to his call for donations to help fight Ebola, the money is starting to trickle in.
Australia, Colombia and Venezuela have deposited a combined $14 million into a special trust fund the U.N. created in September to provide training, equipment and care for people suffering from the deadly disease in West Africa.
The U.N. said last Friday that the fund, which is earmarked at $1 billion, had only received $100,000. At that time, countries had pledged nearly $20 million, but only Colombia had delivered the money.
More countries have committed $50 million to the fund, the U.N. announced Tuesday.
Ban welcomed the show of support, including a $5 million pledge announced Tuesday by his native Republic of Korea. But the U.N. stressed that "much more is needed" to combat the worst Ebola outbreak in history.
Thousands of people in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea have been stricken with Ebola. The World Health Organization estimates the virus has killed 4,493 people in seven countries.
The slow response to Ban's appeal showcases the gap between what aid organizations say they need to fight Ebola and what donors have provided.
Related: Ebola donations lag far behind need
Corporate donors have been slow to respond as well.
As of last week, companies have pledged nearly $19 million in cash and "in kind" contributions to support Ebola relief, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
While that may seem substantial, it's still relatively small compared with the business response to natural disasters in past years.
After the 2010 Haiti earthquake, companies donated cash and other resources worth $148 million. And when an earthquake and tsunami devastated Japan, companies provided $298 million to help with relief.
Even companies with close ties to West Africa have provided relatively little support. The World Cocoa Foundation, a non-profit that helps cocoa farmers, had received roughly $700,000 from its members, which include global chocolate makers such as Nestle, Mars Chocolate and Hershey ( HSY ).
West Africa produces 70% of the world's cocoa supply.
Related: Zuckerberg donates $25 million to fight Ebola
The largest contributions so far have come from wealthy individuals and philanthropies founded by wealthy individuals.
Earlier this week, Facebook ( FB , Tech30 ) CEO Zuckerberg said he was making $25 million grant for public health organizations that are working to contain Ebola. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation , the charity funded by Microsoft ( MSFT , Tech30 ) founder Bill Gates, pledged $50 million to the cause last month.
At the U.N., India has pledged $10 million, Venezuela $5 million and Australia has agreed to give more than $8 million for the Ebola fund. Chile, Estonia and Romania have also made commitments.
Overall, governments have donated some $376 million to other U.N. agencies involved the response to Ebola, which translates to about 38% of what the global organization needs to meet its funding goals, according to a U.N. spokesman.

Modi`s govt frees diesel prices  easing state grip on economyTags: Narendra Modi ,  Modi's govt ,  Diesel prices ,  India's economy ,  Natural gas price ,  Gas pricing ,  Reforms
Pic Courtesy: -
New Delhi: India said Saturday it was freeing diesel prices from government control, marking another step to ease the state`s grip on the economy and propel reforms by the new pro-business government.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi`s administration also hiked natural gas prices to spur exploration in the fuel-import dependent nation. Huge energy imports contribute to India`s trade deficit.
The decision is providing a fillip to investor hopes that the government may take more steps to modernise India`s economy and revive stumbling growth.
However the jump in natural gas prices will increase the cost of running power stations and fertiliser plants, and will raise cooking gas costs and other prices, potentially stoking inflation.
The government had controlled diesel prices using subsidies under a programme intended to shield the poor from soaring fuel prices.
But domestic fuel prices have now exceeded global rates, allowing refiners to sell at a profit and setting the stage for deregulation.
Economists had described the situation as a "golden moment" for the government to deregulate diesel prices after years of paying crushing public subsidies.
India`s central bank governor Raghuram Rajan earlier in the week had urged the government to "seize" the opportunity of the dramatic global fall in energy prices to end diesel subsidies.
The move has been long urged by economists to reduce the giant subsidy burden on the government and help it close a gaping spending deficit.
"The prices of diesel will be market-determined at both the retail and refinery gate level for all consumers" and move in tandem with international prices, the government said in statement.

Assembly elections verdict is out: it s Narendra Modi vs the restprint
Political judgements based on opinion polls are hazardous at the best of times, but when there is a five-cornered fight like in Maharashtra, pollsters are often whistling in the dark. There were almost 50 constituencies in Maharashtra in 2009 where the margin was less than 5,000 votes, making any conclusive poll prediction a nightmare. And yet, let me stick my neck out on my home state: The BJP will be almost certainly the single-largest party and, in fact, should get a clear majority.
Forecasting a majority for the BJP in the 288-member Maharashtra assembly is as big a call as predicting the BJP winning a majority on its own in the 2014 general election. Then too, the BJP was operating in a relatively limited geographical area of north and western India and yet with an 80% plus strike rate in key states, the party scored a spectacular win. In Maharashtra too, the BJP once had a limited base, especially in rural Maharashtra, and yet, there is reason enough to believe that the party is poised to make a remarkable leap in this election.
Let’s put this in some context. The BJP’s best performance in Maharashtra till now has been the 65 seats it won in 1999, that too in alliance with the Shiv Sena. Its vote percentage has hovered between 13 and 17. Now, the party is looking at doubling its seats and its vote share, that too without any alliance with the Sena. In other words, the BJP is poised to become Maharashtra’s number one party, a feat considered unthinkable even a few months ago.
In 1990, I had tracked the length and breadth of Maharashtra in the first state election the BJP and Shiv Sena fought together. This was the height of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement and one could sense a certain energy in the cadre of the party. Accompanying me on a train journey into Vidarbha was a local BJP leader, the late Dharamchand Choradia. As a young journalist, I was being swept by the saffron surge around me: Bal Thackeray and LK Advani were attracting large crowds. “Looks like the saffron alliance will come to power,” I told Choradia. The veteran politician smiled: “Rajdeep, this is Maharashtra, not neighbouring Gujarat. Here, the people will come for our rallies but will go and vote for the Congress.” Why, I asked.
“Tradition. It will take more than one election to break it,” was his explanation.
He was right. From 1952 through to 1990, the Congress dominated Maharashtra politics. There were more seats in this state that the Congress had never lost than any other in the country. Maharashtra did not see a non-Congress chief minister till 1995 when Manohar Joshi of the Shiv Sena was sworn in, that too with the help of independents.
The far-sighted politics of post-Independence Congress leaders like YB Chavan, the consolidation of the co-operative movement, the ability of the Congress to embrace reformist Dalit and backward caste movements and the strong patron-client relations between the agrarian bourgeoisie and the industrial elite meant that Maharashtra was a Congress fortress. Even leaders like Sharad Pawar who stepped out of the Congress fold were eventually forced to return to the party.
Now, the one state which has stood by the Congress in the worst of times is set to shift towards the BJP. Narendra Modi and his Sancho Panza, Amit Shah, could well have done in Maharashtra what they so successfully managed in Uttar Pradesh in the general elections. Indeed, the similarities between UP and Maharashtra are uncanny. If the Akhilesh Yadav-led Samajwadi Party government stood discredited, so is the Congress-NCP government in Maharashtra. The state chief minister, Prithviraj Chavan, is being positioned as a Manmohan Singh-like figure: An honest, well-educated gent but also a political ‘bechara’ who has been unable to impose his presence on the state. Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar’s plight is a shade worse: His remark asking people to urinate to fill dams during a drought last year still haunts him. In the public imagination, the Maharashtra government has been corrupt and callous.
The regional parties like the Shiv Sena and the MNS have also fallen into the same trap as identity-driven parties like the BSP in UP. By appealing to regional pride and attacking the prime minister as a ‘Gujarati’ leading Afzal Khan’s army, the two Senas have failed to understand the changing demographics of the electorate. The younger voter is less driven by the idea of ‘Marathi manoos’ and more attracted by the idea of jobs and rapid growth. More inclusive ‘identity-plus’ politics is the new success mantra.
The Modi-Shah combine has been astute enough in understanding the logic of this changing voter profile. Their formula is clear: Create a larger than life persona around Modi as an icon of governance. This involves a blitzkrieg of rallies and a sustained media exposure that penetrates right down to smaller villages; create sub-regional issues that will have a direct appeal to a voter (separate statehood in a Vidarbha, water scarcity in a Marathwada); strike micro-level alliances (example, with the Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana in western Maharashtra); and finally, use the RSS cadre as last-mile operators for an intensive door-to-door campaign.
By contrast, the Opposition has unwisely chosen to make ‘target Modi’ their single-point poll agenda. This might work to a limited extent in a Bihar by-election where the entire opposition was united; it is doomed in a state like Maharashtra, where the anti-Modi vote is being badly splintered. Indeed, if the BJP does win Maharashtra, the message is clear: Only a united Opposition and a credible local leadership (like a Naveen Patnaik in Odisha) have any chance of stopping the Modi-Shah juggernaut. As was the case with Indira Gandhi in the 1970s, state elections too could now begin to reflect a new reality: Modi versus the rest.

ET Wealth | Should you buy gold this DiwaliCan gold bounce back? Here's why experts feel that you should give yellow metal a miss this Diwali
Narendra Nathan, ET Bureau Oct 20, 2014, 10.33AM IST

(While the one-year loss…)
What will you buy on muhurat day? Will you stock up on equities or will you go for gold? To some buyers, gold might appear very attractive right now. The domestic gold price is down more than 18% from its all-time high of Rs 33,265 per 10 gm recorded in August 2013. The past 15 months, in fact, have been devastating for gold investors. The price of the yellow metal has slipped, turning conventional wisdom on its head. Even now, analysts believe that gold faces headwinds that could take prices down in the near to medium term.
This is not good news for buyers getting ready for Dhanteras shopping. After all, their blind faith in gold had delivered handsome returns in the past decade. This changed last year, with gold churning out losses for investors who bought the yellow metal on the muhurat day in 2012 and held it till the 2013 Diwali. While the one-year loss on 2012 Diwali gold purchase was 4%, the loss till date from the 2013 Diwali gold purchase is 10%.
So, will you buy gold on Dhanteras this year? Experts say investors should give gold a miss this Diwali. Even if they want to buy gold for religious purposes, they should restrict their purchases to a small token quantity. Let us look at the global and domestic factors that are working against the yellow metal in the short and medium terms.
Strengthening dollar
International gold is traded in dollars, and if the greenback strengthens, the value of gold goes down. The dollar has strengthened 7% against other currencies in the past year (see chart). This is mainly because of fears that the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates. "International gold prices should fall by around 10% from current levels by March 2015," says Kishore Narne, associate director, Motilal Oswal Commodities Broker.
 
Falling inflation
Gold is a good hedge against inflation and global investors get on the gold train only when they fear that inflation will go up. After fears of inflation, the European Union (EU) region is facing the threat of deflation, mainly due to the fall in global commodity prices. The international crude oil (Brent variety) is now trading at $83 per barrel, a two-year low. Most global agriculture commodities are also at multi-year lows. The inflationary pressure has ebbed significantly in the US as well.
Investors deserting gold
Investors have also deserted the gold market. The gold holdings of the SPDR Gold Trust, the largest gold ETF in the world, are down 44% from their peak of 1,353 tonnes in December 2012. They don't see any upside potential now from the current levels. "Gold is no more in a buy zone. At best, it is in a hold zone," says Sudip Bandyopadhyay, president, Destimoney Securities. Domestic investors are also deserting gold because of the recent drop in price. "The investors who bought gold above Rs 30,000 are panicky," says Hasmukh Bafna, president of the Gold Chains and Jewellery Wholesalers Welfare Association. People shifting to investments such as stocks is another reason for this dullness in the domestic gold market. "People are still buying small quantities of jewellery, but the demand for gold bars and coins has almost dried down," says Prithviraj Kothari, president of the Bombay Bullion Association. However, analysts don't see a major downside because the current price is close to the mining cost. "Gold has a strong support at $1,180 because the gold mining costs are around $1,150," says C P Krishnan, whole time director, Geojit Comtrade.
Faltering demand
The consumption demand for gold is down partly due to the government's restrictions on imports. Domestic demand may bounce back once these restrictions are withdrawn, but the demand slowdown in China, the biggest gold consumer, may continue. "China has witnessed a moderation in purchases following the hectic buying in the previous year. This will be a drag on prices," says Naveen Mathur, associate director, commodities & currencies at Angel Broking.
Rupee may not weaken significantly
The domestic gold price is down 18% from its peak, but the international gold price is down by 35%. The decline of the rupee against the dollar had cushioned the fall of gold in the domestic market. Though the rupee may weaken more if the US Fed raises interest rates, the impact will be limited because the RBI is better prepared. The rupee has remained relatively stable in the Rs 60-62 per dollar range despite a significant jump in the Dollar Index in the past three months.
Import duty to come down

its 2015 UK economic growth forecastUK economic growth to fall to 2.4% in 2015, says EY Item Club
The weak eurozone means export prospects look "dreadful", says the EY Item Club
The UK economy will grow by 2.4% in 2015, well below the 3.1% growth expected this year, forecasting group EY Item Club has said.
It says the forthcoming election and accompanying political uncertainty will hold business back from investing.
Growth will also be constrained by worries about the eurozone and the Ukraine conflict, EY Item Club says.
The 2.4% figure undershoots forecasts issued by the Bank of England, the CBI and the International Monetary Fund.
Last week, the Bank's chief economist, Andrew Haldane, said he was downbeat over the UK economy because of weaker global growth, low wage growth and financial and political risks.
He said interest rates should remain low to avoid long-term economic stagnation.
'Dreadful'
Peter Spencer, EY Item Club's chief economic adviser, said: "The forecast for GDP growth is still relatively good. What has changed is the global risks surrounding the forecast and the headwinds facing investment by firms.
"The UK's export outlook continues to look dreadful. The glimpse of economic rebalancing that we saw in the early part of this year has turned out to be a false dawn.
"Looming political uncertainty risks denting corporate confidence - the question now is how will these risks play out? I expect caution to become the order of the day."
He also said the Bank of England was unlikely to rush to raise borrowing costs in the face of falling commodity prices and low wage growth.
The report predicted inflation would remain low. It is currently at a five-year low of 1.2% and is likely to average 1.3% in 2015, EY Item Club said.
The Bank of England's most recent forecasts predict GDP growth of 3.5% this year and 3% next, while the IMF says it will be 3.2% followed by 2.7% and the CBI 3% and then 2.7%.

It also leaves the unemployment rate unchanged at 6.6% of the population eligible to work. None of which suggests the German economy is powering ahead, but given it only narrowly avoided a recession last week that should hardly come as a surprise.

ET Wealth | Why disciplined spending is impo...Why it is important to ensure disciplined spending while taking a decision on purchases

(With attractive deals on…)
By Uma Shashikant
The festival season brings cheer, joy and fear of overspending. With attractive deals on cars and consumables being the flavour of the season, carefully drawn plans for savings can go completely awry. Buying clothes and jewellery is too tempting. Demands for refurbishing the home or taking a holiday cannot be postponed any longer. Some of us simply take the plunge and splurge, while others cannot hide the resentment that comes with spending. Why this difference and how does it matter?
In 2007, Scott Rick and others published a paper, famously classifying spenders as Tightwads (TW) and Spendthrifts (ST). TWs spend less than the amount they would ideally like to spend and STs spend more. The authors created a TW-ST scale to measure the pain associated with spending and found that it varied significantly across spenders. The TW-ST framework classifies emotions as 'immediate' and 'expected'. An immediate emotion is one where the consequences of making a choice are instantly experienced. Street vendors battle against them, when customers haggle for discounts as the pain of spending cash is immediate.
An expected emotion is one where the consequences of a choice are experienced much later, even though they are known at the time of making the choice. Credit card providers smartly exploit this—customers buy in the present, but experience the pain of payment much later. Little wonder then that the difference in spending actions between TWs and STs narrows down the most when it comes to credit card usage. Rational decision-making requires that people view money as a limited resource and, therefore, consider the opportunity cost while making a decision. For example, before replacing a car with a new model, a household should consider the possibility of using that money to save for retirement.
Every current expense cuts into the future wealth. However, spending decisions are not made keeping this in mind. In reality, the buyer considers the pain of driving an older car when his peers are driving better ones; or the joy of driving a new car to his relatives' homes on Diwali; or the pride of the family in driving a better car; or the improved social status in his community with the new car signalling his purchasing power.
These joys are much more immediate, retirement is too far in the future. The TW-ST scale depends on the emotion perceived at the time of making the spending decision. If the pain of spending is small compared to the joy it brings, financial discipline becomes tough to impose. The EMI is a smart ploy based on this understanding. It diminishes the current pain associated with buying a car, making the joy and convenience look far bigger.
Festival sale—buy one, get one free, buy now, pay later, waiver of admin fee, grand discounts—is also a smart ploy designed to enhance the joys associated with spending. Striking down a price sticker of Rs 400 and labelling it 'now, Rs 200', works to instantly reduce the pain of spending compared to the joy of getting a 'better' deal. The credit card limit is also intended to serve a similar purpose. When a limit of Rs 3 lakh is offered to a cardholder, the provider essentially taps into his sense of importance. An extravagant meal for Rs 6,000 or an expensive gift worth Rs 15,000 seem too small compared to the card limit. These tricks to reduce the pain of spending are used to their innovative best during the festival season.
 
The pain does come, a little late though. Many binge on sweets and liquor during the festive season, but are overcome by guilt pangs later. Spenders rue their lack of financial discipline when they see the credit card bills.
In an interesting extension of their work, Rick et al point out that one of the ways in which guilt and regret of overspending manifest is in seeking partners of the opposite nature. Spendthrifts seek out Tightwads, and vice versa. After an initial period of 'adjustment', many such marriages deteriorate over money matters. Diwali parties have their share of spousal cribbing on spending, or the lack of it.
There is much more to the urge to spend. Psychologists have found that spending may just be a plug to deal with complex emotions, such as avoidance, depression, low self-esteem or the need for instant gratification. There is evidence to show that those with disturbed childhoods end up being financially unstable as adults in a bid to avoid the earlier trauma. Credit cards are toys that hand over the rewards they were denied. Shopaholics seek the approval from obliging salesmen to escape dealing with disappointments and setbacks. Some hide their true selves through attention-seeking behaviour that focuses on their spending.
They convince themselves into believing that their acceptance in society depends on what they own, and they cannot stop themselves from buying things that they may not actually need.

Goal celebration costs India hopeful his lifeGoal celebration costs India hopeful his life

A young footballer lost his life over the weekend after injuring his spinal cord while celebrating a goal he had scored, according to newspaper reports.
Peter Biaksangzuala, 23, fell backwards on his head as he took a series of somersaults after scoring the equaliser for his team in a local match in Khawzawl town close to the eastern border with Myanmar last Tuesday, the Times of India said.
As he lay on the ground in pain, unsuspecting team-mates jumped on him to celebrate before they realised the extent of the injury and summoned a stretcher to rush him to hospital.
Biaksangzuala died on Sunday after his condition deteriorated in hospital as doctors attempted to repair his damaged spine, the newspaper quoted hospital staff as saying.

Lal Hmar, a football official in Mizoram state, told reporters in capital Aizawl that the young footballer had donated his eyes before his death.
"Peter was a very talented player who dreamt of playing in the national league," Hmar said. "His death has come as a big shock to all of us. We all thought he will recover."
Hmar said the local association was planning to hold a charity match in Biaksangzuala's memory.
Footballers are known to injure themselves while celebrating a goal, but there is no recorded instance of it causing a death.

Congress wins Manipur by-pollComments
Continuing its good show from the last assembly polls and subsequent Lok Sabha elections, the Congress party on Monday won the by-election to the prestigious Hiyanglam assembly seat in Manipur.
According to district information officer Ch Noyon Singh in Thoubal district headquarters, 30 km south of Imphal, Congress candidate E Dwijamani beat his nearest rival Y Radheshyam of All India Trinamool Congress by 1,835 votes in the October 17 by-poll. Dwijamani polled 9,008 votes and Radheshyam 7,173 votes.
Dwijamani, who was elected as an MLA from Hiyanglam in 2007 assembly election by defeating M Kunjo of Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) by a margin of 385 votes, had contested unsuccessfully from the constituency in 2012 elections as he lost to Kunjo by just 17 votes.
Kunjo's son Maibam Dhanabir of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was placed third with 6,306 votes while Manipur People's Party (MPP) candidate M Amutombi got 615 votes. The MPP candidate was followed by Manipur State Congress Party's Th Laiba with 93 votes.
Sources from the counting centre also revealed that 46 voters opted for None of the Above Option (NOTA).
The Hiyanglam by-election was held following the sudden demise of sitting Trinamool MLA Maibam Kunjo on August 11 this year.
With Dwijamani winning from the constituency, Congress has 48 MLAs now in the 60-member assembly, while Opposition Trinamool has 6 legislators, Naga People's Front 4. The NCP and Lok Janshakti Party has one legislator each.

Mangalyaan takes cover as comet Siding Spring whizzes past Marsprint

A comet the size of a small mountain whizzed past Mars on Sunday, dazzling space enthusiasts with the once-in-a-million-years encounter. Isro on Thrusday had repositioned its Mars Orbiter Mangalyaan to avoid collision.
The comet, known as Siding Spring (C/2013 A1), made its closest encounter with Mars on Sunday at 2.27pm (1827 GMT), racing past the Red Planet at a breakneck 126,000 miles (203,000 kilometres) per hour.
At its closest, Siding Spring was 87,000 miles (139,500 kilometers) from Mars -- about a third the distance between Earth and our moon.
Before the comet passed, it could be seen in space racing toward the brightly illuminated Red Planet, trailed by a cloud of debris. 
Scientists said the comet's passing offered a unique chance to study its impact on Mars's atmosphere.
"What could be more exciting than to have a whopper of an external influence like a comet, just so we can see how atmospheres do respond?" asked Nick Schneider, the remote sensing team leader from Nasa's MAVEN mission to Mars.
"It's a great learning opportunity."
Apart from India's maiden spacecraft mission Mangalyaan, Nasa's fleet of Mars-orbiting satellites and robots on the planet's surface were primed for the flyby of the comet, hoping to capture the rare event and collect a trove of data for Earthlings to study.
'Mangalyaan in good health'
India’s Mars Orbiter Mission Mangalyaan is in good health post the encounter with comet Siding Spring on Sunday night.
“We had taken all precautions by changing the orientation of the spacecraft. Post encounter, the systems have been found to be working well.   We have done systematic observations of the comet and  will soon get the data and the images,” Dr Kiran Kumar, director, Space Application Center, told HT.
“The event will happen next year too. The Black Out will take place when the satellite goes behind Mars. The White Out will occur when the Sun will come very close to Mars. Both these phenomenon may throw an affect on the receptive system on the spacecraft.”
Maintaining that the functioning of the spacecraft can extend beyond six months, he said, "We have sufficient fuel and we have to wait and watch.”
MAVEN, Nasa's latest Mars orbiter, too reported back to Earth in "good health" after spending about three hours ducking a possible collision with the comet's high-velocity dust particles, the US space agency said.
"We're glad the spacecraft came through, we're excited to complete our observations of how the comet affects Mars, and we're eager to get to our primary science phase," said MAVEN principal investigator Bruce Jakosky.
"Mars Odyssey hard at work now to image #MarsComet Siding Spring, after closest approach & before dust tail hits," Nasa said on Twitter, referring to one of its robotic spacecraft.
'Duck and cover'
The ball of ice, dust and pebbles is believed to have originated billions of years ago in the Oort Cloud, a distant region of space at the outskirts of the solar system.
The comet is around one mile wide and is only about as solid as a pile of talcum powder.
As it hurtled through space it created a meteor shower and shed debris -- mostly dust and pebbles -- which scientists had feared could damage valuable spacecraft.
"All it takes is a little tiny grain of sand traveling at that speed and you've got damage to solar arrays, or your propulsion line or critical wires," said Schneider.
Before the comet entered the red Planet's orbit, NASA moved its Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, Mars Odyssey and MAVEN to avoid damage by the comet's high-speed debris.
This artist's concept handout shows NASA's Mars orbiters lining up behind the Red Planet for their "duck and cover" maneuver to shield them from comet dust that may result from the close flyby of comet Siding Spring (C/2013 A1). (AFP Photo)
"#MarsComet flyby not over yet. Mars passes thru dust tail... while orbiters #duckandcover on far side," the agency tweeted.
The comet has traveled more than one million years to ake its first pass by Mars, and will not return for another million years, after it completes its next long loop around the sun. \
The comet was discovered by Robert McNaught at Australia's Siding Spring Observatory in January 2013.
Its flyby of Mars is not likely to be visible to sky watchers on Earth.

Hindus in Pakistan demand holiday  aid package on DiwaliHindus in Pak demand holiday, aid package on Diwali
PTI
print
Pakistan's minority Hindu community leaders have asked Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to accept their demand for a public holiday on Diwali and announce a special aid package for them on the festival.
Pakistan Hindu Council patron-in-chief Dr Ramesh Kumar Vankwani, also a ruling party legislator, said that grant of a holiday will help reduce the community's sense of deprivation.
"We are patriotic Pakistanis and it is our constitutional right to have a public holiday on our annual festival," he told The Express Tribune.
Vankwani said he would raise the issue in the national assembly. "No political party is interested in resolving the issues of minority communities in Pakistan," he said.
He said official holiday is observed on Diwali in over 10 countries, including Malaysia, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Mauritius, Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago, Suriname, Singapore, Fiji, India and Bangladesh, while in Pakistan Hindus who do not attend offices on that day are marked absent.
Diwali will be celebrated on October 23.
The Pakistan People's Party-led government had introduced a package of Rs. 10,00,000 for each Hindu lawmaker for distributing among their communities on Diwali.
Vankwani said the PML-N government led by Prime Minister Sharif should continue the tradition. He said the government should ask all public and private organizations to offer packages and advanced salaries to Hindus on Diwali.
Scheduled Caste Rights Movement Pakistan chairman and director Hare Rama Foundation Ramesh Jaipal said that the announcement of a public holiday is a must to make Hindus feel that they are part of the society in this country.
He said Hindus were among the most underprivileged groups in Pakistan and therefore needed special attention of the government.
"The government should announce an economic package for Hindus on Diwali, as it does during Ramazan," he said.
"Yousaf Raza Gilani was the first prime minister to congratulate the Hindu community on Diwali. We expect it from the incumbent government too," he added.
A Hindu religious leader Guru Sukhdev G said Diwali gives the message of love and brotherhood.
"There is a need to spread this message to ward off the threat of extremism in the country. The government should own this occasion to spread the message," he said.
He said the government should encourage all communities, including Muslims and Christians, to participate and share the occasion.

HELSINKI: Finland's Nokia is expected to report a drop in the profit margin at its core networks business to 9.9 percent in the third quarter from 11.0 percent in the second quarter as a result of lower-margin 4G network deals in China, a Reuters poll of analysts showed.
Shares in telecom gear makers such as Alcatel-Lucent , Ericsson and Nokia have fallen this month partly due to fresh concerns over US demand. Some analysts, however, say a cooler US market would not have much effect on Nokia which is little dependent on the region.
Nokia in April closed the deal to sell its former flagship phone business to Microsoft , leaving it with the network equipment unit, navigation technology business and a smartphone patent portfolio.
Of the 19 analysts who gave their rating on Nokia's stock, 9 were positive, 9 negative, and 1 neutral. Estimates in millions of euros, except for EPS and dividend in euros.

Zuckerberg named to board of Beijing biz schoolIndustry chiefs including Mark Zuckerberg named to board of influential Beijing business school

The business school board, with its extensive connections to the central government, has long served as a social network of sorts and an informal meeting ground.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
BEIJING: China's Tsinghua University School of Economics and Management has added three western business heavyweights to its advisory council including Mark Zuckerberg , the Facebook Inc founder who has long sought to enter the Chinese market where his social network is currently banned.
Zuckerberg - who was named to the board along with Virginia Rometty , the IBM chief executive, and Anheuser-Busch InBev SA CEO Carlos Brito - will attend the business school's annual board meeting in Beijing on Friday, Facebook said.
The business school board, with its extensive connections to the central government, has long served as a social network of sorts and an informal meeting ground for Chinese policymakers and international businesspeople seeking closer ties to China.
Founded in 1984 by Zhu Rongji, who went on to serve as premier of China, Tsinghua's business school has several dozen board members including Chinese central banker Zhou Xiaochuan, Goldman Sachs chief executive Lloyd Blankfein and Apple Inc chief executive Tim Cook .
Zuckerberg, who has long stated his desire to enter China as part of his vision to connect the world's population on Facebook, will spend several days in Beijing this week to meet with advertising partners and "China experts" to learn about the market, the company said.
The world's most popular social network has been blocked in China since 2009 while the company's Instagram photo-sharing service was also reportedly blocked in the mainland during the recent pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.
Entering China is something "we are always interested in and always studying," said spokeswoman Charlene Chian, who declined to say whether Zuckerberg will hold any formal meetings with government officials.
An IBM spokeswoman said Rometty will not attend the board meeting this week but is due in China in November. Rometty has visited China repeatedly over past 12 months to mend the company's image amid calls by some Chinese experts and computing rivals to abandon foreign technology on cyber security grounds.
Anheuser-Busch, for its part, has long had extensive business interests in China and owns, among its other properties, Harbin Brewery in northeast China.

Dhaula Kuan gangrape case: Convicts get life imprisonmentComments
A Delhi court on Monday sentenced five men to life imprisonment for abducting and gangraping a call centre worker about four years ago, a sensational case that first drew attention to safety of women working late shifts in the city.
The gang rape of the 30-year-old woman, known as the Dhaula Kuan gang rape, transfixed the city for weeks and was one of the first cases that highlighted growing sexual violence against women in Delhi, where thousands of women work in call centres.
Additional sessions judge Virender Bhat also imposed a Rs. 50,000 fine on Usman, Shamshad, Shahid, Iqbal and Kamruddin to be paid to the woman to compensate for the trauma.The judge said the fine will be handed over to the rape survivor who was traumatised into leaving her lucrative job after the incident.
While the verdict was being read out, Shahid lost consciousness and had trouble breathing. He was taken away to the medics by police. His family had a breakdown outside the courtroom as they watched him being taken away.
The judge's order on the sentence echoed the words of the public prosecutor Satwinder Kaur who had urged the court to hand out the maximum punishment of life imprisonment, saying the men had a criminal record.
The court agreed with Kaur, saying "rape is a serious blow to the honour and dignity of the victim". It added that "a liberal attitude shown towards the offenders, particularly rape convicts by imposing meagre sentences or taking a sympathetic view merely on account of family background ....is against the societal interest".
Police say the men abducted the woman on November 24, 2010 while she was walking home with a colleague near Dhaula Kuan after being dropped off by an office cab after midnight.
They grabbed the women, threatened them with a country-made pistol and tried to force them into their vehicle, but the victim’s friend managed to escape after a brief struggle and call police. The five men drove to west Delhi’s Mangolpuri where they took turns raping her and then dumped her on an isolated road.
After the incident, Delhi Police ordered call centres in the NCR to drop female employees home safely and provide them security while travelling at night. The department also instructed PCR vans to be visible on roads and one officer to remain outside every such vehicle at all times.
Defence counsel Amit Srivastava told the court his client, Usman, had an alibi for the night: he was at a hospital for his youngest daughter’s birth. The judge dismissed the submission, saying it was "too late in the day to raise a fresh alibi".
The defence had also requested that the time served by the convicts -- nearly four years -- should be taken into account during the sentencing and they should be released at the earliest as the men were the sole bread winners for their families.

Expect cracker of a rally on D-St post Diwali: Experts | Mkts rallyStrong start to Diwali week, markets on track to hit fresh highs in November

(The government announced…)
NEW DELHI: After closing on a subdued note last week, the Indian markets managed to surge over 400 points in trade on Monday in the run-up to Diwali, after the government announced a slew of reforms in the oil & gas sector, which can trigger the next leg of rally in the markets.
The government announced a slew of reform measures, such as diesel price deregulation and hike in natural gas price, post the victory in recently-held elections in Maharashtra & Haryana.
The BJP has got a majority in Haryana and will form its government for the first time in the state. It has emerged as the single largest party in Maharashtra, but will have to patch up with old ally Shiv Sena to form a government.
With less than two trading sessions away from this Diwali and eight sessions left in the month of October, market gurus are hopeful that benchmark indices should be able to hit fresh record highs in the month of November.
"The election win will help the BJP increases numbers in Rajya Sabha , which will help in passing reforms. The key reforms have started. Diesel regulation, gas price hike and labour reforms are just the beginning," said market expert A K Prabhakar .
"The government is behaving like a corporate - the way reform process is going forward," he added. Even though FIIs remain net sellers in the month of October, the trend is likely to change in November, added Prabhakar, who thinks that fresh highs for the Nifty can come in the second week of November when FIIs turn net buyers.
Both the Sensex and the Nifty recorded their respective fresh life-time high on 8th September 2014. The BSE Sensex recorded its all-time high of 27354.99 and the Nifty hit a fresh record high of 8180.2.
Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have pulled out a massive Rs 3,755 crore from the Indian stock market since the beginning of this month, mainly on account of profit booking.
Prabhakar is of the view that this is not the first time that FIIs have become net sellers in October. In the last 10 years "we have witnessed a similar trend, because they have to meet their maturity date."
The market has given a thumbs-up as the BJP has won the Haryana State assembly polls and is the single largest party in Maharashtra. The result would add heft to the already formidable political weight of the Prime Minister.
"By holding extensive rallies across both the States, Mr. Modi can claim to have turned the fortunes of his party in the States single-handedly," said Ajay Bodke, Head- Investment Strategy & Advisory, Prabhudas Lilladher.
"Markets hope that the strengthening of his hand would embolden Mr. Modi to roll out aggressive reforms that had enthused global & domestic investors into driving up the Indian equity market to dizzying heights this calendar year," he added.
The S&P BSE Sensex has plunged over 500 points so far in the month of October, as of data collected on 17 October. The weakness in the index was largely led by a sell-off in global markets, including India.
Many factors have been blamed for this recent global equity correction, including growth fears, Ebola and the Middle East tensions. But analysts say that the correction is more of a short-term phenomenon and long-term investors should look at buying on dips.
"This is consolidation and corrective phase going on for the market on account of volatility in global markets due to drifting global growth and other macro issues," said Siddharth Sedani, Vice President (Portfolio Management Service) at Microsec Capital Ltd.
"We reiterate that post this assembly election results, the government would have a strong go on business and reforms which may bring visible changes on the ground and improve earnings of the corporates in the quarters to come," he added. Sedani is of the view that the markets are heading upwards and may hit fresh highs going forward.

Maharashtra: BJP  Shiv Sena yet to decide on post-poll alliancealliance
(On Sunday, BJP discussed…)
NEW DELHI: With BJP emerging the single largest party in Maharashtra Assembly polls, key political parties were in a huddle on Monday to discuss options for alliance and government formation.
Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray held a crucial meet the party headquarters to decide on options post poll results. Meanwhile, BJP President Amit Shah also met Union Minister Nitin Gadkari in the capital to discuss future strategy for Maharashtra.
BJP has made it clear that it will be going ahead with formation of government in Maharashtra. "As per norms of democracy, the largest party has the right to form the government. BJP will be forming the government in Maharashtra," Shah had said on Sunday.
On Sunday, BJP discussed the party's strategy ahead at a meeting of the Parliamentary Board, its highest decision-making body.
Sources also told PTI that BJP is not averse to taking back its old ally Shiv Sena in its government in Maharashtra. A consensus appears to have been reached on taking back the Shiv Sena in its fold to form a stable government in the state.
Insiders say the RSS also wants that all Hindutva forces should remain united for the long term.
Meanwhile, Shiv Sena took a swipe at Narendra Modi, saying the "wave" seen during the campaign lost its force even before reaching the shores and expressed doubts over survival of the state amid a hung House.
BJP, Congress and NCP benefited from multi-cornered contests in the elections, the Sena said and asked the voters if they are happy with the fractured verdict.

Does Amazon have too much power Is it abusi...Does Amazon have too much power & is it abusing that power? Yes!
New York Times Oct 20, 2014, 02.58PM IST

(Such claims are over the…)
By Paul Krugman
Amazon.com, the giant online retailer, has too much power, and it uses that power in ways that hurt America.
OK, I know that was kind of abrupt. But I wanted to get the central point out there right away, because discussions of Amazon tend, all too often, to get lost in side issues.
For example, critics of the company sometimes portray it as a monster about to take over the whole economy. Such claims are over the top - Amazon doesn't dominate overall online sales, let alone retailing as a whole, and probably never will. But so what? Amazon is still playing a troubling role.
Meanwhile, Amazon's defenders often digress into paeans to online bookselling, which has indeed been a good thing for many Americans, or testimonials to Amazon customer service - and in case you're wondering, yes, I have Amazon Prime and use it a lot. But again, so what? The desirability of new technology, or even Amazon's effective use of that technology, is not the issue. After all, John D. Rockefeller and his associates were pretty good at the oil business, too - but Standard Oil nonetheless had too much power, and public action to curb that power was essential.
And the same is true of Amazon today.
If you haven't been following the recent Amazon news: Back in May a dispute between Amazon and Hachette, a major publishing house, broke out into open commercial warfare. Amazon had been demanding a larger cut of the price of Hachette books it sells; when Hachette balked, Amazon began disrupting the publisher's sales. Hachette books weren't banned outright from Amazon's site, but Amazon began delaying their delivery, raising their prices, and/or steering customers to other publishers.
You might be tempted to say that this is just business - no different from Standard Oil, back in the days before it was broken up, refusing to ship oil via railroads that refused to grant it special discounts. But that is, of course, the point: The robber baron era ended when we as a nation decided that some business tactics were out of line. And the question is whether we want to go back on that decision.
Does Amazon really have robber-baron-type market power? When it comes to books, definitely. Amazon overwhelmingly dominates online book sales, with a market share comparable to Standard Oil's share of the refined oil market when it was broken up in 1911. Even if you look at total book sales, Amazon is by far the largest player.
So far Amazon has not tried to exploit consumers. In fact, it has systematically kept prices low, to reinforce its dominance. What it has done, instead, is use its market power to put a squeeze on publishers, in effect driving down the prices it pays for books - hence the fight with Hachette. In economics jargon, Amazon is not, at least so far, acting like a monopolist, a dominant seller with the power to raise prices. Instead, it is acting as a monopsonist, a dominant buyer with the power to push prices down.
And on that front its power is really immense - in fact, even greater than the market share numbers indicate. Book sales depend crucially on buzz and word of mouth (which is why authors are often sent on grueling book tours); you buy a book because you've heard about it, because other people are reading it, because it's a topic of conversation, because it's made the best-seller list. And what Amazon possesses is the power to kill the buzz. It's definitely possible, with some extra effort, to buy a book you've heard about even if Amazon doesn't carry it - but if Amazon doesn't carry that book, you're much less likely to hear about it in the first place.
So can we trust Amazon not to abuse that power? The Hachette dispute has settled that question: no, we can't.
It's not just about the money, although that's important: By putting the squeeze on publishers, Amazon is ultimately hurting authors and readers. But there's also the question of undue influence.
Specifically, the penalty Amazon is imposing on Hachette books is bad in itself, but there's also a curious selectivity in the way that penalty has been applied. Last month The Times' Bits blog documented the case of two Hachette books receiving very different treatment. One is Daniel Schulman's "Sons of Wichita," a profile of the Koch brothers; the other is "The Way Forward," by Paul Ryan, who was Mitt Romney's running mate and is chairman of the House Budget Committee. Both are listed as eligible for Amazon Prime, and for Ryan's book Amazon offers the usual free two-day delivery. What about "Sons of Wichita"? As of Sunday, it "usually ships in 2 to 3 weeks." Uh-huh.
Which brings us back to the key question. Don't tell me that Amazon is giving consumers what they want, or that it has earned its position. What matters is whether it has too much power, and is abusing that power. Well, it does, and it is.

FIIs turn net sellers in October; will the trend reverse post Diwali?
Kshitij Anand, ECONOMICTIMES.COM Oct 20, 2014, 03.37PM IST
(Overseas investors have…)
NEW DELHI: Foreign institutional investors (FIIs), which have remained new buyers so far in the year 2014, have turned net sellers so far in the month of October. But analysts are hopeful that the trend should reverse in November, pushing the benchmark indices to fresh record highs.
Overseas investors have pulled out a massive Rs 3,755 crore from the Indian stock markets since the beginning of this month, mainly on account of profit booking, said a PTI report.
Foreign investors were gross buyers of equities worth Rs 32,484 crore till October 17 and sellers to the tune of Rs 36,239 crore, registering a net outflow of Rs 3,755 crore ($612 million), according to the latest data.
If history is anything to go by, then in the past 10 years FIIs have booked profits in the month of October because they have to meet maturity dates, say analysts.
Even though FIIs remain net sellers in the month of October, the trend is likely to change in November, said market expert A K Prabhakar, who thinks that fresh highs for the Nifty can come in the second week of November when FIIs turn net buyers.
Prabhakar is of the view that this is not the first time that FIIs have become net sellers in October. In the last 10 years, "we have witnessed a similar trend, because they have to meet their maturity date." However, the selling is less fierce in India compared to other countries such as Taiwan and Korea, he added.
The Indian markets bounced back with strong volumes after closing on a muted note last week, after the government announced a slew of reform measures over the weekend, such as diesel price deregulation and hike in natural gas price, post the victory in recently-held elections in Maharashtra & Haryana.
The BJP has got a majority in Haryana and will form its government for the first time in the state. It has emerged as the single largest party in Maharashtra, but will have to patch up with old ally Shiv Sena to form a government.
The market has given a thumbs-up as the 0BJP has won the Haryana State assembly polls and is the single largest party in Maharashtra. The result would add heft to the already formidable political weight of the Prime Minister.
"Definitely, this will help the Modi government to implement the reforms. If global cues remain positive and the Nifty sustains above the psychological level of 7840, then the market is likely to show an upside rally with the crossing of 7960 and may test the life-time high in the near future," said Rohit Gadia, Founder & CEO, CapitalVia Global Research Ltd.
"We have seen an uptrend in FIIs in this calendar year 2014, but they were net seller to the tune of Rs 3755 crore in the month of October so far. Now the BJP government can roll out aggressive reforms that had enthused global & domestic investors into driving up the Indian equity market to dizzying heights this calendar year," he added.
The YTD FII inflow of US$13.2bn is significantly lower than US$19.8bn seen in calendar year 2013, despite the fact that the Indian markets look much better fundamentally.
"We believe that the global funds are sitting on the sidelines and the specific oil & gas decisions over the week-end should help tilt the balance," said global brokerage firm CLSA in a report.
"Our meetings last week with 50+ US-based investors reveals that some amount of scepticism has been building up against Modi due to perceived lack of concrete steps and some the US investors have booked profit and reduced India weight in the recent months. Global investors haven't jumped onto the India bandwagon as yet," added the report.
After focusing on foreign policy (attracting FDI being the central theme), analysts believe that the domestic decision making will now gather pace. They expect some action on coal block auctions, coal & gas price pooling, disinvestments, highway awards, GST etc.
The winter session of Parliament is expected to be between 24th Nov and 23rd December. The session is expected to see some important legislations such as raising FDI in insurance, labour laws etc.
The hope in investors has strengthened post the election results that pending decision can be cleared with respect to key reforms and the economy should be able to spur in near-term as a result of initiatives taken by government.
"FIIs clearly have to balance what is happening globally and what is happening in India. Clearly on India's front things are extremely positive, the recent changes in terms of oil reforms, in terms of labour reforms, in terms of certain financial reforms are extremely positive for change in sentiment which over a period of time should reflect in an upcycle in terms of growth rates," said Alroy Lobo, Chief Strategist and Global Head Equities Asset Management, Kotak Mahindra AMC.
"We are not immune to what is happening globally, but India is one of the few markets where the turn has been positive. Our view is that the winter session of Parliament as well as the budget could further see reform measures taken by the government," he added.
Lobo is of the view that as far as the globe is concerned, come December, January, you should see some amount of quantitative easing emerging from Europe and also from Japan, which will counterbalance the kind of QE tapering or the QE wind down of the US and that will help support equity markets both in India and overseas.

Upto BJP whether or not to accept NCP offer: RSSBhaiyyaji Joshi
(Sah Sarkaryavahak Bhaiyyaji Joshi…)
LUCKNOW: RSS today said it is up to the BJP to decide as to whose support it should take to form a government in Maharashtra where Assembly polls have thrown up a hung House with the party falling short of a majority.
Speaking to reporters after the conclusion of a three-day conclave here, RSS General Secretary Bhaiyyaji Joshi said the issue can be decided by BJP alone.
He was asked if the Sangh would be happy if the BJP allies with the NCP which they had been calling "corrupt" in the past.
"We have no role in it, it is up to the party to accept it or not. And if some party wants to give their support than it is upto that party to decide and think about it," he said.
Asked if the Sangh would support the decision to take support from that party, he insisted, "We don't have any role in it...This is a political issue and political party leaders are mature and they will decide."
NCP has extended crucial "outside support" to BJP in Maharashtra.
Though Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray has made it clear that his party will not lend unsolicited support to BJP in forming the government, he had reportedly called up Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah to congratulate them on the electoral victories in Maharashtra and Haryana.
Joshi said BJP's victory in Haryana and Maharashtra polls shows that the wave of change, which started from Lok Sabha polls, was still going on.
Asked if there was any strategy in place to contest the 2017 Assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh, Joshi said it has to be decided by the BJP and it was not the responsibility of RSS to prepare ground for it.
When pointed out that RSS had helped BJP in Lok Sabha polls, he said the Sangh had not worked for the BJP but had tried to create awareness among voters to exercise their franchise in large numbers.
Asked if BJP was taking "U-turn" on the issue of bringing back black money stashed in foreign banks, Joshi said, "BJP is not taking a U-turn on black money issue. This should not happen. The complications in doing so should be cleared and the promise made in the manifesto should be fulfilled".

NEW DELHI: The country's overall rice production is unlikely to slip below the level of 100 million tonnes this year despite some impact on the kharif crop in few states due to rains following 'Hudhud' cyclone, a top government official said.
Rice production stood at a record 106.54 million tonnes in the 2013-14 crop year (July-June). The government is aiming to achieve 106 million tonnes this year. Currently, the kharif (summer) rice is ready for harvest.
"Overall rice production will definitely be below last year's level but it should not fall below 100 million tonnes," Agriculture Secretary Ashish Bahuguna told PTI.
The kharif rice contributes more than 80 per cent of the total rice production. The government has projected lower kharif output of 88.02 million tonnes for this year taking into account the deficient monsoon rains.
Now that the kharif crop is ready for harvest, the recent cyclone 'Hudhud' has affected the crop not only in Andhra Pradesh but also in other states, resulting in possible further drop in overall rice production.
Asked about impact of cyclone on kharif rice crop, Bahuguna said: "There will be some damage not only in Andhra Pradesh, but in others states like Odisha, Chattigarh and Jharkhand as well."
Rainfall due to cyclone in some places will boost prospects of late sown crop, while in some places it will damage the crop. "However, we are yet to make the assessment. We expect we will make up from improved yields," he said.
The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has also pegged India's rice production this year to be at 100 million tonnes, which includes 87 million tonnes of kharif rice and 13 million tonnes of rabi rice.
"Continued deficient rains and 'normal' cyclones in eastern coast during October/November could further affect the harvest of kharif rice and planting prospects for the upcoming rabi rice," the USDA had said in its latest report.

Watch: It s now Ashutosh Gowarikar s turn to scale TV s TRPs with EverestComments
The first trailer of Ashutosh Gowarikar's TV show Everest is out. Mounted on a scale Gowarikar is known to treat his films, the serial is about a daughter who fights everything in life to fulfill her father's dream of conquering the Everest.
  
Shamata Anchan makes her debut with Ashutosh Gowarikar's Everest.

A poster of Ashutosh Gowarikar's new TV show Everest
Unlike the Anil Kapoors and Anurag Kashyaps of the day, the Swades-fame director seems to have chosen to play by book. The debate over the content (or a lack of it) on Indian TV is not new. When Anil Kapoor adapted the American TV series 24, or when Anurag Kashyap brought the fiction series Yudh to the small screen, they intended to bring a change. Ashutosh, too claims to be aiming the same target.
If the first promo is anything to go by, he, however, sticks to the tried-and-tested tools of melodrama and emotions -- even if in a bid to attract TRPs for better content.
Gowarikar sets the premise for the story of Anjali Singh Rawat (played by debutant actor Shamata Anchan ) who loves her father and wants to fulfill his dream of conquering the Everest. What adds to the stereotypical melodrama is the fact that Manish Choudhary, who plays the father's role, hates her because she is a girl child. He says in the promo, "Jis din paida hui thi us din se le kar aaj tak, har pal chubhta hai mujhe ye sach -- ki wo beti hai meri."
Also read: Gowarikar reveals the poster for his TV show Everest
Showing glimpses of the Himalayas, the promo then establishes Anjali's determination to conquer Everest in a bid to win over her father's love.
Discussing the idea behind the TV show, Gowarikar had said earlier, "I was intrigued by mountaineers and always used to think what they felt after reaching the peak of any mountain. Now, I know it's the inner satisfaction that they get. The show is not only about the female protagonist as each and every character has inner conflicts which they will deal with during the journey of our serial."

Talking about his TV debut, music maestro AR Rahman, who has composed music for the TV show said, "Venturing into television was on my mind for a couple of years. Ashutosh came to me with the concept which was so intriguing. It is a very good start for me." 
Everest also features Suhasini Mulay, Mohan Kapoor, Milind Gunaji, Rajat Kapoor, Kishori Shahane, Sahil Salathia and Rohan Gandotra. Everest, co-directed by Glenn Baretto and Ankush Mohla, will air from November 3 on Star Plus.

VISAKHAPATNAM: State-owned Air India will get around Rs 3,000 crore more in the later part of this fiscal from the Government towards capital infusion and the ailing carrier is expected to make operational profits from the next financial year, a top official of the Ministry of Civil Aviation said.
V Somasundaram, Secretary of Ministry of Civil Aviation also said there is no proposal to build a Greenfield airport at cyclone-hit Visakhapatnam.
"Air India has a turnaround plan, under which a little over Rs 6,000 crore has to be infused this year. I think more than half of that has been given already. Another around Rs 3,000 crore will be infused by the end of the financial year," Somasundaram told PTI during his recent visit to Visakhapatnam.
National carrier Air India, which is sitting on a huge debt pile, is surviving on the Rs 30,000-crore government bailout package announced by the Government earlier.
"The problem was they (Air India) had lot of uneconomical routes and lot of loss-making operations. So during the last two to two-and-half years these have been reduced. They have been successful in bringing down the loss substantially. And by 2015 they are expecting to be profitable, that is next financial year," the official said replying to query on the operational profits of the air lines.
Air India recently became part of the global airlines' grouping, Star Alliance , which would enable seamless travel to over 1,300 destinations for the national carrier's passengers.
Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju had earlier told reporters that Air India's revenues may increase by 4-5 per cent by joining the Alliance.
On reports that the Government is mulling setting up a new airport at Visakhapatnam, Somasundaram said there were no such plans as of now.
He said setting up a Greenfield airport depends on the passenger traffic and revenues and at present Visakhapatnam did not fit the bill.
A senior official of Visakhapatnam airport, which handles 20 flights a day, said it witnessed nearly one million passengers last year.
The Airport was damaged due to cyclone 'Hudhud' and had to suspend operations for four days before partially resuming functions for commercial aircraft.

NEW DELHI: The government is likely to consider allowing private companies to sell coal from blocks that will be auctioned from December, a big reform in India's starved energy sector that could be taken up at the meeting of the Union Cabinet on October 20 evening.
The Cabinet is expected to bring an ordinance to allow private commercial mining and enable state-run miner Coal India to temporarily take over 204 captive coal mines, whose allocation was declared illegal by Supreme Court last month, and operate them till the time they are auctioned.
The ordinance, if approved, will override a bill seeking amendments in the Coal Mines Nationalisation Act to allow private firms to mine and sell coal. The bill has been pending in the Rajya Sabha since 2000 due to stiff opposition from Coal India's trade unions.
Several experts consider commercial coal mining an answer to the increasing demand-supply gap of coal. The amendment in the Coal Mines Nationalisation Act is expected to increase competition, infuse new technology and subsequently lead to a market-based price discovery.
Monopoly miner Coal India is unable to meet the demand for coal in the country. The firm blames delayed environment and forest clearances for the slow growth in production.
The government proposes to auction all 204 coal mines - operating as well as non-operating. Coal India, however, may be given an option to retain some blocks.
The Cabinet is also likely to deny companies the market value for land that they acquired for coal blocks . The companies are likely to be compensated for the land, at the price at which they bought it, and machinery after depreciation. Coal India is likely be given the right to retain or fire employees at the mines.
The Cabinet note was prepared late on Sunday by the officials of the law and coal ministries and was approved by the coal minister Piyush Goyal on Monday morning. The note was circulated on Monday afternoon among the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion and the ministries of law, power, steel, finance and environment.

The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), the apex policy making body of the I-T department, has asked these officers to prepare the status reports under separate and detailed heads of collection from each sector so that a threadbare discussion can be held between the Finance Minister and the senior brass of the department.
"It is expected that a road map to bolster revenue collection in the remaining months of this fiscal will also be discussed with the officers during this meeting with the Minister. The road blocks and achievements made in this domain in this fiscal will also be shared," the officer said.
This is the second time Jaitley will be meeting the zonal heads of I-T after he met them during their annual conference here in June.
The government has fixed direct tax collection target of over Rs 7,36,221 crore for 2014-15, which is 15 per cent higher than the last fiscal's revised estimates.

IBM shares fall 9% after big earnings missIBM shares off 7% after big earnings miss

AP
Shares of IBM fell sharply Monday after the computer company reported third-quarter earnings that fell well short of analyst expectations.
After the weak profit news broke, IBM shares dropped $13.05, or 7.2%, to $169.00.
The company reported adjusted earnings of $3.68 a share, well below the $4.32 analysts had forecast.
Revenues also came in below expectations.
IBM blamed the weak performance on clients buying less of their services.
“We are disappointed in our performance,” Ginni Rometty, IBM chairman, president and CEO said in a news release. “We saw a marked slowdown in September in client buying behavior, and our results also point to the unprecedented pace of change in our industry. While we did not produce the results we expected to achieve, we again performed well in our strategic growth areas – cloud, data and analytics, security, social and mobile – where we continue to shift our business. We will accelerate this transformation.”
IBM, which is a component in the Dow Jones industrial average, also dragged down the blue-chip index. In early trading the Dow was down about 85 points to 16,295, after being up as much as 50 points in pre-market trading.
Operating (non-GAAP) diluted earnings from continuing operations were $3.68 a share compared with operating diluted earnings of $4.08 a share in the third quarter of 2013, a decrease of 10%, the company reported. Third-quarter net income from continuing operations was $3.5 billion compared with $4.1 billion in the third quarter of 2013, a decrease of 17%.
Total revenues from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2014 of $22.4 billion were down 4% (down 2%, adjusting for the impact of the divested customer care outsourcing business and for currency) from the third quarter of 2013.
 

Uddhav meets newly-elected Sena MLAs | Lobbying on in Haryana for CM s postBJP
(The party chief held the…)
MUMBAI: Even as the impasse over government formation in Maharashtra continues following a fractured mandate in the Assembly polls, Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray today held a meeting with the newly-elected legislators here.
"All the newly elected MLAs met Uddhavji today and they unanimously took a decision to give him the right of choosing the legislative party leader," Sena MP Sanjay Raut said.
The party chief held the meeting at Sena Bhavan , party's headquarters at Dadar in central Mumbai.
On being asked if any decision on extending support to BJP was taken during the meeting, Raut said, "Today's meet was not about the BJP. Therefore, we haven't discussed BJP at all. A final decision will be taken by Uddhavji and conveyed to the media in due course."
Thackeray had yesterday said that his party would not lend unsolicited support to BJP in forming the government in Maharashtra, saying "let them make the first move".
Raut added, "We want to thank the people for the support they gave us in spite of us fighting all alone in the polls. It will be our endeavour to continue working for Maharashtra's development in the future as well."
Though the Sena improved upon its 2009 poll performance by winning 63 seats in this year's state elections, it fell short of its best performance in the 1995 elections when it had won 73 seats going to the hustings together with BJP and forming a coalition government.
However, BJP's gamble of walking out of the alliance with Sena paid off as it has secured 122 seats in the 288-member Assembly.

They will eye World Cup berths in Hazare TrophyOpportunity for Nehra and Awana
They will eye World Cup berths in Hazare Trophy.
By Qaiser Mohammad Ali | Mail Today –  Mon 20 Oct, 2014 11:18 AM IST

Ashish Nehra - in the spotlight
New Delhi: Gautam Gambhir and pacers Ashish Nehra and Parwinder Awana will get an opportunity to impress the national selectors in the World Cup season when the Vijay Hazare Trophy begins on November 6. Gambhir will again lead Delhi in the north zone league.
Dhoni may turn to Nehra to address death bowling woes
The 15-member squad, announced by the Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA), is almost the same that failed to qualify for the knock-out round last season.
If Virat Kohli , Shikhar Dhawan and Ishant Sharma are not in the squad it is because the selectors have assumed that they would be on national duty in the five-match One-Day International series against Sri Lanka beginning on November 1.
A Delhi selector said that they were told before the meeting that the squad, which was picked for the cancelled matches against the West Indies, would play against Sri Lanka. That’s why they didn’t consider Kohli, Dhawan and Ishant.
Even without these stalwarts, Delhi looks a formidable side on paper and would be keen to make amends for the last year’s poor performance. The team finished third, behind north zone toppers Punjab and the Services, and crashed out.
This season, Gambhir’s team launches its campaign with a match against Jammu and Kashmir in Bilaspur on November 6, followed by games against Punjab (November 8 in Amtar), Himachal Pradesh (November 10, Dharamsala), Haryana (November 12, Dharamsala) and the Services (November 14, Dharamsala).
While the selectors have retained all seasoned players like Virender Sehwag , Gambhir, Nehra, Mithun Manhas , Rajat Bhatia etc. there’s a view that a few more youngsters could have been picked for the 50-over format.
From last year’s Vijay Hazare squad, only Jagrit Anand has been ignored, and Shivan Sharma is the new face.
This is an important season as the World Cup is to be held and performance in the Vijay Hazare Trophy would be crucial for those who are hoping to impress the national selectors.
From Delhi, Nehra and Awana fall in that category while Gambhir, in his heart of hearts, would also probably not rule himself out.
Nehra took three wickets in four Vijay Hazare Trophy matches last season while Sumit Narwal was the top wicket-taker with eight scalps.
Nehra, 35, impressed in the recent Champion League T20, and a Delhi selector said that he would again be a vital cog in the Delhi campaign in the season-opening tournament for seniors.
In batting, Milind Kumar was the top run getter in Hazare Trophy last year with 187 in five matches, including two half-centuries. Manhas was a close second with 180 from four games.
Batsmen let Delhi down last season as the team crossed the 250-run mark only once, against Jammu and Kashmir, leaving a tough task for the bowlers.
“If you don’t put up big totals, how you can expect the bowlers to defend those runs?,” said a selector.
Squad: Gautam Gambhir (captain), Virender Sehwag , Mithun Manhas , Rajat Bhatia, Unmukt Chand, Yogesh Nagar, Punit Bisht (wicket-keeper), Ashish Nehra , Parvinder Awana, Milind Kumar, Pawan Negi, Sumit Narwal, Varun Sood, Vikas Tokas and Shivam Sharma.

WOLFGANG RATTAY / ReutersAre you helping ID thieves steal your personal information?
Herb Weisbaum TODAY contributor
Email
Identity theft is a real and growing threat. And yet, an alarming number of people are putting themselves at risk by not taking simple precautions to guard their personal information.
About 28 million Americans, 12 percent of the adults in this country, were victims of identity theft in the past 12 months, according to a new AARP report, Identity Theft: Who’s at Risk? The nationwide survey also found that:
WOLFGANG RATTAY / Reuters
Having a mailbox that locks is a simple way to prevent identity theft.
59 percent do not have a locking mailbox to prevent mail theft
21 percent never shred personal documents that could be used to steal their identity
54 percent of those aged 18-49 left at least one valuable item in their car, such as a purse or wallet, pay stub or laptop, during the last week
Doug Shadel, a fraud prevention expert with AARP’s Fraud Watch Network , can’t understand why so many people are so nonchalant about this crime.
Shadel just wrote an in-depth article for AARP, She Stole My Life , about the time he spent with “Alice,” an identity thief who showed him how easy it was to get the personal information she needed to do her dirty work.
Alice and her crew would break into cars parked at the mall and look for laptops left inside. They’d hit gym parking lots, well aware that a lot of people leave their wallets in the glove box or under the seat during their workouts.  And they’d go through the mail in unlocked mailboxes, looking for bank statements, credit card offers or other financial information to steal.
Video: For the past 13 years, the number one complaint to the FTC has been identity theft. Cyber security expert Jim Stickley says to protect yourself you should keep confidential information in a safe place, watch out for vacation rentals that request private information, and be careful of first-time jobs that look too good to be true.
“These ID thieves are very brazen,” Shadel told TODAY. “The fact that you live in a supposedly safe neighborhood doesn't stop them.”
With all the news coverage about big data breaches, it’s easy to forget that identity thieves still get what they want the old-fashioned way –  going through the trash, stealing mail and breaking into cars.
“It doesn’t matter how they get your personal information, whether they hack into a database or steal a letter from your mailbox or grab a financial document from your garbage, the damage they can do is going to be the same,” said Eva Velasquez, president and CEO of the non-profit Identity Theft Resource Center in San Diego.
Another alarming finding
Technology is now fueling the rise in identity theft, and yet the AARP survey found that many Americans are even less prepared for these high-tech attacks.
“One of the most shocking findings was that more than one-third of all Americans do not have a pass code on their smartphones,” Shadel said. “All of these people are vulnerable to identity theft because if a thief steals that phone, they have access to all of your stuff – especially if the phone syncs automatically to your accounts.”
The survey also found that:
More than one in three (35 percent) adults surveyed have not set up online access to all of their bank and credit accounts.  Checking these accounts on a regular basis – weekly, if not daily – is one of the best ways to quickly spot financial fraud.
Nearly half (45 percent) use the same password on two or more accounts. If that password is compromised in some way, it gives the crooks the key to multiple accounts and the ability to do more damage.
Almost half (49 percent) have not changed the password on their online bank account in the past six months. This proactive step will block a thief who somehow gets your password. Change it and it’s useless.
There’s really nothing any of us can do about the seemingly endless number of data breaches taking place at big retailers, but you can probably do more to reduce your vulnerability to a personal hack attack.
“Hackers look for unlocked doors and millions of Americans are leaving their doors unlocked,” said Adam Benson, deputy executive director of the Digital Citizens Alliance . “When you take the proper security precautions, it’s like locking the door to your house.”
Taking some basic digital security precautions won’t protect you from everything, but it will stop a lot of the low-level hackers who will simply move on to an easier target, Benson said.
As part of National Cyber Security Awareness Month, the Digital Citizens Alliance and Blackfin Security have created a Personal Threat Assessment quiz (just 10 questions) that can help you determine if your devices and data are secure.

Sensex to hit new highs post Diwali | Will FIIs turn net buyersYou are here: Home > Collections
Five reasons for Sensex to hit new highs post Diwali
ECONOMICTIMES.COM Oct 20, 2014, 03.47PM IST
(Scepticism against Modi government,…)
MUMBAI: The Sensex surged over 400 points in intraday trade today, high-on BJP's win in Assembly elections. The Sensex ended the day at 26,429.85; up 321.32 points.
The Nifty closed the day at 7,879.40; up 99.70 points.
Following are the top five reasons why Sensex is likely to hit fresh life highs soon:
Return of FIIs: The foreign institutional investors, who are generally sellers in October, are expected to make a come back following the recent developments in India.
Scepticism against Modi government, slowdown concerns in China and recession in Europe have been some of the factors that kept FIIs on the back-foot in October.
According to CLSA report, over 50 US-based investors revealed that some amount of scepticism has been building up against Modi due to perceived lack of concrete steps. Some US investors booked profit and reduced India weight in the recent months.
However, global investors haven't jumped onto the India bandwagon as yet. Analysts say FIIs will now have to balance between India and other global markets.
"FIIs clearly have to balance what is happening globally and what is happening in India. Clearly things are extremely positive on the India front," said Alroy Lobo, Chief Strategist and Global Head Equities Asset Management, Kotak Mahindra AMC.
Expectations of big reforms in Winter Session: The winter session of parliament is expected to begin on November 24, 2014. Analysts are expecting some important legislation such as FDI in insurance and labour laws etc to be taken up.
"We expect heightened decision making over the next 3-6 months which should be a positive for domestic cyclical recovery," said CLSA report.
There are reports that the government may even announce big reforms ahead of Diwali festival.
The government has so far announced slew of labour and oil & gas reforms, which has boosted market sentiment.
Diesel prices were deregulated, natural gas price was hiked and announced plans to re-introduce direct benefit transfer of cash subsidies for subsidized LPG.
This is addition to recently announced labour reforms which included easier compliance with labor laws through online filing for 16 out of 44 labor laws, transparency in inspections which will result in greater ease of doing business, single window portal to enable doing business with labour ministry and Portable employee PF accounts.
BJP victory in assembly elections: The BJP government has lot of reasons to rejoice. The party has got majority in Haryana assembly (47 out of 90 seats) and it has emerged as a biggest party in Maharashtra (123 out 288). The party is likely to form the government in Maharashtra with the help of its old ally Shiv Sena.
The election outcome has also improved BJP's strength in the Rajya Sabha. This will help the party to push through major reforms with relatively less opposition in the upper house.
"The market has given a thumbs-up as the BJP has won Haryana State assembly polls and is the single largest party in Maharashtra. The result would add heft to the already formidable political weight of the Prime Minister," said Ajay Bodke, Head- Investment Strategy & Advisory, Prabhudas Lilladher.
Inflation expected to surprise on downside: The fall in global commodity prices, especially crude oil is a big positive for Indian economy. The government has reduced retail diesel prices and it will help in reigning CPI and WPI inflation in coming months.
"In our view, a weak global economic outlook may keep commodity prices subdued to India's benefit. We forecast CPI inflation of 7 per cent over January-March 2015, well below the RBI's target of 8 per cent in January 2015," said Kotak Institutional Equities report.
Expectations of lower interest rates: The inflation is on a downward trajectory and has seen a sharp decline with food inflation coming down sharply. The recent decision to lower diesel prices will further lower inflationary pressure in coming months.
Lower interest rates: The decision to deregulate will improve India's finances as the oil subsidy will come down by Rs 150 billion. Also, the cut in diesel prices by INR3.56/litre will go a long way in fighting inflation, which is trending downwards, says India Ratings & Research report.
According to the report, this will create more space for the Reserve Bank of India to ease its policy stance and cut policy rate sooner than hitherto believed.
As per Kotak Institutional Equities report, the RBI will look through inflation base effects in November 2014. A CPI print of 6.5-7 per cent in 1QCY15 may result in policy rate cuts in 2QCY15, 1-2 quarters ahead of the current consensus view.

Freeing diesel will allow RBI to cut rates: ...diesel
(The government last Saturday…)
MUMBAI: The government decision to free diesel prices will give more space to the Reserve Bank to slash interest rates earlier-than-expected, and also help in improving the overall finances of the country, says a report.
The government last Saturday deregulated diesel prices which resulted in a Rs 3.37 a litre cut in retail rate of India's most consumed fuel.
"The deregulation of diesel prices will significantly improve the country's finances as oil subsidy will come down by Rs 15,000 crore," said the report by India Ratings.
The retail price cut will go a long way in fighting inflation, which is trending downwards, it said. "This will create more space for the Reserve Bank to ease its policy stance and cut policy rate sooner than expected."
The staggered diesel price hike initiated since September 2012 and the recent drop in crude prices in global markets have converted under-recovery (difference between retail price and its imported cost) of public sector oil marketing companies into an over-recovery (profit).
The over-recovery on diesel for such companies reached Rs 3.56 a litre for the first fortnight of October.
The crude price of the Indian basket as on October 15 fell to $ 83.85 a barrel and the rupee was at Rs 61.1 against the dollar.
When diesel prices were increased by around Rs 5 a litre on September 14, 2012, the Indian basket was priced at $ 113.64 a barrel and the local currency was at Rs 55.47 to a dollar, leading to an under-recovery of Rs 13.86/litre.
Although the rupee depreciated to around 61.5 by the middle of October 2014 from around 59 vs dollar in May/June 2014, the sharp fall in global crude prices has overall lowered import price of India's basket considerably.
"As the crude prices in global market are likely to remain low in the near term due to the US' discovery of shale oil as also the struggling economies of Europe and Asia, deregulating diesel prices is both the right and opportune step," the rating agency said.
The rating outfit, however, said India will have to be watchful of global developments as the current fall in crude and petroleum product prices are due to low demand and rise of the dollar in relation to its trading partners.
"In a scenario where even if global oil and petroleum products demand and supply remain same, depreciation of the US dollar may flare up both crude and product prices."

Hindus in Pak demand holiday  aid package on DiwaliHindus in Pak demand holiday, aid package on Diwali
PTI
print
Pakistan's minority Hindu community leaders have asked Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to accept their demand for a public holiday on Diwali and announce a special aid package for them on the festival.
Pakistan Hindu Council patron-in-chief Dr Ramesh Kumar Vankwani, also a ruling party legislator, said that grant of a holiday will help reduce the community's sense of deprivation.
"We are patriotic Pakistanis and it is our constitutional right to have a public holiday on our annual festival," he told The Express Tribune.
Vankwani said he would raise the issue in the national assembly. "No political party is interested in resolving the issues of minority communities in Pakistan," he said.
He said official holiday is observed on Diwali in over 10 countries, including Malaysia, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Mauritius, Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago, Suriname, Singapore, Fiji, India and Bangladesh, while in Pakistan Hindus who do not attend offices on that day are marked absent.
Diwali will be celebrated on October 23.
The Pakistan People's Party-led government had introduced a package of Rs. 10,00,000 for each Hindu lawmaker for distributing among their communities on Diwali.
Vankwani said the PML-N government led by Prime Minister Sharif should continue the tradition. He said the government should ask all public and private organizations to offer packages and advanced salaries to Hindus on Diwali.
Scheduled Caste Rights Movement Pakistan chairman and director Hare Rama Foundation Ramesh Jaipal said that the announcement of a public holiday is a must to make Hindus feel that they are part of the society in this country.
He said Hindus were among the most underprivileged groups in Pakistan and therefore needed special attention of the government.
"The government should announce an economic package for Hindus on Diwali, as it does during Ramazan," he said.
"Yousaf Raza Gilani was the first prime minister to congratulate the Hindu community on Diwali. We expect it from the incumbent government too," he added.
A Hindu religious leader Guru Sukhdev G said Diwali gives the message of love and brotherhood.
"There is a need to spread this message to ward off the threat of extremism in the country. The government should own this occasion to spread the message," he said.
He said the government should encourage all communities, including Muslims and Christians, to participate and share the occasion.

I had to take a position for my organisation...CBI
(He said he would be filing…)
NEW DELHI: CBI Director Ranjit Sinha has said that he would file a perjury case against lawyer Prashant Bhushan in the wake of an income tax probe finding there was no conversation between him and controversial meat-exporter Moin Qureshi as alleged.
He said he would be filing the case next week as all the allegations levelled by Bhushan against him had "fallen flat" after the Income Tax probe.
"It's not a question of Ranjit Sinha but the honour and dignity of the post of the CBI Director," he said.
"I decided to approach the Supreme Court. I am not important, my organisation is. I am grateful to the apex court for restoring the dignity of the premier probe agency," Sinha said here.
He also rubbished allegations made by Bhushan that Qureshi was possibly a conduit between the CBI director and the coal-scam accused.
Bhushan had alleged that Sinha had 90 meetings with Qureshi over 15 months and claimed that he was a conduit for getting the agency to shut probes into various cases linked to the coal scam.
The Supreme Court was apprised on Friday by Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi about an appraisal report prepared by the Director General of Income Tax (Investigations) on Qureshi.
"There is no conversation (between Qureshi and Sinha). There may be some innuendo referring to present CBI Director but there is no direct conversation", Rohatgi had said in the Court.
Sinha had also raised objections after a special court hearing coal cases remarked that the investigators should undergo proper training and refresher courses at CBI Academy so as to hone their investigation skills.
The Supreme Court has asked the special court dealing with the coal-block allocation cases not to make any personal remarks against the officers probing the scam and to stick to the point of law.
A three-judge bench headed by Justice M B Lokur had disapproved of the remarks made by the special court, saying "it (trial court) will stick with the legal issues and not make any personal remarks."
The court had also barred any officer probing the coal cases from opting out of the investigation without the permission of the Supreme Court.
Sinha claimed that there were concerted efforts by "vested interests" to sully CBI's image by making false allegations.

WATCH: Murugadoss packages Vijay as a  saviour  as Kaththi trailer showsComments
For all Vijay and AR Murugadoss fans, the forthcoming Tamil film Kaththi promises to be an absolute double treat! But one look at the trailer, released on Sunday, and it tells you many things – it could be an underdog versus big guns story, a land grab tale, or even the coming-of-age story of an urban youth waking up to all the decay around him. However you choose to see it, one thing is clear – Kaththi promises to be an action-filled, fast-paced thriller, with Vijay hogging most of the screen space. Others, if they matter, must share the moment of glory in his company.
Needless to say, Vijay is in all his ‘star’ glory in this one. He is the go-to man to beat up the baddies, and, at the same time, adept at arousing a bunch of helpless villagers from the clutches of a mean-minded greedy industrialist/corporate set to rob them of only asset (we don't know yet if it's land or oil!). Vijay also gets to romance his girl (in this case, it is Samantha Ruth Prabhu) and sings as well. And finally, that gaze – that symbolic ‘angry young man’ look which is fast becoming a craze down south. In short, it is a complete package. But, seriously, how? You might just keep asking that question. We are not even going a ballot way here.
Given that it is a Murudagoss feast, be sure that the ace director will not let Kaththi spiral into a Vijay fare alone. The narrative will be gripping and larger than life. The storyline will be taut with little room for superficialities, and the trailer pretty much hints at that.
We also get to see a lot of Neil Nitin Mukesh, Bollywood's newest export, as Vijay’s bête noire. In fact, if this is anything to go by, the villain has much more screen time than the heroine. Neil, it has been reported, plays a Mumbai-based character. He is relatively restrained with little room for melodrama.

How to Pick the Perfect PumpkinHow to pick the perfect pumpkin
Ben Popken TODAY
Email
Nothing puts the "Boo" in Halloween like carving a crummy pumpkin that's already falling apart before the 31st. But getting a nice fresh one straight from the farm can be a great family outing that lands you a terrific Jack-o'-lantern to boot. We talked to a few farms about how to pick the perfect pumpkin, whether for spooking up your decorations or for carving and baking .
HUNTING
The healthiest and ripest pumpkins are a solid orange with no green. Another sign of a good pumpkin is a nice thick stem. Avoid brittle stems. They can break off when carrying, disintegrate in the rain and just don't look as good.
Video: Pumpkin hunting is a lot like finding a good melon at the store. TODAY’s Ben Popken shows you how to get the pick of the patch.
TESTING
Press your fingers into the pumpkin's skin all around. You want your pumpkin to be completely hard, like a melon. If there's any soft spots, skip it.
CARRYING
A stem is a decoration, not a handle. Try to use it as one and it's likely to break off. Hold the pumpkin with at least one hand below and consider using a wheelbarrow or wagon to help you bring it to your car. But don't roll the pumpkin. It can pick up dirt or gravel, which will damage the skin. Rolling can also create bruises, which accelerate rotting.
Enjoy and don't stress it! Pumpkins are very subjective. Your perfect pumpkin could be 2 lbs or 20 lbs, teeny tiny or with a great big long face. Just pick the one that speaks to you, test it for softness, treat it right, and yours can be the "Great Pumpkin" too.

FTAs not hurting domestic manufacturing: Com...domestic industry
(Brushing aside concerns…)
NEW DELHI: Brushing aside concerns of Indian industry over free trade agreements (FTAs), senior commerce ministry officials today said it has not led to any spurt in imports or export of raw materials.
A Commerce Ministry's study and analysis on impact of FTAs have found that "the imports have not increased to any level that would create concerns and we have not become suppliers of raw materials. This is good part," the officials said.
However, officials did not provide any concrete data to substantiate their claims on the impact of FTAs on domestic manufacturing.
Imports of intermediate goods have increased which means that India is becoming part of the regional value chain of South Asia , they said adding Indian exporters and industry are not able to exploit these pacts fully.
"The use of these agreements by our exporters are perhaps a matter of concern. But we are making lot of efforts to disseminate informations, " the officials said.
The ministry has drawn up a strategy for the coming six months to accelerate and strengthen outreach programmes which would include workshops.
"We will also try to go down to industrial clusters where potential exporters can understand what are the benefits they have of using the preferential tariff under the FTAs. We want to them about rules of origin, sanitary and phyto-sanitary moves, technical barriers to trade," they said.
The ministry is also in the process of developing a comprehensive portal about FTAs.
"It will tell about different product regime. It will serve the purpose of promoting FTAs and helping exporters to know about tariff and non-tariff and preferential tariff regime in the partner country. That portal is for about 30 countries who are our major trade partners, including FTA partners," they added.
India has so far entered into FTAs with Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Malaysia, Asean and South Asia.
Indian industry and exporters have raised serious concerns about these pacts saying that they are benefiting partner countries more and impacting domestic manufacturing.
Citing few figures, the officials said that out of India's total overall inbound shipments, imports from ASEAN, Singapore, S Korea and Japan at preferential duty rates stood at 14.5 per cent, 10.8 per cent, 21.8 per cent and 22.4 per cent respectively.
"This clearly indicates that the preferential imports under FTAs have not contributed to the increase in trade deficits with some countries," they said adding it was difficult to collect data on exports as it have to shared by the FTA partner country. The Commerce Ministry officials also said that India is losing its price competitiveness in the global market but not because of free trade agreements.
"We did a study about global competitiveness of Indian manufacturing. We found that we are losing competitiveness due to factors such as infrastructural bottlenecks, deficiencies in customs procedures and trade logistics, inadequate communication infrastructure and lack of uniform system of indirect taxes," they said.
India is losing its price competitiveness in some of its traditional strengths like textiles, clothing, leather, automotive components and engineering machinery.
Further allaying concerns of Indian industry, they said that imports of consumer goods too have not increased at higher rates due to these FTAs.
"It has remain stagnant. We have certainly not moved down in the value chain in our exports also. We have also not become a market where consumer goods have dumped under preferential tariff so that could have been a worry but that has not happened," they added.
"One moderating feature is that we have not been able to use these FTAs as they could have been. They are not as widely used as they could be," the officials said.
On complains of the automobile industry on spurt in imports of auto components such as gear boxes, they said that "they are nothing alarming. Auto percentage of imports under different free trade agreements are very low".
About increase in imports of electronic goods, they said that it was because of the Information Technology Agreement (ITA) of the WTO and not because of trade pacts.
India's rationale for entering into FTAs was the diversification and expansion of exports to the partners and region as well ass access to raw materials, intermediate products and capital goods for stimulating value added domestic manufacturing, they said.
"FTAs have adequate safeguard mechanisms to tackle the adverse effect of imports on the domestic industry and take corrective action against import surges," they said.

Karl-Josef Hildenbrand / AFP - Getty ImagesThree big expenses you'll save on this fall

The recent volatility in the financial markets have left many Americans feeling jittery.The Dow and S&P indexes suffered some of their worst losses of the year last week, and a shocking price move in the bond market sent the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield below 2 percent, the lowest level in over a year. U.S. oil prices also dropped below $80 a barrel, a two-year low.
But there is some good news. The significant decline in energy prices and bond yields could actually prove to be a silver lining for many Americans, helping to cut mortgage, transportation, and heating costs in the coming months.
Plunging mortgage rates
Falling Treasury yields pushed mortgage rates this week to lows not seen in over a year. The rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage fell below the psychologically significant 4-percent level. "Lower mortgage rates will benefit both homebuyers as well as anyone who bought a home in the past few years who can now look at refinancing," said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.
For example, on a $250,000 loan, McBride said a drop in the rate on a 30-year mortgage from 4.25 percent to 4 percent would reduce a borrower's monthly payment from $1,229 to $1,193, resulting in a savings of $36 a month. That may not seem like much, but it adds up to $432 in savings over 12 months. A more dramatic decline in 30-year mortgage rates to 3.75 percent would bring that monthly payment down to $1,157 a month, resulting in monthly savings of $72 and nearly $900 over one year.
Less pain at the pump
Gasoline prices have plunged by more than 50 cents per gallon on average since the end of June. Pump prices are falling at the fastest rate in two years and are likely to continue to drop as long as oil prices decline. One-third of all U.S. gas stations are selling gas for less than $3.00 per gallon, according to AAA.
Most drivers are already spending about $5 to $15 less to fill up their gas tank than they were around the Fourth of July. Many families fill up the car four times a month, which means they could be saving $20 to $60 a month on gas depending on the type of car they drive. If your family has two cars that you fill up four times each, that would be a savings of $40 to $120 a month -- a significant savings ahead of the  holiday season .
Lower heating prices
A drop in energy costs is good news for consumers as the temperatures fall. Most households may only see $20 to $30 in savings on their heating bills this season compared to last winter, but some customers could see a nearly  $800 drop in their overall heating costs, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
More than a third of U.S. households use natural gas to heat their homes and the price of that fuel is likely to be higher than last winter (electricity prices, which follow natural gas, are on the rise too), but the forecast for milder temperatures should mean overall consumption for the heating season--and your bill--will be lower than last year. If you're in the Northeast and use heating oil or propane to heat your home, you could see a 15-percent drop in your winter heating bill versus last winter. Propane users in the Midwest may pay the most in the country to heat their homes, but with the drop in propane prices, the overall cost will be about 30 percent less than last year, according to the EIA.

Rich-poor gap  concerns me : YellenRich-poor gap 'concerns me': Yellen
By Ben Rooney   @ben_rooney October 17, 2014: 4:53 PM ET
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
Is rising income inequality un-American?
That's essentially the question Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen raised Friday in a speech on the widening gap between rich and poor in the United States.
"I think it is appropriate to ask whether this trend is compatible with the values rooted in our nation's history, among them the high value Americans have traditionally placed on equality of opportunity," the central bank chief said.
By some measures, Yellen said economic inequality is near the highest levels in the past hundred years. This continued rise of income inequality "greatly concerns me," she said.
The remarks are somewhat unusual for the nation's top monetary policy maker, since the Fed is primarily tasked with managing interest rates and fostering employment.
But income inequality has grown severe enough that the Fed is holding a conference on the topic at its Boston branch.
Related: More US families own cats than stocks
Since the Great Recession of 2007 to 2009, income inequality has become an increasingly populist issue. The booming stock market has disproportionately benefited the wealthy , while the recovery in jobs and also of home prices has been slow.
Yellen said it's taken several decades for the current disparity between rich and poor to reach this point, where living standards for a majority of Americans has stagnated, while wealth at the top has ballooned .
Yellen said some degree of inequality is to be expected and can create incentives for people to work hard, get an education or take other steps to improve their situation.
But she warned that greater income inequality can lead to a decline in economic mobility across generations.
Citing figures from a recently released Fed survey , Yellen said a greater amount of wealth is increasingly concentrated in the hands of few -- the wealthiest 5% of American households held 63% of all wealth in 2013, up from 54% in 1989.
Compared to that, the poorer half of all American households held just 1% of wealth in 2013, down from 3% in 1989.
"In such circumstances, society faces difficult questions of how best to fairly and justly promote equal opportunity," she said.
Related: Seniors in almost every state are struggling to afford retirement
While she did not offer specific recommendations, Yellen did identify some areas that needed to be debated.
She said research has already shown the benefits of investing in early education for children, but that there are huge challenges when it comes to paying for college. In addition, she said it's becoming harder to start a small business and noted the role inheritances play in perpetuating income inequality.

How YouTube s Biggest Star Got His StartTen years ago, who knew gaming could rake in the big bucks?
Photo by Suhaimi Abdullah/Getty Images
This article originally appeared in Inc .
Felix Kjellberg, better known by his online gaming alias "PewDiePie," has one of the fastest-growing channels on YouTube —a sign of some serious entrepreneurial juice. 
Advertisement
PewDiePie posts videos of himself playing video games, along with humorous commentary for viewers. The gamer hit an impressive 30 million followers in September, making his channel the most subscribed and the most viewed on YouTube for the month. His videos also have caused spikes in sales of games he's featured, such as Slender, Goat Simulator, and Flappy Bird , showing an influence he himself describes as "scary." But how did he get to where he is today?
"I just want to entertain; that is my main objective and what comes before everything else," PewDiePie told Swedish magazine Icon in a May interview.
Kjellberg comes from humble roots: Born in Gothenburg, Sweden, he gave up his pursuit of an industrial economics degree to focus on his YouTube career—something that, until recently, wasn't even considered a career. Yet his channel's revenue, which comes primarily from YouTube ads, ranges between $140,000 and $1.4 million a month, the Atlantic reports. 
PewDiePie's Web personality is remarkably human: He jokes, swears, shrieks, and giggles, all the while referring to his massive fanbase as his "bros" or "bro army." He ends almost every video with an affectionate fist bump (dubbed the "brofist"), encapsulating the entrepreneurial experience by effectively saying: I'm one of you, viewers.
And he's not afraid to be candid with his audience, either. In September, after reaching the 30-million-follower milestone, he posted a video titled " Goodbye Forever Comments ," in which he remarks: "I'm not trying to offend you bros who show a lot of support, but I don't see it as much anymore. … I go to the comments and it's mainly spam, it's people self-advertising, it's people ... trying to provoke. … Just all this stuff that to me isn't anything."
After announcing that he would disable the comments section forever, he smiled cheekily and ended the video with his trademark fist bump. (On Monday, Oct. 13, however, he brought the comments section back, in a walkthrough of Alien: Isolation.)
Like any true entrepreneur, PewDiePie is devoted primarily to his project and to his consumers (read: bros). "The thing that has made YouTube so successful is that you can relate to the people you're watching to a much higher degree than to the people you see on TV," he tells Icon.
PewDiePie's contract with Maker Studios—the largest network of channels on YouTube—is up in December. In the interview with Icon, PewDiePie announced that he may be starting his own network instead of renewing the contract, though he wouldn't go into further detail.

RSS says it s up to BJP to decide on accepting NCP offer  Shiv Sena kept guessingComments
The RSS on Monday  increased the suspense on government formation in Maharashtra by saying it was up to the  BJP to accept or turn down the NCP's offer of unconditional support.
Talking to media persons after the conclusion of a three-day conclave, Sah Sarkaryavahak Bhaiyyaji Joshi said it "was best left to the BJP to take a call on the basis on merit."
"This is a political issue and should be left to the BJP," he said while answering a question on whether it was morally right to go with Sharad Pawar's NCP after targeting it during the campaign.
Meanwhile Sharad Pawar tweeted the NCP would not compromise with fundamentals and that the unconditional support to BJP was to ensure that Maharashtra gets a stable government.
Earlier in the day Shiv Sena leaders were in a huddle on what terms to set for joining a BJP-led government in Maharashtra.
The BJP right now has not fully revealed its cards on whether it would ask the Sena to join  the government or accept the outside support offered by Sharad Pawar's NCP.
With just 23 short of majority, the BJP's gameplan clearly is to wear down the Sena and make it put up as less demands as possible, including one for the post of chief minister on a rotational basis.
The visit of union home minister Rajnath Singh, who was to attend a crucial BJP meeting here Monday , has been deferred.
"The new date would be announced later," leader of Opposition in legislative council Vinod Tawde said.
 
BJP has appointed Singh and senior leader J P Nadda as central observers to choose its legislature party leader in Maharashtra.
The Sena however continued to put up a brave fact, taking a swipe at Narendra Modi in its editorial in party mouthpiece Saamna saying the "wave" seen during the campaign had lost its force.
Expressing doubts over the survival of the state amid a hung house, it said the BJP, Congress and NCP benefited from multi-cornered contests.
"Break up of the Sena-BJP alliance and division of votes due to four and five-cornered fights in all seats benefited BJP as well as Congress-NCP. The Sena-BJP split benefited Congress-NCP.
Watch: Modi deserves credit for BJP's victory in Maharashtra, says Majid Memon
Given the Lok Sabha results, both these parties could not have won more than 25 seats together," the editorial said.
The Shiv Sena will not comment on how it views the results as of now, because what is important is the view of the "all powerful voters" who gave a fractured verdict, it said.
"With no party getting a clear majority, there are doubts how the state will survive because of the instability," the editorial said.
Taking a swipe at Modi and the BJP, the editorial said the "wave" seen during the campaign had lost its force even before reaching the shores.
In some places, there was more foam and less water in the wave," it quipped.

Government moves closer to selling stake in oil firm ONGC
ET Bureau Oct 21, 2014, 01.04AM IST

Coal India
(Administration's top privatization…)
NEW DELHI: The government has stepped up efforts to sell 5% of its stake in Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, the country's biggest explorer, two days after it lifted state control on diesel prices and raised prices of natural gas.
The government is hoping Saturday's decisions will help it get a better valuation for its stake in ONGC as diesel deregulation will reduce the company's subsidy burden while it will get a higher price for its gas now.
A senior finance ministry official said Disinvestment Secretary Aradhana Johri met merchant bankers in Mumbai on Monday to discuss the proposed stake sale.
Shares of ONGC rose 5.44% to close at Rs 418.85 on the Bombay Stock Exchange on Monday, a day when the exchange's benchmark index, the Sensex, gained 1.23%.
"Gas price hike decision and diesel deregulation would give clarity to investors," a senior finance ministry official said.
He said the government also plans to take up the pending insurance bill in the upcoming Winter Session of Parliament. The bill seeks to raise foreign direct investment (FDI) cap in the sector to 49% from 26%.
The official said stake sale in ONGC may take place in November. "Keeping valuations in mind, this is the right time to divest in ONGC," he said. The government has a 68.94% stake in the company.
The disinvestment department has already selected five merchant bankers—Citigroup, HSBC Securities, UBS Securities, ICICI Securities and Kotak Mahindra Capital—for managing the stake sale.
At the current market price, the stake sale in ONGC may fetch about Rs 18,000 crore to the exchequer. In 2012, a 5% stake sale in the company had helped the government raise Rs 14,000 crore.
Last month, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) cleared the proposal of stake sale in three state-run firms, including the big-bang offerings of Coal India and ONGC. The government intends to divest 10% stake in Coal India. The government may be able to raise around Rs 40,000 crore through these two issues alone.
The proposal to sell 11.36% stake in power sector firm NHPC was also cleared by the CCEA.
In his maiden budget in July, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had proposed a record target of Rs 58,425 crore from the sale of the government's stake in companies. Of the total, Rs 43,425 crore is expected to come from stake sales in government-controlled companies and Rs 15,000 crore from firms where the government has a minority stake.
Last fiscal, the government could mobilise only Rs15,820 crore through disinvestment against a budgeted target of Rs40,000 crore. In 2012-13, only Rs 23,957 crore was raised against the Rs 30,000-crore target.
A select committee of Parliament is looking into the insurance bill after the government was unable to get it passed in the Rajya Sabha.
The NDA government lacks the numbers to get bills passed on its own in the Rajya Sabha.
"The select committee is looking into the Bill. We will take it up in the Winter Session," the official said. Higher insurance limit could bring nearly Rs25,000 crore of investment into the sector.

Four goals in seven minutes and a furious MonkLiverpool and Stoke City win amid more top flight drama

By Mike Collett
LONDON (Reuters) - Liverpool scored a stunning 3-2 win over bottom side Queens Park Rangers with four goals coming in a frenzied seven-minute finale at Loftus Road as the drama continued in the Premier League on Sunday.
QPR's Steven Caulker put the ball into his own net - Rangers' second own goal of the game - in the 95th minute to hand Liverpool the points after home substitute Eduardo Vargas had twice equalised in the last few minutes.
Liverpool's last-gasp win was an amazing affair, with no hint of the dramatic finale as they held a 1-0 lead - thanks to Richard Dunne's own goal in the 67th - with three minutes left.
Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers told Sky Sports: "QPR certainly didn't deserve to lose. I thought we were very, very lucky to get the win.
"We showed tremendous character and were a little bit better in the second half but QPR definitely deserved something from the game."
It capped an extraordinary weekend which on Saturday saw Sergio Aguero score all four goals for Manchester City in a 4-1 win over Tottenham Hotspur in a game that saw four penalties.
Southampton had also recorded their biggest top flight league win on Saturday with an 8-0 demolition of Sunderland.
FURIOUS MONK
The theatre continued in Sunday's late game with post-match recriminations following Stoke City's 2-1 win over Swansea City, which featured two converted penalties.
Swansea manager Garry Monk accused Stoke's Victor Moses and the referee Michael Oliver of cheating, an accusation which could land him in trouble with the FA.
Asked on Sky Sports if he blamed the referee or the player for Stoke's penalty, Monk replied: "He (Moses) should be punished for diving. It was a clear dive which is cheating.
"He has cheated the ref, and the ref has cheated us in terms of giving a decision that never was."
The defeat meant Swansea, who were second at the end of August, slipped a place to eighth after a fifth league game without a win.
Liverpool ended the day in fifth up from 10th, Stoke climbed to 10th from 15th while QPR stayed bottom.
Chelsea's 2-1 win over Crystal Palace on Saturday, which saw two red cards, left them top on 22 points from eight games, with Manchester City second on 17, one ahead of Southampton, with West Ham fourth on 13 points after their 3-1 win at Burnley.
OWN GOALS
QPR had the better of the first half with Leroy Fer hitting the bar twice ahead of the break before Richard Dunne put Liverpool ahead when he put through his own net.
It was Dunne's 10th own goal of his career on his 400th Premier League start and looked like being the winner before Vargas equalised in the 87th minute from close range.
Philippe Coutinho put Liverpool back in front in the 90th minute with a swerving curler that took a deflection off a defender before Vargas headed another QPR equaliser to make it 2-2 in the second minute of stoppage time.
Incredibly, Liverpool then won when Caulker deflected a cross from Raheem Sterling into his own net in the final minute.
QPR manager Harry Redknapp, who has played down talk his job is under threat despite QPR's poor start with just one win from their opening eight games, told reporters: "I couldn't give a monkeys about speculation.
"The rubbish written in the papers, I don't read them. If you do your best you can't give any more."
TWO PENALTIES
QPR were not at their best and contributed to Liverpool's winner when they decided to float the ball into the box rather than shoot from a free kick deep inside their opponents' half.
"If it goes in great, if it goes in the crowd, then organise behind it, but suddenly everyone was running in the box, and you're waiting to get done on the counter attack. You take a point in situation like that... It was naive," said Redknapp.
Most of the drama in Sunday's second match came in the first half before a 76th minute header from Jon Walters swung the match Stoke's way.
Wilfried Bony put Swansea ahead with a penalty in the 34th minute after being wrestled to the ground by Ryan Shawcross.
Charlie Adam equalised for Stoke from another spot kick nine minutes later when Moses appeared to easily go to ground under the slightest of challenges from Angel Rangel, the episode which prompted Monk's fury.
The nine matches played so far this weekend have produced a season high total for one round of 36 goals before West Bromwich Albion host Manchester United on Monday.

Govt to bring Ordinance on cancelled coal blocksComments
Union Cabinet  recommended promulgation of Ordinance to President to resolve pending issues after SC quashed allocation of coal blocks on Monday
The measure has been designed to deal with the implications of the Supreme Court's order in the coal case.
After acquiring the land of these coal blocks, the government would auction these.
The apex court had last month quashed allocation of 214 out of 218 coal blocks alloted to various companies since 1993 terming the method as "fatally flawed".
It had allowed the Centre to take over operation of 42 such blocks which are functional.
The Coal Ministry has drafted the Ordinance after extensive consultations with Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi.
The issues that need to be resolved by the government in the coal mine case include forfeiting of bank guarantees and title deeds of the land mines purchased by the companies, sources said.
Sources said successful bidders in the fresh auction of coal blocks along with the land and plant standing on it would be liable to pay the earlier allottees the cost of the land and the plant along with 12 per cent annual interest on the amount that was originally invested for purchasing the land and setting up plant.
Also, all allottees whose blocks were cancelled by the top Court would be eligible to participate in the fresh auction barring those convicted in coal related cases, sources added.

Meet doctors who are cancer suvivors tooTweet
0
At a time when hospitals are overcrowded and doctors overburdened, it's rare to find a medical practitioner who will go beyond diagnosis and treatment and help counsel you about your health condition. But that's just what these doctors do-mostly because they understand the nuances and can give you insights into what you'll go through and how best to take care of yourself, because they are cancer survivors themselves. 'It makes me value life.' Dr Rajendra Kerkar, gynae-oncologist, at Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, beat back tongue cancer 26 years ago.
When a painful pea-sized white patch on the tongue was diagnosed as squamous carcinoma, a common type of oral cancer, Kerkar was shattered. "Even after I had overcome the initial shock and denial and the anger of 'Why me?', the fear of going under the scalpel, of being left with a tiny stub of a tongue, of not being able to speak 'normally' again continued to haunt me," says Kerkar who was only 28 then.
But he surrendered himself to his surgeon Dr RS Rao at Tata Memorial Hospital (TMH), Mumbai. Post-surgery, Rao had warned him not to speak, to prevent the stitches from snapping. He obeyed. "I realised then that speech is a gift," Kerkar says. He was out of hospital in 3 days but had to undergo 6 weeks of radiation.
The first 3 weeks were okay, but then the side effects surfaced-a loss of taste and a perennially dry mouth that burnt with every morsel of food. The skin on his neck blackened and then peeled off. He bore it all without complaint. He is able to speak from that experience even today, "The treatments are toxic but they are required. And they will come to an end, so don't drop out, I tell my patients."
Learning to speak again was a Herculean task. "I practised before the mirror, framing every syllable and word separately and repeating sentences over and over again. Words with 's' were the biggest roadblock," he says with a slight slur that you would hardly notice if you didn't know his story.
Kerkar had always been keen on a career in gynaeconlogy. And after his cancer diagnosis, his resolve grew stronger. He first went to train at TMH as soon as his treatment was done. Then, 2 years later, he went to the UK for further training. He returned, 9 years later to join TMH as a consultant gynaecological oncologist, and now heads the department. He doesn't make a big deal of his cancer story, but he knows that it has shaped his very being.
"When you get cancer at a young age, your perspective changes-you value every little aspect of your life and make the most of the time you have," he says. As a doctor he is very empathetic and can almost feel what his patients go through. He tends not to give his example but makes an exception when the situation calls for it. "Cancer is not the end of the world. Don't let it make you a bitter-but a better person," he says with the confidence of being on top of it.
'My understanding of my patients has changed.'
Dr Namrata Biswas, anaesthetist at Columbia Asia Hospital, Kolkata, had leukamia 9 years ago. In 2003, Dr Namrata Biswas, an anaesthetist at Columbia-Asia Hospital, Kolkata, had felt unusually weak during her pregnancy. A number of blood tests later, doctors told her she had leukaemia.
At Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai, Biswas and her husband were told that they would have to abort the child immediately to begin her treatment. "Looking back, I still remember the shock and denial my family went through at the time. All of a sudden, our lives had been turned upside down," says Biswas.
While going through her treatment, Biswas decided to not delve into the statistics and survival rates as they would only depress her. "No matter what the statistics tell you, you have to fight for your life. I would not give up," says Biswas.
Biswas joined work after a tumultuous 2 years, but her approach to her patients had changed completely. "When I was undergoing treatment, I realised how we, as healthcare providers, do not communicate with patients enough, making them scared and sceptical about the treatment," she says.
Ever since her return to work, Biswas has ensured that she explains the tiniest of details to patients before administering the treatment. Her belief is that listening to patients' queries, putting them at ease and communicating with them goes a long way in helping them cope with their illnesses. 'I was an excellent patient.'
Dr Urvashi Prasad Jha, gynae-oncologist at Fortis Hospitals, Delhi, won against breast and thyroid cancer 1 year ago. It was during a routine mammogram that Jha felt something wasn't quite right with the report. But the radiologist assured her that all was well. Two years later, she was sure there was a problem. She went for an MR mammography and found she had a big lump in one breast.
A PET scan the next morning revealed a thyroid malignancy as well (though the two were not connected). The next day she was admitted in hospital, Medanta-The Medi-city, Gurgaon, where her husband practises. The following day, she had both the surgeries one after the other in an 8-hour operation.
Dr Deepak Sarin was her thyroid surgeon and Dr Hemant Singhal was her onco-surgeon. They advised her to conserve her breast, an advice she took. "It was great. I was relatively pain-free." And she went back to work in 3 days! "Acceptance was never an issue-my children were settled and I am professionally fulfilled," she says. Soon she underwent radiotherapy which she found awful. "As an onco-surgeon, I used to think it was a song, but it wasn't. I used to get exhausted, and you feel terrible lying on the machine with this thing going around you."
She talks about it to her patients today, especially the feeling of exhaustion (both physically and emotionally) that they'll likely face after. Much like the way she deals with life, Jha was matter of fact about her illness. "It has been the hardest on my husband, and my daughter; my son is much like me-practical.
My mum, then 86, handled my diagnosis with faith in the unknown," she says. And what about Jha herself? "Well, I simply thought of it as something that was coming in the way of work," she says non chalantly. So when a patient is diagnosed with cancer, she reassures them that it's not the end of the world, often sharing her story with them-especially with those who are worried and scared. "It's been very helpful for my patients, because I can tell them, look I've had two cancers but I'm working and getting on with life. You don't let it affect your life. You accept that it's there and get it treated."
As before, Jha continues to talk about breast self-exams and the importance of screening-"Do it on your birthday, then you'll remember each year," she says, rather pragmatically. 'Mammograms cost as much as sarees.'
Dr P Ushalakshmi, gynaecologist from Hyderabad conquered breast cancer 12 years ago. A retired gynaecologist at the Niloufer Hospital, Hyderabad, Dr P Ushalakhsmi is proud of her breast cancer survivor status-it has given her the passion and desire to educate women about the disease and ensure that they learn how to prevent it. "As a doctor, I felt bad that I had not followed the advice that I gave to my patients-to have regular check-ups," says Ushalakshmi. However, when she felt a lump in her breast in a bath, she realised that it had the potential to be more serious. Early detection had helped her treatment and she wanted to educate more women about it. Ushalakshmi was treated in London.
After comparing her experience with medical care in the UK to that in India, she requested her son to set up a similar specialised breast cancer facility in Hyderabad. In 2007, the Ushalakshmi Breast Cancer Foundation was started as a collaboration between Breast Care Centre, UK and Dr Reddy's Foundation for Healthcare Education. Ushalakshmi is working with the Foundation to train health workers in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh to give breast examinations to rural women and educate as many women as possible. "It is so easy for women to forget that they have to take care of themselves as well. It is important for her and her husband to ensure that she gets a mammogram and a pap smear every year and it doesn't cost more than a saree," says Ushalakshmi.

Are You Helping Thieves Steal Your IdentityAre you helping ID thieves steal your personal information?
Herb Weisbaum TODAY contributor
Email
Identity theft is a real and growing threat. And yet, an alarming number of people are putting themselves at risk by not taking simple precautions to guard their personal information.
About 28 million Americans, 12 percent of the adults in this country, were victims of identity theft in the past 12 months, according to a new AARP report, Identity Theft: Who’s at Risk? The nationwide survey also found that:
WOLFGANG RATTAY / Reuters
Having a mailbox that locks is a simple way to prevent identity theft.
59 percent do not have a locking mailbox to prevent mail theft
21 percent never shred personal documents that could be used to steal their identity
54 percent of those aged 18-49 left at least one valuable item in their car, such as a purse or wallet, pay stub or laptop, during the last week
Doug Shadel, a fraud prevention expert with AARP’s Fraud Watch Network , can’t understand why so many people are so nonchalant about this crime.
Shadel just wrote an in-depth article for AARP, She Stole My Life , about the time he spent with “Alice,” an identity thief who showed him how easy it was to get the personal information she needed to do her dirty work.
Alice and her crew would break into cars parked at the mall and look for laptops left inside. They’d hit gym parking lots, well aware that a lot of people leave their wallets in the glove box or under the seat during their workouts.  And they’d go through the mail in unlocked mailboxes, looking for bank statements, credit card offers or other financial information to steal.
Video: For the past 13 years, the number one complaint to the FTC has been identity theft. Cyber security expert Jim Stickley says to protect yourself you should keep confidential information in a safe place, watch out for vacation rentals that request private information, and be careful of first-time jobs that look too good to be true.
“These ID thieves are very brazen,” Shadel told TODAY. “The fact that you live in a supposedly safe neighborhood doesn't stop them.”
With all the news coverage about big data breaches, it’s easy to forget that identity thieves still get what they want the old-fashioned way –  going through the trash, stealing mail and breaking into cars.
“It doesn’t matter how they get your personal information, whether they hack into a database or steal a letter from your mailbox or grab a financial document from your garbage, the damage they can do is going to be the same,” said Eva Velasquez, president and CEO of the non-profit Identity Theft Resource Center in San Diego.
Another alarming finding
Technology is now fueling the rise in identity theft, and yet the AARP survey found that many Americans are even less prepared for these high-tech attacks.
“One of the most shocking findings was that more than one-third of all Americans do not have a pass code on their smartphones,” Shadel said. “All of these people are vulnerable to identity theft because if a thief steals that phone, they have access to all of your stuff – especially if the phone syncs automatically to your accounts.”
The survey also found that:
More than one in three (35 percent) adults surveyed have not set up online access to all of their bank and credit accounts.  Checking these accounts on a regular basis – weekly, if not daily – is one of the best ways to quickly spot financial fraud.
Nearly half (45 percent) use the same password on two or more accounts. If that password is compromised in some way, it gives the crooks the key to multiple accounts and the ability to do more damage.
Almost half (49 percent) have not changed the password on their online bank account in the past six months. This proactive step will block a thief who somehow gets your password. Change it and it’s useless.
There’s really nothing any of us can do about the seemingly endless number of data breaches taking place at big retailers, but you can probably do more to reduce your vulnerability to a personal hack attack.
“Hackers look for unlocked doors and millions of Americans are leaving their doors unlocked,” said Adam Benson, deputy executive director of the Digital Citizens Alliance . “When you take the proper security precautions, it’s like locking the door to your house.”
Taking some basic digital security precautions won’t protect you from everything, but it will stop a lot of the low-level hackers who will simply move on to an easier target, Benson said.
As part of National Cyber Security Awareness Month, the Digital Citizens Alliance and Blackfin Security have created a Personal Threat Assessment quiz (just 10 questions) that can help you determine if your devices and data are secure.

("This is a significant commitment…)
MUMBAI: Private sector Yes Bank today said it has raised $422 million by way of dual currency multi-tenor syndicated loan facility.
The amount, a combination of $288 million and 103.5 million euro, shall be utilised for general corporate purposes, the bank said in a statement.
The privae lender, however, did not specify the coupon for the issue. The loan facility has a maturity of one, two and three years.
"This is a significant commitment from global banks, reinforcing our differentiated business and financial model as well as reflecting faith and trust reposed in the bank," said Managing Director and CEO Rana Kapoor .
The facility was launched in August this year as $275 million plus a green shoe option.
The bank decided to close the book once it crossed the $400 million mark, which was within the comfort level of the green shoe amount.
The loan has received commitments from 21 banks, representing 14 countries across the US, Europe, Africa, West Asia, Japan, Taiwan and Australia, with larger commitment coming in the two and three year tranches, the statement said.
The initial mandated lead arrangers and book-runners (IMLABs) on the transaction were ANZ Banking Group, Bank Muscat SAOG, Commercial Bank of Qatar QSC, Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft, Emirates NBD Capital , First Gulf Bank PJSC, Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp, National Bank of Abu Dhabi PJSC, Shinsei Bank, State Bank of India and Wells Fargo Bank.
The loan was coordinated by Emirates NBD Capital.

NEW DELHI: Days after the Supreme Court cancelled allocation of 214 coal blocks, the government today moved to bring an Ordinance that will enable it to acquire the land of these mines along with plants for auction later.
The Ordinance has been finalised and will be notified after approval of the Union Cabinet, a source said.
The measure has been designed to deal with the implications of the Supreme Court's order in the coal case.

NEW DELHI: Over 150 passengers of an Air India Express flight from Dammam to Kozhikode, scheduled on Saturday night, were stranded almost two days as the Boeing 737 aircraft developed a major technical fault.
A special aircraft has been arranged to fly the passengers from Dammam to Kozhikode via Mangalore tonight to reach India by tomorrow morning, officials of the Air India subsidiary told PTI from Kozhikode, adding that this plane would operate the scheduled flight IX-386.
They said men and materials have been flown to repair the hydraulic brake system of the Boeing plane which was grounded in Dammam.
The unexpected postponement of the flight provoked some of the 160 passengers to get into heated exchanges with the airline staff at the Dammam International Airport, after it was announced that the flight, scheduled to take off late Saturday night, would not operate due to a major problem with its brakes.
The officials said all the passengers were provided with accommodation and necessary help and they were being flown out of Dammam tonight to reach Mangalore and Kozhikode tomorrow morning.

SAARC nations should identify areas of chall...India
(South Asian countries should…)
NEW DELHI: South Asian countries should identify specific areas of common heritage, challenges and opportunities to foster region-wide cooperation, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said today while committing India's full support to the SAARC process.
He made the remarks here while receiving Nepalese Foreign Minister Mahendra Bahadur Pandey who handed over to him a formal invite from Prime Minister Sushil Koirala for attending the upcoming SAARC Summit in Kathmandu on November 26-27.
Modi, who had invited leaders of all SAARC countries for his swearing-in in May, reiterated that he attaches the highest level of priority to relations with SAARC countries and that he keenly looks forward to participating in his first Summit of the eight-member grouping.
He considered the SAARC as a vital instrument to add to the strength of each member nation and advance collective action for shared prosperity in the region, a PMO statement said.
In addition to promoting regional connectivity and integration, Modi said the SAARC countries should identify specific areas of common heritage, challenges and opportunities to foster region-wide cooperation, it said.
Committing India's full support to the SAARC process, he also expressed strong belief that SAARC countries had much to learn from each other`s experiences and strengths.
Modi, who undertook his first visit as Prime Minister to Nepal in August, conveyed his gratitude to the people and the government of that country for the warmth and affection, as well as the "extraordinary hospitality", which he received during the trip, the statement said.
He welcomed the progress in key areas of bilateral relations since the visit.
He expressed hope for early completion of the drafting process of Nepal`s Constitution, the statement said.

Why Modi has chosen DD  AIR over pvt channelsView Photo
Prime Minister Narendra Modi gestures as he speaks during the launch of 'Make …
NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi has anointed India's state-backed broadcaster as his media brand of choice, helping shield his government from tough questions and prompting private news outlets to complain that they are being kept out of the loop.
Starchy and unpolished, Doordarshan News and All India Radio (AIR) were not the obvious choice for a government that took power in May after a high-octane election campaign that used special effects to beam Modi's image to rallies across the nation.
But the old-fashioned outlets are expected to offer one big advantage over their slicker private rivals: a less combative and questioning platform from which Modi can get his message out to tens of millions of Indians.
Carefully controlled communication has been a defining characteristic of the new government since Modi's nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party swept to power.
Critics see it as one symptom of a broader leadership style under Modi that has weakened opponents, sidelined ministers and concentrated power in the Prime Minister's Office (PMO).
Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar said Modi's preference for the public broadcaster was not an attempt to suppress information or limit access.
"I think everyone must welcome it. He has not banned anybody, his programmes are telecast live, practically on all channels, so where is the issue? There is no denying somebody access."
"There is complete freedom in our regime," he told reporters.
PMO officials were not available to comment for this story.
"FROM THE HEART"
Modi has never given a news conference as prime minister, but he has been active on Facebook and Twitter, where he has over 7 million followers, bypassing traditional media and spurring editors to complain about a lack of two-way communication and debate.
Now, for the first time, an Indian prime minister has a direct link to voters' living rooms in his home.
Last month, the state broadcaster set up a recording studio at Modi's official residence where he will record "Man ki Baat" ("talking from the heart"), his regular address to the nation on AIR that debuted earlier in October.
Doordarshan has been contracted to build a television studio at Modi's residence so his talk can be televised as well, according to an engineer working on the project.
Separately, the government has sent a letter asking ministries to engage more with the publicly funded broadcaster, according to the India Today news website, and has given its journalists coveted spots in a significantly reduced press corps that travels with the prime minister overseas.
Thirty or more journalists usually travelled with the previous prime minister. But on Modi's recent trip to the United States, only nine - the majority from state-funded organisations - accompanied him, according to the foreign ministry.
Private news outlets say diminishing interaction with the government has made their jobs harder.
"There has been a lot of communication from the government, but it's been very top-down," said N. Ravi, editor of the Hindu newspaper and president of the Editors Guild of India, which issued a statement in September calling on the government to interact more with journalists. "It's been a one-way street."
The Guild statement noted "a certain deficit of transparency in the functioning of the government," citing the delay in setting up a media liaison in the PMO and restricting access to ministers and bureaucrats.
BAD BLOOD
Modi has had rocky relations with the media since 2002, when at least 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, died in religious riots in Gujarat state, where he was chief minister at the time.
Local and international media reported extensively on the violence, raised questions about the state government's role and some blamed Modi for failing to stop the brutality.
Modi has always denied any wrongdoing, and courts have never found sufficient evidence to prosecute him.
But the relationship remained fraught. Since 2002 his aides have routinely requested journalists to present their questions in advance as a condition to secure a formal meeting with him.
In 2007, Modi abruptly walked out of an interview with a private Indian news channel when he was asked whether he regretted the 2002 incidents.
Modi sat through an interview with Reuters last year, dismissing concerns about his style of management and saying that he welcomed criticism because "the strength of democracy lies in criticism".
Since taking office Modi has not given an interview to the Indian media, though he has spoken with foreign news outlets ahead of trips abroad.
"Even for the positives of the government to be brought out, a certain amount of access is necessary," said NDTV political editor Rahul Shrivastava, who has covered the PMO since the mid-1990s.
Now, he said, "you have to accept [information] as it comes – both in terms and quality and quantity."
In June, Information and Broadcasting Minister Javadekar said he would give Prasar Bharati, the state body that operates AIR and Doordarshan, more autonomy and editorial freedom. The government's new reliance on these networks may complicate that.
The government asked ministries to strengthen ties with state-run broadcasters because of their national reach, Bimal Julka, secretary of Javadekar's ministry, told Reuters.
The government wants information "to penetrate to the last mile", he said, but it is "distorted" by some private outlets and so public broadcasters also need to distribute the facts.

External forces inciting protests: Hong Kong leaderprint
Hong Kong’s top government official CY Leung has said that external forces were inciting the ongoing pro-democracy protests in the city even as his government prepares for talks with student representatives on Tuesday.
The ongoing protests, which have now entered its fourth week, have paralysed parts of the financial hub for more than three weeks now with the participants demanding a free and fair election in 2017 and Leung’s resignation.
Though the numbers of protesters have dwindled in the past week, many are still camped at key locations in the city.
The weekend was marred by clashes between the agitators and police personnel with the latter removing barricades from locations to clear way for traffic.
Beijing has fully backed the embattled Leung and has repeatedly warned that no country should interfere in Hong Kong’s affairs.
Leung’s statement to a television station about outside forces working in Hong Kong was on similar lines.
“There is obviously participation by people, organisations from outside of Hong Kong, in politics in Hong Kong, over a long time. This is not the only time when they do it, and this is not an exception either,” Leung said.
Leung, however, did not name any country or organisation which could be involved.
Protesters have denied Leung’s claim.
Student activist Alex Chow told the BCC that the leader's comments were “irresponsible”, adding that he did not provide any evidence to support his claim.
Police in Hong Kong were not ruling out clearing protests sites in Mong Kok locality, Hong Kong police spokesperson Hui Chun-Tak was quoted as saying by the state media.
“Police will continue to monitor the developments and make suitable assessments and we will decide when to take action based on the actual circumstances,” the officer said.
Protesters had clashed with the police in the area over the weekend.
Tuesday’s talks are not expected to end the protests and the sense of impasse as the Hong Kong government is unlikely to meet any of the primary demands of the Occupy Central members.

IDBI Bank raises Rs 2.5k cr via AT-I bondsAT-I bonds
(The Rs 2,500 crore bond issue…)
MUMBAI: State-run IDBI Bank on Monday has raised Rs 2,500 crore by selling perpetual bonds at 10.75% annual coupon rate. This is the second such issue in the country after Bank of India's, which is compliant with Basel III capital adequacy norms, an international regulatory framework for banks.
Tier I perpetual bonds issues help strengthen the issuing bank's capital base. ET had earlier reported about the pricing details.
"This issuance will pave the way for other banks to issue Tier I bonds in the domestic market and will increase the acceptance of this instrument among the investors," said M S Raghavan, Chairman & Managing Director, IDBI Bank.
The issue has a call option after the instrument has run for 10 years. It received an overwhelming response and has been fully subscribed prior to the closure date, IDBI Bank said in a release.
The core issue size was at Rs 1,500 crore with an option to retain over-subscription up to Rs 1,000 crore. The issue opened on September 29 this year. The bonds are rated AA- by CRISIL and India Rating.
Earlier in July, Bank of India issuance opened in July this year. BoI bonds are currently yielding 10.55-60% range in the secondary market, suggesting more than 3% price increase, which is almost in line with the increase in the benchmark government bonds.
IDBI Bank's capital adequacy ratio stood at 11.60% as of June. It is estimated at about 12.60% or above after this issuance.
At the same time, private sector lender Yes Bank has raised about Rs 2,500 crore, or $422 million, through offshore syndicated loan facility both in dollar and euro with three maturities one-two-three years.
"This fund raising will us diversifying (borrowing sources) and also to maintain the liquidity coverage ratio by January next year," said Arun Agrawal, group president-international banking, Yes Bank. "Typically, we do one (offshore) syndicated loan ever year. Globally liquidity is sloshing and the response was good as we obtained better pricing than last year."
"Had we raised it in rupee terms domestically, the cost would have been similar," he said.
The bank will bring the entire sum back to India on a fully hedged basis and plans to use it for expanding loans.

Blue Monday for Big BlueIBM shares down after it dumps chip unit, posts disappointing earnings

IBM getting out of the chip business
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
It's looking like a very blue Monday for Big Blue.
IBM shares were sharply lower after the company dumped its chip unit at a loss and said it was disappointed with its earnings.
The computing company, a component of the Dow Jones industrial average , will take a $4.7 billion charge to sell its chip unit to Globalfoundaries, which will be a supplier of chips to IBM for the next three years. The chip unit lost another $100 million in the most recent quarter, roughly the same as the loss a year earlier.
To shed the money-losing unit, IBM will continue to invest $3 billion in chip research and development over the next five years, with Globalfoundaries benefiting from the results of that research. In return for that, Globalfoundaries will pay IBM only $1.5 billion over the next three years.
Related: IBM builds a brain out of computer chips
IBM also reported lower earnings and revenue that were sharply below forecasts by Wall Street analysts. It said the poor results were due to a "marked slowdown in September" in sales and that the results "point to the unprecedented pace of change in our industry."
"We are disappointed in our performance," said CEO Ginni Rometty.
The fall in IBM ( IBM , Tech30 ) shares took Dow futures, which had been positive earlier, into negative territory.

Bankruptcy Code
(The government has set up…)
NEW DELHI: The government has set up a committee to frame bankruptcy law to enable entrepreneurs to close down unviable businesses.
The committee under T K Vishwanathan, former Law Secretary, will study the corporate bankruptcy legal framework in India and submit a report by February next year, Finance Ministry said in a statement.
Finance Minster Arun Jaitley in 2014-15 Budget had announced that an entrepreneur friendly legal bankruptcy framework would be developed for SMEs to enable easy exit.
The Committee will examine the whole gamut of issues relating to bankruptcy, including the following specific areas like why bankruptcy matters and early detection and resolution of financial distress.
It would also look into protection of interest of stakeholders and would study the rescue mechanism and suggest ways of improving it, besides liquidation procedure for smaller companies.
In its meeting in August, the sub-committee of the Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC) had called for taking early steps by financial sector regulators for a vibrant, deep and liquid corporate bond market:
"A group headed by a former Law Secretary would examine all the existing laws and a single Bankruptcy Code would be put in place as an effective Bankruptcy Code is critical in developing a sound corporate bond market," an RBI statement said today.

Maharashtra Assembly: Sena  BJP stand-off continues; NCP ready for  outside supportComments
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is in no hurry to form a government in Maharashtra, hoping to wear down its former ally, the Shiv Sena, into offering unconditional support as political negotiations over who will rule the state gathered momentum on Monday.
 
Speculation swirled about whether the BJP would join hands with the National Congress Party (NCP), which has already offered outside support, or turn to the Shiv Sena, with whom it snapped a 25-year-old alliance days before the assembly election.

Read: Sena hopes for best, ready for worst
Though the BJP is 22 seats short of a majority in the 288-member assembly, it has an upper hand in negotiations with future allies because it is the single largest party with 123 seats compared with the Shiv Sena’s 63 seats. However, it still needs to team up with one of the opposition parties for a majority of 145.
“Our primary aim is to run the government without the Sena’s support,” said a senior BJP leader. “We are in no hurry. If the Sena wants, it may join us but without any condition.”
 
The BJP has not yet decided on accepting the NCP’s offer, but it has begun talks with smaller parties and independents who together have 19 seats. Party sources said they would get the support of at least 16, taking its tally to 139. Two each from the All India Majlis-E-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) and Samajwadi Party may even stay neutral.
All possibilities, including the extension of President’s Rule or poaching a group of MLAs from other parties are also being considered, they added.

The BJP kept its suitors waiting as Prime Minister Narendra Modi and party president Amit Shah met union transport minister Nitin Gadkari on Monday, sparking speculation in party circles that they wanted him to take over as chief minister.
 
Party MLAs are likely to meet in Mumbai on Tuesday to select their chief ministerial candidate. State party chief Devendra Fadnavis, the 44-year-old fourth-term MLA from Nagpur, still looked like a front-runner for the top job. He is seen as having an edge because he has the backing of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and has a clean image.

State leaders felt the party should have an alliance with the Sena but in a revised format. Sources said the Sena has certain demands, including the deputy chief minister’s position, one-third of ministerial berths with key portfolios and a promise that the BJP-led government will not split Maharashtra to create Vidarbha state.
 
They said the Shiv Sena wanted a plum share in government in line with a formula the two parties have had in place since the first time they ruled together between 1995 and 1999. The BJP rejected the formula and sought a deal under which the Shiv Sena will get a share based on its strength.
 
Under the old formula – which was also adopted by successive Congress-Nationalist Congress Party governments in the past 15 years -- the chief minister’s post goes to the party with more seats while important ministries such as home, finance, rural development, public health go to the second-largest party.
 
“Even our MLAs want us to forge an alliance with the Sena on a condition that they do not suffer at the hands of the ex-ally’s arrogant ways. Even grassroot workers from both parties who fought each other in the elections are ready to patch up in view of their old association,” said a leader who is part of the state’s core committee.
 

Cabinet clears ordinance toend coal blocks stalemateComments
The government plans to put up coal mines for bidding by private steel, power and cement companies and introduce changes in the law to enable commercial mining in the future, signalling its intent to fully open the sector to private players.
The new auction-based system will replace the earlier controversial policy of allotting coal blocks based on recommendations of a panel of bureaucrats, which the Supreme Court had struck down last month as arbitrary. The Court had cancelled 214 blocks allotted since 1993, a move that threatened a nascent economic recovery.
Read: Gold import curbs could be back after Diwali
The measures, announced on Monday by finance minister Arun Jaitley and coal and power minister Piyush Goyal, follow close on the heels of labour and fuel sector reforms and are likely to go down well with markets.
“The Cabinet has recommended promulgation of an Ordinance to the President in order to resolve the pending issues particularly the situation arising out of the Supreme Court judgement quashing the allocation of the coal blocks,” Jaitley told a press conference after a cabinet meeting that approved the decision.
Currently only steel, power and cement companies are allowed to own mines for their own use. But in the future there could be commercial use of mines, a move that would enable private companies to get into trading coal and break the monopoly of public sector monolith Coal India.
“There will be an enabling provision for the future where under rules which are framed for commercial users of mines could also be decided by the Central government. This would lead to an optimal utilisation of the natural resource,” Goyal said. He added that power prices could fall as a result.
Jaitley vehemently denied a suggestion whether the process could be termed as “de-nationalisation” of the coal sector saying, “The original Nationalisation Act remains and will remain and Coal India Ltd will be fully protected.”
The government will allot mines directly to state-owned companies like NTPC and state electricity boards, and only companies incorporated in India will be allowed to participate in bids.
“The actual users of coal in the cement, steel and power sectors who apply for a certain number of coal mines will be put in the pool and there would be an e-auction. A sufficient and adequate number of mines would be put so that actual users go back with the mines,” Jaitley said.
“The entire mess that the UPA had left behind from 2005 onwards over the next four months would be cleaned up,” he said, adding coal worth $20 billion (about Rs. 1.26 lakh crore) which was being imported annually would be domestically substituted through this measure.
Coal-rich states Jharkhand, Odisha, West Bengal and Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh would make big fiscal gains from the auctions, a fact that could endear the ruling BJP to the electorate in any of those states going to assembly polls in the next few years.
India’s estimated coal reserves now stand at 301 billion tonnes, the fifth highest in the world, but companies still have to import as large number of mines remain unused.
More than half of India’s power is produced from coal. State-owned Coal India, accounts for nearly 80% of the country’s coal output, but it isn’t enough to meet India’s rising energy demand.
India’s coal imports jumped more than three times in the last eight years—from 41.2 million tonnes in 2005-06 to 140.6 million tonnes in 2012-13.
The previous UPA government had come a under relentless attack after India’s national auditor Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) in a report in 2012 suggested that the arbitrary allocation of coalfields may have robbed the exchequer of potential revenues of Rs. 1.86 lakh crore between 2004 and 2011.
“We sincerely hope that benefits of the auction of coal blocks will go to actual users and percolate down to the consumers. At the same time, we also caution the government to weave in necessary parameters and safeguards to ensure these benefits reach the ultimate consumers,” Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said.

SBI to carry on operations in UK despite crackdown on foreign banks

Crackdown
("Our intention is to continue…)
LONDON: State Bank of India is determined to carry on retail banking operations in the UK despite a recent crackdown by the Bank of England on the operations of foreign-owned banks in the country.
SBI , which has been operating in the UK for 95 years, said it is prepared to set aside 100 million pounds in ring-fenced capital and restructure its operations if that is necessary to keep operating on the high streets.
Mrutyunjay Mahapatra, the UK head of the bank, told 'The Times' newspaper that the bank will keep serving retail customers in Britain as well as open new branches.
"Our intention is to continue to do business in the UK. We have been here for 95 years. We're too deep rooted here," he said.
The Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) of the Bank of England had recently issued an ultimatum to the British operations of foreign-owned banks taking deposits of more than 100 million pounds to restructure with their own ring-fenced capital or end retail operations.
SBI, which has over 900 million pounds of deposits in Britain, is among those affected.
Bank of Baroda, which has 10 branches in Britain, and Bank of India, with seven, could also be hit.
A consultation launched in February by the PRA, responsible for supervising individual banks, concluded in September.
Under the new rules, banks from outside the European Economic Area ( EEA ) must offer only minimal retail services.
Analysts suggest Isbank of Turkey and Overseas Chinese Banking Corporation of Singapore are also likely to be affected.
They would either have to shut down their retail banking operations in Britain or convert from branch status to full UK subsidiary - an expensive and cumbersome process.
The new rules mean it will be easier for wholesale foreign banks , which cater to other financial institutions and large corporations rather than retail customers, to open non-deposit taking branches which would not face size limits but are likely to make it very difficult for some retail bank branches to operate.

The Name of Google s New Text-Messaging App Is Really Going to Annoy FacebookNot sure Facebook will "Like" this.
Photo by BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/GettyImages
Google is introducing a text-messaging app called "Messenger" with the launch of Android 5.0 Lollipop , the new version of its mobile operating system.
Advertisement
That, obviously, will be confusing because it has the same name as Facebook's existing messaging app. Do not expect folks at Facebook to jump for joy at this news.
Facebook Messenger is a juggernaut: It's currently No. 1 in the app store charts, according to App Annie . It has more than 200 million users, and that number will climb as Facebook requires its users to do their messaging separately inside Messenger instead of Facebook (the company's new policy). It's also a really good app.
Facebook also has another "messenger" app you may have heard of: WhatsApp Messenger. It's No. 3 in the app store charts. It has more than 600 million users.
It gets even more confusing because Google already has a really good messaging app. If you're an Android user, you'll know that Google's Hangouts app is one of the best things about Android—chat messages from your Gmail account follow you automatically on your phone. It's seamless.
So it's not clear why Google wants people on a traditional SMS/MMS text messaging platform as well. Google told the 9to5Google blog :
Messenger and Hangouts offer users choice, each have their own benefits. Hangouts work great for cross platform (web, iOS, Android) and cross medium communications (video, voice, messaging, SMS). Messenger will be specially designed to be a quick and easy way to send and receive SMS and MMS messages on Android; more to come (Nexus 6 will come with both apps).
And just to be even more confusing, "Messenger" used to be called "Messaging," according to Phone Arena .
OK, so users will have choices. That's great. It would be easier to figure out those choices if the product names were a little more distinctive, though. Just a suggestion.
Here's a chart:

Nigeria officially Ebola free: World Health OrganizationWHO declares Nigeria officially Ebola free
AFP
print
The World Health Organization on Monday declared Nigeria officially Ebola-free, after 42 days -- or two incubation periods -- without any new confirmed cases of the deadly virus.
"The virus is gone for now. The outbreak in Nigeria has been defeated," WHO country representative Rui Gama Vaz said in Abuja.
"This is a spectacular success story that shows to the world that Ebola can be contained."
The arrival of Ebola in Nigeria, which is Africa's most populous nation, leading economy and top oil producer, sparked fears of its rapid spread throughout the country of 170 million people.
But the doomsday scenario did not happen and health experts involved in tackling the outbreak praised the authorities for their rapid response and comprehensive contact tracing.
In all, eight people died out of 20 confirmed cases in Nigeria's biggest city, Lagos, and the oil hub of Port Harcourt, while nearly 900 people were monitored for signs of the disease.
Nigeria's official Ebola-free status comes after Senegal was given the all-clear on Friday.
Read: Is Ebola the world's worst infectious disease threat after AIDS?
Both countries are coming under close scrutiny from public health specialists looking to contain the spread of the disease around the world.
More than 4,500 people have died and nearly 10,000 have been infected with the haemorrhagic fever, most of them in West Africa, since the start of the year.
But a number of cases outside the region, particularly in Spain and the United States, have raised fears about its wider transmission and the urgency for a more effective response.
As well as rigorous contact tracing, Nigeria introduced stringent health screening checks at all airport and sea ports for arrivals and departures.
Cameroon, Nigeria's neighbour to the east, shut its border as a precaution, but Abuja did not close its frontiers.
Travel bans were not imposed, although leading carrier Arik Air did suspend its scheduled routes to Liberia and Sierra Leone, which with Guinea have been the worst affected by Ebola.

Cabinet clears ordinance to end coal blocks allocation stalemateComments
The government plans to put up coal mines for bidding by private steel, power and cement companies and introduce changes in the law to enable commercial mining in the future, signalling its intent to fully open the sector to private players.
The new auction-based system will replace the earlier controversial policy of allotting coal blocks based on recommendations of a panel of bureaucrats, which the Supreme Court had struck down last month as arbitrary. The Court had cancelled 214 blocks allotted since 1993, a move that threatened a nascent economic recovery.
Read: Gold import curbs could be back after Diwali
The measures, announced on Monday by finance minister Arun Jaitley and coal and power minister Piyush Goyal, follow close on the heels of labour and fuel sector reforms and are likely to go down well with markets.
“The Cabinet has recommended promulgation of an Ordinance to the President in order to resolve the pending issues particularly the situation arising out of the Supreme Court judgement quashing the allocation of the coal blocks,” Jaitley told a press conference after a cabinet meeting that approved the decision.
Currently only steel, power and cement companies are allowed to own mines for their own use. But in the future there could be commercial use of mines, a move that would enable private companies to get into trading coal and break the monopoly of public sector monolith Coal India.
“There will be an enabling provision for the future where under rules which are framed for commercial users of mines could also be decided by the Central government. This would lead to an optimal utilisation of the natural resource,” Goyal said. He added that power prices could fall as a result.
Jaitley vehemently denied a suggestion whether the process could be termed as “de-nationalisation” of the coal sector saying, “The original Nationalisation Act remains and will remain and Coal India Ltd will be fully protected.”
The government will allot mines directly to state-owned companies like NTPC and state electricity boards, and only companies incorporated in India will be allowed to participate in bids.
“The actual users of coal in the cement, steel and power sectors who apply for a certain number of coal mines will be put in the pool and there would be an e-auction. A sufficient and adequate number of mines would be put so that actual users go back with the mines,” Jaitley said.
“The entire mess that the UPA had left behind from 2005 onwards over the next four months would be cleaned up,” he said, adding coal worth $20 billion (about Rs. 1.26 lakh crore) which was being imported annually would be domestically substituted through this measure.
Coal-rich states Jharkhand, Odisha, West Bengal and Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh would make big fiscal gains from the auctions, a fact that could endear the ruling BJP to the electorate in any of those states going to assembly polls in the next few years.
India’s estimated coal reserves now stand at 301 billion tonnes, the fifth highest in the world, but companies still have to import as large number of mines remain unused.
More than half of India’s power is produced from coal. State-owned Coal India, accounts for nearly 80% of the country’s coal output, but it isn’t enough to meet India’s rising energy demand.
India’s coal imports jumped more than three times in the last eight years—from 41.2 million tonnes in 2005-06 to 140.6 million tonnes in 2012-13.
The previous UPA government had come a under relentless attack after India’s national auditor Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) in a report in 2012 suggested that the arbitrary allocation of coalfields may have robbed the exchequer of potential revenues of Rs. 1.86 lakh crore between 2004 and 2011.
“We sincerely hope that benefits of the auction of coal blocks will go to actual users and percolate down to the consumers. At the same time, we also caution the government to weave in necessary parameters and safeguards to ensure these benefits reach the ultimate consumers,” Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said.

Markets surge on diesel decontrol  assembly election resultsSensex vaults 321 points on diesel deregulation
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  Mumbai, October 20, 2014
First Published: 10:09 IST(20/10/2014) | Last Updated: 00:24 IST(21/10/2014)
Comments
Diwali came early to Dalal Street on Monday with both the Sensex and Nifty marking their biggest daily gains in more than one week after the Narendra Modi government's energy reforms led to a rally in shares of oil retailers, while wins by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Maharashtra and Haryana assembly elections raised expectations of more reforms.
The 30-share BSE Sensex rose 21.32 points, or 1.23%, to 26,429.8. The broader Nifty surged 99.70 points, or 1.28%, to end at 7,879.40.
Hindustan Petroleum jumped 7.4%, Bharat Petroleum rose 4.5%, while Indian Oil gained 3.8%.
Auto stocks also moved higher, as removal of price controls on diesel is seen helping demand for cars. Maruti Suzuki India gained 2%, Ashok Leyland ended up 2.1% and Mahindra and Mahindra rose 0.6%.
The International Monetary Fund further raised sentiment by predicting that India is poised to become a $2-trillion economy this year, with its GDP size crossing $3 trillion in 2019.
"The gods are really smiling on India this time," said Nandan Chakraborty of Axis Capital. "Macro factors such as rains, low crude prices have been very helpful. But, the government has also shown intent by going ahead with reforms."
Recently, global crude oil and other commodity prices have fallen to four-year lows, which may change India's twin deficits favourably, given that the country is a net commodity importer.
"The markets are reacting to GDP expansion and the improved prospects from exports," said Shankar Sharma of securities firm First Global. "Software, pharma and auto are still the main factors that will pull the Indian economy," he told HT over the phone from Dubai.
Foreign brokerages are also upbeat on India's prospects (see graphic). "Investor sentiment is likely to improve as the government is seen as more reform-oriented," a Nomura report said.
"The Modi administration has embarked on one of its biggest reforms over the weekend to modernise the economy," said Mole Hau of BNP Paribas.

Maharashtra picture still hazy as Shiv Sena  BJP stand-off continues | Full coverageBJP
(A day after Maharashtra…)
MUMBAI: A day after Maharashtra Assembly polls gave a fractured verdict, major political parties today went into a huddle exploring ways for government formation but the picture remained nebulous with speculation rife about whether it will be an NCP-propped BJP ministry or a coalition regime with Shiv Sena.
The stand-off between former allies BJP and Shiv Sena, whose coming together will obviate the need for an outside support from NCP, continued even after Uddhav Thackeray's phone call to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP Chief Amit Shah yesterday to congratulate them on the party's electoral triumph in Maharashtra and Haryana.
The newly elected Shiv Sena MLAs met and authorised party President Uddhav Thackeray to choose their leader in the House but there was no discussion at the meeting on reviving the 25-year-old alliance that fell apart just before the election following failure of seat-sharing talks.
"All the newly elected MLAs met Uddhavji today and they unanimously took a decision to give him the right of choosing the legislative party leader," Sena MP Sanjay Raut said after the meeting.
"Today's meet was not about the BJP. Therefore, we haven't discussed BJP at all. A final decision will be taken by Uddhavji and conveyed to the media in due course," he said.
Another Sena MP Anil Desai said "no overture" was made to BJP on a reunion and the meeting was called just to authorise Uddhav to select a new legislature party leader.
Om Mathur, BJP's Assembly poll incharge, said the party was "open to all" in its quest for forming government "but there has been no proposal" from Shiv Sena.
"In the interest of Maharashtra and for government formation, all doors are open," he said when asked if BJP had accepted NCP's offer of outside support.
BJP General Secretary incharge of Maharashtra Rajiv Pratap Rudy said Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh and another General Secretary J P Nadda, appointed observers for election of the legislature party leader, will discuss "in depth" the issue of ties with Sena.
"After Rajnath Singh and J P Nadda arrive, the top BJP leadership will have a conclusive statement as to how we are going to proceed with our alliance. As of now, BJP is confining itself to that it is going to stake the claim for chief ministership of Maharashtra," he said.
Singh and Nadda are likely to arrive here tonight. He also said BJP Parliamentary Board, the party's highest decision-making body, had not discussed NCP's offer.
As the picture remained hazy, NCP Chief Sharad Pawar defended the party's decision to extend "outside support" to BJP, which has emerged as the largest party in the 288-member Assembly with 122 seats, saying it was the "best alternative" to usher in a "stable" government.
"Offering outside support to BJP was the best among alternatives before us. We have to ensure a stable government comes in Maharashtra," Pawar said, addressing newly elected MLAs after nephew and former Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar was elected leader of the NCP legislature party.
Pawar said no other combination was feasible going by the number of seats won by major parties.
  Ajit Pawar claimed he was approached by a Congress leader who proposed forming a coalition government with Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena as constituents.
"A Congress leader contacted me on phone and suggested we form a government that also includes Shiv Sena...I told him together we have 146 MLAs and the government thus cobbled together will not be stable," he said.
While Congress has 42 MLAs in the 288-member Assembly, NCP has 41 and Shiv Sena 63.
Though BJP has emerged as the largest party in the House with 122 seats and its ally Rashtriya Samaj Paksha one, it is still 22 seats short of the magic figure of 145.
As BJP was certain to form government, political circles were abuzz about the prospective chief minister but state party President Devendra Fadnavis looked a clear favourite.
Though names of Leader of Opposition in the outgoing Assembly Eknath Khadse, his counterpart in the Legislative Council Vinod Tawde, who has won the Assembly election, former state BJP Chief Sudhir Mungantiwar, Pankaja Munde, daughter of Union Minister late Gopinath Munde, are doing the rounds as top contenders, young Fadnavis looked like having an edge.
The 44-year-old fourth-term MLA from Nagpur, who has a clean image, has roots in RSS and had come in for special praise by Narendra Modi who described him as "Nagpur's gift to the nation" at an election rally.
As the youngest mayor of Nagpur aged 27, Fadnavis had introduced the popular scheme of publicly maintained toilets in the city, something that would not escape Modi's notice, especially after the much-publicised launch of his own "Swachch Bharat' campaign.

Surat firm gifts 491 cars  200 two-BHK flats...Diamond industry
(The company has gifted the…)
AHMEDABAD: Surat's diamond industry may still be struggling to regain its sparkle after the economic slowdown but about 1,200 employees of local firm Hari Krishna Exports have ample reason to celebrate this Diwali. The company has gifted the employees 491 Fiat Punto cars, 200 two-bedroom houses and jewellery ahead of the festival of lights .
"This is part of our rewards for loyalty programme for employees who have shown high degree of performance in the past five years," Savji Dholakia , chairman and managing director of Hari Krishna Exports told ET.
The incentives, adding to Rs 50 crore, were meant for the employees who contributed significantly to the growth of the company over the past five years, he said, adding that this is normal annual Diwali bonus for the company.
Established in 1991, the diamond firm has an annual turnover of Rs 5,000 crore and a workforce of about 6,000. It has presence overseas as well, in Belgium, Hong Kong and England.
Only 1,200 employees qualified for the rewards, said Dholakia, adding that the gift items were given based on the current needs of the employees. The employees who did not own a house were given the first preference for house. Those who owned a house were eligible for a car while the employees who had both a house and a car were given jewellery, he said.

Toyota recalls 247k vehicles in US over air ...Toyota recalls 247,000 vehicles in US over Takata air bag issue
By Reuters | 20 Oct, 2014, 08.25PM IST
That raised the number of vehicles affected by regional recalls launched in June by several automakers due to the Takata air bags to more than 4.5 million.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
DETROIT: Toyota Motor Corp recalled 247,000 cars, SUVs and pickup trucks in the United States on Monday because of potentially defective front passenger air bag inflators from Japan's Takata Corp that can rupture and spray metal shrapnel, according to US safety regulators.
That raised the number of vehicles affected by regional recalls launched in June by several automakers due to the Takata air bags to more than 4.5 million.
The regional recalls by Toyota and other automakers including Honda Motor and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles'
Chrysler Group began in certain high-humidity areas of the United States after the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) started investigating reports of air bag explosions in Florida and Puerto Rico.
Prompted by NHTSA, Takata and automakers have been trying to determine whether exposure to high humidity caused any defect in the inflators collected though the regional recalls.
"At this point, the issue appears to be a problem related to extended exposure to consistently high humidity," NHTSA said in a statement on Monday. "However, we are leaving no stone unturned in our aggressive pursuit to track down the full geographic scope of this issue."
Toyota recovered replaced air bag inflators from areas of South Florida and Takata evaluated them starting in August, according to the NHTSA documents. On Oct. 10, Takata informed Toyota that a number of the inflators performed "improperly" during testing. Five days later, after reviewing the data with NHTSA, Toyota decided on the recall.
Over the last six years, Takata has recalled about 16 million vehicles globally for defective air bags, including the regional recalls.
The Toyota vehicles affected by Monday's recall are from model years 2002 through 2005, according to the NHTSA documents. They include the Lexus SC coupe, Toyota Corolla small car, Corolla Matrix small car, Sequoia SUV and Tundra full-size pickup. Also part of the recall is General Motors' Pontiac Vibe, which was built by Toyota.
The vehicles being recalled are registered or originally sold in areas of South Florida, along the Gulf Coast, Puerto Rico, Hawaii, the US Virgin Islands, Guam, Saipan and American Samoa, according to the NHTSA documents.
A Toyota spokeswoman said the automaker was not aware of any crashes, injuries or deaths related to the recall. A U.S. spokesman for Takata could not be reached for immediate comment.
Dealers will replace the front passenger airbag inflator with a newly made replacement. If a replacement is not available as a temporary measure the dealer will disable the air bag and advise the customer not to use the front passenger seat, according to the NHTSA documents.
Other automakers affected by the regional recalls include BMW, Ford Motor, Mazda Motor, Mitsubishi Motors, Nissan Motor and Fuji Heavy Industries' Subaru.

Chopper deal: Court rejects Gautam Khaitan s...Aeromatrix
(The Central Bureau of Investigation…)
NEW DELHI: A court here Monday dismissed the bail plea of businessman Gautam Khaitan , arrested in a money laundering case related to the AgustaWestland chopper deal .
Special judge V.K. Gupta denied bail to Khaitan who is in judicial custody.
The Enforcement Directorate (ED), while opposing the bail plea, had last Wednesday informed the court that he did not join the trial in Italy and the arrest warrants were still pending against him in an Italian court.
The ED statement came after Khaitan had moved a fresh bail plea, citing an Italian court acquitting two foreigners of graft charges.
Khaitan told the court that in a similar case, the Italian court passed a verdict exonerating two foreign nationals accused of bribery and corruption in India and in this view, the ED's allegation that he had received kickbacks now stands "eroded".
The investigating agency countered it and said that an Aug 5 order of the Italian court shows that Khaitan was involved in money laundering as the court there has mentioned about the illegal acts.
The Italian court Oct 9 acquitted former Finmeccanica CEO Giuseppe Orsi and ex-AgustaWestland head Bruno Spagnolini of corruption charges in the chopper deal with India.
They were, however, sentenced to a two-year jail term on lesser charges of falsification of invoices.
Khaitan, who was on the board of the Chandigarh-based company Aeromatrix, was arrested a day after the agency conducted a search of his premises Sep 22.
The supply of 12 VVIP helicopters from British firm AgustaWestland came under scrutiny after Italian authorities alleged that the company paid a bribe to clinch the deal with India, inked in February 2010.
India Jan 1 terminated the Rs.3,600 crore (about $770 million) deal with AgustaWestland for the purchase of the choppers following allegations of kickbacks having been paid to fix the deal.
India had paid around 45 percent of the total contract value for the choppers meant to ferry the president, the prime minister and other VIPs.
The ED had registered a case in this deal in July 2013 under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act and booked former Indian Air Force chief S.P. Tyagi, foreign nationals Carlo Gerosa, Christian Michel and Guido Haschke, companies like AgustaWestland, its parent company Italy-based Finmeccanica, Chandigarh-based IDS Infotech and Aeromatrix as well as two companies based in Mauritius and Tunisia, a few other firms and unidentified people in its criminal complaint.
The ED named 21 entities in the case.
The Central Bureau of Investigation lodged a separate case in March 2013 against Tyagi and others in connection with the kickback allegations.

Indian diaspora in Sydney is planning the event similar to the one New York’s Madison Square hosted for him
With an expected turn-over of 15,000 people, the Sydney event is being hosted by the Indian Australian Community Foundation (IACF), a coalition of diverse Indian-Australian organisations, to welcome the Indian prime minister.
“The Sydney event is the only community address that Prime Minister Modi will be delivering during his Australian tour.” Ramyavaran Ramaswamy, one of spokespersons of the IACF said.
Within three days of opening registration, over 250 community organisations have registered to be a ‘Reception Partner’ for the event.
Modi would be attending the two-day G20 Summit from Nov 15 to 16 and then visit Sydney on Nov. 17 during which he will address the Indian Diaspora. He will address a joint parliamentary session in Canberra the next day, according to the schedule.
IACF will organise the event with the support of hundreds of groups representing the Indian. Last Indian prime minister to visit to Australia was Rajiv Gandhi in 1986.
Modi’s visit follows Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott’s Indian tour in September when the two sides sealed the historic deal to sell uranium to India.

WHO declares Nigeria officially Ebola freeWHO declares Nigeria officially Ebola free
AFP

The World Health Organization on Monday declared Nigeria officially Ebola-free, after 42 days -- or two incubation periods -- without any new confirmed cases of the deadly virus.
"The virus is gone for now. The outbreak in Nigeria has been defeated," WHO country representative Rui Gama Vaz said in Abuja.
"This is a spectacular success story that shows to the world that Ebola can be contained."
The arrival of Ebola in Nigeria, which is Africa's most populous nation, leading economy and top oil producer, sparked fears of its rapid spread throughout the country of 170 million people.
But the doomsday scenario did not happen and health experts involved in tackling the outbreak praised the authorities for their rapid response and comprehensive contact tracing.
In all, eight people died out of 20 confirmed cases in Nigeria's biggest city, Lagos, and the oil hub of Port Harcourt, while nearly 900 people were monitored for signs of the disease.
Nigeria's official Ebola-free status comes after Senegal was given the all-clear on Friday.
Read: Is Ebola the world's worst infectious disease threat after AIDS?
Both countries are coming under close scrutiny from public health specialists looking to contain the spread of the disease around the world.
More than 4,500 people have died and nearly 10,000 have been infected with the haemorrhagic fever, most of them in West Africa, since the start of the year.
But a number of cases outside the region, particularly in Spain and the United States, have raised fears about its wider transmission and the urgency for a more effective response.
As well as rigorous contact tracing, Nigeria introduced stringent health screening checks at all airport and sea ports for arrivals and departures.
Cameroon, Nigeria's neighbour to the east, shut its border as a precaution, but Abuja did not close its frontiers.
Travel bans were not imposed, although leading carrier Arik Air did suspend its scheduled routes to Liberia and Sierra Leone, which with Guinea have been the worst affected by Ebola.

Sun-Times reverses endorsement stance  will back Bruce...All act surprised: Sun-Times to endorse Bruce Rauner
posted on
Tweet
Chicago Sun-Times
After insisting for nearly three years that it would no longer endorse candidates for political office, the Sun-Times is reversing itself and formally backing Republican Bruce Rauner for governor.
The Sun-Times announced Friday that its Sunday edition would carry its choice for governor. Although the announcement stopped short of saying whom the newspaper would endorse, sources confirmed that Rauner would get the nod enthusiastically over Democrat Pat Quinn.
Michael Ferro Jr.
The decision to endorse Rauner and no other candidates on the November ballot is certain to fuel cynicism about the motives of Michael Ferro Jr., chairman of Sun-Times Media parent company Wrapports LLC. In recent weeks, sources said, Ferro has been exerting pressure on editors regarding coverage of Rauner, who held a 10 percent stake in Wrapports before he became a candidate for governor.
The back-pedaling by the Sun-Times may have been foreshadowed earlier in the week when the paper ran a full-throated editorial in support of Rauner ( “Economy only thing that matters” ) that many regarded as a tacit endorsement.
Questioned about it by Chicago magazine political blogger Carol Felsenthal, Sun-Times publisher and editor-in-chief Jim Kirk said: “This was not a backdoor endorsement. If it were an endorsement we would be upfront about it.”
The Sun-Times said it would make endorsements in the February Chicago municipal elections and “other key local races.”
Here is the text of the Sun-Times editorial announcement:
Why we are back in the endorsement business
The Chicago Sun-Times will again endorse candidates in elections.
We will plunge back in Sunday with an endorsement in the race for governor, and we will make endorsements in the February Chicago municipal elections and other key local races.
Two years and nine months ago, we announced we would no longer make endorsements, explaining that we had come to believe they feed a perception of a hidden bias throughout a newspaper. The Chicago Sun-Times has always taken great care to keep its news coverage separate from its editorials and opinion pieces, but we are sensitive to the fact that we operate within an increasingly fragmented and politicized media market.
Our readers have taken a different view. They have told us they understand the difference between the independence exhibited in the news coverage from opinions expressed in the editorials.
We appreciated this feedback and understanding.
In the years and months since our decision to stop making endorsements, readers have told us constantly that they found great value in them and wished we would make them again. Our endorsements, they said, offered another frame of reference, fresh analysis and insight. Even when they disagreed with an endorsement, readers said, it was of help to them in exercising the most fundamental right of a democratic republic — deciding who will represent them. For every reader who has commended us for standing on the sidelines, seemingly hundreds of others have asked, “Who’s gonna tell me how to vote for …?”  
When we stopped making endorsements, part of our rationale was that in this digital age citizens already have access to a vast number of resources for boning up on the issues and candidates and deciding whom to vote for. While this is true, we also know we have something extra to offer, given our deep Chicago and Illinois roots and knowledge, that can’t be found elsewhere. This is especially true for down-ballot local races for which there often is not a wealth of other information or insight.
The heart of the matter is that Chicago is our city and Illinois is our state. We belong here, love being here, and want to do our best by our hometown. It is our reason for being. The
Chicago Sun-Times is inextricably and permanently tied to this wonderful town, its fortunes becoming our own fortunes. A newspaper has a special bond with a community, and a unique obligation to be of service.
If taxes get too high, it’s our job to say so, for your sake and ours. If taxes must be raised, for that matter, we had better speak up — for your sake and ours. If our schools are inadequate, we must say so.

Keep your hair healthy and youngget ready for ageproof hair

Greying hair is a nightmare for every woman. It happens to all of us at some point in life. Some women start greying in their mid-30s while some do not see their first silver hair until they are in their 50s. The main reason for premature greying is that the hair follicle stops producing melanin, which is hair’s natural pigment.
“Going grey isn’t just about losing your hair’s natural colour — what makes it worse is the change in texture that usually takes place once premature greying starts,” says Aakriti Kochar, beauty expert, Oriflame India. Hair starts turning quite coarse and is not easy to manage.
With ageing, the rate of hair growth slows down, while some hair follicles stop producing new hair completely. So, when a hair falls out naturally, it may not be replaced. This kind of hair-ageing can catch women off-guard and its fixes aren’t quick. Caring for your hair and scalp now is the only way out of this eventuality.
Tips to keep your hair at its best, no matter what your age
Keep stress at bay
Stress spikes adrenaline production, which can convert into androgens and cause extra hair to fall out. So, take some time out of your busy schedule to do what makes you feel good — whether it’s yoga, meditation or something as simple as a bubble bath.
Lock in moisture
When it comes to your hair, remember, ‘moisture is the key’. Says dermatologist Swati Srivastava, VLCC, Mumbai, “Hairstyling treatments completely zap moisture from the mane. Limit hairstyling to special occasions. If you tend to use a hair dryer every day, switch to a no-heat setting. Avoid excess brushing and hair washing.
Pack in protein
When shopping for hair products, opt for the protein-based ones; they reinforce the hair shaft, and help it remain strong enough to fight breakage. Foods like tofu, lean meat and eggs are also great sources of edible protein.
Treat your scalp
Whether it is oily or dry, your scalp needs a relaxing treatment. Take some almond oil and massage it into your scalp. Dip a towel in hot water and wrap it around your head for about 20 minutes.

5 companies face greater expectations5 companies face greater expectations

It’s still early in the third quarter earnings season, but savvy investors are already looking forward to the fourth.
There are five companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500, including real-estate investment trust Essex Property Trust (ESS) , Southwest Airlines (LUV) , Alcoa (AA) and computer chipmaker Micron Technology (MU) where analysts have boosted their price targets on fourth-calendar quarter earnings. These are companies where analysts have upped their adjusted earnings-per-share estimates for the fourth quarter by 10% or more over the past 30 days, according to a USA TODAY analysis of data from S&P 500.
Finding companies where analysts are increasingly bullish is important as investors process third-quarter results and find clues about the future. So far, 70 companies in the S&P 500 have reported their third-quarter results, says S&P Capital IQ. Analysts see earnings growing 5.5% in the third quarter — but investors are hoping for more.
And hopes are even higher for the fourth quarter. Investors are already looking to the future, and there, expectations are for a resumption of double-digit earnings growth. Analysts are calling for 10.3% growth in the fourth quarter. That’s actually down from 11.5% growth expected by analysts on July 1, S&P Capital IQ says, but still strong.
Offsetting the declining hopes for the fourth quarter, though, are companies where analysts are upping estimates. Aluminum company Alcoa is one of the first companies analysts bumped up their estimates for. Analysts have increased their estimate for the company’s earnings in the fourth quarter by 31% to 23 cents a share over the past 30 days. It’s easy to see why. The company blew away third-quarter estimates by 41% when it reported in early October.
Another example is computer chipmaker Micron Technology. Analysts have boosted their profit target for the company’s upcoming quarter ended in November by 10% to 91 cents a share. There’s a belief that pricing for computer memory chips remains strong globally.
But while analysts are ramping up their expectations for these companies, that doesn’t necessarily mean their stocks are winners for investors, yet. Shares of these five stocks are down by 6.8% on average over the past 30 days. That’s slightly worse than the S&P 500’s 5.7% decline during the same period.
But maybe analysts’ great expectations might mean greater things for the stocks ahead if more investors start to agree?

Three Big Expenses You ll Save on this FallThree big expenses you'll save on this fall

The recent volatility in the financial markets have left many Americans feeling jittery.The Dow and S&P indexes suffered some of their worst losses of the year last week, and a shocking price move in the bond market sent the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield below 2 percent, the lowest level in over a year. U.S. oil prices also dropped below $80 a barrel, a two-year low.
But there is some good news. The significant decline in energy prices and bond yields could actually prove to be a silver lining for many Americans, helping to cut mortgage, transportation, and heating costs in the coming months.
Plunging mortgage rates
Falling Treasury yields pushed mortgage rates this week to lows not seen in over a year. The rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage fell below the psychologically significant 4-percent level. "Lower mortgage rates will benefit both homebuyers as well as anyone who bought a home in the past few years who can now look at refinancing," said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.
For example, on a $250,000 loan, McBride said a drop in the rate on a 30-year mortgage from 4.25 percent to 4 percent would reduce a borrower's monthly payment from $1,229 to $1,193, resulting in a savings of $36 a month. That may not seem like much, but it adds up to $432 in savings over 12 months. A more dramatic decline in 30-year mortgage rates to 3.75 percent would bring that monthly payment down to $1,157 a month, resulting in monthly savings of $72 and nearly $900 over one year.
Less pain at the pump
Gasoline prices have plunged by more than 50 cents per gallon on average since the end of June. Pump prices are falling at the fastest rate in two years and are likely to continue to drop as long as oil prices decline. One-third of all U.S. gas stations are selling gas for less than $3.00 per gallon, according to AAA.
Most drivers are already spending about $5 to $15 less to fill up their gas tank than they were around the Fourth of July. Many families fill up the car four times a month, which means they could be saving $20 to $60 a month on gas depending on the type of car they drive. If your family has two cars that you fill up four times each, that would be a savings of $40 to $120 a month -- a significant savings ahead of the  holiday season .
Lower heating prices
A drop in energy costs is good news for consumers as the temperatures fall. Most households may only see $20 to $30 in savings on their heating bills this season compared to last winter, but some customers could see a nearly  $800 drop in their overall heating costs, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
More than a third of U.S. households use natural gas to heat their homes and the price of that fuel is likely to be higher than last winter (electricity prices, which follow natural gas, are on the rise too), but the forecast for milder temperatures should mean overall consumption for the heating season--and your bill--will be lower than last year. If you're in the Northeast and use heating oil or propane to heat your home, you could see a 15-percent drop in your winter heating bill versus last winter. Propane users in the Midwest may pay the most in the country to heat their homes, but with the drop in propane prices, the overall cost will be about 30 percent less than last year, according to the EIA.

Mohammedan Sporting goes bankrupt  to shut downMohammedan Sporting goes bankrupt, to shut down
By Yahoo! India News
Print
One of India's oldest football club - Mohammedan Sporting - has decided to disband its team amidst a major financial crisis. The decision was taken during a working committee meeting on Saturday.
Founded in 1891, the Kolkata-based club had failed to pay salaries to its players and coaching staff for the last three months.
24 Ghanta, a Bengali news channel, reported that the club's head coach Fuja Tope couldn't even leave the country to meet his ill mother due to non-payment of his salary, which turned out to be his final straw at the club.
Mohammedan Sporting created history to become first Indian football club to win the Calcutta Football League continuously for 5 years from 1934 to 1938. It was also the first Indian team to break the monopoly of the British football teams in the Durand Cup when they became champions in the year 1941.
The club was currently playing in the I-League and premier division of CFL.

Valparai: Of waterfalls and wildernessShare 0
Yahoo Lifestyle/Yahoo India Travel/ Ramya Sriram - Athirappilly Falls stages a rainbow
We kept our eyes peeled for leeches on the ground as we made our way to the waterfall. The stone steps, flanked by ferns, glistened with rain. We were visiting Athirappilly waterfalls in Kerala, which provided a grand beginning to our 80-km journey to Valparai in Tamil Nadu. We had chosen to take the famously scenic route through the thick Vazhachal forest in the Western Ghats.
The path to the waterfall was lined at frequent intervals with notice boards that reminded us that the forest and its resources were precious and vulnerable. Baby monkeys used the boards to perform gymnastics, while older ones looked unblinkingly at passers-by, possibly in hope of being fed.
The Athirappilly Falls in full flow
The 80-foot waterfall is formed by the Chalakudy River, which seemed surprisingly tame, but cascaded over the edge of the mountain furiously into a turqoise pool below. The pool was surrounded by what looked like impenetrable deep green forest. To my delight, a lovely rainbow played towards the bottom of the waterfall, with the foam blurring its colours slightly.
A small signboard pointed the way to the bottom of the waterfall - Way to Full View. The steps were ignored in some places, where visitors preferred to take the steeper and muddy “short-cut”. We reached the bottom of the waterfall, and the little girl in front of me squealed, “Wow!” I echoed her. We were looking up at enormous columns of water that crashed on the rocks below dramatically, birthing a spray of cool water over us. I remembered a TV ad I’d once seen that likened streams and waterfalls to the veins of mother earth, with blood surging through them. I understood the analogy then!
Curtains of water at Athirappilly Falls
I noticed that the way was completely clean and free of plastic, despite the numerous tourists there. A group of men sang a lilting Malalayam folk song as they descended the path, their voices mingling with the trill of cicadas.
Our next stop was at the Vazhachal waterfall, which ran over a gentler slope as compared to Athirappilly but was twice as loud. From a distance, it sounded like TV static noise, getting louder as we moved closer; then it was deafening. The Vazhachal forest is home to all the four species of hornbills (I didn’t spot any though). The route through the forest was quiet and deserted, except for the gurgling of the Chalakudy River, which travelled with us alongside. The forest was freshly washed by rain and everything from the ground to the treetops seemed to scream with life.
Vazhachal Falls - less spectacular than Athirappilly but louder
As we approached Malakkapara, a mist descended on us, an almost-opaque white screen that I’ve seen so often in the Ghats. It cleared within minutes, like a curtain raiser for the next scene – a completely different landscape of tea gardens caressing the clouds. I always look at tea plantations with a mixture of delight (how pretty they look!) and sadness (if unpruned, the tea "shrub" grows into a magnificent tree) and guilt (I'm a tea-lover). On the way, we encountered the Upper Sholayar Dam, the second deepest in Asia, which provides water and electricity to neighbouring areas.
Our destination, Sinna Dorai’s bungalow, situated in Upper Paralai tea estate of Parry Agro, took some time to locate. Two charming women welcomed us with a drink that was sweet and fresh – iced tea. I noticed wooden benches outside the cottages where I could already picture my mother meditating early in the morning. It was so quiet that any conversation seemed disturbing and out of place.

The rooms were done up in teak, cane and jute, maintaining a tone of natural warmth. Food was hot and steaming – dal, roti, rice, sambar and rasam, all home-cooked – and served by smiling staff. The coconut soufflé was a perfect end to the meal, and was followed by an hour of me battling existential questions – what was I doing living in a crowded, polluted city? I vowed, like every time I visit the Western Ghats, that I would move out and settle down in the hills.
In the evening, Murugan, our local guide, took us for a short walk around the Parry Agro estate on the road, which he said was “shared by elephants and bison”. Visitors are usually not allowed to roam around on their own “for their own safety as well as for safety of the animals.” I suspected the animals possibly needed more protection from humans than vice versa. As we walk, we hear bird calls – a magpie robin, Murugan tells us, the crooning of a spotted dove, and a loud, clear call of a peacock, which was so close that I jumped. It stood silhouetted against the twilight sky, before it spread its brown wings and swooped over the valley and disappeared into a tree. “Did you know peacocks could fly that far?” my mum asked in a hushed whisper. Murugan, amused by our wonder, said, “Wait till you hear the Malabar Whistling Thrush hold katcheris in the mornings.”
A walk through Upper Paralai Estate
The Upper Paralai Estate is about 225 hectares in area and is exclusively dedicated to growing organic tea: “No chemicals, only neem cake and vermi-compost.” Silver oak trees, which help bind the soil, are planted in between the tea. “It is a light tree and falls easily,” Murugan said, upon which we backed away from the tree a little. “But it acts as good manure.” The tea is sold in five flavours - strawberry, peach, black currant, lemon mint and green apple. The 700 workers there are all provided with accommodation within the estate. Most of them send their children to the local school and college. Some of the other estates in Valparai belong to Tata, PKT, Jayashree Industries, NEPC and Woodbriar. Murugan stopped to pluck a fern leaf. He stamped it on his hand and sheepishly told us that it leaves a silver-white “tattoo” on the skin.
 
The bungalow boasts of a quaint library, well stocked with books, two Murphy radio sets and an ancient typewriter. An enormous log register from 1952 sits on the table, which has the names of the tea estate workers, the amount of work done per day and the corresponding pay. A cosy sitting room, complete with fireplace, includes a record player. The decor and serveware is exquisite – if you like a piece, you could request them to source it for you. Murugan tells us that the bungalow got its name from the local salutation for ‘Assistant Manager’. Back in the room, I read a letter from the current Sinnai Dorai himself, who made it quite clear that we behave ourselves, respect the environment, and not try any funny business with the animals.

A plethora of bright-eyed birds awaited us the next morning outside the cottage. It is always special to see dawn rise over the hills, gently prodding to life all things big and small. Shortly after, a siren sounded – the signal for the first batch of workers to begin their tasks for the day. Murugan appeared and ushered me down the slope into the tea gardens. Among the green, brown blobs moved heavily about. Gaur! We watched in silence as the gaur grazed on the grass among the tea (“No animal likes tea,” Murugan said. “Only we do.”)
We climbed up the steep slope to our cottage again, when he turned around suddenly and wildly gestured to me with a finger on his lips. He quietly parted the leaves of a bush and – OMG! I found myself staring straight at a leopard. Thankfully, it was a good distance away, but surely it was making eye contact with me? I was too nervous to move or reach for the camera. The staring match continued – I couldn’t tell who was more startled. Throughout, Murugan asked me to stay completely quiet and still. The leopard, bored of these seemingly inanimate creatures, turned around and bounded off into the trees. I was shivering with excitement – this was my first big cat sighting in the wild!
Over breakfast, the staff told us that wild animal sightings are extremely common in the area. Encounters are an everyday affair. “Elephants are fine as long as you get out of their path,” we are told. “If you confront it or poke a camera in its face, it may attack.” Though both tigers and leopards are found in the area, leopard attacks are more common. After a pause, Murugan added, “We are trespassing on their property, you know.”
Our cottage at Sinna Durai's Bungalow
Sinna Dorai’s bungalow, like most mountain getaways, offers tranquility and a chance to bond with nature. But more than that, it offers a way of living. I was impressed by the way its inhabitants and tea estate workers co-existed with the wilderness around them. It looked like a value system was firmly in place, respected and obeyed. For those who can adjust to being treated at par with their wild fellow-creatures and can appreciate and follow the code of conduct, this is the place. Just twenty-four hours in Valparai made me feel like I was moulting, shedding off a layer of the old and growing new skin. With its commitment to responsible travel, cool air and homely warmth, a visit to this bungalow can be described as nothing short of healing.
