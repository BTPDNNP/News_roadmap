Warren Buffett Defends Controversial Tax Planreddit
Warren Buffett defended Burger King's plan to expatriate to Canada in an appearance on CNBC's Squawk Box Thursday morning, saying that the deal isn't a move to skirt taxes.
"I would tell you that overwhelmingly most inversion deals have had a huge tax motivation in doing them. I can tell you this one didn't," the billionaire Berkshire Hathaway CEO responded when host Andrew Ross Sorkin asked if the deal was unpatriotic.
In August, Burger King announced plans to acquire the Canadian coffee and donut chain Tim Hortons for about $11 billion, moving the struggling fast-food company's headquarters from Miami to Toronto. The deal, which would create a combined company with projected sales of $23 billion , has been under scrutiny by critics who accuse Burger King of trying to dodge paying U.S. taxes.
"It doesn't have anything to do with taxes. It has to do with the fact that Tim Hortons earns twice as much money as Burger King does," Buffett said.
Though Burger King did not respond immediately to a request for comment, the company has maintained in the past that the deal isn't about dodging taxes.
In September, the  U.S. Treasury Department announced new rules that would make so-called inversion deals more difficult, but it's unclear if the new rules will have much of an impact on Burger King.

How Running a Long Distance Race Is Like Building a Businessreddit
On September 28, I set out to complete a 10-mile run in the Bronx. I had known about this race, and had signed up for it a couple of months in advance. Yet, somehow, I hadn't trained properly. I just couldn't seem to "get into the grove" when going out for my 5-6 mile training runs. I would start out strong, then get winded, then end up walking more of the training run, than actually running it. Alas, race day was here, and I was determined to complete it. I wasn't concerned with my race time, just crossing the finish line.
My morning started at 5:15A when my alarm clock went off. I rolled around in bed a few minutes, checking Facebook and Twitter, and my email. Then, I climbed over the edge of my mattress, planted my feet firmly on the floor, and stretched my arms to the ceiling. I have been experiencing very tight muscles running along the sides of my back, so I did some side bends to try and loosen every thing from my deep sleep.
My cat, Shakti, greeted me in the hallway, with a small squeaky meow, and I picked him up and snuggled him while walking to the bathroom. After brushing my teeth, I made coffee, like I do everyday. I began gathering the additional items I needed and put them in the race bag I had backed the night prior. Specifically, I added my phone so I had my music, my headphones, and my stopwatch. Even though I don't race for time, I do keep up with how long I need to walk, between the running spurts, so I can encourage myself to pick up the pace.
I sat down with my coffee and wrote in my journal, a daily practice that keeps me focused and grateful for all the good things happening in my life. I decided on two pieces of toast with peanut butter, and grabbed an apple for the 30-minute drive into the Bronx. I also took a banana, and would run with it in my right hand, until mile 4, where I would then refuel.
Standing in the race corral, with 14,000 other runners, the adrenaline started kicking in. I was eager to get started. I heard the national anthem over the loud speakers, and I knew we were getting ready to begin. The buzz of all my fellow runners and the excitement in the air was contagious. The race horn blew, and we were off!
Before I continue with this story, let's get back to the lesson: How Running a Long Distance Race is Like Building a Business.
1. Building a business requires a positive mindset, and so does distance running. Do you know how many times in my business, I have had to give myself a pep talk? There are days that are just terrible -- people that said they were going to sign contracts, don't, and the income falls short for the month. Running a long distance race also requires serious pep talks, especially when one hasn't trained properly.
2. Building a business requires completing daily mundane tasks, and so does distance running. The amount of email I need to answer in any one day is out of control, but it must get done, so that my business can move forward. I need to blog, I need to send out newsletters, I need to continue building online connections. Are there days I don't feel like it? You bet! But, just as with running, daily trainings and workouts, taking extra time to stretch problem muscles, and eating wholesome, nutritious foods (when I really would rather have mac and cheese and pie!) requires discipline and routine.
Miles 1, 2, and 3 were relatively easy, despite the hills. The sun was low on the horizon, the fall season making its presence known. Michael Jackson and Whitney Houston were pumping good vibes into my ears, and my body was getting more loose as it warmed up to the task at hand. At mile 3.5, I slowed my pace to a walk, turned off my music, and cheered for the elite runners who were zipping past me on the other side of the course, ready to finish the 10-mile race in less than 50 minutes. It felt good to cheer them on, as it took my mind off of my immediate woes.
By mile 4, my mind started wandering. I began to wonder why in the world I had picked a hilly course. I ate my banana and gulped some water. At mile 5, the temperate was close to 80 degrees with the sun strong and warm on my body. I felt a blister forming on my left pinky toe, and another on my right.
3. Building a business requires that you gracefully navigate the unexpected. One day my computer decided to quit working, and I had website copy that was due out that afternoon. I could have screamed and yelled, but instead, I called my client and explained the issue. Another day in the past week, I was too exhausted to even attempt to write anything coherently, so I took the day off and slept. When running this race, I hadn't expected such a hilly course, nor did I ever think it would be 80 degrees at the end of September in New York City! But, I did the best I could with the conditions that I had been given.
4. Building a business is much more fun when you cheer others on along the way! It is so fulfilling to see what my colleagues are doing, to be involved in their goals, and to support them as they realize their dreams. When I saw those runners coming toward me, knowing that they were almost ready to finish their race (and I had only hit the 3.5 mile mark!), I cheered like a mad woman. Cheering them on gave me strength and inspiration to keep going, putting one foot in front of the other.
By miles 6 and 7, I was hot, sweaty, and so grateful when someone had popped open a fire hydrant along the course and was hosing us down as we passed the 7 mile marker. I didn't care at that point if I had to run in wet shoes for the final 3 miles, because the cool water hitting my skin felt luxurious!
I walked most of mile 8, relieving a cramp in my calf. If I stopped to stretch, the cramp got worse, and if I ran, the calf almost completely locked up. So, I decided to walk, so I could continue making progress, grooving to some upbeat music along the way.
At mile marker 9, I grabbed some Gatorade, took a final stretch break, and gave myself a pep talk, that most likely went something like this: "You've completed 9 miles Shannon, there's only 1 more to go. Let's do this!" And with that, I set off at a steady pace and focused on the finish line. I sang aloud, I gave high-fives to friends and family waiting on their loved ones to run by, and I reminded myself of all the things I loved about running.
5. Building a business requires that you remain grateful -- remembering the little things that are so important. I am so grateful to be able to work from home, and stay in pajamas all day, if that's what I want to do. I am so grateful that I don't have to set an alarm clock each morning, travel via mass transit to a job, and join in the rat race of the working public. And during this run, I was never so happy to see water spurting into the air!
6. Building a business requires you to slow your pace and walk when needed. You can't just speed through things at lightening pace, and expect to do good work. You need to be able to think, have time to be creative, and rest when you need it. Being successful in business means that you get support from others, just as I did when reaching out for high-fives along the last mile stretch. And with both running and business ownership, you must remember why you started out on the journey in the first place!
As I crossed the finish line, the tears welled up in my eyes. It seems to happen in almost every long race I run, and I've learned to embrace that emotion and let it flow, rather than hold it back and hide it. I stopped my watch, but didn't note the time. I received my Bronx 10 Mile Race medal with a smile, tears still on my cheeks, and grabbed a bagel and a bottle of water.
7. Building a business most definitely requires that you celebrate your achievements along the way. Take time to look at how far you have come and how much you have grown. How you decide to tackle tasks, mentally and physically each day, is your daily training.
Build your business with gusto and embrace all aspects of it, objectively. Get help when needed. Celebrate the small stuff. Be authentic and be you. I'll see you at the finish line!

We re Spending A Lot More On Snacks And A Lot Less On Actual Foodreddit
We're becoming a nation of snackers.
Americans are spending much more on snacks like protein bars, chips and beef jerky, while overall grocery spending has remained almost flat, according to data provided by Nielsen to The Huffington Post. Worldwide, snack sales rose 2 percent to $374 billion for the year ending in March.
The chart below, based on Nielsen data, shows how sales of snacks grew much faster in the U.S. than grocery spending overall during the year ended Sept. 6, 2014.
Why Are We Buying So Many Snacks?
When asked why they're snacking so much, most of the 490 Americans Nielsen polled said they "enjoyed" eating all the time. Because, of course. After enjoyment, the second most common reason Americans cite for eating a snack in the past 30 days is "to satisfy hunger in between meals," Nielsen found.
Of course, the reasons we're snacking all the time go much deeper than "hunger" and "fun":
1. We work a lot: Full-time employees actually work 47 hours a week on average, according to a recent Gallup survey. And millions of workers are juggling multiple jobs .
And family life has gotten more hectic. Over the past few decades, the number of households with two working parents has grown , making June Cleaver-style meals more of a rarity . In addition, kids these days are more likely to grab a Go-Gurt, while racing between swim practices, violin lessons and debate team prep than to sit down for dinner.
2. Big Food brainwashed you (a little) with delicious jerkies and salted chips: Food giants want us to eat processed foods -- the companies can charge more for potato chips than for potatoes. Big Food obsesses over creating super-addictive snack items in the battle for "stomach share," so there are tons of snacks for you to choose from at the store. For example, more than a dozen varieties of Doritos are available.
A comprehensive list of Doritos flavors, according to the Frito-Lay website.
Our need to snack has even changed the way we view certain foods, said James Russo, a senior vice president of consumer insights at Nielsen. Take breakfast cereal. Instead of eating it just for breakfast, we now see items like Kix as more of a snack food. While sales of breakfast cereal are declining overall, an increasing number of us are eating Cheerios throughout the day. Forty-four percent of Americans said they ate cereal outside a meal in the past 30 days, compared to just 19 percent who said they ate a nutrition bar during that time period, according to Nielsen.
"One of the big stories here is the blurring of what is a snack and what is a meal," Russo said.
And the number of snacks we eat at mealtimes is expected to grow by 5 percent over the next five years. That means that in 2018, Americans will be eating snacks as meals 86.4 billion times a year, according to the NPD Group , a market research firm.
NPD predicts most of that growth will come from healthier snacks, but that doesn't mean we're over chocolate and chips. Instead, because we're snacking constantly, we want snacks to be available in both decadent and healthy forms. Pepsi's recent patent for a granola bar with Pop Rocks is one food that combines these desires, but for the most part we're looking to eat carrots and hummus around lunchtime and then grab some candy a few hours later.
Russo pointed to Americans' contradictory feelings toward salt as an example of this dynamic. While the top snack in North America over the past 30 days was chips or crisps, the third-highest health priority for respondents was low salt/sodium, Nielsen found .
"We want indulgent snacks but we also want healthy options for a snack," Russo said. "We're increasingly using all these different food products to satisfy our hunger."

Nashville Fridays: Songs From My Couch  with Hannah BethelBy Radley Balko October 3 Follow @radleybalko
Hannah Bethel. Image courtesy of Hannah Bethel.
Nashville singer-songwriter Hannah Bethel grew up in Houghton, Mich., in the northern part of the state’s Upper Peninsula. She began singing and playing guitar at age 14 and released her first record at 17. The next year she moved to Nashville, attending Belmont University to study commercial voice. After finding some early success, she dropped out of school to pursue a music career full time. She released her second record in 2010 and, the following year, put out “The Freedom E.P.,” what she calls her first fully realized recording. She then embarked on a grueling tour that has taken her all over the country. Now 25, Bethel has a growing fan base and hosts the biweekly web show “Every Other Thursday.” Her forthcoming album is produced by fellow singer/songwriter and “X Factor” contestant Brennin Hunt. It comes out later this month.
Bethel recently gave a mini-concert at my apartment as part of my “Songs From My Couch” series. Additional guitarist/banjo player by David Myhre. Video by David Johnson. Sound engineering by M. Allen Parker. Couch provided by me, Radley Balko.
When did you decide you wanted to become a musician?
There wasn’t really ever any one moment. I’ve wanted to make music for as long as I can remember. I’ve also always loved entertaining, loved performing for people. I did dance and theater at an early age. I started playing guitar and writing songs at 14. From there, I just started playing everywhere I could — bars, coffeehouses, parties, just about anywhere.
What artists influenced you growing up and got you interested in music?
Definitely Willie Nelson. He’s probably the only male country artist I listened to regularly growing up. I loved Patsy Cline and Reba. And of course the Dixie Chicks and Shania were big when I was a kid. But I also loved classic rock. I’ve always loved ’70s groups like Fleetwood Mac and the Eagles. And of course the Beatles.
I always find it interesting to hear stories about an artist’s first few years in Nashville. Tell me a little bit about yours. What odd jobs did you take? Did those have any influence on your music?
Once I left Belmont, I had to take a few different jobs to support myself. I worked for a holistic wellness center. I managed a huge indoor yard sale. I sold athletic equipment. I worked at a furniture company. I met a lot of good people, but I can’t say it had much effect on my music. It was just a way to make some money.
So what was life like — working those jobs and pursuing a music career at the same time?
It was definitely hard to do both. I was pretty much running on empty all the time. I would get up at 6 a.m. to work at an office until 3 in the afternoon. And then most nights, I was up until at least midnight writing, recording and performing. About two years ago I decided to quit my day job and pursue music full time. I’m sustaining myself by touring. It’s been awesome, it isn’t easy. I do all my own booking. It’s a busy life, but I no longer have the distraction of a day job.
How many shows have you played in the last year?
I don’t have an exact number right now, but at least 200. I’ve played all over the country — Alaska, Arizona, New Mexico — all over the map.
Artists once came to Nashville in search of a record contract. That was the only way to do it. Now there are lots of other ways to grow a following and establish yourself. Sounds like you’re doing okay without the big-label deal.
My ultimate goal is to make music for the rest of my life. Touring the world, making music, meeting people. That’s my main goal. I want to win CMA awards. The whole thing. If that means working with a label, I’m happy to do that. But my strategy right now is that I am an independent artist. So I’m working on my fan base and working to grow as an artist. You can do it on your own today, but it’s a lot of hard work. Not just from me but from people around me. I’m constantly meeting great people and adding them to my team.
 
Do you have an “only in Nashville” story?
Oh my God, I do! It just happened two weeks ago. I was walking my dog on 12 South, and I saw this woman walking toward me. I thought to myself, “Holy s—, that’s Patty Griffin!” So I asked. And sure enough, it was Patty Griffin. She was looking at my dog. He loves people, so he was wagging his tail. She asked if she could pet him. I mean, of course. Patty Griffin was petting my dog.
I started telling her what a big fan I was. I’m sure I sounded ridiculous. I was probably blabbering. I mean, I’ve worked with a lot of great artists and I’ve never freaked out like that. That was just a big freakout moment for me.
Tell me about your new record.
The title is still under wraps. But we’ve been working on it for about a year. It’s been a really difficult record to make, but I’m so proud of it. It’s a very intimate experience for listeners. It also pushes my limits a little more. We use instruments in unconventional ways, create sounds we wouldn’t normally put together. It’s also a good blend of my influences — old country music, ’70s rock, and old school soul and R&B. It should come out this month. We don’t have a release date yet, but check my web site .
A couple more questions that I like to ask everyone who plays for us: First, if you could collaborate with one artist right now, who would it be?
I’d love to work with Willie Nelson or Patty Griffin. They’re two of my very favorites.
Can you recommend some Nashville-based artists people might check out when they’re in town?
Well there’s my very good friend Rachele Lynae . She’s getting radio play all over the country right now. I co-wrote her current single, “Fishin’ for Something.” Also check out the Devious Angels , a great country duo.

India  US working on choking financial support to D-Company35

New Delhi: India and the US are working further on their declaration on how to choke all financial and tactical support to underworld don and terror mastermind Dawood Ibrahim's D-Company.
National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, who stayed back in the US from Prime Minister Narendra Modi's delegation, was tasked to discuss with his American counterpart and other senior Obama Administration officials a strategy to be adopted to implement the Indo-US commitment.
A joint statement, issued after the talks between Modi and US President Barack Obama, said, "The leaders stressed the need for joint and concerted efforts, including the dismantling of safe havens for terrorist and criminal networks, to disrupt all financial and tactical support for networks such as Al Qaeda, Lashkar-e Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammad, the D-Company, and the Haqqanis. "They reiterated their call for Pakistan to bring the perpetrators of the November 2008 terrorist attack in Mumbai to justice."

Doval was also entrusted to talk about US government- approved snooping on various countries including India, a top government official said. Significantly, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj had raised the issue with his American counterpart John Kerry during his visit to India on July 31, saying that snooping on India was "not acceptable".
The government official, who termed Modi's visit as "extremely successful and a game changer", also said that India's decision to grant Visa on Arrival to American citizens which was announced by Modi there was not on "strict reciprocity".
"The decision (to grant VoA) is taken for our own interest. It is to enhance tourism, inflows of visitors. This is not something we are looking for strict reciprocity. We are looking at it in pure self interest," the official said.
The official also talked about the United States' Global Entry Program available to Indian citizens which will enable their easy entry into America.

5 Ways to Drive More Traffic to Your Websitereddit
With new websites being created daily it becomes increasingly important to identify ways to attract more traffic. You could have the most user friendly website packed full of high quality content, but without traffic all of your efforts are for nothing.
Your website is a huge asset for your company. It allows you to promote your service or products to potential customers, while providing them with useful content -- this helps to build trust while establishing your brand as an authority.
Here are five ways to drive more traffic to your website.
1. Establish a Strong Social Media Presence
Every social media platform that your business participates on is another extension of your website. It is important to interact with the social channels that your target audience is going to be active on. For instance, while Pinterest would be an excellent choice for a local bakery or flower shop, a tax accountant isn't going to find the right audience to interact with on that platform. The majority of businesses can benefit by including Facebook, Twitter, and Google+ as their social media base. From there you can identify additional social media platforms to use, including YouTube, LinkedIn, and Pinterest just to name a few.
Share your content across social media and make sure to interact with your audience by responding you questions and acknowledging those that share your content via their social profiles. Engaging with your social audience is a great way to get them interested in your brand, and this will often lead to repeat traffic to your website. You also want to make sure that you make it very easy for your website visitors to share your content by including social share buttons. This is a great way to expose your brand to a larger audience and drive them back to your website.
2. Optimize Your Website Content
Website traffic that originates from an organic search is typically very targeted and of the highest quality. In order to attract organic traffic you need to make sure that your content is properly optimized for the search engines. Factors such as website speed, titles, headings, formatting, publishing frequency, and content quality all come into play. For a detailed breakdown check out this on-page optimization guide .
3. Write Attention Grabbing Titles
When someone comes in contact with your content through an organic search or through social media what is the first thing they see? The title of your content is the first thing they come into contact with. A boring title that doesn't grab their attention will be passed over and you will miss out on traffic to your website. Want some inspiration to help you craft some titles that will result in a high click through rate? Take a look at some of the titles found here on Huffington Post as well as websites like Buzzfeed and Mashable. Think of your titles as the make it or break it deciding factor. A boring title will be skipped over, driving traffic to potential competitors, while a clever title will pull in the organic and social traffic that you are targeting.
4. Pay Per Click Advertising
There are several paid traffic options to drive visitors to your website , including Facebook, AOL sponsored listings, the Yahoo! Bing Network, and of course Google AdWords. The major benefit of PPC is having the ability to scale your traffic. Yes, you are paying for each click, but when done right you are attracting very targeted traffic that is actively seeking for what you are selling. When you discover a winning combination you can increase your advertising spend and really grow your business and revenue. While organic search traffic is nice, pay per click advertising allows you to drive instant traffic.
5. Paid Content Distribution
Paid content distribution is a great way to attract website traffic that might not have come into contact with your brand otherwise. There are several paid content distribution platforms such as Outbrain and Taboola that will place you content on some of the most popular websites. You are charged only when someone clicks over to your website.
Every time someone clicks over to your content it introduces a new potential customer to your brand with an opportunity for a sale as well as social shares. When you put together a plan to drive traffic it is important that you don't put all of your eggs in one basket and diversify your traffic sources. Paid content distribution is just one of many that you should consider.

Greg Orman leads Sen. Pat Roberts by 10 points  poll showsBy Sean Sullivan October 5 Follow @WaPoSean
U.S. Senate candidate Greg Orman, an independent, discusses voting trends with a class at Washburn University in Topeka, Kan., on Sept. 17. (Chris Neal/the Capital Journal via Associated Press)
A poll out Sunday shows Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) trailing independent challenger Greg Orman by 10 points. The survey is the latest sign of trouble for Roberts, who is in a tough fight to keep his job.
The NBC News/Marist poll shows Orman leading Roberts 48 percent to 38 percent among those likeliest to vote. The poll comes days after a Suffolk University/USA Today poll was released showing Orman with a five-point lead over Roberts.
Just 37 percent in the NBC News/Marist poll say they have a positive impression of Roberts, while 47 percent say have a negative impression of the senator. Roberts has been battling attacks all year that he has lost touch with the state. The New York Times reported in February that he pays rent to supporters to stay with them when he is in Kansas. 
Orman has not said which party he would caucus with if the Senate majority comes down to him. Republicans are casting him as a liberal masquerading as a centrist, citing his past affiliation with the Democratic Party.
NBC/Marist polls in two other battleground Senate races were released Sunday. Both show close contests.
In Iowa , Republican state Sen. Joni Ernst leads Rep. Bruce Braley (D) 46 percent to 44 percent, an advantage that is within the poll's margin of error. The two candidates are competing for the seat of retiring Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin.
In North Carolina , Sen. Kay Hagan (D) holds a slight 44 percent to 40 percent lead over state House Speaker Thom Tillis (R).
Sean Sullivan has covered national politics for The Washington Post since 2012.

Its rest time for Dasara elephantsUpdated: October 5, 2014 23:14 IST
It’s rest time for Dasara elephants
R. Krishna Kumar
Karnataka
Abhimanyu, Srirama, Vikrama, Gajendra will prepare for more strenuous activities in the days ahead
Having shored up the Mysore Dasara with their impeccable performance during the Jamboo Savari which concluded on Saturday, a few of the gentle giants from the jungle camp will be on standby for more strenuous tasks in the days ahead.
For, these elephants have a formidable reputation of subduing counterparts who stray into human landscape and driving them back into the wild. They are in much demand by the Forest Department who use them to capture the so-called ‘rogue elephants’. Abhimanyu, Srirama, Vikrama, Gajendra are past-masters who go about their job with composure despite the mayhem surrounding them. When a herd of elephants stayed put at Kolar in June last year, it sent shiver down the spines of the locals and officials who feared another round of conflict. But Abhimanyu and company led the counter attack to drive the wild herd back to the jungle. Later, they were on an overdrive capturing stray elephants on the rampage in Hassan district.
Veterinarian Nagaraj, who is in-charge of the elephants’ welfare during their annual sojourn in Mysore, told The Hindu that Abhimanyu, Srirama, Gajendra and Vikrama are fit to take on such operations and their assistance may be sought in the future as well. “But at present, they have the task of taming the 13 wild elephants that were captured in Hassan district and are in captivity at different camps, including Dubare and Mathigodu,” he said.
Heroic tales
Incidentally, Abhimanyu, Gajendra, Srirama and Arjuna have covered themselves with glory in central India as well after they pulled-off a spectacular victory in what was deemed to be a mission impossible.
A herd of elephants had created havoc in the undivided Madhya Pradesh and scores of people had died in the Surguja region in Chhattisgarh in the mid-1990s. Arjuna was in the prime of his youth and had a penchant to take on challenges.
Along with Abhimanyu, who is known for his no-nonsense approach in carrying out the tasks ordained to him, Arjuna subdued the opponents within a month with help from Gajendra and Srirama. Mission accomplished, the quartet returned triumphantly to the State having scripted glory in the dense jungles of central India. The elephants are being rested at the Mysore palace grounds after 45 days of Dasara duty. Plans are to take them to their respective jungle camps during the week after which some of them will disperse for more strenuous tasks.

The domestic business, which has seen a strong increase in the profit in recent quarters, will see growth on higher auto sales, localisation efforts of original equipment makers and vendor rationalisation.
The trigger, however, remains deleveraging (getting rid of debt).
The company’s debt is ~15,000 crore, translating into a net debt to equity ratio of just under two and net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (Ebitda) of 4.3. The company also has to improve its single-digit return ratios.
While there is an upside to the stock, investors should track the pace of the debt reduction and turnround in international operations, to provide further boost to the financials.

Unemployment rate falls to 6-year lowU.S. stocks rose and yields on U.S. government debt moved up, while the dollar continued a rally that has been in place for weeks.
The employment gains last month were broad-based.
Factories payrolls, which had fallen in August, expanded by 4,000 workers. The retail sector added 35,300 jobs, a big bounce back that the government said reflected an end to employment disruptions at a grocery chain in New England.
Construction and healthcare payrolls also notched solid gains.
There were some downsides, even outside the weakness in wages.
Notably, part of the decline in the unemployment rate was because workers left the labor force. The share of the population with jobs or hunting for one fell to 62.7 percent, its lowest level since 1978.
That rate has declined in recent years as more workers have retired and as people have given up job hunts due to a weak economy.
Still, a measure of unemployment that partially takes into account worker discouragement fell to 11.8 percent, its lowest level since October 2008.
The number of people who held part-time jobs but wanted full-time work declined slightly to 7.1 million, a sign of slow progress that will be eyed closely by Fed officials as they seek to gauge how much slack remains in the labor market.
In a sign the economy's expansion is moderating from the second quarter's torrid pace, a separate report showed growth in the U.S. services sector eased in September.
Most economists see the economy growing at around a 3 percent annual rate in the third quarter, down from the 4.6 percent rate notched in the April-June quarter but still well above the average over the last two years of 2.2 percent.
Recent signs of vigor in the economy, however, may be insufficient for the Fed to initiate an early rate increase.
Over the past 12 months, hourly earnings were up only 2.0 percent, in line with what has been seen over the past few years and a slight deceleration from August.
“It was a good report but I don't think it changes the Fed dynamics,” said Kim Rupert, a managing director at Action Economics in San Francisco. “I still think the first rate hike is maybe mid-year.”
In a third report, the Commerce Department said the U.S. trade gap unexpectedly narrowed in August to its smallest level in seven months on an increase in exports, which led some economists to raise their growth forecasts.

U. of I. nurses OK strike if deal isn t reached soon8
The 1,150 nurses represented by the Illinois Nurses Association had a three-year contract with the hospital system that has been extended twice already. The three-day vote was tallied late Thursday night, with 94 percent, 609 nurses, in favor of a strike. The one-day strike could take place as soon as Oct. 21, the day the current contract expires.
Chris Martin, a spokesman for the association, said “negotiations are not progressing well.”
The two groups remain far apart on issues like staffing, scheduling and wages.
Nurses also have been pushing for a 21.5 percent wage increase over three years, something hospital officials have said would cost the system $20 million. The nurses said the hospital offered them a 1 percent raise per year, which is less than the 1.7 percent annual inflation rate. U. of I. Hospital nurses on average earned $106,000 in 2013, according to the hospital system.
These nurses makes too much money already at $100,000 a year. Time to bring back the Philippine nurses to cut the cost

Coal Block De-allocation: Will Review Petitions SucceedTweet
Published on Sat, Oct 04,2014 | 17:56, Updated at Tue, Oct 07 at 19:16Source : CNBC-TV18 |   Watch Video :
On August 25th the Supreme Court found all coal block allocations made between 1992- 2010 are arbitrary and illegal. On September 24th, in the second part of its decision - the court decided that the consequence of these illegalities is de-allocation or cancellation of all blocks involved. The cancellation is effective March 31st, 2015 - giving the government and government owned Coal India enough time to take over the operation of the blocks. The SC has also imposed a penalty of Rs 295/mt on all coal extracted so far. Quite obviously, the order is a difficult one to swallow for all the affected companies; more so for the 46 entities who have operationalised the mines or are close to doing so. Some of them such as Nalco & Jayaswal Neco are keen to seek a review of the de-allocation. Others such as JSPL want the penalty amount reviewed. Will any of these review petitions find success? To answer those questions CNBC-TV18's Menaka Doshi speaks to well-known constitutional expert PP Rao & Supreme Court Senior Counsel Gopal Jain.
DE-ALLOCATED!
SC cancels allocation of all coal blocks Cancellation will take effect from 31st March, 2015
Government & Coal India need some time to adjust to changed situation
Allottees will also get adequate time to manage their affairs
DE-ALLOCATED!
SC: 24th September, 2014
‘We also accept the submission of the learned Attorney General that the allottees…must pay an amount of Rs. 295/- per metric ton of coal extracted as an additional levy. This compensatory amount is based on the assessment made by the CAG…’
‘The compensatory payment on this basis should be made within a period of three months and in any case on or before 31st December, 2014’
Doshi: Justice Krishna Iyer in 1980 said that unless the first judicial view is manifestly distorted a plea of review is likely asking for the moon. Review petitions very rarely succeed. In this situation, do you think any of the affected parties are likely to find success if they were to file a review petition? On what grounds can they find success?
DE-ALLOCATED!
Review Petition?Justice Krishna Iyer, 1980
‘…a plea of review, unless the first judicial view is manifestly distorted, is like asking for the moon…’
Rao: Unless we see the review petition and the grounds formulated by them, it is difficult to comment about the rate of success. However as a general proposition, review petitions rarely succeed. The reason is this; the grounds of review are very limited. One ground which is commonly invoked is there is some error or mistake apparent on the face of the recorded judgment which has been given. That means there is something which stares you in the eye- that there is something wrong on the face of it.
I find it is very difficult to say that on the face of it, there is something is wrong with the judgment. It is a judgment which I consider as a well-considered judgment. They have gone through the entire record and they came to the conclusion that the procedure followed is arbitrary and there has been no proper rules and principles and this is a matter of largest public property and therefore, the various methods followed by the Screening Committee and also the government dispensation method and administrative dispensation method - all three are found to be wrong. So it seems to be a conscious application of mind to the facts of the case and the findings have been regarded.
It is only when we see the formulations made by the petitioners who want to seek review, then one can reassess the position as to how far these grounds will stand. So far as the question of the amount which is precipitated by the court that they should pay for per metric ton Rs 295 etc- that also the court has said that they don't have accurate data but they are going by the report estimate made by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) and therefore they said that under circumstance we had to make a guess estimate of it and they reasonably came to the conclusion that this is the amount. Probably if they are able to demonstrate that this calculation of Rs 295 is wrong, then maybe the court will be inclined to review that part of it- that is my view.
DE-ALLOCATED! Grounds For Review
In light of new evidence that was not available when the judgment was pronounced
If a mistake occurred on the face of the record
Any other sufficient reason
Doshi: You have raised both grounds on which petitioners are likely to file review. One is against the actual de-allocation itself and some other petitioners such as Jindal Steel and Power Ltd (JSPL) have suggested that they would like to file a review petition against the amount of penalty imposed. I will try and place arguments on both grounds but before that if you were representing any of the affected parties, would you see enough grounds for a review petition to succeed?
Jain: When a review petition is normally filed, the grounds being limited and the court having considered all these aspects, the likelihood is very slim. But having said that, one very important aspect is the larger pubic interest aspect which is that many of these companies having made significant investments and are very close to operationalising the end use as well. And the fact that core sectors like power and steel have a cascading effect on the entire economy and therefore overriding public interest should have been a ground which the court could have considered in moulding the relief.
Doshi: These are arguments made by several of the Senior Counsels representing the affected parties - Mr Venugopal, Harish Salve, Abhishek Manu Singhvi - and these are arguments that the Supreme Court bench did consider and yet decided to de-allocate on mass. So would making these arguments again through a review petition hold any water?
Jain: Let me take a step back- the letter of allocation is the crucial document on which the whole case hinged. Now letters of allocation where issued was like a bankable document on which banks etc lend several thousand crores to various of core sectors. These were implemented and acted upon and eventually the court found that this letter of allocation had no legal value at all. Now, this according to me, could fall within the considerations of an error apparent because this was the very basis which was acted upon by people making investments by end use, industries those developing the block and several times government said to several of the allottees- look if you don't comply with these conditions, we will be forced to de-allocate.
So the substratum of the whole case hinged on the legality and validity of the letter of allocation which in my view was a bankable document and that really goes to the root of the matter. Second point that I was trying to make is the impact and consequences may have been considered, but consideration did not take the larger focus into account and the effect and merely going by the government's assurance that we would be able to handle the situation is like saying if there is a storm or a blast, let it come; we will be good at rehabilitation. The idea is could it have been prevented, could they had offered the right of first refusal saying whatever is the auction determined price or the market price if people were to match it….(Interrupted by Anchor)
Doshi: Why should the SC step into determining or designing, what the re-allocation process should be? That clearly falls within the ambit of the Executive and the SC wouldn’t you say has done the right thing by staying away from trying to design a re-allocation policy? Let me get a view from PP Rao on what he thinks of your suggestion of error apparent being suitable grounds for review petition.
Several of the senior counsels that represented the affected parties did put in big numbers out there in terms of the impact- saying investments to the tune of Rs 4 lakh crore will be impacted, 28,000 megawatt of power capacity will be affected, estimated loss of 4.4 lakh crore in terms of royalty, CESS, direct and indirect taxes, bank loans will be impacted. The SC heard all of this and yet decided to de-allocate the blocks. Would you then agree with Gopal that this might still serve as grounds for review?
DE-ALLOCATED!
Arguments by Allottees
Govt not in position to supply enough coal Issue of poor quality of coal supplied by Coal India
Rs 2.87 lakh cr invested in 157 blocks as of Dec 2012 Approx Rs 4 lakh cr invested in end-use plants
Employment of 10 lakh people at stake
Loans of Rs 2.5 lakh cr will become NPAs
28000 MW of power capacity affected Estimated loss of Rs 4.4 lakh cr in royalty, cess, taxes
Rao: You are absolutely right. The SC has listed out all the possible consequences mentioned by Gopal and other counsels who have appeared in the matter and have applied mind to those consequences and still it came to the conclusion that the process of allocation was arbitrary and cannot be sustained and only in a few cases, they have allowed the allocation to continue - in the case of public sector undertakings which did not have joint venture. The concept of an error apparent needs to be understood clearly. SC in various decisions said you should be able to point it out- should take a few minutes- it is not a question of rearguing the whole matter on the grounds which were already added but not accepted by the court. So that re-hearing is not what is contemplated by review but that kind of an error apparent in the face of the record is difficult to find out in this case. That is what it is.
Doshi: I just want to add to one other argument that several critics of this decision have been making which is whether the SC ignored the principles of natural justice in not granting each individual affected party a hearing when determining the consequences. Now the SC has discussed this in its order and said- look we did listen to the large industry groups and we did listen to the Senior Counsels representing those groups. So in a sense we have heard all the arguments including the arguments of various State Governments. Yet, there are some companies who believe that there are specific circumstances regarding the allocation that must be heard before they are penalised either by way of de-allocation or the monetary penalty. Would you think that grounds of natural justice might be one way a review petition would succeed?
DE-ALLOCATED!
SC: 24th September, 2014
‘The judgment did not deal with any individual case. It dealt only with the process of allotment of coal blocks and found it to be illegal and arbitrary. The process of allotment cannot be reopened collaterally through the appointment of a committee. This would virtually amount to nullifying the judgment’
DE-ALLOCATED!
SC: 24th September, 2014
‘…it is incorrect to say that these associations which represented the bulk (if not all) the allottees or beneficiaries of coal blocks were not heard. They presented their point of view, like any other party to a lis and it was only then that judgment was delivered’
Rao: This aspect was considered by the court and this was also raised before the court that all the individual companies were not issued notices and they did not have the opportunity to present their cases and the court has taken the view that all possible arguments have already been advanced before the court. Therefore in this situation there is also a decision of SC which says if hearing each individual is not going to make any material change, then it is a futile exercise and courts will not resort to futile exercise. The line of decision was also there. So the whole question is if every individual comes and says look here if I have these XYZ points which were not considered by the court then the affected parties could come forward before the court and point out those things if they are going to make any material difference in the ultimate conclusion. But unless there is a concrete case like that, it is merely saying that opportunity is not given which is the aspect which was already considered by the bench is not going to make any difference but broadly the position is this - it is very difficult to say that in the face of it, the judgment is wrong because the judgment has considered all the aspects. A judgment can be right or wrong- two views are possible- the court has taken one view where another view is also possible but that is not a ground for a review.
Doshi: We have discussed many legal technical grounds for review. Let me come to one argument that has been raging with many of the affected parties that I have spoken to and that is how is it our fault and why are we being punished? The allocations were made by the Screening Committee set up by successive governments over a two decade period, companies believe they had grounds for asking for a coal block allocation and that when they got it, they did not sit in judgment of the process through which they got it because they just assumed the government was working to a process that was well laid down. Many of these companies are saying or drawing a distinction between the 2G decision and what has taken place in this decision. In the 2G decision, the SC bench very clearly found malafide;infact it said that this arbitrary action of the Minister of Communications & IT appears to be innocuous but was actually intended to benefit some of the real estate companies who did not have any experience in dealing with telecom services. But this coal decision makes no suggestion of any malafide. So companies are saying if we haven’t done anything wrong, why are we being punished?
DE-ALLOCATED!
SC: 25TH August, 2014
‘the entire allocation of coal block…suffers from the vice of arbitrariness and legal flaws….There was no fair and transparent procedure, all resulting in unfair distribution of the national wealth. Common good and public interest have, thus, suffered heavily. Hence, the allocation of coal blocks based on the recommendations made in all the 36 meetings of the Screening Committee is illegal’
DE-ALLOCATED!
Review Petition?
SC: 2G spectrum/licence cancellation order (2012)
‘this arbitrary action of the Minister of C&IT though appears to be innocuous was actually intended to benefit some of the real estate companies who did not have any experience in dealing with telecom services’
DE-ALLOCATED!
Review Petition?
SC: 2G spectrum/licence cancellation order (2012)
‘this arbitrary action of the Minister of C&IT though appears to be innocuous was actually intended to benefit some of the real estate companies who did not have any experience in dealing with telecom services’
Jain: This is where I think the first issue that you raised of natural justice also becomes important. Apart from the fact that it is a basic feature of the Constitution, the story of each allocate was different and if you are going to visit the punishment, which is de-allocation or cancellation, it would have made sense to hear each person to give their side of the story to say what is it they have done with the block, what is the end use, what is the investment they made etc at that should have been considered.
Secondly, the court could have said alright, even if we felt the procedure was wrong, they could have overruled it prospectively like they did in the arbitration case where they said after the date of the judgment any arbitration agreement, the judgement would apply not prior to that.
Thirdly, yes, it is important in a case like this to say instead of clubbing everybody and painting them with the same brush, it would have been helpful to see those who had used the blocks and those who had put it to an end use with the investment should have been treated differently from those who had not worked the block at all or invested in it. So yes, there is some merit in that version.
Doshi: But will that other view succeed on a review petition?
Jain:  No, I think in a review petition the chance is very slim or unlikely because the court did consider it. So it will be difficult to say it falls within the error apparent test.
Doshi: I am going to bring to you some of the arguments made by some of the affected companies. For instance, the public sector company NALCO says that it will consider filing a review because it too should have been spared just as SAIL and NTPC were and they were spared on grounds of being central government units and that was well within the allocation policy. So NALCO is asking the question as to why it was not spared and that is an important question it hopes to address through the review petition. Then you have a company for instance like Jayaswal Neco who says look, how can you impose a penalty of Rs 295 on us given that that coal that was mined from those blocks has already, through various processes, been sold or consumed and now where are we going to recover that additional money from since this is a matter of several years back. You have got JSPL, which says that that Rs 295 per metric tonne is a figure arrived by the CAG taking into account different kinds of coal mines but we work with a lower grade of coal mine and therefore Rs 295 should not apply to us. Would any of these grounds, especially on the penalty front, may have more success than fighting the full scale de-allocation?
DE-ALLOCATED!
Review Petition?
NALCO
‘Nalco is a PSU. It has not entered into a joint venture with any private company. We have asked our legal experts to examine the apex court verdict….We will request the court to reconsider our case and will explain the reasons for delay in developing the block’
Jayaswal Neco
‘We have produced material, sold it out to consumers and now from where will the money come? We will definitely go for review’
JSPL
‘Rs 295/ mt (penalty) is with reference to coal of premium grade whereas coal that we have produced all along from these mines is of ‘E’ and ‘F’ grade. We certainly are going to make a review petition on that’
Jain: On the first point that you said about NALCO, they are trying to make out a case for parity saying that I am also a public sector and should have been excluded but again whether it falls strictly within the error apparent test - possibly or possibly not - because it was the considered view taken by the court to save these four blocks and not include NALCO. It was a good case to do before the judgment but whether again it is reviewable or not - in my view, it would be difficult.
Second on the penalty aspect - the CAG recommendation was adapted and made as a benchmark or the yardstick but again the penalty has civil and adverse consequence and it should have been a case of hearing the affected parties at that and the court could have considered whether they should have been subjected to this penalty and this amount of penalty. So, both aspects are there. One is the aspect of whether penalty should be imposed and the aspect of the quantum of penalty and the SC itself has said that being a civil measure with adverse consequences, even on a quantum, parties are entitled to be heard. So nobody was heard on the aspect of quantum. It was a figure taken from the CAG recommendation and report and it was imposed across the board.
Doshi: So you think that they might find success, some of these companies if they were to argue through their review petitions for a lower quantum of penalty?
Jain: I think again unlikely because like I said the common threat through the courts judgement is cancel all blocks and impose the penalty across the board. So that is the considered view of the court and therefore it is unlikely that any of these points will warrant any success in a review petition.
Doshi: You have raised the issue of penalty right in your first response. The SC acknowledged in its order that in matters of this nature, it is difficult to arrive at any mathematical acceptable figure quantifying the loss sustained. Do you believe that any of these companies, however justified their grounds are for a lower penalty, will succeed in arguing for a lower penalty through a review petition?
Rao: If they are able to demonstrate by facts and figures that the estimate given by the CAG is obviously wrong, then there maybe a chance but that is a herculeantask and now in retrospect also, in the 2G Spectrum case, the court was guided by CAG’s estimate of loss but which has turned out to be after subsequent auctions etc was a very highly inflated figure. So therefore, CAG also cannot be taken as sacrosanct or absolutely authentic. It is just an estimate. If it is shown, if it is demonstrated to the court in the review petition then the estimate is obviously wrong, then maybe there is a chance the court will consider that aspect. I don’t rule out the possibility but of course it is very unlikely that a review petition will succeed.
Doshi: Given the slim chances that it will succeed, let me add to the odds and that is that several companies might have different take. For instance JSPL says the penalty amount actually refers to coal of grade A, B, C and we are mining coal of Grade E, F. Some other company may have the issue like Jayaswal Neco pointed out saying; look, we have already consumed this coal, where are we going to recover the additional Rs 295 from. A third company may have a third argument for a third amount that should be imposed on them. So in a review petition, will the review bench that listens to this- sans the outgoing CJI - will they be able to say, okay, your argument calls for Rs 290 and somebody else’s argument calls for Rs 250 and a third party’s argument calls for Rs 150 and hence allocate different penalties based on different review petition arguments?
Rao: Well that will be very difficult, it is very unlikely.
Doshi: So how will they go about it?
Rao: The fact that the outgoing Chief Justice has already retired means only this much that another judge will be added to the bench that now is in place.
Doshi: That is fine but it could very well be that the review bench will have to listen to 40 arguments because there are 40 operational mines and therefore 40 entities that will dispute the penalty amount. Are they going to be able to do that- is that realistic, is that what takes place in a review and therefore would you say that there are zero chances for a review of the penalty amount?
Rao: If at all the bench is impressed with any of the facts and figures given by them to disputing the amount of Rs 295 prima facie they may have a limited hearing to clarify the position further and may issue some further directions by way of clarifications but that is all one can expect at the most but not that it will happen but generally as I said it is very difficult to make out a case to show that this estimate is wrong because this was an estimate given by the CAG, it was on record before the court, everybody knew what it was.
Doshi: The government endorsed this figure as well because the Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi in fact in his submission to the court said that the court must apply a penalty of Rs 295; retrospectively at that. Should I then take away from this conversation that the chances of any review succeeding - whether on grounds of de-allocation or the penalty itself- are absolutely zero?
DE-ALLOCATED!
SC: 24th September, 2014
‘…we also accept the submission of the learned Attorney General that the allottees…must pay an amount of Rs. 295/- per metric ton of coal extracted as an additional levy. This compensatory amount is based on the assessment made by the CAG. It may well be that the cost of extraction of coal from an underground mine has not been taken into consideration by the CAG, but in matters of this nature it is difficult to arrive at any mathematically acceptable figure quantifying the loss sustained. The estimated loss of Rs. 295/- per metric ton of coal is, therefore, accepted for the purposes of these cases’
Jain: Yes, it is very slim; the chances of a review succeeding in a case like this because as we have just discussed all these arguments were made and rightly or wrongly the court rejected them and said the block should be de-allocated and a penalty should be put.
Doshi: In all of this, the ministers and the bureaucrats which for over two decades occupied the Screening Committee, assisted the Screening Committee and allowed for this processless allocation to take place or this arbitrary series of allocations to take place have escaped unaffected and instead it is the companies who have very well applied in good faith who are now going to bear not just some brunt of this order but the full brunt of this order retrospectively. What would you say about the justice that this order has delivered?
Jain: You have raised a very important point of accountability of those who took decisions. If they had taken decisions which were arbitrary or wrong, then squarely the blame/punishment/liability should have been on them. As you said, this has basically clubbed all the allottees together and given, if I may use the word, like a mass punishment and if you remember years ago when petrol pumps had been cancelled, the Supreme Court itself reversed it and said, no, you can’t have an mass block cancellations; you should hear each case and then decide.
So in a sense those who took these decisions have at the moment gotten away scot free and that doesn’t send the right signal because they should be held accountable for their decisions and it should not be that only the allocates themselves were to blame, because the procedure and the policy was framed by the government and they were beneficiaries of that but they certainly were not the authors or the architects of that.
Rao: The persons who had taken part in the process of processing these applications or in helping these allocations, they were not individually made parties before the court. There is no relief sought against them individually. We have only focused on the legality of the allocations and that the court has decided. If individuals had to be proceeded against and they were to be punished, then they have to have been made parties to the court and proper allegations should have been made against them and they should have an opportunity to reply to them and only then the court could have taken action against them. In this proceeding - which has been decided now by the court - that issue could not have been gone into within the parameters of law.

Protests over RSS chiefs DD telecast; Congress demands Javadekars resignationPress Trust of India | New Delhi/chennai | Posted: October 5, 2014 7:56 pm
Scores of Congress workers and leaders today held a protest here demanding immediate resignation of Union Minister Prakash Javadekar accusing him of forcing Doordarshan to go for live telecast of RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat’s speech from Nagpur two days ago.
The Delhi Congress workers led by its chief Arvinder Singh Lovely were detained outside the DPCC office in central Delhi when they tried to carry out a procession towards Doordarshan office at Mandi House.
“The government has been influencing Doordarsan to propagate RSS’ agenda of saffronisation. The Congress party will not tolerate this and we demand resignation of I&B Minister Prakash Javadekar,” Lovely said addressing the protesters.
Mounting a direct attack on the BJP, he said the whole country knows that the RSS is an organisation which has always got enmeshed in controversies in its bid to spread communalism.
He said the direct telecast of the speech by RSS chief Mohan Bhagat has hurt the sentiments of people who strongly uphold the principles of secularism.
The live telecast of Bhagwat’s address in Nagpur on October 3 by Doordarshan stoked a controversy with almost all major opposition parties accusing the government of “misusing” the state broadcaster while BJP defended it.
Lovely also demanded that Prime Minister Narendra Modi apologise to the people of the country on this matter. He said such an “unconstitutional incident had happened in the country for the first time, which would not be tolerated by the Congress Party at any cost.”
Chief spokesperson of Delhi Congress Mukesh Sharma said RSS was a controversial religious and political organisation and showing Bhagwat’s address live on Doordarshan was not at all acceptable.
“Congress will not allow the government to be run from Nagpur,” he said. The protesters also burnt an effigy.
Dismissing criticism over the issue, Javadekar had said that Prasar Bharati, which controls Doordarshan, takes its own decisions. He maintained that it was a “newsworthy” event covered by private channels too.
Lovely also questioned the silence of Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal on this issue and alleged that he appeared to be in full agreement with the BJP on the matter.
Meanwhile Over 500 persons, including women and children, belonging to Tamil Nadu Thowheed Jamat, today protested in front of the Doordarshan office in Chennai and shouted slogans against BJP for using the channel as a platform to telecast live RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat’s speech.
“Doordarshan is part of the government machinery and it cannot be used for promoting any party’s ideology.
Doordarshan has a legacy of being neutral and now they have lost that,” Mohammad Yusuf of Tamil Nadu Thowheed Jamat told reporters.
The protesters held placards and also raised slogans against BJP continued…

Ebola in America: Nothing to fear but fear itselfJust consider how the New York tabloids covered a potential Ebola case in the city two months ago.
Ebola scare in the city: http://t.co/BU8srB5koR What you need to know about the Ebola virus: http://t.co/kxYs44FxHn pic.twitter.com/muEPntrMX6
— New York Daily News (@NYDailyNews) August 5, 2014
Fear of Ebola eclipses other health crises around the world, including diarrhea, a preventable and treatable condition that still kills 1.5 million children each year.
When Dr. Oz called Ebola "the biggest medical crisis our country, and the world is facing," he couldn't possibly have been referring to the number of cases, deaths, or the infrastructure needed to fight it . There are other ailments that are bigger in all of those senses. But we fear few of them like we fear Ebola.
That fear has a familiar narrative, one that plays out like a movie. "There's a fascination with the drama of the disease," said Priscilla Wald, author of " Contagious : Cultures, Carriers, and the Outbreak Narrative" and a professor at Duke University. "Why are we so afraid of something like Ebola? You hear about liquefying organs. There's the bleeding from the eyes."
Ebola is a scary way to die, to be sure. But there are other dramatic ways to meet one's end. And yet, we don't talk about car crashes like a contagion, nor do we apply the same focus to other, more common killers, such as influenza or pneumonia. "We're not scared of hearing that someone's lungs fill up with fluid," Wald said. "That's not scary. It's just deadly."

In a sense, Ebola has captured our collective fear because it, like epidemic movies, relies on a fictional burst of imagination. Ebola is an ingredient in an outbreak story we're already primed to tell, in zombie stories and films such as "Contagion."
When applied to a real epidemic, Wald said, the speculative outbreak narrative sidelines a necessary discussion about the underlying causes of the actual outbreak. "We are not talking about global poverty," she said.
The reason Ebola — a disease that has a relatively low transmission rate — has spread so dramatically and quickly through Liberia, Sierria Leone and Guinea has little to do with the characteristics of the virus. Now, as before the outbreak, "people are malnourished, with ill shelter, and most importantly, no access to adequate healthcare," Wald said.
In the West African regions at the center of the epidemic, the spread of Ebola has been nothing short of disastrous. On top of the 3,400 people in the region who have died from the disease, Ebola's spread has crippled the already fragile health-care systems of the hardest-hit countries. In Liberia, people are dying of treatable, preventable illnesses , because the health system there is so overwhelmed by Ebola.
In other words, one could view Ebola as a real doomsday for the Liberian capital of Monrovia, one of the worst-hit cities in the Ebola epidemic. In Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, the virus has spread at an unprecedented rate, and the death toll has long since surpassed all previous Ebola outbreaks combined . It is going to take a significant international effort to help contain Ebola in West Africa under these conditions.
The United States should be a different story, with Ebola easier to contain. But the mere potential of an outbreak here is exactly what many Americans are imagining.
Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the agency is trying to contain the spread of Ebola in West Africa stressing that "an outbreak anywhere is potentially a threat everywhere." He added that the CDC is now looking into the issue of entry screening at the airports. (Centers for Disease Control)
Even before the first U.S. Ebola case, four in 10 adults were concerned about the possibility of a large-scale outbreak of the disease in America, according to a Harvard poll conducted in August . The concern is probably fueled in part by a widespread lack of knowledge about Ebola: Nearly 70 percent of Americans incorrectly believe the virus spreads "easily," and a third of Americans believe (incorrectly) that there is an effective treatment for Ebola. Twenty-six percent of Americans are concerned that they or one of their loved ones will get Ebola within the next year.
Ryan Hall, a psychiatrist who has written about the 1995 Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo, said that the "long-term maintenance" following an acute crisis like the U.S. Ebola case can be more severe than the initial panic, with people who believe a case of the sniffles could be Ebola flooding hospitals or, he said, something like a "spike in heart attacks at home" because no one wants to go to the hospital because they think they'll be at risk of Ebola infection there.
"This is going to eat at people for 20 to 30 days until we see if there's a new case," Hall said, referring to the length of time it can take for Ebola to become symptomatic. (Generally, symptoms appear within 21 days of exposure.) If there is a second case, Hall said, the anxiety period will be extended: "That 20 to 30 days is going to restart."
Humans have a long history of overreacting like this, often to threats that turn out to be false. When the brain comes into contact with a perceived threat, there are generally one of three outcomes. If the threat is real, and the individual reacts to the threat properly, it's called a "hit." "If it is a genuine fear and I don't act, it's a miss. If I act and it's not, it's a false alarm," said Shmuel Lissek, founder of the ANGST Lab at the University of Minnesota, where he studies the human brain's responses to fear.
As it turns out, our brains may have evolved to avoid "misses." In early human history, Lissek said, "the cost of a miss ... of not taking it seriously, could potentially be lethal." But the cost of a false alarm is much lower. The simple version of this idea? Better safe than sorry.
Some people, more than others, have trouble inhibiting this fear response, even when the logical part of their brains tell them that the threat isn't real. "Somebody might rationally be 95 percent sure they're not gonna contract Ebola, but there's still a five percent chance they could," Lissek said. "They focus on that five percent and say 'what if?'"
According to Lissek, one of the best things health officials can do to help to calm that reaction is to find the "stop, drop, and roll" of Ebola prevention. "Being over-trained with things helps in the face of stress," he said, adding that it's helpful to "have concrete things that people can do" to prevent an Ebola infection, or to respond if the virus reaches where they live.
This is why the military drills emergency responses into soldiers. If responding to an emergency is as easy as drinking a latte, the anticipation of that emergency produces less anxiety; it removes the mystery, the dramatic appeal of the disease, to have a solution to the problem.
Susan Sontag knew this decades ago. She wrote in "Illness as Metaphor" that "any disease that is treated as a mystery and acutely enough feared will be felt to be morally, if not literally, contagious." At the time, in the late 1970s, the author had cancer, a disease that she observed had carried something of a taboo among the rest of society. She applied the same characterization to TB in the past, and eventually, to the AIDS/HIV epidemic.
Although Ebola is not present here in the way that TB, AIDS, or cancer ever have been, the same principle arguably applies.
So what should you do if you fear Ebola is coming to get you? Kaplan had one idea. "Turn off the TV," he advised.

Radamel Falcao  David De Gea save Manchester United fromfallFalaco missed four chances but finally scored a poacher's goal as United claimed a deserved win. (Source: Reuters)
Associated Press | Manchester | Posted: October 5, 2014 8:47 pm | Updated: October 5, 2014 8:51 pm
Radamel Falcao scored his first goal for Manchester United in a 2-1 win over Everton on Sunday as the Red Devils won consecutive Premier League games for the first time under manager Louis Van Gaal.
Angel Di Maria opened the scoring for the hosts before United `keeper David de Gea saved a penalty from Leighton Baines.
The England international then picked out Steven Naismith, who put the teams level in the 55th minute.
Falcao, who joined United on loan from Monaco during the summer, sealed his team’s win seven minutes later, slotting home past Tim Howard after di Maria’s shot landed in the Colombian’s path.
“Everton got chances outside the box and they had good shots, but David De Gea was fantastic,” Van Gaal said. “Falcao was forcing himself last week against West Ham. I told him to be satisfied about his performances and that the goals are coming. The goals are coming. He will be even better after the international break.”
De Gea made a stunning save in stoppage time to tip over the bar Bryan Oviedo’s left-foot shot from 20 meters.
Falaco missed four chances but finally scored a poacher’s goal as United, which played without the suspended Wayne Rooney, claimed a deserved win after dominating from the start at Old Trafford.
Di Maria put the hosts in front with a curled effort past Howard from Juan Mata’s cross for his third goal of the season before Naismith got the better of Luke Shaw and headed home.
De Gea was decisive throughout, denying Leon Osman and Oviedo after stopping Baines’ penalty kick.
“What was my most important save? Maybe the penalty,” De Gea said. “Every save is important but the team played very well. I think the younger players in the team will learn from these types of games. The team and the manager need to look forward.”
Baines had scored 14 penalties from 14 attempts before his attempt at the bottom left was thwarted by De Gea.
“I think David is the guy the who deserves this reward rather than myself, he saved us throughout the game and particularly towards the end and the penalty as well so not only him but the rest of the side deserve this,” said Di Maria after being named man of the match.

Now  MP town denies permission for ChristianconventionALSO READ:  Christian boy- Hindu girl marriage ends in separation 
The police administration had declared as invalid the marriage between Joseph Pawar and Ayushi Wani, both major, who tied the knot at an Arya Samaj temple in Bhopal.
The 5th Massihi Atmik Jagruti Sabha had been planned in advance but the administration first cancelled the permission on September 30 after Hindu organizations threatened to begin an indefinite protest from October 1 till the couple was not traced and the woman restored to her parents.
While denying the permission, SDM (Jobat) Sharda Chouhan in a letter to Kapil Sharma, who is founder of MF and state head of AIUF said if the meet was held “Wani Samaj and Hindu Sangathan(s) could commit some cognizable offence.” The SDM quoted an input by the in-charge of the Jobat Police Station behind the refusal.
The couple was traced and brought to Jobat on October 1, the day Hindu organizations enforced a complete bandh but withdrew the call for indefinite protest. Ayushi told the administration that she loved Joseph and refused to go back to her parents. While she was sent to Nari Niketan in Ujjain, Joseph was escorted to Indore.
Thinking that the matter had been resolved, Sharma again wrote to the SDM seeking fresh permission for the meet. He said invites had been sent to followers weeks in advance and it would be difficult to stop them from coming to Jobat.
Sharma told The Indian Express that on Sunday he got a call from the SDM to convey the administration’s decision that the permission for the meet remained cancelled because the atmosphere was still charged.
Chouhan informed that the ‘mahaul’ was not conducive for the gathering of Christians and that the permission had been denied because it could have become a law and order issue. “What if something goes wrong? Then we will be blamed for having allowed the meet to take place” she said adding tempers were still running high. She said the venue (agriculture field) suggested the meet was planned at a larger scale.
Sharma said that he would challenge the denial of permission in a court of law because the minority community’s constitutional right was being violated.
Fr Anand Muttungal of Isai Mahasangh slammed the Alirajpur administration saying security concern was an excuse. “How could permission be refused for a peaceful meet that could have taken place inside a church,” he asked dubbing the cancellation as “deliberate”.
Refusing the allegation by right-wing organizations that people are converted during the annual meet, Sharma’s letter to the SDM said “no one has been converted in the last four meets and no one will be converted in future.”

Over 200 evacuated from firing-affected hamlets inJammuPress Trust of India | Jammu | Posted: October 5, 2014 10:08 pm
Over 200 people have been evacuated from border hamlets that are affected by Pakistan’s shelling in Arnia and R S Pura belts of Jammu sector.
“More than 200 people have been evacuated from shelling-hit border hamlets along the borders in Arnia and R S Pura belts of Jammu sector,” police officials said.
They were shifted to government buildings and Radha Soami Satsang ghar, they said.
Confirming the reports of evacuation, District Magistrate Jammu, Ajeet Kumar Sahu said, “Situation is unpredictable along the borderline.”
“In the view of firing from across the border, we shifted the people living in villages close to IB to safer areas,” he said.
Violating the ceasefire for the 10th time this month, Pakistani troops on Sunday opened heavy fire on Indian posts along the LoC in Poonch district of Jammu and Kashmir.
Pakistani troops on Saturday fired mortar shells along the LoC in Poonch district, drawing equal retaliation from Army.
On October 3, Pakistani troops violated the ceasefire four time by shelling forward areas and villages along LoC and International Border in Gulmarg sector of Kashmir Valley and Poonch and Jammu sector in Jammu region in which a girl was killed and six persons were injured.
There have been over 100 ceasefire violations by Pakistan along the Line of Control in recent months.

Jose Mourinho  Chelsea have the lastlaughWenger could face disciplinary action after shoving Mourinho in the chest midway through the first half after a heated exchange of views. (Source: Reuters)
Reuters | London | Posted: October 5, 2014 10:00 pm
Jose Mourinho maintained his hold over Arsene Wenger with leaders Chelsea enjoying a routine 2-0 win over Arsenal on Sunday after the two old adversaries became involved in an ugly touchline spat.
Wenger could face disciplinary action after shoving Mourinho in the chest midway through the first half after a heated exchange of views.
It was Mourinho, once again, who had the last laugh though with goals from Eden Hazard and Diego Costa securing a win to stretch Chelsea’s lead at the top to five points.
Mourinho is yet to taste defeat when up against Wenger, winning seven and drawing five of their clashes.
Chelsea were not at their best but for all Arsenal’s possession they rarely looked like replying once Hazard had earned and converted a 27th minute spot kick.
The hosts appeared content to sit back in the second half until former Arsenal skipper Cesc Fabregas, up against his old club for the first time since returning to the Premier League from Barcelona, sent Costa clear with 12 minutes remaining to wrap up the points.
Costa had been quiet throughout but took his tally to nine league goals in seven matches for the Blues.
The only worry for Chelsea was a first-half head injury to keeper Thibaut Courtois who soldiered on for a while before being replaced by Petr Cech.
After a 15-minute delay caused by an incident with a flare outside the stadium, the opening half proved a feisty affair.
Arsenal began in confident fashion with Alexis Sanchez having the first shot in anger.
The Chilean was in the thick of the action minutes later when stretching to reach a Jack Wilshere through ball he accidentally clattered into Courtois.
Sanchez was then on the receiving end of a hefty challenge from Gary Cahill that had Wenger incensed and storming into Mourinho’s technical area.
When Mourinho confronted the Frenchman, Wenger offered a two-handed shove into the chest of the Portuguese who last season described his rival as a “specialist in failure”.
Wenger was lucky to escape punishment from the referee but the incident raised the decibel level in the stadium and appeared to spark the hosts into life.
Shortly after a still groggy Courtois was helped off, Chelsea took the lead.
Hazard’s swerving run was ended abruptly by Laurent Koscielny for a penalty that the Belgian fired into the bottom left corner.
Arsenal playmaker Mesut Ozil flitted in and out of the game and ironic home cheers greeted one tackle on the German by Fabregas who displayed calm authority throughout an often tetchy afternoon.
Chelsea went close to extending their lead after the break when Hazard’s low cross was almost sliced into his own goal by Mathieu Flamini.
The fleet-footed Hazard became increasingly influential, giving young left back continued…

Clashes break out in Ahmedabad after police went to arrest suspects of cowslaughterPrint
Express News Service | Ahmedabad | Posted: October 5, 2014 9:40 pm
A day before the Eid-ul-Zuha celebrations, clashes broke out in the communally sensitive Shahpur area of the city late on Sunday evening where the police officials from the Ahmedabad Crime Branch went to arrest suspect in cow slaughter in Shahibaug firing case a night earlier. The situation turned tense for a few hours where police resorted to shelling tear gas shells to control the violence.
The incident fuelled up at Rangila Chowky near Pattharwali Masjid when a team of crime branch landed in the area for probe. The locals reportedly formed a huge mob and pelted stones at crime branch. Soon, the policemen from Shahpur and neighbouring police stations rushed to the spot to take stock of the situation.
The Shahpur police said that locals didn’t hear to what policemen had to say and objected to the arrest of the men from the locality. They alleged that the boys were being rounded up on wrong allegations and charges. The cops however claimed that they had gone to Shahpur just to check on the suspect’s role in animal slaughter.

The police shelled 20 tear gas shells from the riot control van and over 20 another from stun grenades to control the stone pelting that went on for more than two hours. Two police vans were torched and several private vehicles parked near the spot were ransacked. A Sub-Inpsector from Shahpur police station was injured in the incident and shifted to VS Hospital for treatment.
Ahmedabad Police Commissioner Shivanand Jha rushed to the spot and spoke to the people of the community in Shahpur. He told the locals there, “There was a misunderstanding due which the stone pelting started. You all should remain patient because violence doesn’t benefit anyone. Take control of your areas and maintain peace. We will let you celebrate your festival properly in full security”.
On night of October 4, a team of crime branch men lead by Inspector Bhavesh Rojiya had fired at a mini tempo allegedly carrying beef near Shahibuag underbridge. The tempo driver and cleaner identified as Salman Khan Pathan of Danilimda and Zakir Pathan of Jamalpur were arrested. The crime branch officials said that the driver tried to run over Inspector’s jeep when he tried to stop him from fleeing, which led to the firing.
The officials added that Inspector Rojiya had fired two rounds at the tempo’s rear wheel and stopped the vehicle for checking. The vehicle was however empty but the crime branch had a complete tip off that the accused are connected with the butchers’ network in the city and were going to bring beef in that tempo. The accused are now in custody of the crime branch.
The crime branch officials had suspicion on Hanif Langda, a known butcher and the leading suspect who is running the illegal animal slaughter in the city. Langda’s aide who is based in Shahpur was under the suspicion radar of the crime branch.

Era of alliances over  want full majority  says PM Modi inMaharashtraComments

Stating that the era of poll alliances was over, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday urged the people of Maharashtra to give BJP “a full majority” in the October 15 Assembly elections.
Accusing the Congress-NCP regime of “looting” the state, Modi said both will be equally punished.
“The era of alliances has ended. If you want Maharashtra to progress, then give us full majority,” Modi said, addressing an election campaign rally here.
Modi cited examples of adjoining Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh where voters had given the BJP a full majority. “Maharashtra could be the number one state in the country,” he said.
NCP chief Sharad Pawar chose the Rajya Sabha route for himself but made Praful Patel a scapegoat and fielded him for Lok Sabha polls, Modi said.
“The Maharashtra Assembly polls will decide the fate of Maharashtra,” he said.
Modi observed that the inflation rate has come down for the first time in five years and cited reduction in petrol and diesel prices as important work done by his government.
“Both Congress and NCP have destroyed Maharashtra. Both are equally to blame and both will be equally punished,” he said.
“The maximum number of terror acts occur in Maharashtra. After Uttar Pradesh, the maximum communal riots occur in Maharashtra,” he said.
Appealing to the Maoists to shun violence and return to the mainstream, Modi said, “Put down guns from your shoulders and put ploughs on your shoulder. You will get relief.”
“Return to the mainstream. Stop the bloodshed. Be a partner in the country’s progress. Nobody has succeeded through violence,” he said.
“To political pundits, I wish to say, look around you and feel the atmosphere. We are going to get a clear majority (in Maharashtra),” he said.
“Sharad Pawar was agriculture minister, but in Maharashtra, 3,700 farmers committed suicide per year. However, Congress and NCP government did not shed tears for them. Such a cruel government never existed anywhere,” Modi said.
“Here, we had a chief minister (Prithviraj Chavan) who declined to share the stage with me. How can we work together if such governments are there in Maharashtra,” he said.
Modi described LBT as “looto baato tax.” “BJP will free you from LBT after being voted to power in Maharashtra,” he said.
“Congress people ask me to give them an account of work done by our government. First give me an account of your 60 years of work. After that, ask me the account of my 60 days in office. I am accountable to the people,” Modi said.
“Had I been allowed to complete the work of raising the height of the Narmada dam, Maharashtra would have got free electricity worth Rs 400 crore per year,” he said.
“Now, I can assure you that the work will be continued…

New Delhi: Delhi BJP on Sunday slammed Congress for demonstrating against Doordarshan for the live telecast of RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat's Dussehra speech , saying it has become a "vision less party".
"Congress in Delhi has become a visionless party whose leaders rejected by the citizens of Delhi keep raising petty issues to try and remain in media coverage," Delhi BJP president Satish Upadhyay said here in reaction to the
demonstration by Congress workers.
Scores of Congress workers and leaders today held a protest here demanding immediate resignation of Union Minister Prakash Javadekar accusing him of forcing Doordarshan to go for live telecast of Bhagwat's speech from Nagpur on October 2.

Scores of Congress workers and leaders today held a protest here demanding immediate resignation of Union Minister Prakash Javadekar accusing him of forcing Doordarshan to go for live telecast of Bhagwat's speech from Nagpur on October 2.
The Delhi Congress workers led by its chief Arvinder Singh Lovely were detained outside the DPCC office in central Delhi when they tried to carry out a procession towards Doordarshan (DD) office at Mandi House.
Mounting a direct attack on the BJP, Lovely has said the whole country knows that the RSS is an organisation which has always got enmeshed in controversies in its bid to spread communalism.
He alleged the direct telecast of the speech by RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat has hurt the sentiments of people who strongly uphold the principles of secularism.
Opposing the view taken by Congress, Upadhyay said, "The stress and message of Mohan Bhagwat's speech on Dussehra was on National unity and fruits of development going to all irrespective of caste, creed and religion. But for some fake seculars, the entire nation has lauded the address of Mohan
Bhagwat."
Lashing back at Congress, he also said that "RSS is a socio-cultural organization whose activities influenced every third Indian directly for last seven decades, but Congress using its power clout stopped the government news mediums DD and AIR from covering healthy Sangh activities".
"Now with a free editorial policy DD took a right decision to cover Sangh Pramukhs Dussehra address," he said.

David Axelrod: It was a mistake for Obama to say hi his policies were on the ballotA former top adviser to President Obama said Sunday that it was a "mistake" for Obama to say in a speech last week that his policies are effectively on the ballot in the midterm elections this fall.
"I wouldn't put that line there," David Axelrod said on NBC's "Meet The Press."
In a Thursday speech, Obama said : "I am not on the ballot this fall. Michelle’s pretty happy about that. But make no mistake: These policies are on the ballot. Every single one of them."
Republicans swiftly started running attack ads using the words to tie Democratic congressional candidates to the president, who polls show is unpopular.
Axelrod added, "Understand, if you read the speech, the context of the line was the things he's pushing forward — minimum wage, pay equity, infrastructure — and he said these are on the ballot."
But Axelrod concluded, "It was a mistake."
Sean Sullivan has covered national politics for The Washington Post since 2012.

Mallya has to clear loan defaults to serve as USL chairman: DiageoComments
Loan default cases against Vijay Mallya and his UB Group may cast a shadow over his continuation as chairman of United Spirits Ltd (USL) in the future, with its current parent, UK-based Diageo, making it clear in a statement from its headquarters in London.
Mallya got re-elected as chairman of USL with the support of majority shareholders during the company’s annual general meeting on Tuesday.
Diageo’s contractual obligations to support Mallya continuing as non-executive director and chairman of USL are subject to United Breweries Holding Ltd (UBHL) holding at least 1.3 million shares as well as “the absence of certain defaults by UBHL or Mallya,” said the statement, which was put out on Diageo’s website, a day after the USL annual general meeting.
With UBHL still holding about 4.6 million shares, Mallya may not face challenges as far as his stake in United Spirits is concerned. However, if Diageo raises concerns over default cases, Mallya might find it difficult to stay at the helms of USL. Mallya is fighting various default cases filed by his creditors including public and private sector banks.
Besides this, USL, under Diageo, has initiated inquiry into loans the company had lent to various UB Group entities.
“After the re-election his position on the USL board now looks solid. But With close to 55% shares, Diageo has enough influence to effect a change,” said an expert in company law who sits on the board of a few companies.
Meanwhile, the UB Group lost a position on the board of USL following the reduction in shareholding after creditors invoked pledged shares. 
“Following a reduction in its shareholding in USL, UBHL is no longer entitled to recommend an independent director to the USL board under the shareholders agreement between the Diageo group and the UBHL group,” said the statement from Diageo.
Diageo now has four members on the board of USL including managing director Anand Kripalu, Paul Walsh, Ravi Rajagopal and PA Murali while Mallya remains the lone member from UB Group, which is now a minority shareholder.
A mail to the UB Group, seeking response on Diageo’s statement did not elicit any response till the time of going to the press.

Noida Authority warns home buyers against investing in unauthorised projectsNoida Authority warns home buyers against investing in unauthorised projects
Vinod Rajput , Hindustan Times  Noida, October 02, 2014
First Published: 17:22 IST(2/10/2014) | Last Updated: 17:29 IST(2/10/2014)
The Noida Authority on Thursday said it has issued a public notice to home buyers warning them not to buy flats or plots in a builder project without exercising due-diligence.
 
The notice comes after many builders were allegedly found selling flats and plots in Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway areas, without having the allotted land for the same.
 
The authority had received complaints of buyers, who were duped by builders, who promised a flat/plot without having land and requisite building lay out map approvals.
 
“In notified area of around 20,000 hectare in Noida, the Noida Authority is only government agency that has got mandate to allot land and subsequently approve building layout map for the purpose of planned development. If a builder sells or launches a project on a land not allotted to him/her by the authority, then the same project is unauthorised. Therefore, buyers should first authenticate details of a project before investing money,” said a senior Noida Authority official, requesting anonymity.
 
The authority had recently issued notice to eight builders and lodged an FIR against another for launching an unauthorised group housing project.
 
“We are likely to issue notice against one more builder, who is selling an unauthorised project. Buyers should not invest in a project which is not approved by the Noida Authority,” said official.
 
A few builders have been launching group housing project on village land after obtaining approvals from district panchayat.
 
The authority said that district panchayat has no right to approve such building map in Noida area, where Uttar Pradesh Industrial Act, 1976 is in effect.
 
It added that the builders are cheating home-buyers and such group housings are illegal.
 
The authority said that it had issued several notices to the builder not to carry on construction. It also advised home buyers not to invest in such projects because buyers will face issues in getting possession of houses.

Over 140 passengers on-board Air India’s (AI) Delhi-London flight had a harrowing time on Thursday as the aircraft — a Boeing 787 Dreamliner — took off from the Indira Gandhi International Airport only to return three hours later due to a technical problem.
AI flight 115 took off from the Delhi airport at around 7.34 am. Sources said that around an hour after the take off, passengers complained of suffocation as the aircraft’s air-conditioning system wasn’t working. “As around eight hours of flying was still left it was decided to turn back the plane,” a source said.
The flight landed at Delhi airport at around 10.55 am. “The aircraft was brought back as there was an overheating of cabin. There were 18 business class and 125 economy class passengers on board,” an AI official said.
However, that wasn’t the end to the passenger’s ordeal. Once the flight landed in Delhi it was decided to shift the passengers to an alternate aircraft and operate the flight at 11:55 am. However, by that time the crew’s flight duty time limitation would have kicked-in and an alternate crew would have to be arranged.
“The passengers were finally transferred to AI flight 111, which departed at 1.30 pm,” the official said.
The 787 has been a source of constant trouble for AI.
Last week, the windshield of a 787 had cracked midway through a flight. Till June, 318 cases of delays had been reported due to technical snags in the Dreamliner.

Microsoft is putting up a brave face after its latest edition of office software, Windows 10, drew mixed response in the first 24 hours of its unveiling.
The Windows 10 Global Technical Preview was on Wednesday, and initial reports in blogs and social networking sites were not encouraging, but Microsoft expressed confidence that the product would get positive global feedback once more people get to try it.
“It is just about 24 hours…Tech Preview is designed for PC experts who are comfortable downloading unfinished software,” said a Microsoft spokesperson in India. “We expect the participation of more global users to provide the most robust set of feedback we’ve ever had.”
Mark Hachman at PC World commented: “The Start menu isn’t an overtly pro-business element, and neither are the windowed apps, virtual desktops, or the nifty Snap Assist tools. That would be like saying mouse support is strictly for businesses.”
Windows 10 is important for Microsoft as its current offering, Windows 8, is marred by low user acceptance and glitches that update patches were unable to address. Some common complaints were the new Start screen, Internet Explorer requiring frequent refreshes, excessive backing up of files that filled up hard disks with redundant files, and issues in upgrading from Windows 7.
“Devices using Window have evolved, are evolving, the challenge is to meet not only the demands of existing forms of devices but also those evolving,” Vineet Durani, director, Windows business group, Microsoft India, told HT.
Market analysts are optimistic. “Microsoft has tried to balance the demands of different users by focusing on overhauling the new operating system in terms of adaptability across various devices,” said Sandeep Ladda, India Technology leader, PwC. “The return of the popular Start menu, and addition of innovative features such as Multiple Desktops, Snap View and Universal App Store are likely to bring momentum.”
The software variant for mobile devices has not been unveiled yet. “We will have more to share on the Windows experience for mobile devices at a later date,” a Microsoft India spokesperson said.

CignaTTK Health Insurance launches global group health coverCignaTTK Health Insurance launches global group health cover
BS reporter | Mumbai Oct 04, 2014 12:22 AM IST
CignaTTK Health Insurance has launched a global flagship product in India, as a part of its group product. The product, called the CignaTTK Global Health Insurance, offers a sum insured of between Rs 50 lakh and Rs 12 crore.
 
The product gives employers the liberty to purchase the policy in Indian rupees and claims in respective local currency. The existing policies from other domestic players are a mix of travel and health insurance policies which need to be purchased in US dollars.
 
Sandeep Patel, CEO, CignaTTK Health Insurance said that this product is a global expat plan from India.
 
“The expat plans offered are by international insurance companies with either no or limited access to Indian market. This product will also be cheaper than the other expat plans offered by international players,” he said. 
 
Patel said that this product is suitable for companies, Indian or otherwise, who have employees across the world and is designed for employees who keep travelling on a regular basis. This plan covers the employee in the home country, India and anywhere in the world depending on the geographies chosen in the cover. It also covers the employee, his/her wife/husband or live-in partner/fiancée and dependent children upto the age of 25.
 
The minimum number of employees included in the group plan is 10 and it is a yearly renewal policy.
 
Patel explained that while there are policies covering health expenses when one is travelling abroad, Cigna's product covers not just emergency and critical illnesses, but also other ailments and health check-ups done in other countries.
 
The Policy is available in both deductible and co-pay options and policy holders can claim for dental, vision treatment too. Co-pay means that the insured pays some out-of-pocket expenses when they receive the services while insurer pays the rest. Deductible is the fixed amount one pays before the policy benefits come into force.
 
The product has a 30 day emergency cover beyond the area of coverage. Patel explained that terrorism and catastrophe related medical conditions are excluded and not covered under the policy.
 
“In a crisis situation, policyholders under a group can rely on our emergency assistance services. For instance, if there is an epidemic, we will stabilise the person and get them back to the home country,” said Patel.
 
The Policy offers two plans – Ruby and Diamond. Ruby has sum insured options of Rs 50 lakh and Rs 2.5 crore, while Diamond plan offers sum insured option of Rs 1.5 crore, Rs 3 crore, Rs 4.5 crore, Rs 6 crore, Rs 9 crore and Rs 12 crore. 

Abercrombie Battle Heads To Supreme CourtAbercrombie's Religious Headscarf Battle Heads To Supreme Court
Posted:
reddit
Abercrombie & Fitch's stringent dress code has come under fire from employees who say they were barred from wearing religious items while at work. Now, the nation's highest court is getting involved.
The U.S. Supreme Court said on Thursday that it will hear an appeal filed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on whether Abercrombie can disqualify workers from getting a job because they want to wear a hijab, or headscarf.
The EEOC sued Abercrombie in 2008 on behalf of Samantha Elauf, a Muslim woman who was denied a job as a salesperson at an Abercrombie Kids store in Tulsa, Oklahoma, because her headscarf violated the company's rigid dress code. Elauf, who was 17 at the time, wore a headscarf at her job interview. She didn't specifically say that she wanted a religious accommodation to wear it while working.
A lower court ruled in her favor, saying Abercrombie was liable for religious discrimination. Then, an appeals court reversed the decision, determining that Elauf had to explicitly ask for religious accommodations.
Lately, Abercrombie's "Look Policy," which governs the outward appearance of its salespeople, has been a point of contention for workers who want to wear religious items. In interviews with The Huffington Post last year, several former Abercrombie employees described incidents where they said they were forced to remove religious items or face punishment. A Christian teen was told to take off her cross. A Hindu associate had to cut a religious string off her wrist. And Muslim store employees were told to remove their hijabs.
All kinds of violations can lead to reprimands, Abercrombie insiders told HuffPost. The dress code requires sales associates -- who are called "models" -- to follow specific guidelines. Excessive makeup isn't allowed. Jeans should be cuffed in a certain way. Hair highlights have to be just right. Jewelry must be "simple and classic."
Previously, Abercrombie argued in court documents that its dress code goes to the "very heart of [its] business model," and it could hurt business if employees don't adhere to the rules. CEO Mike Jeffries, who lost his job as chairman earlier this year, is obsessed with the details in his stores, according to a 2006 interview with Salon. Salespeople are a big part of that focus.
In 2013, Abercrombie agreed to make changes to its dress code as part of a settlement in two religious discrimination cases. The retailer specifically acknowledged that hijabs are OK to wear and promised to train managers.
Abercrombie did not respond to a request for comment on Elauf's case. But after last year's settlement, the company told HuffPost in a statement: "We are happy to have settled these cases and to have put these very old matters behind us."

Gandhi  morality and political legitimacyUpdated: October 4, 2014 01:30 IST
Gandhi, morality and political legitimacy
Ananya Vajpeyi
accomplishment
While true political legitimacy has to be premised on popular will, on the desire for self-determination, and on the capacities and capabilities of a government, it resides in a more subtle quality that has to do with the inherent morality of any structure of power that purports to rule a people in their name and for their own good
Every October 2, for the past 66 years, Indians have reflected on the legacy of Mohandas Gandhi, born on this day in 1869, and killed on January 30 in 1948. This moment of reflection has sometimes gone by in a haze of indifference, at other times sparked deep criticisms of the flaws and contradictions in Gandhi’s thought, and on yet other occasions has been observed as a day of ahimsa, non-violence. This year after the general election and the victory of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Gandhi Jayanthi feels like a poignant crossroads. Young Indians seem not to have any particular attachment to Gandhian ideals like ahimsa, swaraj and satyagraha.
Is Gandhi still relevant?
Prime Minister’s Narendra Modi’s invocations of the Mahatma’s name are frequent, but not always convincing: Gandhi is either diminished into a parochial Gujarati figure, or reduced to a formula and a cliché. In the current administration’s rhetoric, Gandhi is not the fountainhead of modern India’s political selfhood but rather a mere icon to be monumentalised and trivialised in one go. Why just Gandhi, it could be Swami Vivekananda who is trotted out one day, Sardar Patel another day, and Babasaheb Ambedkar when his name happens to suit a given purpose. The particularities of the beliefs and ideas of each of these individuals, and their very different, often incommensurable contributions in the making of modern India, are of no relevance in an atmosphere of illiterate nationalistic jingoism and complete ideological vacuity.
But like with any thinker of such enormous and lasting influence, Gandhi’s repertoire of ideas turns out to be more surprising and more resilient than we might realise after many decades of having him be a part of our default political furniture.
If ideas like non-violent sovereignty, the dignity of the poor, the power of truth, and the difficult practices of moral courage are not fashionable today, there is nevertheless a key lesson Gandhi taught us, that remains as relevant in our own time as it was during the British Raj. This is the lesson about the true sources of political legitimacy, and how to recognise them, no matter what the outer garb of sovereign power or the architecture of a state.
Gandhi showed Indians and the world that the ultimate legitimacy in politics comes not from brute force, not from the state apparatus, and not even from mechanisms of political participation, electoral choice and representative self-government. All of these are limited, and all of them are fallible. The popular mandate of Hitler did not make Nazi rule legitimate. The benign despotism of the British in India did not make colonial rule legitimate. Totalitarianism that enters riding on the coat-tails of democracy, or imperialism that seems bent over with the self-inflicted burden of delivering benighted natives from their ignorance and backwardness — neither of these forms attains legitimacy merely because it is successful in capturing power on the basis of professed good intentions.
True political legitimacy has to be premised on popular will, on the desire for self-determination, and on the capacities and capabilities of a government, for sure. But in the end it exceeds and transcends all of these factors, and resides elsewhere, in a more subtle quality that has to do with the inherent morality of any structure of power that purports to rule a people in their name and for their own good.
Lessons from a flood
An illustration from recent events: the devastating floods in Jammu and Kashmir in early September were on the face of it a sign of climate change, environmental calamity and the inadequacy of early warning and disaster management systems. But as the weeks have passed, with houses still submerged; telephone, television, radio and Internet services still down; roads, bridges and highways in a shambles, and government infrastructure unable to come back up to provide even a hint of civic normalcy, it becomes clear that the real crisis in the Valley is a crisis of political legitimacy.
The State government has next to no legitimacy because it failed so completely to warn and evacuate citizens as the waters of the Jhelum began to rise to dangerous levels after unusually heavy rains; it failed to re-establish a basic quorum of ministers, legislators, bureaucrats, police officers and municipal workers who could operate out of private homes or makeshift offices while the government’s own buildings were under water; it failed to marshal, collect and distribute relief supplies that were pouring in from all parts of India and the world at the Srinagar airport; and it failed to provide a modicum of on-the-ground support to the agencies most involved in search, rescue and relief operations for the first few days — the Indian armed forces, the National Disaster Response Force, and the informal and spontaneously arisen Kashmiri citizens’ groups that worked tirelessly in almost every neighbourhood in the deluged State capital, Srinagar.
But these multiple failures of the local government in the face of the biggest natural disaster that the State has ever seen, are only premised on its already low credibility based on a track record of an indifferent administration, weak and faltering alliances, and the inability to put pressure on the Indian and Pakistani governments to resolve their long-running disputes and take concrete steps to break the perpetual political deadlock of Kashmir. The truth is that the floods only provided an alibi for a State government that has barely functioned for its entire term in office. That Chief Minister Omar Abdullah’s National Conference (NC) was elected to power is a fig leaf that scarcely covers how much the party and its leadership is disliked and mistrusted by the people of Jammu and Kashmir, who knew well before the floods that theirs was a government mostly missing in action.
After the floods, even the pretence of law and order, of administrative control, of the delivery of basic services to the citizenry, disappeared entirely. Given that State elections stand to be postponed from December 2014 to next summer, there is no reason to expect that the abysmal standard of governance will suddenly be raised now. Persistent flood conditions and their aftermath, a looming winter, an impending durbar move to Jammu, and, very possibly, a spell of Governor’s Rule make it unlikely that the very politicians and administrators who abandoned their people will belatedly rise to the occasion and do later on what they ought to have done for the past month.
There are at least two positions on the electoral process as a route to political legitimacy in the State, especially in the Valley. Members and leaders of mainstream political parties like the NC and the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) participate in State elections, enter into alliances with national parties like the Congress and the BJP, and form and run the State government if elected to power. Others like the Hurriyat leadership and their supporters do not participate in elections. Their contention is that Jammu and Kashmir is essentially not like any other State of the Indian union, and should not proceed as though it were exactly that, until such time as the overarching dispute about the status of Kashmir is settled in national and international fora.
The terrible predicament of the people of the State is that they have to choose between on the one hand, leaders who do participate in Indian electoral democracy and try to provide at least a semblance of representative self-government, howsoever interim its character — but then make a mess of their regime. On the other hand, there are leaders who don’t participate electorally at all, but don’t have the leverage to actually restate the problem and restart to the process of multilateral dialogue and conflict resolution from scratch. It’s a lose-lose bind. The floods only press home the reality that it’s a pathetic choice between a leadership that can’t govern in fact and one that won’t govern on principle.
In a situation of extreme crisis, like a natural disaster, this dilemma stops being abstract and becomes all too real. Neither a helpless Chief Minister wringing his hands on the Indian media sans his cell phone and his secretariat, nor a popular separatist personally delivering water and food to hundreds of stranded residents of his locality in Srinagar in a small makeshift boat, can present a viable answer to the question that has hovered over the Himalaya since Partition: Who really commands political legitimacy in Kashmir?
Over and above democracy
It has been suggested that what Gandhi has to give to Kashmir is the usual message — non-violence. Militants should put down their weapons, fundamentalists should embrace their neighbours and everyone who has lived through the conflict should renounce anger and vengeance to chart a new path to freedom. But in fact the real relevance of Gandhi to Kashmir — and more so in light of the floods, which have washed away all existing structures of authority, such as they were — is to table once more the question of political legitimacy.
How is political legitimacy in Jammu and Kashmir to be earned? Who can demonstrate having it? From rebuilding Srinagar after the devastation, to repatriating Pandits, to putting in place enduring systems of environmental management, to demilitarisation, to resuming talks with Pakistan, to tackling corruption, to instituting processes of rehabilitation, justice and reconciliation for all those affected by 25 years of war — what needs to be done, and who will do it?
Gandhi’s achievement in forcing a subcontinent and later an empire to re-examine the very foundations of sovereignty urgently needs recalling. Not only have the floods in Kashmir left an entire regional population without any kind of government, whether popular or unpopular, but down south, in Tamil Nadu, another electorally powerful and massively admired leader, Ms. Jayalalithaa, has had to forfeit her mandate in the face of corruption allegations. Her democratically ratified legitimacy is nevertheless not sufficient to protect her from criminal charges in a court of law. And at the centre, a majority win for Mr. Modi and the BJP still leaves open the question of who this government really speaks for, who it represents and sees itself as representing, and who gets left out of its ambit.
The writing is on the wall: in a fractured democracy like India, numbers alone do not tell the whole or the true story of legitimate rule. Legitimacy has to be earned the hard way, through good governance, transparency, probity, lawfulness, justice, inclusivity and the capacity to demonstrate, both every day and in a crisis, that a government really is not just by and of, but also for the people.

Why Ben Bernanke can t refinance his mortgageWhy Ben Bernanke can't refinance his mortgage
Neil Irwin |  Oct 04, 2014 12:56 AM IST
An employee of a think tank owns a house in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Washington. He wants to refinance his mortgage, but the bank won't give him a loan.
It is perhaps not the most shocking story in the world, but it becomes so when you learn that the think tank employee is Ben S Bernanke, who was until earlier this year the chairman of the Federal Reserve, charged with setting the course of interest rate policy for the United States economy.
And it seems downright absurd when you consider that he now makes a reported $250,000 for giving a speech and has signed a book contract that is surely in the seven figures. His income this next couple of years will surely dwarf the value of his house (he and his wife bought it for $839,000 in 2004, and it is currently assessed at $815,000, according to District of Columbia property records).
"Just between us," he said on stage at a conference in Chicago on Thursday, according to Bloomberg News, "I recently tried to refinance my mortgage and I was unsuccessful in doing so."
So what's going on?
The problem probably boils down to this: Anybody who knows how the world works may know that Ben Bernanke has vast earning potential, and that he is as safe a credit risk as one could imagine. But he just changed jobs a few months ago. And in the thoroughly automated world of mortgage finance, having recently changed jobs makes you a steeper credit risk.
"The biggest issue that we see with changes in employment is when a change in pay structure occurs," said Jim Woodworth, a mortgage specialist at Quicken Loans, in an article on that company's site offering home-buying advice. "For example, someone that goes from a salaried position to a commissioned position will encounter some obstacles with applying for a loan, even if the new job results in higher income."
That would seem to fit Bernanke to a tee. He recently ended 11 years of steady employment with the federal government, during which he earned a steady salary. Now, while his earning potential is vast, it is irregular, with an unpredictable stream of revenue from speeches and book advance payments.
At the event in Chicago, Bernanke was using his own refinancing difficulties to make a point that mortgage credit may still be tighter than it should be. But rather than a simple matter of tight versus loose, the real dynamic in the mortgage market right now may be one of a lack of flexibility.
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-owned mortgage companies, now dominate the market for loans, so banks must meet their strict standards for any loans they wish to sell off to them at favorable interest rates. And banks themselves are under pressure from regulators not to take major risks on their balance sheets.
More broadly, the old-school model of what it means to apply for a mortgage - go down to your local bank and have a loan officer meet with you and try to judge whether you are likely to repay the mortgage - is very much a thing of the past.
The more automated mortgages have become - based on formulas tied to credit scores and employment histories - the less room individual lenders have to use sensible judgement to conclude that, just maybe, the nice man with a beard who looks vaguely familiar and seems quite certain he will make plenty of money to make his mortgage payments might be a good credit risk, no matter what his employment status says.

Telling the truth in Hollywood‘Let Me Be Frank with You’, by Richard Ford
It has been a busy summer for McQueen; no wonder the garden needed some concentrated maintenance. The explosion of publicity that surrounded the release of his Oscar-winning masterpiece 12 Years a Slave last year, and the trail of critical plaudits that has followed it, have been life-changing experiences.
Except that McQueen’s life barely seems to have altered. If he has become a cultural superstar, you wouldn’t know it. There is a notable lack of interest in his presence here. He once told me that he chose to live in Amsterdam for its “human scale”, and the city’s residents are doing their bit to offer a corrective coolness to the geysers of acclaim which have come his way over the past year.
As if to prove the point, McQueen puts his hand up to try and order some drinks. He fails to catch the eyes of the waiting staff. I decide to help him, and the two of us wave away, drowning in anonymity, hoping that someone will notice. A good 60 seconds later, we finally succeed. I wonder to myself if that has ever happened to a current holder of the Academy Award for Best Picture before. The maître d’s of Los Angeles would rather be skewered for sushi than allow such a thing to occur in any of their establishments. “I thought my arm was going to break!” says McQueen cheerfully.
McQueen’s latest project, his first since 12 Years, is an entirely predictable change of register. It is a short film shot on Super 8mm, Ashes, which is on show at London’s Thomas Dane Gallery from October 14. While 12 Years played to a captivated global audience in its millions, Ashes belongs to the more rarefied province of the contemporary art gallery, in which McQueen made his name.

A still from McQueen’s new work, ‘Ashes’, about a young fisherman who was killed by drug dealers. The film uses footage shot in Grenada 12 years ago
The film shows a handsome young black man sitting, standing, preening on the bow of a boat. He shows off to the camera, laughing and striking poses. In front of him is the sea and the bluest of skies. The camera seems to love him, and he loves playing to it, and he finally pratfalls off the boat.
The film is a joyful paean to youth and innocence – until you listen carefully to the soundtrack, in which two men recount, in thick Caribbean patois, the plight of one of their friends, a fisherman named Ashes. He found a stash of drugs on a beach, they say, took it away, and was then hunted by a gang of men who wanted it back. The posse caught up with him and shot him dead as he tried to escape. The narrators’ voices are full of sadness. We know, no explanation required, that the carefree young man in the film is Ashes.
The juxtaposition of spoken word and image, pulling and pushing at different emotions in the spectator, is typical McQueen, complicating and subverting a seemingly straightforward narrative. The film, he explains, has something of the quality of a found object for him: the footage of Ashes was shot 12 years ago in Grenada, his father’s birthplace, while he was shooting for another film entirely, the installation diptych, Caribs’ Leap and Western Deep.
There he is on the edge of the boat, looking towards this endless horizon. He doesn’t know he will be dead in six years’ time . . .
“Ashes was a fisherman, this extremely striking, beautiful young man, with blond dreadlocks, very charismatic,” says McQueen. “And I just thought, ‘Let’s shoot him.’ He didn’t say very much, but he just had this aura about him. In other circumstances he would have been a rock star or a movie star. He had that quality about him. I just wanted to shoot him. I didn’t know why. The footage wasn’t necessary for the piece, so when we got back I just put it away.”
McQueen returned to Grenada eight years later and made inquiries about the young fisherman. Friends recounted the circumstances of his demise. “I was so shocked. I found out what happened and it was in some ways a completely classical story – the young man who finds the stash of drugs, the 21st-century equivalent of treasure, and then the pirates go after him and kill him. Now that doesn’t happen in Grenada, it’s very rare. I was struck by this deep sorrow [of the islanders] about his death.”
The film, he says, is about “life’s possibilities. There he is on the edge of the boat, looking towards this endless horizon. He doesn’t know he will be dead in six years’ time. No one knows.” Except, that is, for the spectator, watching the film with hindsight. Visitors can also pick up a poster from the film, with a transcript of the difficult-to-understand testimony of Ashes’ friends. “I liked the idea of people taking something away with them,” says McQueen.

I ask him if it feels good to return to the more intimate milieu of the art gallery after the bombastics of Hollywood film-making. “I never left it,” he says immediately. “And last year I did a very big show at the Schaulager [Basel] which actually didn’t feel very intimate at all. But the intimacy in one’s mind, yes.” The best way to describe the relationship between the two means of expression, he says, in a comparison he has made before, is that “the movie is the novel, and art is poetry. Not a lot of people appreciate poetry, and it is the same with art. It is a more specialised form. That’s the difference.”
But the two impulses are forever “expanding and contracting” in his mind, he says. I ask if it is difficult to shift between genres. It is the rarest of things for a video artist to convert to Hollywood film-making. “Not at all. It is not as if I am jumping into different states of mind. It is all about finding what you want to say, and then how you want to say it.” Is that very clear to him straightaway? “Oh yes. But these things are incubating in my mind for a long time. I am in 2007 right now.” I look for a hint of a smile as he says this but he appears deadly serious.
Art is poetry. Not a lot of people appreciate poetry, and it is the same with art
McQueen, who turns 45 this week, is routinely described as a prickly man who doesn’t suffer fools gladly, but I wonder if that is confusing his seriousness and unrelenting intensity for a kind of social awkwardness. He gives every impression to me of enjoying the interview process, watchful and concentrated while he is listening to the question, like a batsman steadying himself during a bowler’s run-up. When Kirsty Young brought up the same subject in a recent edition of the BBC’s Desert Island Discs, asking why he was so unfairly portrayed, he replied simply: “I am a black man. I’m used to that. If I walk into a room people make a judgment. I don’t care.”

McQueen was born in west London in 1969, moving from the White City estate to the more comfortable suburban environment of Ealing when he was a small boy. Encouraged by his mother, he turned to art, studying at Chelsea College of Arts and Goldsmiths College, before moving to New York to take a film-making course at Tisch School of the Arts. He was frustrated there by the strictures of the teaching, saying he was unable “to throw the camera up in the air”.
Throughout his career he has shown an innate ability to temper the rhythms of film to startling effect. In 1992’s Exodus, his camera followed two men walking through Brick Lane market in east London carrying potted coconut palms, imbuing in the innocuous narrative an inexplicable sense of tension and poignancy. In 1997’s Deadpan, a reproduction of a scene from Buster Keaton’s Steamboat Bill, Jr, he turned comedic homage into something more sinister and dangerous. The work was one of the pieces that won him the Turner Prize in 1999.

Michael Fassbender and Rory Mullen in Hunger (2008)
By the time he came to direct his first feature film, Hunger, in 2008 – the same year that he was chosen to represent Britain in the Venice Biennale – he was able to mix stillness and movement to masterly effect, stamping his own style on to a very different form of film-making. The movie, recounting the hunger strike of the IRA prisoner Bobby Sands in 1981, was clustered around a remarkable central scene lasting 22 minutes, shot in two takes and heavy with dialogue, between Sands and a priest. “It was a cascade of language, an avalanche,” recalls McQueen. “Up to that point, violence has been exhausted, so this was language being exhausted. And then the third act is the hunger strike, which is another kind of limit.”
He makes it sound like music, I say. “I like the idea of composing a narrative from A to B, and thinking how you take a person on a particular journey. It’s all about composing. It’s not a waltz, 1-2-3, 1-2-3, it is a more difficult thing for the spectator, but after a while you trust the film-maker’s decision. That is the art.”
Hearing McQueen talk about his film-making like this reminds me that, speaking to him about Hunger five years ago, I made a joke that he was about to be swallowed up by Hollywood. McQueen said then that he had taken some meetings which he found to be strange affairs, and that while Hollywood was full of clever people, their only terms of reference seemed to be other movies, and as a result they “killed” original ideas.
It is all about finding what you want to say, then how you want to say it. These things are incubating in my mind for a long time. I am in 2007 right now
So how did he successfully pitch the idea of 12 Years, I ask him? How did he conquer Hollywood? “12 Years could not have been made anywhere else,” he replies. “It had to be made in Hollywood. I couldn’t raise the money in Europe. And I was extremely lucky that people trusted me and trusted my vision. Brad [Pitt, whose company Plan B backed the film] was amazing. I was lucky enough to work with people who understood what I was trying to do. They gave me their trust. I had final cut, and that was that.”
Hunger was a film which reopened a historical chapter which many had considered closed. Was that also his aim in 12 Years? “I don’t think people had looked into the subject matter very much, that relationship between slave and slave-owner,” he says simply. “That is what I wanted to do. It is such a huge part of history, and there was a certain kind of examination or reflection it hadn’t been given. It is very, very important to look back in order to move forward.”
“A lot of people didn’t want the movie made,” he says suddenly. I ask if he was able to understand that. “Yes, because people want to close their eyes on some subjects. They want to keep on going, they don’t want to look behind them.”

The success of the film – Solomon Northup’s 1853 memoir was proposed to him by his long-time partner, the critic Bianca Stigter – comfortably surpassed his expectations, he says. “I am very happy the film did so well, and that people have been talking about the subject in a real way.” It has had a more visceral effect too. A producer McQueen knows in Toronto told the director of his experience when he saw the film: “There was a black woman sitting next to him, in her thirties or forties, and as the movie’s final part was beginning, she put her hand on his hand. They held hands. And when the titles came up, they fell into each other’s arms, crying. And that is not the first time I have heard a story like that.”
But in addition to the film’s considerable emotional impact on audiences, it is the longer-lasting resonances that give McQueen satisfaction. He has taken part in numerous post-screening debates, which have mostly been “electrifying”. One woman stood up to reveal, for the first time in public, that her father had been poisoned for teaching children how to read. “She had never talked about it before like that,” he says. “Art can do that. Art can start a conversation.”
It is not a conversation that shows any sign of fizzling out: McQueen is now involved in President Obama’s charity for young people, My Brother’s Keeper, and he has also been instrumental in promoting a scheme that will see the film and book of 12 Years available to every school in America. “I really wanted that to happen,” he says, adding that he would also like to see the initiative in the UK.
A lot of people didn’t want ‘12 Years’ made. People want to close their eyes on some subjects, they don’t want to look behind them’
He seems to relish plunging into controversial subjects, I say. Shame, his second feature film, was an extraordinarily candid view of the unheralded extremes of male sexuality. “That’s still not sorted,” he says quickly. “That is unfinished business. I really want to come back to that.” Why was that? “It is an extremely fascinating subject. But no one talks about it. Let’s get real! So many important decisions in the world are connected with the sexual appetites of important men. Whether it is JFK, or Clinton, or Martin Luther King. That is what we are. That is part of us. But sometimes people are embarrassed by their pleasures.
“It is a huge subject. So many people came out after that film and sent me anonymous letters, a lot of thank-yous, and some crazy stuff too.” What did women think of it, I ask? “I don’t know how much women know, or want to know, about men’s sexual appetites. A friend of mine went to see it with his wife, and she asked him, ‘Do those things really happen?’ And he was, like, ‘No, no, it is just a fantasy, it is just the movies.’” McQueen’s laugh suggests otherwise.
Politics, priapism and persecution: McQueen’s first three films have delved fearlessly into taboo themes. Does he feel he has to screw his courage to the sticking-place when he is looking for a subject? “No, not at all. Sex addiction, hunger strikes, slavery – these are huge subjects. And for some reason people don’t want to take them on.” What is that reason? “I have no idea. But those are the subjects I want to engage with. I want to narrate them, see them, think about them, grapple with them.”
Notwithstanding his ability to focus like a hawk on the most divisive of contemporary themes, McQueen, it strikes me, is the most traditional of artists, balancing the claims of truth and beauty as he picks at the scabs of social injustice and human suffering. More than one critic was struck by the innocent loveliness of many of the images in 12 Years, some suggesting that it was a distraction from the film’s uglier themes. McQueen won’t have that. “I wasn’t making a horror movie. Have you ever been to New Orleans? It is the most beautiful place. And yes, these things happened there.
“The world is perverse. And sometimes perversity happens in the most beautiful places. That is what it is all about. You can still go to the American south and visit these whitewashed plantations, and a Scarlett O’Hara figure will give you a guided tour of the place, offer you lemonade or ice cool tea, and show you where the cotton was picked, as if it were Disney World.
“That is where these perverse things happened. And that is what I wanted to show, exactly as it was. Deal with it.”

DERC to review fuel surcharge  tariff may go up in NovemberDERC to review fuel surcharge, tariff may go up in November
Press Trust of India | New Delhi Oct 05, 2014 04:54 PM IST
Power tariff in the city may go up next month as Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission is all set to levy a fuel surcharge to help the private distribution companies adjust their power purchase cost.
While hiking the power tariff by up to 7.5% for domestic consumers, the DERC in July had withdrawn Power Purchase Adjustment Cost (PPAC) of around 8% till October.
Chairman of Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission P D Sudhakar said a decision on "readjusting" the tariff will be taken by end of the month after examining the petitions of the three private discoms to review the PPAC.
"We will take a decision on the fuel surcharge based on petitions of the discoms. A decision will be taken by end of this month and if there is a hike in tariff, then it will come into effect from November," Sudhakar told PTI.
The regulator had introduced PPAC in 2012 to help the private power distribution companies recover additional cost on account of increase in coal and gas prices.
Delhi gets power from a number of gas and coal-based power generation plants.
Power experts said the three discoms Tata Power Delhi Distribution Ltd, BSES Rajdhani Power Ltd and BSES Yamuna Power Ltd may see a hike in the range of 6 to 8%.
While hiking the power tariff by up to 7.5% for domestic consumers, the DERC in July had withdrawn PPAC of around 8% for three months.
The withdrawal of the PPAC resulted in marginal decline of tariff for the consumers, whose monthly consumption does not exceed 400 units.
In January, the DERC had hiked the fuel surcharge to the tune of 8% for BSES Yamuna Power Ltd, 6% for BSES Rajdhani and 7% for Tata Power Delhi Distribution Ltd.
The private power distribution companies, particularly, BRPL and BYPL, have been demanding significant hike in tariff, citing rise in power purchase cost.

Facebook Finally Admits  Mood Altering  Study Not The Best Ideareddit
Facebook finally just kind of apologized for manipulating the emotions of hundreds of thousands of people.
In a blog post published to Facebook, the company's chief technology officer expressed regret for a research experiment conducted on more than 689,000 Facebook users in 2012 in which news feeds were purposefully manipulated to alter people's moods. He also announced some changes the company plans to make to ensure future experiments won't be so creepy.
"It is clear now that there are things we should have done differently," Schroepfer writes. In the post, Schroepfer admits Facebook was "unprepared" for the backlash caused by the research. The experiment should have been more widely reviewed and better explained to users.
When word of the experiment leaked earlier this year, the public freaked out. Even the architect of the study admitted it was creepy , the Atlantic reported.
“This was part of ongoing research companies do to test different products, and that was what it was; it was poorly communicated,” Facebook's chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg said -- stopping short of apologizing for anything but the poor communication
In his post, Schroepfer goes farther than Sandberg but never explicitly says sorry. He also says Facebook will continue experimenting and researching our behavior.
"We’re committed to doing research to make Facebook better, but we want to do it in the most responsible way," Schroepfer writes.
He explains that going forward Facebook will give researchers "clearer guidelines," create a panel of review for the study, increase education for researchers and create a public website for its published research.

One Haider is not enoughOne Haider is not enough
ANI   October 05, 2014
Comments
I no longer don the uniform. But I did once, in the year the recently released movie Haider is set. And in the same place, the Kashmir Valley. I may have been young then, and Haider may be a work of fiction, but I did come across many characters Vishal Bhardwaj and Basharat Peer have crafted for the movie. More significantly, I was a part of the environment the movie is set in, and may have even shaped it in my own little way.
First the movie. I have watched Haider and it is political. It is neither a documentary nor is it a propaganda film. The political undertones are subtle at most places but the movie sporadically erupts into making overtly political statements: disappeared people, half-widows, unmarked graves, AFSPA, the army's creation of counterinsurgent group, Ikhwaan and perhaps the most controversial of them all, the torture scenes.
Also watch: Haider is not your regular Bollywood film
To anyone who has read Basharat Peer (author of Curfewed Night) or other Kashmiri writers, this should not come as a surprise. It is the standard viewpoint of middle-class, educated young men from Srinagar who came of age in the early 1990s, when the militancy was at its peak in the state. The movie stays true to that political viewpoint and captures many truths of that period. But it is not the complete truth. To think that this movie tells you everything you need to know about Kashmir would be fallacious. We will perhaps need another half a dozen movies just to scratch the surface of the many truths of Kashmir.
Also read: Haider will hurt and haunt you
As per reports, the movie was given a U/A certificate after 41 cuts by the Censor Board. It would be fascinating to see what those cuts were, because I fear that they perhaps gave the movie the political correctness it ends up with.
The movie starts with a caption Srinagar, India 1995. To use Srinagar, India and not Srinagar, Kashmir the way other Bollywood movies (like Roja) have done was a significant statement to make even before the movie started. The ending, where the protagonist ends up forsaking revenge to terminate the unending cycle of violence --- and the nods to the futility of revenge earlier during the movie --- seem almost contrived. As if the censors wouldn't pass the movie if it didn't end with the politically correct message. To be or not to be.
Of course, no Indian movie can have Indian Army as the villain and so the movie ends up depicting the pro-India counterinsurgency group, Ikhwaan as the evil guys. That's the closest --- by proxy --- Peer and Bhardwaj could have come to showing India and Indian Army as being the bad guys. Subtle but well done and par for the course for a political movie. So what was the truth about Ikhwaan-ul-Muslimoon?
Also read: Haider may not release in Pakistan
Everything the movie says about Ikhwaan is perhaps true. The group was supported by the Indian Army and operated alongside it. It countered terror with terror of its own against Pakistan-backed terrorists and their over ground supporters. Ikhwaanis illegally felled timber and sold it (Koka Parray acknowledged that in an interview to Harinder Baweja of India Today in 1995), extorted money from shopkeepers, street vendors and even bus-passengers at checkpoints it established. It also probably did things much worse than that. After all, these Ikhwaanis had been trained in Pakistan, had operated as terrorists and knew how to fleece the Kashmiris for personal benefits.
Why did Indian Army prop up Ikhwaanis under Koka Parray? Koka Parray was a folk-singer from Hajan who was trained in PoK and later surrendered after being with the Hizbul Mujahideen. Till 1994, he was a small-time informer for the infantry battalion at Manasbal, who gained such prominence by 1995 that he was being courted by top military commanders and politicians. Koka Parray was a prized asset not only because he could do the dirty job for the army, but because he was the only one to provide a breakthrough in a war India seems to be losing --- or at best, not winning --- in Kashmir.
Ikhwaanis provided intelligence, intimate local knowledge and understanding of the militant tactics which the army didn't possess. The success was immediate and reflected in the parliamentary elections of 1996. Most people forget that even Farooq Abdullah had boycotted the 1996 Lok Sabha polls, anticipating that they will be a stunning failure. The "success" of 1996 Lok Sabha polls encouraged Dr. Abdullah to participate in the 1996 Vidhan Sabha elections, which led to resumption of the political process and Kashmir's slow march towards normalcy.

Shraddha, Shahid in Haider
What was India like in early 1990s? It was still recovering from the economic crisis and politically, it was in great turmoil. Babri Masjid had been demolished by the Sangh Parivar, Rajiv Gandhi had been assassinated by the LTTE, Mandal Commission had opened cleavages in the society, militancy was still at its peak in Punjab, and serious charges of corruption (from Harshad Mehta and payment to JMM MPs to Urea Scam) were levelled against PM Narasimha Rao. 
Internationally, the Cold War had ended with the disintegration of India's strategic ally, the USSR. Pakistan had been at the forefront of defeating the Soviets in Afghanistan, and the world's sole superpower owed Pakistan a few favours. So much so that Robin Raphael, First Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs under President Clinton, was actively supporting Kashmiri separatism and helped form the Hurriyat as a political face of the Pakistan-fuelled militancy in Kashmir. In those pre 9/11 days, there was no global consensus against Islamist terror. India felt under siege, both at home and abroad. It is in these circumstances that the Indian establishment took to Ikhwaan as a tactical succour. And however loathe we might be to acknowledge it today, the coming in of Ikhwaanis turned the tide in India's favour. It was not the best option but as anyone who has served in counterinsurgency knows, there are no good options in counterinsurgency. You always choose the least bad option and perhaps Ikhwaan was the least bad option at that time.
It must be reiterated though that whether due to Kashmiri politics or due to Indian apathy, the Ikhwaanis were soon marginalised and ceased to exist, both as a counterinsurgent group and as a political force in the Valley. Praveen Swami's obituary in Frontline magazine of Koka Parray after his killing by two Hizbul terrorists in 2003 adequately captures the decline of Ikhwaan in the state. That reinforces my belief that Ikhwaan wasn't a strategic choice exercised by the Indian Army but only a tactical ploy to overcome a very difficult situation at a specific time. Weren't Petraeus and other American generals hailed for doing the same in Iraq? 
On AFSPA, even if we concede that the law was needed at the peak of militancy in Kashmir in the 1990s, there is no reason for it to still be applied to urban areas of Kashmir at the current levels of violence. Chief minister Omar Abdullah has cogently made the case but to little avail. Let's hope the new, unfearing government at the Centre will have the courage to take that bold step and send a message to Kashmir which its predecessor governments failed to do. 
The interrogation centre in Haider is called Mama-2, a clever nod to the now-mythologised interrogation centre called Papa-2 in Srinagar. But the movie gets it wrong. Papa stands not for father but for the phonetic word associated with letter P; if it started with letter M, the place would be called Mike and not Mama. Frivolities aside, Papa-2 was run by BSF --- not the army though it got intelligence ascertained from militants detained there --- and closed down in 1996. Did torture happen in Papa-2 or in other detentions by the security forces? 
There is no reason to believe that it didn't happen but such incidents (as those of "fake encounters") came down dramatically after the 1996 assembly elections. It is something which ideally shouldn?t have happened but when people are sucked in the vortex of an ugly conflict, ugly things happen. The question of justice for those who suffered in that conflict --- innocents, militants, sympathisers, security force personnel, Kashmiri Pandits, families --- is a vexed one. Should it be "retributive" justice or "restorative" justice advocated by Mandela in South Africa? Can time heal all the wounds? If so, how much more time do we need? These are complex questions in any conflict and in case of Kashmir, almost impossible to find simple answers to.
For all his craftsmanship, Vishal Bhardwaj makes some silly errors in the movie which I couldn't fail to notice. The yellow table tennis balls, used by a young Haider and his father in a flashback scene, came into use much later. White balls were used during the period of the movie. The soldiers move around with INSAS rifles in the movie set in 1995 when these weapons were introduced only in 1997. The vehicles used by the Indian Army in 1995 were not the ones soldiers use in the movie. The stars on the collar dogs for Brigadiers and above were introduced in 2000s and a Brigadier (portrayed by Ashish Vidyarthi in the film) couldn?t have worn them in 1995. Indian Army didn't have a RPG-7 in its inventory and the RL-84 Rocket launchers that it used never set buildings to fire. They just drilled holes through the walls. Often, houses where militants were holed in were set to fire by the soldiers as a matter of last resort by late evening to prevent escape of militants under the cover of darkness. At times, explosives were used by soldiers in daring moves to blast such houses. Of course, grenades never cause fire in such high intensity but that is a problem of depiction with Hollywood too. Suicide vests, using Chinese grenades, might be a cinematic device used here because suicide bombing and fidayeen attacks started a couple of years after 1995 when HuM, HuA and LeT became dominant players in the terror game in Kashmir. And yes, Srinagar was no way as clean and tidy then as shown in the movie. It was a dark, dirty, gloomy place which is unimaginable now.
These nitpickings aside, Haider is a movie we should welcome whole-heartedly. More than the quality and the message of the movie, the fact that such a political movie can be made and released in this country is something we should be justifiably proud of. Let a thousand more Haiders bloom.

Won t say a word against Shiv Sena as a mark of respect to Bal Thackeray: ModiInto his second day of campaigning for the October 15 elections in Maharashtra, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Sunday that he would not criticise former ally Shiv Sena out of respect for its late leader, Bal Thackeray.

"Political pundits are saying why is Modi not criticising Shiv Sena in his speeches (during poll campaign). This is the first election in absence of late Bal Thackeray, for whom I have great respect. I have decided not to utter a single word against Shiv Sena. This is my tribute to Balasaheb Thackeray.
"There are some things which are above politics...There are feelings. Not everything should be linked to politics," the 64-year-old BJP leader said addressing a poll rally at Tasgaon in Sangli district of western Maharashtra.
Read: Modi kicks off campaign trail in Maharashtra, Haryana; launches attack on Congress
The soft approach set off talk about the possibility of the BJP and Sena coming together after the polls, in case neither was able to form the government on its own. Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari had told HT last week the BJP may have a post-poll alliance with the Sena in such circumstances.
But Modi asked the media not to speculate. Pointing out that certain things were beyond politics, he told a rally in Tasgaon in Sangli district, “These are the first assembly elections to be held without Balasaheb... I have great respect for him.”
He also appealed to voters to give the BJP a clear majority, saying “alliances did you no good... No party takes responsibility in alliances. The BJP will take responsibility if you vote it to power”.   
Modi, who began his speech in Marathi, launched a scathing on Pawar for his comments about Shivaji "plundering" the treasury of Surat.
Read: Now, Pawar hits back at PM Modi
"Pawar's statement has hurt me deeply. You don't have knowledge of history. Gujarat was part of Maharashtra prior to its formation in 1960. We have considered Maharashtra as big brother," he said.
"I want to ask Pawar: you speak of Shivaji. It was the Vajpayee government which named Mumbai airport after Shivaji. You were CM but did not think of it. Even Victoria Terminus was named Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus by Vajpayee government," the PM said. "There is no chance of you (Pawar) getting Shivaji's qualities in your character. But as agriculture minister, had you implemented Shivaji's water management techniques, farmers of Maharashtra would not have committed suicide."
Modi added, "I am amazed. Pawar was the Union agriculture minister. But in his Maharashtra, around 3,700 farmers commit suicide every year. It does not befit Pawar to talk of Shivaji. The statue of Shivaji in Surat is much bigger than the one in your Baramati (Pawar's constituency in western Maharashtra).”
“Stop challenging our Shiv bhakti,” he said.
At a recent poll rally, Pawar had attacked the BJP, saying that the people who had termed Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj a 'looter' were invoking the warrior king to seek votes.
"They never even celebrated Shiv Jayanti and suddenly they have realised the importance of Shivaji Maharaj. All this is for votes only. BJP is well aware that it would not be able to reach out to the masses using its so-called icons and that's why is using Shivaji Maharaj's name and seeking people's blessings," Pawar had said.
Attacking the Congress and the NCP, Modi said both were of the same mould as far as corruption was concerned. "These are the people who robbed Kargil widows of their homes and jobs from youth. They have destroyed Maharashtra," he said. "Do you want to get Maharashtra out of the morass of corruption? I am willing to take responsibility, but elect a government with full majority."

He said had had the Congress-led UPA government completed work on Narmada project, Maharashtra would have got free electricity worth Rs. 400 crore per year. "Why are sugar mills in Maharashtra closed?" he asked. "The Amul success story of Gujarat is now globally famous but you made sugar mills hub of politics," he said.
Modi began his speech by hailing Chhatrapati Shivaji and paid tributes to Ganesh and Piroba deities. "Sangli, sarvat changli (Sangli is the best of all)," he said. "I am a kaamdar (worker) among all these amdars and khasdars (MLAs and MPs)," Modi said.
"India is shining in the US not because of Modi, but because of the 125 crore people. This is the power of full majority," he said.
Modi said he had asked officials to check how much percentage of natural fruit could be put in soft drinks. "This will ensure that fruits produced by farmers don't rot. I am going ahead with the 'Make In India' mantra so that youth get jobs.”
Modi concluded his speech with an appeal to the crowd to leave the rally venue only after making sure that the ground was free of litter. He also spoke of the Swachh Bharat campaign aimed at creating a clean India.

Burdwan blast: 2 women held; Bengal a safe haven for jihadis  says BJPComments
Two women were arrested and remanded to police custody for two weeks on Sunday in connection with the explosion at Khagragarh that left two suspected militants dead.
SMH Mirza, superintendent of police (SP) said the two women — Rajira Bibi alias Rumi hailing from Karimpur in Nadia and Ameena Bibi hailing from Lalbagh in Murshidabad — were arrested on Sunday morning.
Burdwan blast: phones with 'jihadi' videos found
Rumi is the widow of suspected militant Shakil Ahmed, who was killed in the explosion in a house at Khagragarh on October 2, while Ameena Bibi is the wife of Abdul Hakim, who was critically injured in the blast. They were later produced before a local court which sent them to police custody, Mirza said. The CID of West Bengal police is looking into possible involvement of terror outfits like Lashkar-e-Taiba and Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami in the blast.
It is suspected that the victims of the explosion were associated with a militant outfit as a large number of watch dials, SIM cards, and other tools required to make improvised explosive devices were recovered, police said.
Meanwhile, Hakim’s family members expressed said it was not unexpected for him as they had suspected foul play since last few years.
“At first, he used to visit house on a regular basis. Since the last two years, he had only visited his house only once,” recalled Muntaj Ali, a local villager. “He had changed a lot…his attitude was not at all normal or as before. For which we prefer not to keep touch with him,” he added.

As fuel price gap narrows  petrol cars offer better costadvantagePrint
Written by Sandeep Singh | Posted: October 6, 2014 12:08 am
Following a series of fuel price cuts as a result of softening global crude oil prices, the state-owned oil marketing companies announced a 65 paise cut in the price of petrol while keeping the diesel rates untouched and thereby narrowed the gap between diesel and petrol prices down to Rs 8.89 a litre from over Rs 20 per litre in January 2013.
In line with the changing dynamics of the fuel prices, the Indian automobile industry witnessed a big shift in customer preference from petrol cars to diesel cars and vice-versa.
If the preference was heavily tilted in favour of diesel cars till a few months ago, the tide now seems to have turned in favour of petrol cars after a series of monthly hikes in diesel prices beginning January 2013.
The gap between diesel and petrol prices which stood at almost 45 per cent in early 2013 has now narrowed down to 15 per cent, forcing the car buyers to think whether it makes sense to pay the additional capital of Rs 1 lakh to buy the diesel variant of the car.
While prospective customers may be looking for advice on whether they should go for a petrol or diesel car based on their average monthly running, Express Money does the exercise to make it easier for you to decide which car you should pick.
In order to arrive at a purchase decision, we looked into the two most important aspects — the capital outgo (the equated monthly installment on the two fuel variants of the same car model) and the running cost (respective fuel expense for the two car variants at various levels of monthly running).
Should you SETTLE  for a diesel car?
With diesel prices cheaper by over 40 per cent than petrol, it was a no-brainer to go for the diesel car till a year ago. However, today, with the price advantage that diesel offered fast eroding, the odds are stacked more in favour of petrol cars unless your monthly run on the car is more than 2,300-2400 km.
Since petrol variants of the same car model are priced roughly Rs 1 lakh cheaper than their diesel variant, car buyers must check their saving in terms of monthly EMI if they buy a petrol car and compare that expense with the saving on running cost.
In case of Maruti Suzuki DZire the petrol variant (VXI) is cheaper than the diesel variant (VDI) by  Rs 1,07,330 and therefore the EMI on a 5-year loan at 11 per cent rate of interest for a diesel car is higher by 2,334 (considering a constant down payment).
In case of Hyundai Verna SX the ex-showroom price of the diesel variant in New Delhi is higher by Rs 1,18,139 and in this case the EMI for a diesel car would be higher by Rs 2,568.
Going ahead with the example of Maruti DZire, once the EMI expense is ascertained, one must now check the average monthly run on the car and arrive at monthly fuel expense by taking into account the car continued…

More than a week after she went missing from the lawns of India Gate, three-year-old Jahnvi has been found and united with her family.
The girl who went missing on September 28 was seen by some locals near a Gurdwara in Mayapuri area of West Delhi on Sunday evening. According to sources, the child had a board around her neck which read: “This is Jahnvi, missing from her home, someone please unite her with her family.”
According to police, a call was received at the control room around 9 p.m. about a girl resembling Jahnvi being traced in Mayapuri. Upon receiving this information they brought the child to the local police station and gave a call to Jahnvi’s parents. Her parents on reaching the police station confirmed that it was their daughter.
Police have so far not given any information on how the girl reached there and what happened to her in the past one week. “This is too early to say anything about where the child went and what happened to her. We are carrying out investigation and will take suitable action,” said a senior police officer.
The girl Jahnvi Ahuja had come to India Gate with her parents and two siblings on September 28 evening and was last seen in the CCTV footage at 9.21 pm. After searching for her for a couple of hours, Jahnvi’s parents had called the police.
The girl’s family had taken to social media, including Facebook and Twitter to seek help to find Jahnvi.
Posts on the two social networking sites carried the missing girl’s photographs along with the caption, “Call on this number if u get any clue about her - Rakesh Ahuja 9540098859”.
This is also part of a campaign ‘Bring Back Jahnvi'’ on Facebook. Apart from these, thousands of posters regarding the missing girl had been put up across the city.

Business Journalists Rush to Rescue Chevron From Its Ecuador DisasterReposted from Eye on the Amazon (by @kevinmkoenig )
On the run from a landmark $9.5 billion judgment in Ecuador, fighting enforcement actions in three countries that threaten strategic company assets, and gearing up for make-or-break appellate hearings does not bode well for the prospects of Chevron CEO John Watson and his management team.
No worries. Chevron got a little help from its friends in the corporate media last week. The resulting echo chamber is a startling reminder that, like the big banks, Chevron is considered by many to be too big to fail. It is clear that business journalists will come out of the woodwork to defend the company from attacks on their own kind, even if the truth about Chevron's human rights violations is sacrificed in the process.
The lawsuit brought by Ecuadorian rainforest communities against the oil giant is seen not only as a singular threat to Chevron's bottom line, but a historic symbol for corporate accountability. This is an unwelcome message to the oil-industrial complex which assumes that environmental damage and human rights abuses can be externalized and that justice can be so delayed that affected communities will never receive the redress or remediation they deserve. After all, Chevron has vowed to fight the Ecuadorians "until hell freezes over, and then we'll fight it out on the ice."
In a case like this with global implications for the environment, human rights, and corporate accountability, it's telling to see who Chevron's bedfellows are.
Over the 21 years of the Aguinda v. Chevron litigation, the list runs long. It includes people and institutions that have run to the company's defense, or outright done its dirty work -- Ecuadorian government officials, military, judges, junk scientists, convicted felons, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the U.S. Embassy in Ecuador , among others.
We can now add a trifecta of reporters to that list -- two of whom have just published new books. These reporters have swallowed Chevron's narrative raw and whole. Sadly, this is not so surprising, coming as they do from Fortune Magazine, Businessweek, and American Lawyer (the latter considered the right wing litigation bible of corporate America) Roger Parloff, Paul Barrett, and Michael Goldhaber respectively, have been tripping over themselves to promote their books and articles, referencing, cross-referencing, citing, quoting, and linking to each other, to dizzying, albeit deceitful effect.
Let's focus on Paul Barrett of Businessweek, whose book "Law of the Jungle" (get it, there's no law in the jungle. Ha!), is a pro-Chevron tour de farce of the Aguinda v. Chevron litigation, as well as Chevron's countersuit using the RICO statute in New York Federal Court. He plays lip service to one of the indigenous leaders who lost two children due to oil contamination and builds up U.S. lawyer Steven Donziger, only to then take him and his clients down using Chevron's deceitful narrative. The majority of Barrett's book is written as if he spent extensive time on the ground in Ecuador, and was at many of the events described. However, he wasn't.
Barrett watched the documentary film, Crude, by Joe Berlinger. He then wrote as if he was standing right there in front of toxic waste pits, or in the judge's office, or at the hotel preparing Emergildo Criollo for the shareholders meeting. It's a deceitful tactic that purports to lend "jungle cred" to Barrett, as if his book is some kind of in-depth investigation from the sweaty Amazon court room or next to rusting Chevron pipelines that siphon off overflowing oil sludge into streams below, to be drunk later by unsuspecting villagers downriver.
Watching another journalist's film is no substitute for actual reporting. The reality is that Barrett spent precious little time in the Ecuadorian rainforest -- two weeks at most. He did not speak to the lawyers for the communities, let alone Donziger, for the book. He never attended even a day of the trial. Barrett speaks no Spanish, so a thorough review of the 200,000 plus Ecuadorian trial record was out of the question. Ultimately, the book is mostly taken from Chevron's legal briefs.
A revealing example of Barrett's pro-Chevron bias occurs in Chapter Two. He begins by describing an entire scene from the film Crude as if he were there. As evidence of his simple acquiescence to Chevron's arguments, Barrett uses Chevron's deceptively edited outtakes from the film to paint a sinister scene of Donziger bullying and pressuring a judge. Barrett's citation is as follows:
We're going down to have a little chat with the judge. This is something that you would never do in the United States. But in Ecuador this is how the game is played, it's dirty. We have to - occasionally - use pressure tactics to neutralize their corruption. And today is one of those examples.
Except the actual transcription is as follows:
We're going to confront the judge who we believe is paid by Texaco. We believe he is corrupt, and we're gonna confront him, ah, with - with our suspicions about his corruption and let him know what time it is. And, ah, you know, this is something that you would never do in the United States. I mean, this is something you would, I mean, this is just out of bounds, both in terms of judicial behavior, and what - what lawyers would do. But Ecuador, you know, there's almost no rules here. And this is how the game is played, it's dirty. And, you know, they're playing dirty, we're honest, they're dirty. They play dirty, we have to occasionally use, um, pressure tactics to neutralize their corruption. And today is one of those examples.
Barrett left out the bolded text above, changing the context and intent of what was said into its opposite. That's not reporting; that's hit job journalism.
That is not the only instance where Barrett obfuscates the facts, turning what are decidedly black and white issues into murky grey -- another Chevron tactic. One of the company's trademark products, beside crude, is doubt . Doubt has long been the go-to tool of big business litigators to turn the tables on their adversaries by flipping logic and reason of disciplines like epidemiology on its head. The intentional manipulation of facts creates just enough second guessing of the dangers of chemicals and toxins to allow said guilty company off the hook.
This tactic was used by Chevron in the Ecuador case. What about the causation between sick communities and the waste pits they live on top of? Well, hydrocarbons aren't necessarily toxic, claims Chevron. According to Chevron's Manager of Global Issues and Policy, Silvia Garrigo in an interview with 60 Minutes :
"I have makeup on, and there's naturally occurring oil on my face. Doesn't mean that I'm going to get sick from it."
Interesting though, that when you enter a gasoline station in California there's a sign disclosing that your mere presence at the pump could expose you to carcinogens. But in Ecuador's Amazon, you can live on top of a Chevron waste pit and any causality link to carcinogens is questioned.
Barrett avoids the truly scandalous and criminal examples of Chevron's tactics to hide contamination during the Ecuador trial, like swapping toxic soil samples with clean ones, and avoiding sampling at depths at which Chevron knew contamination existed, at locations Chevron knew were still contaminated, and were downgradient from known contamination. You'd think that a book purportedly covering the largest environmental litigation in history would merit a real review of the evidence, much of which was provided by even the skewed soil and water samples taken by the company.
Other corrupt and illegal acts that were Chevron's standard practice during the Ecuador trial are glanced over or omitted by Barrett. This includes the company's successful cancellation of a judicial inspection of a major toxic site through collaboration with the Ecuadorian military to produce a phony security threat. Perhaps most audaciously, Barrett fails to adequately mention a sting operation where Chevron employees posed as remediation contractors in an attempt to entrap the presiding judge.
Barrett also overlooks all the arguments that render Chevron's fraud claims ridiculous. If the trial was marred by fraud, why hasn't Chevron filed an action to nullify the judgment under the fraud protection statute in Ecuadorian courts? Three layers of Ecuadorian courts -- eight appellate judges -- reviewed and upheld the $9 billion verdict, and threw out Chevron's claims of fraud . But for Barrett, apparently U.S. courts are the only legitimate court system in the world. Barrett lets Judge Kaplan off the hook for his colonial overreach in judging a country's legal system that he knows nothing about. Kaplan can't read the native language, nor did he read the trial record. On top of that, Barrett seems unconcerned that Chevron's star witness received some $300,000 in payments for his testimony, plus a new life for him and his family in the United States, thanks to a Chevron financed and supported asylum bid. Even Kaplan called it a corporate witness protection plan.
Not only does Barrett's bias show throughout the book, his extracurricular activities lay bare his leanings. On July 20, 2014, Barrett joined Chevron and its legal team from Gibson, Dunn, and Crutcher for a Congressional subcommittee hearing organized by Chevron lobbyists on Latin American democracy. Alongside a Chevron lawyer, and a representative from the American Enterprise Institute, Barrett played the role of expert on Latin America, lamenting Chevron's legal plight in the country jurisdiction of its choosing, without irony.
So what we're left with is a book that's a copy-paste job from Chevron's legal briefs and reads as if the case, and the plight of the affected communities, is over. Peter Maass, author of the book "Crude World: The Violent Twilight of Oil," reviewed Barrett's book for Outside Magazine, and concluded: "There are two sides to the story of the biggest environmental lawsuit ever, but a new book tells only one of them."
Parloff, Barrett, and Goldhaber are quick to claim that from the outset they had high hopes for the Ecuadorian villagers. They had hope that U.S. courts could be used to hold corporations accountable for human rights violations abroad. But given the overwhelming evidence against Chevron, we have to seriously question these claims. Two of the pillars of American business reporting, and a conservative legal magazine hoped that the Ecuadorian rainforest communities who procured the largest environmental judgment in history from the second largest U.S. oil company would prevail? That's doubtful. The reporters have held on to that story merely to give the appearance of objectivity and to reinforce their framework claiming Chevron as the true victim. Immediately after publishing a number of articles, their "journalist" buddies began chiming in. Thus, the pro-Chevron feedback loop was set in motion.
For example, after Barrett's book launched on Sept. 23, Joe Nocera, a columnist for The New York Times, wrote a piece about Barrett's account. Nocera unquestioningly sides with Barrett and Chevron, while failing to mention that his wife's law firm represented Chevron in a discovery matter directly related to the Ecuador litigation. Shouldn't a journalist cite such an obvious conflict of interest?
Then cue Debra Saunders, the "token conservative" columnist for the San Francisco Chronicle. Saunders writes an article the next day about Nocera's article about Barrett's book. Feeling dizzy?
Saunders ends her piece quoting Nocera, with an alleged quote from Donziger, excerpted from the movie Crude, and edited and used by Chevron during the RICO trial. The quote is this: "Facts do not exist. Facts are created." Sounds incriminating, right? Except Donziger goes on to say, "...and you talk to Texaco, because they create facts. Texaco creates facts. They create standards. ... That's what I am saying. They create fiction."
This is how the Chevron media echo chamber continues to feed itself. A book repeats Chevron's flawed arguments during the RICO trial almost verbatim, which produces articles and reviews of the book, which then produces yet more articles about articles about the book -- all recycling and reinforcing Chevron's false and misleading narrative. The great irony is that Nocera, Saunders, and Barrett and the others accuse Donziger of trying the case in the media, when in fact it's Chevron and its minions who continue to prop up the company's crumbling house of cards in the court of public opinion, because its legal case is meritless.
We all know that a good "David vs. Goliath" story sells. But what sells better is the 'Hero's fall from grace' frame that Chevron's defenders are pushing about Donziger. Except, the demonize Donziger narrative is not new. In fact, it's been part of Chevron's playbook long before the New York RICO trial began
Enter Sam Singer, from Chevron's PR firm Singer and Associates. Singer is not merely Chevron Apologist-in-Chief; he's a long time Bay Area PR hit man who prides himself on cleaning up the image of his corporate clients. He's like the "Wolf" in Pulp Fiction -- the guy you call to clean up your mess, hide the bodies, or whatever other unmentionables are needed. A recent piece in SF Weekly , "Trust Me: Who Are you Gonna Believe, San Singer or Your Own Eyes?" exposes Singer and his tactics:
When your workspace is engulfed in flames; when your mistress threatens to reveal your illegitimate family; when your restaurant serves up E. coli burgers; when your employees inadvertently kill a young child; when a wild beast rampages through your place of business - you better call Sam Singer. "When things go bump in the night," assures Singer, "we are there."
"The truth, after all, isn't exactly Singer's milieu. His mission is to push 'the facts as our clients see them,'" writes Joe Eskenazi for the Weekly. That's what Singer does for Chevron.
According to internal Chevron emails with Singer, the plan was to target Donziger from the get go. Singer's strategy was to paint Ecuador "as the next major threat to America" like Iran or a "Cuban missile crisis in the making" and Donziger as "the most powerful man in Ecuador, pulling the strings of an emerging banana republic." Indeed, another Chevron strategist in an internal memo to colleagues was more blunt, noting that the company's [long-term] strategy is to demonize Donziger."
But even Singer and Chevron's strategy was wearing thin after Donziger and the Ecuadorians proved more resilient that Chevron thought possible. A recent article in Rolling Stone was a turning point, finally putting the spotlight on Chevron's phony narrative and the vacuousness of its arguments for anyone willing to look past Chevron's talking points. Despite this, Parloff, Barrett, and Goldhaber have been quick to take up the slack.
In the meantime, Chevron was unhappy with the unfavorable coverage it continued to receive in Richmond, California, home to the company's largest and oft exploding refinery. Richmond's mayor traveled to Ecuador to tour Chevron's toxic legacy and saw firsthand the company's impact on the rainforest and human health. Since then, she has been a vocal critic of Chevron's disaster in Ecuador. Combined with coverage of a controversial $1 billion refinery expansion plan and Chevron dumping $1.6m into local elections , there was little positive traction for the company in the local press. What was Chevron to do? If you can't influence the media, become the media!
Thus, the Richmond Standard was born. A Chevron-funded daily, the Richmond Standard is an Orwellian extension of the corporate media. An LA Times piece by Michael Hiltzik titled, "A Chevron PR website pretends to be an objective news source," explains:
This is what the news business has come to in communities where economics have wiped out traditional local newspapers. Self-interested corporations have stepped into the vacuum. You'd be hard-pressed to find a case as flagrant as Richmond's.
As the Financial Times describes it:
The Richmond Standard is one of the more polished sites to emerge in the age of hyper-local digital news brands such as Patch and DNAinfo.com. That may be because it is run and funded by Chevron, the $240bn oil group which owns the Richmond refinery that in August 2012 caught fire, spewing plumes of black smoke over the city and sending more than 15,000 residents to hospital for medical help.
The only writer for the "paper" is an account executive for Singer and Associates, Mike Aldax. According to Aldax, "my function is to report the news you're not seeing in Richmond." Translation: pro-Chevron stories. Hiltzik reports:
Aldax says Chevron doesn't review or edit his stories, but it doesn't have to. It provides his paycheck, and even subconscious self-censorship can undermine news gathering - especially if one defines news as information its subject doesn't want the public to know.
According to Singer, the Richmond Standard has at least found some support. "The rappers...They love us!"
For Chevron and the Ecuador case, there's no need to bypass corporate media when you have Parloff, Goldhaber, and Barrett. As the company's prime cheerleaders, they give voice and credibility to Chevron's recycled claims that were rejected by Ecuadorian courts. Meanwhile, the voices of indigenous and farming communities, who continue to suffer on the ground in Ecuador, are largely drowned out in the U.S. These three pro-business American reporters give cover to Chevron's board of directors whose oversight of the liability has been called out by its own shareholders. Parloff, Goldhaber, and Barrett help immunize CEO John Watson who, as Chief Architect for the Texaco acquisition, has let the Ecuador issue come to define the company, while the liability has ballooned into the billions. And they've wrongly lifted the spirits of Chevron's stockholders who are led to believe that the issue is over.
But here's the rub. Chevron never intended to file a RICO suit, nor did Watson ever think it would get this far. The company's strategy has always been to outlast and out-resource the Ecuadorian communities and their legal team. It was Judge Kaplan who, presented with edited outtakes from the movie Crude that Chevron now admits were not properly translated or did not include the full transcript, asked, "does RICO play here at all?" A U.S. federal judge suggested that Chevron ought to file RICO charges, and the company quickly obliged. Kaplan navigated Chevron and its legal team through the trial, and issued a ridiculous verdict ripe to be overruled.
Which is why, during the four years in the run up to and during the trial, Chevron has sought to eviscerate the plaintiffs, their legal counsel, their funders, NGOs, or anyone who has ever dared to support the communities. The company hoped to outlast Donziger and the plaintiffs in a resource and PR battle, because they know exactly how hard it is to win the case on the merits. Ironically, given the tremendous amount of resources and time Chevron has invested in its scorched earth strategy, the communities and their counsel are not only still alive, they are in a remarkably good position.
The seven-week bench trial that Kaplan presided over -- and that Parloff, Goldhaber, and Barrett sat through -- may have generated back slaps and high-fives from San Ramon to Midland, Texas. But it was never built to last. Which is why, at least according to the rumor mill, Chevron is looking for an exit strategy. The company likely hopes the Ecuadorian government will play a role in its hoped-for rescue.
With a panel from the Second Circuit Court of Appeals looming over the company, Watson has reason to be worried.. The last time the Second Circuit had a crack at Judge Kaplan, it vacated his preliminary injunction in the case almost immediately. It was also an embarrassing public depantsing of Gibson Dunn lawyer Randy Mastro, who was literally laughed out of court. Don't expect to see Randy making the oral arguments this time.
But before the Second Circuit hearing, another critical hearing is slated for December. In Canada, the country's Supreme Court will hear arguments on whether the Ecuadorian communities can indeed go after Chevron's massive assets as a way of enforcing their judgment. These are major, make-or-break hearings for Chevron. But you wouldn't know that by reading the work of Parloff, Barrett, or Goldhaber. These three gringos who have been guzzling Chevron's Kool-Aid for the last four years may very soon wake with a hangover of a lifetime.

The right to medicines in a world of stock-outslaws
Access to essential medicines in the public health system cannot be a service that the state voluntarily undertakes; it must be considered an undeniable right of every Indian
India is widely recognised as the pharmacy of the developing world thanks to its generic drugs manufacturing sector. Yet, ironically, it often fails to provide necessary drugs to its own population. Several States across India have been reporting that essential HIV drugs, especially nevirapine, have gone out of stock. This is deplorable considering we supply affordable HIV drugs globally and save millions of lives but have somehow managed a stock-out at home.
Drug shortages are common in India and rarely make news. A stock-out of essential HIV drugs, however, is nothing short of a crisis; it is one that has parallels in previous stock-outs and raises many questions. What causes drug stock-outs? Who is responsible and accountable for them? Where do the poor go when they need these drugs? Finally, what are the implications of these stock-outs on the control of infectious diseases such as HIV and TB?
A culture of neglect
Let’s consider how stock-outs happen. Contrary to popular perception, the government is designed to be a competent machinery with detailed systems in place to avoid such crisis. Drug stocks in the public health system are meant to be regularly monitored and the suppliers should be kept in the loop about future requirements. Hence all drug stock-outs are created — either out of neglect or out of self-interest. No drug stock-out is ever an unanticipated one. Who then is responsible for these stock-outs? It’s rarely an individual but usually a result of actions (or inactions) by a group or the entire system. A drug stock-out requires some negligence, compliance and efforts by all actors. For one, it requires the purposeful ignoring of well-structured systems of reporting on drug stocks. It also demands continued delays in forecasting and planning. Finally, there must be extensive procrastination or delay in procurements.
This points to several systemic weaknesses that are difficult but essential to address. There is a culture of neglect where the health establishment is geared for minimal action to disturb the status quo. There is also a deeply ingrained mindset of mutual protection. Despite a looming crisis, people within the system rarely raise an alarm. The matter only reaches a head when word gets out to the media or someone senior calls for explanations. Until then the system protects itself while poor patients wait for the health system to deliver.
Where then do the poor go when they do not receive drugs? They have two options — they can wait and suffer or they go to the private sector. Truthfully, this is not really a choice. It’s well-known that a large number of patients seek care in the private sector only due to the overburdened and patient-unfriendly nature of the public sector. So, those who seek care in the public sector either cannot afford to go to the private sector or have already been exploited by it.
This raises the critical question of the government’s role as the primary provider of drugs and services to the poorest. This extensive power seems to come with little accountability. The issue also has legal and ethical implications: how can the state put lives of patients with HIV at risk by not making essential drugs available? Patients suffering from TB and HIV also suffer extensive physical, psychological, social and economic consequences of these diseases. These diseases impact income, raise expenses and often push families into debt. By not providing appropriate and timely treatment, the government is further acerbating their suffering and also limiting their ability to build constructive lives.
Implications for disease control
A stock-out also has significant implications for disease control. Unplanned HIV treatment interruptions lead to increased risk resistance to HIV drugs, failure of treatment, and death. Similarly, a TB patient without drugs can become drug-resistant and infectious. Imagine a TB patient in a crowded slum — coughing and transmitting the disease. Stock-outs also significantly reduce the patient’s trust in the system and makes retention of patients more difficult. Undoubtedly, these stock-outs represent a lack of appropriate governance and accountability within the health system. With new leadership in the Health Ministry, addressing stock-outs should be a top priority. This should be followed by immediate remedial action to ensure that these crises do not recur in any form in the future.
At the same time, it’s also important that we as a people seek accountability for our right to free quality health services. Despite political posturing, the idea of Universal Health Coverage remains elusive and continues to lack political commitment and resources. Neglect by successive governments has resulted in the growth of an unregulated and exploitative private sector which has become the primary provider of health services to Indians. It is ethically and morally untenable that the state can renege on its duty to provide the poor and vulnerable health care, particularly medicines under the public sector. It violates human rights and all notions of justice and empathy. Access to essential medicines in the public health system cannot be a service that the state voluntarily undertakes; it must be considered an undeniable right of every Indian.

Ukrainian politicians learn to roll with the punches -- even when cake is thrown at themBy Casey Capachi October 4 Follow @caseycapachi
Tensions in Ukraine reached a high point this summer with members of the public lashing out at their leaders over policy decisions and sometimes coming to blows. (Casey Capachi/The Washington Post)
While reports indicate that the conflict in Ukraine has settled into  a calmer, albeit still violent, pace , public discontent surrounding policy decisions this summer rose to heated levels against Ukrainian politicians.
Thursday's event, in which Oleh Makhnitsky, an aide to Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, hid behind a conference table while cakes were thrown in his direction by hooded men, marked the latest in a string of recent outbursts.
"You see how much popularity I have gained. I'm even happy about that!" Makhnitsky said to reporters after regaining his composure at the podium, cake crumbs still splattered across the stage.
But perhaps no Ukrainian politician learned what his constituents thought of his policy quite the way parliament member Vitaly Zhuravsky did. On Sept. 16, he was tossed into a dumpster by an angry mob and held down as more trash was thrown on top of him. Zhuravsky has taken a strong stance on anti-government protests in the past.
And it's not just the public coming after politicians with clenched fists: Lawmakers are punching each other out, too.
After being referred to as a "pot-bellied fatty" by parliament member Oleh Lyashko during a dispute, Oleksandr Shevchenko hit his colleague in the head in front of members of the media.
In Ukraine, parliamentary action takes on a whole new meaning.

When in legal trouble  say Ram JethmalaniWhen in legal trouble, remember Ram Jethmalani
Avantika Mehta , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, October 05, 2014
First Published: 13:28 IST(5/10/2014) | Last Updated: 00:47 IST(6/10/2014)
From London to Chennai to Karnataka high court to secure bail for former Tamil Nadu chief minister J Jayalalithaa is all in a day’s work for lawyer Ram Jethmalani.
 
Ignore the landing of the overnight flight at 1.30am, the one-hour trip to the hotel and the jet lag, 92-year-old Jethmalani was in court 10.30am sharp on September 30 to fight for his client.
File photo: Jethmalani leaves the special CBI court in Ahmedabad, with his son Mahesh Jethmalani, after representing Amit Shah in a case of alleged fake police encounter that lead to the death of Sohrabuddin Sheikh. (AFP photo)
Exhausting schedules are for lesser mortals to crib about, not him.
 
Jethmalani did not have his way with the court and his move for an urgent hearing was criticised by both legal pundits and lawyers.
 
“Lawyers, for fabulous fees or otherwise, must not be rushed into filing petitions and applications that cannot realistically be granted,” wrote Supreme Court advocate Sanjay Hedge.
 
Jethmalani shoots back, “The accused has the right to apply for bail as soon as possible.” With his famed sharp humour, he adds, “Tell those people someday they’ll be convicted, and they’ll do the same.”
 
On charging exorbitant fees, he tells HT, “Yes, I am charging Jayalalithaa. But I fight many cases pro bono. All in all, I make money from 10% of my clients.”
 
Apart from his legal acumen, his rise to fame began as the maverick lawyer in sensational cases such as the Nanavati murder trial.
 
Jayalalithaa has joined a long list of controversial clients, but he insists they approach him and he’s constrained by law to take briefs. “It’s a basic principal of law that everyone, no matter who, deserves a defense.”
 
While Jethmalani’s client list reads like India’s who’s who and he is the arguably the only advocate recognised by every Indian, this fame comes at a price.
 
Former high court judge RS Sodhi recalls, “When I asked him to fight Indira Gandhi’s alleged assassin Balbir Singh’s case, he was a BJP member. He gave up his membership, but not the case.”
 
Senior advocate Kamini Jayaswal who fought with him to defend SAR Geelani in the case arising out of the 2001 Parliament attack said she was “disturbed” by his decision to fight for Manu Sharma who was accused of murdering Jessica Lal in 1999.
 
Unfazed, Jethmalani always adheres to his conscience. “If taking up an unpopular cause will result unpopularity, so be it.”
 
This unflinching belief in the law’s wisdom is a part of Jethmalani’s upbringing as a third generation litigator. “My grandfather was a great lawyer. It’s in my blood.”
 
A student of Karachi Law School, he passed the Bar examination at 17. Then he had to argue before court to have a special provisio enacted to be allowed to practice at a time when 21 was the standard age for enrollment into the Bar.
 
His dogged love for the judicial system is also the reason why he is “an inspiration and a tough act to follow”, his son and senior advocate Mahesh Jethmalani says.
 
The public fascination with the senior lawyer, however, goes beyond his achievements in the courtroom.
 
He wakes up early to enjoy a game of badminton, eats some fruit, usually works through lunch while drinking buttermilk, and for dinner, “I take my two whiskeys, and occasionally a little bit of ice cream.”
 
Jethmalani has often been punished for his unabashed love for the finer things in life. In 1977, he started his career as a Parliamentarian by winning a Lok Sabha seat. However, he was not made law minister because Prime Minister Morarji Desai disapproved of his ‘lifestyle’.
 
It is possible Desai remembered having his lecture on celibacy interrupted by a young, blunt lawyer’s scathing words — “Morarjibhai, had my wife looked like Gajraben (Morarji's wife), I'd have turned celibate at eighteen.”
 
Jethmalani’s acerbic wit and unforgiving honesty are the stuff of legends. Often, he is blunt before people who, spoilt by power and privilege, aren’t used to truthful opinions.
 
During the Emergency, he was forced to leave the country under threat of arrest for speaking out against Indira Gandhi. More recently, he reportedly told a Supreme Court Judge, “Gone are the days when judges would read.”
 
Most people would be held for contempt, but “Ram floats on higher thermals in the Elysian fields where the normal rules of behaviour of mere mortals hardly apply,” says senior advocate Anil Dewan.
 
Accordingly, his life too is an open book. The many and varied accounts of his romances in the authorised autobiography written by Nalini Gera reveal a softer side. For instance, to converse with a Damascus dancing girl who spoke only Arabic, Jethmalani enrolled in language classes.
 
Jethmalani’s romanticism extends beyond his personal life. Expelled from the Bharatiya Janata Party, he still came out in full support of the Narendra Modi government. Yet, he declined Prime Minister Modi’s invitation to attend his swearing-in ceremony. “I told him I didn’t want to meet others who I didn’t like.”
 
He admits that a large part of his support for the present regime was to oust the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA), which he describes as “that corrupt government.”
 
His next move? “To bring back the black money to India.” He wishes the government would extend more support to this cause.
 
For now, though, he sits surrounded by a mountain of papers, preparing for Jayalalithaa’s next bail plea hearing on October 7.

Microsoft makes more money from Samsung than from Skype  Windows Phone  and Xbox combinedMicrosoft's own phones aren't getting it anywhere.(Reuters/Gustau Nacarino)

Android—the most widely-used mobile operating system in the world made by Google—actually owes a lot to patents owned by its erstwhile rival, Microsoft. There has been a lot of speculation about just how much Microsoft makes from royalty fees from Android handset users like Samsung and HTC. A glimpse was revealed when Microsoft said in a legal filing that Samsung, the biggest Android phonemaker in the world, paid the software maker more than $1 billion a year to use its technology in Samsung phones.
To put that into perspective, that is more than the $848 million that Microsoft made last year in operating income in its Entertainment and Devices Division, which includes the Xbox console—including Kinect and Xbox Live internet gaming network—as well as online video-calling service Skype, and its Windows Phone line. Samsung’s fees also compare favorably to Microsoft’s search engine Bing and the MSN Network. That division made a loss of $1.3 billion last year.
Another way to put that in perspective—Microsoft makes more from Samsung in a year than Apple won in court after famously suing Samsung in California over violating its patents. And that doesn’t include the money that Microsoft makes from the other Android phone manufacturers. As the Wall Street Journal reported, the filing that revealed the $1 billion figure was previously redacted and included in documents in court, where Microsoft is accusing Samsung of failing to honor a 2011 patent-licensing agreement.
How much is Android actually based on Microsoft technology? When the Chinese ministry of commerce approved Microsoft’s purchase of Nokia in April, Microsoft said the authorities “concluded after its investigation that Microsoft holds approximately 200 patent families that are necessary to build an Android smartphone.”

Chinese troops play symbolic role in Hong Kong drama over democracyChinese troops play symbolic role in Hong Kong drama over democracy
Reuters
Hong Kong, October 05, 2014
First Published: 18:38 IST(5/10/2014)

Major General Tan Benhong, the commander of the People's Liberation Army in Hong Kong, was a picture of uniformed calm as he shared champagne toasts with Chinese officials on Wednesday at local celebrations marking China's national day.
The streets surrounding the bash at the Hong Kong Convention Centre presented a starkly different scene as thousands of protesters escalated the most sustained push for full democracy since China took Hong Kong back from Britain in 1997.
As the protests enter their second week amid fresh signs of street violence, some demonstrators and ordinary Hong Kong citizens fear Tan's troops could eventually be ordered to crush a movement unthinkable on the mainland.
Thorny political, legal and strategic realities make any such involvement of the PLA exceptionally difficult, however, and Hong Kong's 27,000-strong police force is expected to remain in charge for the time being.
Government advisers and experts believe leaders in both Beijing and Hong Kong understand the immense political costs of ordering the PLA out of their barracks, ending at a stroke Hong Kong's vaunted autonomy under the "one country-two systems" formula under which Britain agreed to hand over the Asian financial hub.
Foreign diplomats are monitoring developments closely, noting moves in recent months to upgrade PLA facilities in Hong Kong and unconfirmed reports of anti-riot drills being staged at both urban and rural bases.
The garrison comprises between 8,000 to 10,000 personnel, mostly infantry troops, spread between bases across the border in Shenzhen and in Hong Kong, envoys estimate. It includes a small naval and air-force attachment. 
"I think that (Hong Kong) policymakers at the highest level ... are fully aware in that if the PLA were deployed, in the eyes of the world it would be the end of one country-two systems," Regina Ip, an adviser to embattled Hong Kong leader Leung Chun-ying and a former security chief, told Reuters.
"It would cause tremendous damage," she said, noting that the local government officials had repeatedly stressed that local police - equipped with paramilitary anti-riot units - were fully capable of dealing with the unfolding situation.
A Hong Kong-based mainland security academic said he believed Beijing was also acutely aware of the risks of using the PLA in Hong Kong.
"I am sure the leadership in Beijing knows that any such involvement would involve massive political costs," he said, speaking on condition of anonymity given the sensitivity of discussing PLA operations.
"For that reason, the PLA in Hong Kong is maintained largely as a symbolic presence."
RISE OF RED NEON STAR
Foreign diplomats watching developments remain unsure of the precise political threshold that must be crossed for Beijing to unleash the troops.
Their presence in Hong Kong, after all, has been one of the most sensitive elements of the handover, fuelled by deep local memories of the 1989 army crackdown on protesting students in and around Tiananmen Square in Beijing - an event still commemorated annually in the city.
The Chinese military is housed in 19 urban and rural sites inherited after the British folded up the Union Jack on what had been a major military staging post of the British empire and a vital Cold War-era listening post.The bases, dotted strategically across Hong Kong island, Kowloon and the New Territories, include the old British Tamar headquarters building in Admiralty, now next door to the government's new offices - and the epicentre of the current demonstrations.

The building was recently refurbished, along with other sites, and is now topped with a red neon star. Most of its offices are thought to be occupied, some for the first time.
A large domed surveillance camera sits perched above a corner over one of the main thoroughfares leading to Hong Kong's glittering Central financial district.
Both Asian and Western envoys say they have spotted a lot more activity both at the headquarters and other sites over the last year. Unmarked black SUV vehicles sporting military number plates are now a common sight on city streets.
"We are just not yet sure whether the activity is related to the Hong Kong situation, or reflects China's broader military build-up," one Asian envoy said.
The garrison did not respond to questions from Reuters.
   
MAINLAND SOLDIERS KEEP TO THEMSELVES  
The PLA's presence is controlled by Hong Kong's mini-constitution, the Basic Law, which states the garrison must not "interfere" in the city's affairs but that Hong Kong's leaders can request its help to keep order or handle disasters.
They must abide by local laws, which are governed by an independent judiciary, in contrast to the mainland legal system.
Other parts of the Basic Law echo mainland laws and appear to allow for the standing committee of China's parliament, the National People's Congress (NPC), to deploy the garrison if a state of war or emergency is declared for Hong Kong.
Under the Basic Law, the NPC would need to be satisfied that there was enough "turmoil" to endanger "national unity or security" and was "beyond control of the (Hong Kong) government".
"Ultimately I think it would have to be pretty extreme to invoke those provisions and call in the garrison," said Hong Kong University law professor Simon Young. "We're really talking complete collapse of government control or civil war."
One foreign envoy said the laws were written with enough leeway for Beijing to "create a narrative under which deployment becomes imperative".
Read: Deadline looms for Hong Kong protesters
The mainland law covering the garrison does not allow soldiers in Hong Kong to belong to local political, social or religious organisations. None are recruited locally. They are kept on base where they are effectively isolated from Hong Kong's freewheeling society and media.
British troops enjoyed far more freedoms, and filled the city's bar districts on nights off. Other than occasional open-days, there is very little interaction between the PLA and the Hong Kong community.
And unlike the British forces in Hong Kong, the PLA command is kept at arms length from the local government, liaising via its civilian-run security bureau.
There is no joint police-army operational wing as in the colonial era, when the chief of British forces also served on the governor's executive council, effectively his cabinet.
Foreign envoys note that the garrison appears largely geared for internal security, rather than repelling foreign invasions.
Relatively lightly-armed, the garrison's chief weapons are lightly armoured WZ523 personnel carriers, equipped with machine guns and suitable for Hong Kong's tight and congested streets.
Internal security was stressed, too, when Major-General Tan led the toasts during cocktails with foreign diplomats, local officials and police as well as mainland government officials and businessmen to mark the 87th anniversary of the PLA's founding on July 31.
It was something of a coming out party for Tan, who had just arrived in Hong Kong after commanding military forces on the strategically important Hainan Island in the South China Sea.

The 57-year-old has also served in elite Second Artillery command that controls China's conventional and nuclear missiles, and earlier did a spell as garrison chief-of-staff in Hong Kong.
He has said he would command jointly with his political commissar, the more senior Lieutenant General Yue Shixin, a signal of the importance Beijing places on the political dimension of the garrison's Hong Kong role.
The PLA, he told the gathering, had a long tradition of ensuring China's internal stability and security.
"It was a very short, blunt speech," said one observer. "Then there was all this Russian-style martial music blaring away. It was hardly the usual Hong Kong cocktail party."

Maharashtra polls: After Amit Shah  PM Modi lauds Pankaja Munde  backs her leadership14
0
Aurangabad: In a significant political development, Prime Minister Narendra Modi after his massive rally in Beed asked Pankaja Munde Palave to undertake state-wide campaign hinting that she may be the future leader of the state.
Modi kicked off his first rally from Beed to pay homage to the departed leader Gopinath Munde. Modi appreciated the huge gathering organised by the young daughter of late Munde. A day before the PM's rally, the BJP president Amit Shah announced that she will be the state leader of the OBC's. It is notable that after the sudden death of Munde, there was a void in the BJP leadership. Munde had a strong base in Maharashtra. As far as Marathwada region is concerned, his death dealt a severe blow to the BJP.
Although, there are many leaders like the state BJP president, Devendra Padnavis, the state opposition leader, Eknath Khadase and Vinod Tavade, all lack the leadership skills and mass appeal like Munde. However, with the launch of 'Sanghgarsh Yatra' which was led by Pankaja there has been a huge positive response to the BJP. Though, Pankaja is a political novice, she possesses the qualities of a politician and very eloquent. According to some political observers, Pankaja may be elevated by the Prime Minister Modi in the coming days.
According to some political observers, Pankaja may be elevated by the Prime Minister Modi in the coming days.

On the other hand, with his speech on Saturday, the Prime Minister gave a clear cut signal that he was not at all in favor of alliance with the Shiv Sena. Modi was advocating for the majority for the BJP in the state without any alliance. The campaign of Modi seems to have attracted those people who do not have any prior political affiliations. Moreover, Modi's working style and ideas for a new progressive India appears to be getting a positive response from the youth and this may work in favor of BJP gaining votes of the younger generation. It is very apparent that at present, the BJP lacks a strong hold in the state compared to Shiv Sena and if at all the party gains victory in the state if will be only because of the Modi-factor.
In contrast to this, Congress seems to have left with no more influential orators to compete with the rising young leaders of BJP in the election campaign who can attract the voters.

Era of alliances over  want full majority: Narendra Modi in MaharashtraBJP
(NCP chief Sharad Pawar chose…)
GONDIA (MAHARASHTRA): Stating that the era of poll alliances was over, Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged the people of Maharashtra here today to give BJP "a full majority" in the October 15 Assembly elections.
Accusing the Congress-NCP regime of "looting" the state, Modi said both will be equally punished.
"The era of alliances has ended. If you want Maharashtra to progress, then give us full majority," Modi said, addressing an election campaign rally here.
Modi cited examples of adjoining Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh where voters had given the BJP a full majority. "Maharashtra could be the number one state in the country," he said.
NCP chief Sharad Pawar chose the Rajya Sabha route for himself but made Praful Patel a scapegoat and fielded him for Lok Sabha polls, Modi said.
"The Maharashtra Assembly polls will decide the fate of Maharashtra," he said.
Modi observed that the inflation rate has come down for the first time in five years and cited reduction in petrol and diesel prices as important work done by his government.
"Both Congress and NCP have destroyed Maharashtra. Both are equally to blame and both will be equally punished," he said.
"The maximum number of terror acts occur in Maharashtra. After Uttar Pradesh, the maximum communal riots occur in Maharashtra," he said.
Appealing to the Maoists to shun violence and return to the mainstream, Modi said, "Put down guns from your shoulders and put ploughs on your shoulder. You will get relief."
"Return to the mainstream. Stop the bloodshed. Be a partner in the country's progress. Nobody has succeeded through violence," he said.
"To political pundits, I wish to say, look around you and feel the atmosphere. We are going to get a clear majority (in Maharashtra)," he said.
"Sharad Pawar was agriculture minister, but in Maharashtra, 3,700 farmers committed suicide per year. However, Congress and NCP government did not shed tears for them. Such a cruel government never existed anywhere," Modi said.
"Here, we had a chief minister (Prithviraj Chavan) who declined to share the stage with me. How can we work together if such governments are there in Maharashtra," he said.
Modi described LBT as "looto baato tax." "BJP will free you from LBT after being voted to power in Maharashtra," he said.
"Congress people ask me to give them an account of work done by our government. First give me an account of your 60 years of work. After that, ask me the account of my 60 days in office. I am accountable to the people," Modi said.
"Had I been allowed to complete the work of raising the height of the Narmada dam, Maharashtra would have got free electricity worth Rs 400 crore per year," he said.
"Now, I can assure you that the work will be completed in one or two years," he said.
"Their (Congress and NCP) only job was to fill their pockets. They are shameless people. If you want Maharashtra to progress, give the BJP full majority," Modi said.
Modi described the Congress-NCP coalition as a gang which looted the state enchequer.
  He was more offensive against NCP leaders, particularly NCP chief Sharad Pawar as well as Praful Patel who hails from Gondia.
Modi said that Pawar himself did not fight the Lok Sabha polls and managed to enter the Rajya Sabha to "save himself from embarrassment", but Praful Patel has been made a scapegoat.
He said that it was unfortunate that more than 3,700 farmers ended their lives every year when Pawar was the Union Agriculture Minister.
Modi said that Nana Patole, a BJP candidate from Gondia who was elected by a margin of more than two lakh votes defeating Patel, had made frequent requests to him (Modi) to campaign for his candidature, pleading that Patel is a millionaire who spends huge money, "But I told Patole don't bother, you will get elected".
Regretting that he could not make it during the Lok Sabha poll campaign, Modi said that he is in Gondia today to thank the people for reposing faith in the BJP by electing Patole with a huge margin.
Modi said that the plight of tribals in Maharashtra is miserable though a lot of funds are given by the Centre for their welfare and developmental activities, since it never reaches them.
The entire population of the state suffers due to lack of power supply and he blamed the previous Congress led UPA government for its non-cooperation.
He said that the Sardar Sarovar Project on Narmada river required the Centre's permission for the dam's height to be raised, but since 2005, the government refused to concede the Gujarat government's demand.
Had the Congress government at the Centre given a go-ahead, Maharashtra would have got electricity worth Rs 400 crore, he said.
The NCP was born in 1999, but the hands of the clock, which is its election symbol, never moves, Modi said.
Listing the achievements of his government, Modi said that inflation is under control and petrol prices have gone down.
"A government which ruled for 60 years is asking me achievements of 60 days," Modi said.
Modi said that LBT (Local Body Tax) is nothing but "looto baaton tax" (rob and share tax), adding that if the BJP government is voted to power, LBT would be scrapped.
He reiterated his call to the outlawed Maoists to return to the mainstream and give up their armed struggle.
"Don't kill anybody and sprinkle human blood on the ground; instead they should cultivate the fertile land," he said.

Stampede fallout: Patna DM  SSP transferredComments
Under pressure to fix responsibility for the stampede at Gandhi maidan here on Friday that left 33 dead and scores injured, Bihar chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi has axed the entire team of officials comprising the Patna administration.
Late on Sunday, the government formally notified the transfer with immediate effect of Patna divisional commissioner N Vijayalakshmi, DIG Ajitabh Kumar, district magistrate Manish Kumar Verma and SSP Manu Maharaj.
Meanwhile, the Bihar government has 'showcaused' the head of a locally stationed unit of the NDRF for its alleged failure to respond urgently to its 'SOS' after the stampede here on Friday that left 33 dead and scores injured.
Sources cited the transfers as the government's tacit acknowledgement that administrative lapses may have played a hand in the Dussehra evening stampede at the southern exit gate of Gandhi maidan, after the ceremonial slaying of Ravan, that marks the conclusion of festivities.
In all, the government notified the transfer of 11 officers, including five IPS officers.
The decision raised eyebrows, coming as it did, on a Sunday and before the completion of an administrative probe into the incident.

Car sales in Navratri subduedCar sales in Navratri subdued
BS Reporter | Ahmedabad Oct 05, 2014 08:58 PM IST
As the domestic passenger car market is on a slow but steady road to recovery, vehicle sales in the Ahmedabad market during the festive month of Navratri has also seen some traction. According to major dealers in the city, close to about 3,500 cars have been delivered during the last ten days in and around Ahmedabad, the major car market in Gujarat.
The first day of Navratri saw around 1,000 cars delivered, and on the Dussehra day around 1,200-1,500 cars were delivered in and around the city, say dealer sources. The total sales in these ten days is estimated to be around 3,500 cars.
Sukhbir Bagga, director, Group Planet Petal which operates 32 dealerships across the state covering six brands including even two-wheeler brands like Yamaha, said that his chain of dealerships had delivered 250 cars and around 400 two-wheelers on the first day of Navratri and around 270 cars and 500 two wheelers on the last day. "Sales, however, on an year-on-year basis, are up in the range of 5-6 per cent. Demand in the market is growing, but slowly," he explained.
Similar tone echoed in the words of Shashin Shah, the owner of a Hyundai dealership in the city, who said that while there is demand revival, but that is happening in a slow but steady manner. Bagga feels that earlier new variant launches during festive season could boost sales by 50-60 per cent, however, now, buyers are more cautious.
The industry produced a total 1,943,134 vehicles including passenger vehicles, commercial vehicles, three wheelers and two wheelers in August 2014 as against 1,691,699 in August 2013, registering a growth of 14.86 percent over the same month last year.
According to data from the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers' Association (SIAM), the sales of passenger vehicles grew by 4.46 percent in April-August 2014 over the same period last year.
A similar trend has been witnessed in Gujarat, where growth of passenger vehicles has been in single digits so far.

PM Modi should do homework well; Maharashtra ahead of Gujarat: Congress23
0
Mumbai: Claiming that Maharashtra is ahead of Gujarat in terms of development and education, former Union Minister and Congress leader Anand Sharma said Prime Minister Narendra Modi should to do his "homework before saying anything."
Sharma said Modi is "scared" and that is the reason he is holding over 20 rallies in Maharashtra ahead of the Assembly elections.
"Yesterday, Modi said he wants to see Maharashtra ahead of Gujarat. Maharashtra is already far ahead of Gujarat going by the statistics available between year 2000 and 2013. The state has attracted maximum Foreign Direct Investments while Gujarat stood fifth in FDI investment. He should do homework before saying anything," Sharma said on Sunday in a press conference.
Congress leader Anand Sharma said Modi is "scared" and that is the reason he is holding over 20 rallies in Maharashtra ahead of elections.
#maharashtra assembly elections 2014 #maharashtra #congress #narendra modi
"Maharashtra was number 1 in industrialisation when UPA left the charge at the Centre. It is ahead of Gujarat in terms of education, potable water. Gujarat has more number of malnutrition deaths," claimed the former Union Minister in charge of Commerce, Industry and Textiles.
On being asked about over 20 rallies of Modi scheduled in Maharashtra ahead of the state elections on October 15, Sharma said, "It looks like he is scared..."
"First time after Independence we have no separate Defence Minister. Defence Ministry was given to Finance Minister who is not well now," he said.
Modi's "Make In India" initiative was nothing but implementation of policies and plans undertaken by the previous government, he claimed.

Maharashtra elections: Rainstorm washes out PM Modi s Nashik rally5
0
Nashik: Heavy rains accompanied by thunder and lightning washed out Prime Minister Narendra Modi's scheduled election rally on Sunday in this Maharashtra pilgrimage centre.
Modi was expected to reach late on Sunday evening, but the sudden stormy weather created a lot of mud and waterlogging on approach roads to the open ground, the venue of the rally near the city.
Many chairs were tossed about by the gusty winds and some portions of the marquee and stage also were blown away, necessitating cancellation of the rally, a local organizer told media persons.

On Sunday, Modi addressed huge rallies in Sangli, Kolhapur, and Gondiya in eastern Maharashtra ahead of the October 15 state assembly elections.
This was Modi's second day of whistle-stop election tours in the state where he is expected to address 20 rallies over the next nine days.

Mumbai: Cricket icon Sachin Tendulkar swept a road in Mumbai with a broom in hand, days after accepting Prime Minister Narendra Modi's nomination as one of the 'ambassadors' of 'Swachh Bharat' campaign.
Sachin was one of the nine celebrities nominated by the Prime Minister to spread awareness on cleanliness when he kicked off his ambitious campaign on October 2 on the 145th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
"I have been entrusted the leadership role of 'Swachh Bharat' campaign by Shri Narendra Modi. So, I am here along with my team and will clean this area," Sachin said, while taking part in cleaning up the road with some youngsters.

"When all of us, including my friends got the information that I have received the leadership role, all my friends came together and said we will also lend our hand towards cleanliness and will try and keep India as clean as possible," said Sachin, who is also a Rajya Sabha member.
Sachin, who retired from international cricket last year, said it was just the start and the campaign can move forward with more participation.
"This is the start and we can move forward from here by doing better work. So, we are a team and we will try to work with all our heart to our part well," he said.

HP third-quarter sales top estimates as PC revenue jumpsHP’s results give CEO Meg Whitman a boost as she works to turn around the world’s second-biggest PC maker. Photo: Hemant Mishra/Mint
San Francisco: Hewlett-Packard Co. reported fiscal third-quarter sales that topped analysts’ estimates, fuelled by improving personal-computer sales.
Profit excluding certain items in the period ended 31 July was 89 cents a share, with revenue rising 1.3% to $27.6 billion, the Palo Alto, California-based company said in a statement. Analysts on average were estimating profit of 89 cents a share and sales of $27 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The results give chief executive officer (CEO) Meg Whitman a boost as she works to turn around the world’s second-biggest PC maker. Since taking over in September 2011, she has focused on reducing costs and bringing new products like water-cooled servers and 3-D printers to market. Whitman, who was recently named chairman after activist investor Ralph Whitworth stepped down for health reasons, in May said she was paring as many as 16,000 more employees, on top of 34,000 already announced.
“She’s done a really good job of stabilizing a business that was spiralling out of control,” said Jayson Noland, an analyst at Robert W. Baird & Co., who has the equivalent of a hold rating on the stock.
Shares declined 1% to $35.12 at the close in New York. The stock is up 26% so far this year.
PC lift
Corporate spending on PCs has also helped lift the results of other technology companies recently. Intel Corp. last month forecast revenue that exceeded analysts’ estimates for the current quarter, while Microsoft Corp. said it’s seeing signs of improvement in the PC market. Worldwide PC shipments slipped less than projected in the second quarter as businesses replaced older computers, researcher IDC said in July.
“What we’re looking at is not just a turnaround story, now we’re really starting to get some hardware tailwinds,” said Jeffrey Fidacaro, an analyst at Monness Crespi Hardt & Co., who has a buy rating on the stock.
Hewlett-Packard’s net income for the quarter fell 29% to $985 million, or 52 cents a share, compared with $1.39 billion, or 71 cents, a year earlier.
For the current quarter, the company projected profit excluding items of $1.03 to $1.07, in line with analysts’ average estimate of $1.05, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Whitman has stabilized Hewlett-Packard and returned the company to profit over her tenure. She has cut jobs several times, including the latest round announced in May. The company’s workforce totalled 317,500 at the end of October.

NDMC sets Oct 31 deadline to make its areas filth-freeThe civic body will clean filth in areas like Valmiki Sadan (above) which comes under its jurisdiction. PM Narendra Modi kicked off his cleanliness campaign from this area.
Express News Service | New Delhi | Posted: October 6, 2014 12:40 am
New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) has set a target of making the areas under its jurisdiction garbage-free by October 31. The council has already prepared an action plan to intensify its cleaning operations in the wake of the launch of the Swachh Bharat mission by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on October 2.
The civic body has identified areas that require special attention and is stepping up operations to ensure proper hygiene and sanitation, officials said.
Special efforts are being made for cleaning the backlanes of several colonies and areas, which attract a high footfall of visitors, like Hanuman Temple road, Sarojini Nagar market, Connaught Place.
“Sanitation workers will be asked to give specific attention to the corners, backlanes, and overflowing dhalaos where garbage usually accumulates,” P K Sharma, Director (health), NDMC, said.
Tricycle-rickshaws have also been directed to collect garbage thrice daily instead of just once a day, Sharma said. He also said 800 new garbage trolleys have been ordered for the purpose.
“Door-to-door garbage collection has already been started in six colonies, including Jor Bagh, Golf Links, Rajinder Nagar and Khan Market,” he said.
The civic body is also regularising services of 762 sanitation workers who were working on contract basis. Attendance of the workers will be registered digitally, officials said.
The civic body has also signed a contract with a private company for the upkeep of Connaught Place where redevelopment work ended earlier this year.
According to NDMC officials, the civic body recently organised a rally during which schoolchildren offered flowers to people who were found littering in Connaught Place.
The civic body has also a created a Facebook page where it has asked people to post photographs of those found littering or urinating at public places.
On October 2, Modi wielded a broom and swept the pavement in Valmiki Basti — which falls under NDMC’s jurisdiction — as he launched the country-wide cleanliness drive.

I dont aspire to be CM  I want to be a mass leader like my dadComments

At Narendra Modi’s rally in Beed on Saturday, Pankaja Munde asked voters to imagine she is contesting all six assembly seats in Beed Lok Sabha constituency, last represented by her father the late Gopinath Munde. Speaker after speaker was rooting for her as chief minister, but the 35-year-old, two-time MLA and president of the BJP’s state youth wing says she wants to grow first.
This is the BJP’s first election after the death of your father. Are you approaching it differently?
The people are the same, their support is the same. Their love is maybe even more than before. But my dad’s guidance is not there. He would say one word and I would know what exactly to do next. That is something I miss terribly. I am also afraid of doing something wrong. I stop often and ask myself how he would have dealt with a situation.
Will the BJP will outdo itself in Beed owing to a sympathy factor?
Of course there is a sympathy factor; I would not deny it. He was such a big leader, and remember the tragedy happened just 15 days after he won the election, just four days after his swearing-in… There will be a love-cum-sympathy factor for us.
There has been so much talk about Pankaja as chief minister. Is that your immediate aspiration?
See, I was not aspiring towards chief ministership ever. I was not working towards that. Minister anyway I was going to become. When dad was there also, I would have become a minister, because I was among the state’s first ten leaders. Now I am in the first four or five. I tried to give justice to my promotion. Earlier I was not part of the team that took decisions. Now during my Sangharsh Yatra, I met lakhs and lakhs of people. They felt it was my dad’s dream and so they feel I should therefore be chief minister. But I never aspired to that. However, I would like to be part of the process of making the chief minister of the state, and I will contribute.
Let’s say you are offered the top job; what would your response be?
If the party offers it, I wouldn’t say no, but honestly I am not thinking about it right now. I need to grow first.
At a function earlier this week, Amit Shah anointed you the state’s biggest OBC leader. Is that the BJP’s strategy to occupy a political space that’s fallen vacant?
Yes, my dad was born into an OBC caste, but he was a leader. Leadership is not gender-based or caste-based. But being an OBC he always knew their problems, their survival issues. I would like to take on that mantle. At the same time I would like to be a mass leader like him. That is something I aspire to, more than a ministership. A mass leader is something continued…

BJP hits back at Sonia  says strong PM answer to countrys problemsPrint
Express News Service | New Delhi | Posted: October 6, 2014 12:31 am
The ruling BJP slammed Congress president Sonia Gandhi for her accusation that the Narendra Modi government had been giving “hollow promises” and said her speech writers had not done their home work even as the party listed the achievements of the BJP-led government in its four-month rule.
The BJP fielded Union Law and Justice minister Ravi Shankar Prasad to react to Sonia’s election speech in Haryana on Saturday.
According to Prasad, a strong leader like Modi is the BJP’s answer to the problems country is facing. “Soniaji, your government had given a weak PM and no one including the party or any minister were listening to him. BJP has given a strong PM… India today has a towering leader, a powerful PM whose voice is heard not only in the country but in the entire world over with respect and admiration because of his track record of governance,” the Union minister said.
“It is now trusted and feted the world over. India’s rating was down, now it has gone up after Modi became PM,” Prasad said.
Driving home the BJP’s allegation that it was Sonia who called the shots during the Congress-led UPA government under Manmohan Singh, Prasad took a swipe at the Congress chief. “Soniaji’s problem is that why decisions are being made from 7, Race Course Road (PM residence) and why there has not been any national advisory council? Why there has not been any 10, Janpath (Sonia residence)?”

Death of teen sisters: Jalaun SP moved out  3 cops suspendedPrint
Express News Service | Lucknow | Posted: October 6, 2014 12:29 am
The Uttar Pradesh government on Sunday removed Jalaun SP Rakesh Shankar and suspended three police officers hours after protests by locals in Orai turned violent over the killing of two teenage sisters, who had gone missing earlier this week.
A group of people clashed with policemen and pelted stones at them alleging negligent approach of the police in solving the case.
According to the police, the two sisters — Neetu (16) and Vaishali (14) — had left their home on Wednesday night after allegedly giving some sedative substance to their family members. The family later lodged a missing complaint with the police in which they accused Gaurav Chaturvedi, a youth from nearby Kuthaundh town, of kidnapping the sisters.
On Saturday, the decomposed bodies of two girls were found in a sack in a drain near Atrakala village in Churkhi police station area of Jalaun district. The bodies were later identified as of Neetu and Vaishali by their mother.
DIG (Jhansi Range) Prashant Kumar said the locals protested as the youth accused of kidnapping the girls was not arrested by the police. Orai Kotwali station house officer, sub-inspector who was investigating the case and the station officer of Kuthaundh have been suspended, said the official.
Meanwhile, Additional SP of Jalaun, Lallan Singh, said police teams have been conducting raids to arrest those named in the FIR.

Ex-Jharkhand minister who set up criminal gangs heldWritten by Deepu Sebastian Edmond , Sarah Hafeez | Ranchi | Posted: October 6, 2014 12:24 am
In A joint operation, a team of the Jharkhand Police’s CID and the Delhi Police finally arrested former Jharkhand agriculture minister Yogendra Sao from the national capital on Saturday, nearly a month after he resigned and went absconding following allegations that he formed a criminal gang.
A Delhi court on Sunday granted the Jharkhand Police a transit remand of three days for Sao.
A debutant MLA of the Congress, who represents the mineral-rich Barkagaon in the Assembly, 50-year-old Sao had resigned on September 12 following sustained pressure from within the party. A district court in Hazaribagh had issued a non-bailable warrant against him on September
The CID had been claiming that the former minister could not be found even though he gave a series of interviews to Jharkhand-based media
A statement by the Jharkhand Police said Sao was arrested from the house of a Panna Lal Mahto in a JJ Colony in Delhi’s Shakurpur. The Delhi Police said Sao had been constantly changing locations to evade arrest. “He hid in Assam and Bihar before coming to Delhi on September 30. He was staying with an associate, also a resident of Jharkhand, in Shakurpur’s JJ Colony. Police arrested him on a tip-off,” Delhi Additional Commissioner of Police (Crime) Ashok Chand said.
The Jharkhand Police had approached the Delhi Police Crime Branch five days ago seeking a joint operation to track Sao.
The MLA claims to have been “trapped” by the police because of his opposition to various “police atrocities”.
The case began with the arrest of five men from Giddi in Jharkhand on September 1 for illegal possession of firearms. On interrogation, their leader Raj Kumar Gupta told the police that he headed a banned criminal gang, Jharkhand Tiger, also classified as a left-wing extremist organisation in the state.
In a statement recorded under Section 164 of the CrPC, Gupta later told the police that it was Sao who had set up the gang in early 2014 to carry out extortion, and that the MLA provided him guns, money, bikes and posters. Gupta claimed the initial payment to the gang was Rs 75,000, along with three bikes.
The Delhi Police said Sao also formed another criminal outfit with alleged links to left-wing extremist groups, the Jharkhand Bachao Andolan.
The only leader to have come out in support of Sao has been former Ranchi MP Subodh Kant Sahay, who himself had to resign as Union minister in October 2012 following allegations of involvement in the coal block allocation scam.
Apart from facing extortion charges, the Jharkhand Tiger is suspect in at least two kidnappings. It was reportedly preparing to attack a project site of the GVK Group when its members were arrested.

New Delhi
More than a week after she went missing from the lawns of India Gate, three-year-old Jahnvi has been found and united with her family.
The girl who went missing on September 28 was seen by some locals near a Gurdwara in Mayapuri area of West Delhi on Sunday evening. According to sources, the child had a board around her neck which read: “This is Jahnvi, missing from her home, someone please unite her with her family.”
According to police, a call was received at the control room around 9 p.m. about a girl resembling Jahnvi being traced in Mayapuri. Upon receiving this information they brought the child to the local police station and gave a call to Jahnvi’s parents. Her parents on reaching the police station confirmed that it was their daughter.
Police have so far not given any information on how the girl reached there and what happened to her in the past one week. “This is too early to say anything about where the child went and what happened to her. We are carrying out investigation and will take suitable action,” said a senior police officer.
The girl Jahnvi Ahuja had come to India Gate with her parents and two siblings on September 28 evening and was last seen in the CCTV footage at 9.21 pm. After searching for her for a couple of hours, Jahnvi’s parents had called the police.
The girl’s family had taken to social media, including Facebook and Twitter to seek help to find Jahnvi.
Posts on the two social networking sites carried the missing girl’s photographs along with the caption, “Call on this number if u get any clue about her - Rakesh Ahuja 9540098859”.
This is also part of a campaign ‘Bring Back Jahnvi'’ on Facebook. Apart from these, thousands of posters regarding the missing girl had been put up across the city.

We Don t Know What We Don t Knowreddit
I was in New York with a colleague, Gregory Hill. We were having several cups of coffee, discussing the importance of strong foundations in corporations.
Organizations go through change -- growth, market dynamics, Customer demands, stakeholder pressures. An organization's ability, and readiness, to face that change, and to create real sustainability is paramount. All too often, the unknown plays a crucial factor. So, preparing for that with organizational resilience is important. It is about the teams we put together, It is about the skills and experience we have at our disposal. It is about the culture we create.
One element of that culture is a company's constant ability and desire to gain fresh perspective on existing dynamics as well as to anticipate and seek out new perspectives and viewpoints.
And that starts at the top.
At this point, my friend Gregory pulled out a napkin and drew a simple diagram. He drew a circle and he drew in a slice of a makeshift pie. "This slice represents what we know."
He drew another slice. "This slice represents the stuff we know we don't know."
The biggest piece of the pie, remained unclaimed. "This big piece of the pie, represents We don't know that we don't know."
We can argue all day long how large that last piece of the pie is, but one thing we can all agree on - it is big. When leaders recognize this, they start to build a culture that welcomes input, fresh perspective and diversity; they build organizations that are open to input - organizations based on trust and transparency.
And they invite players to the table. They invite other parts of the organization. They invite customers. They invite suppliers. They invite stakeholders.
They bring in mentors, advisors, advisory boards.
Because they don't know what they don't know.
And they manage accordingly.

FinMin asks banks to tighten norms for high value FDsFinMin asks banks to tighten norms for high value FDs
Press Trust of India | New Delhi Oct 06, 2014 12:36 AM IST
The finance ministry has asked public sector banks (PSBs) to tighten norms, including know your customer (KYC) monitoring for high-value fixed deposits (FDs), to check the kind of frauds suspected to have been committed at Dena Bank and Oriental Bank of Commerce (OBC).
The ministry would like banks to make a foolproof arrangement for high-value fixed deposits, including due diligence of KYC details, sources said.
Banks have been advised to categorise FDs, which may fall under the high-value criteria, sources said. At the moment, different banks have varied definitions of high-value FDs.
By the preliminary forensic audit report, a fraud to the tune of Rs 436 crore in two PSBs, Dena Bank and OBC, were committed through multi-layer system. It is suspected there was money laundering. The lenders are also alleged to have siphoned off the money (Rs 180 crore by OBC and Rs 256 crore by Dena Bank) received as FDs.
Besides, the ministry has asked the Reserve Bank to tighten lending norms to prevent borrowers from opening multiple current accounts outside their consortium banks’ in the light of Kingfisher Airlines case.
There are a few instances where defaulting borrowers diverted of funds by opening multiple current accounts outside the members of the consortium, sources said.
Therefore, sources said, the finance ministry has urged RBI to tighten the norms and monitoring system so that such activities could be prevented.     
According to sources, Kingfisher Airlines allegedly diverted funds by opening a current account in HDFC Bank and had a balance of Rs 7.5 crore as on date.
This fact was not known to the consortium of lenders headed by State Bank of India. These banks have debt dues of Rs 6,521 crore from the now-grounded carrier.
Such diversion can be monitored by RBI as it is sector regulator and there is need to strengthen the monitoring mechanism, sources said.
There has been a spate of defaults in the banking system. A majority are due to slower economic growth but there is a small proportion of cases where the defaults are intentional.
Recently, the ministry had ordered a limited forensic audit into some non-performing accounts of Kolkata- based UCO Bank to find if there were any irregularities in sanction of loans.

Sharapova battles hard to overcome Kvitova
World No. 1 Novak Djokovic crushed Tomas Berdych 6-0, 6-2 Sunday to win the China Open and maintain a remarkable 100 per cent record in the Beijing tournament.
Meanwhile, French Open champion Maria Sharapova was forced to battle hard to overcome Petra Kvitova 6-4, 2-6, 6-3 in the women’s final — a victory which moves her into second place in the rankings.
Serb Djokovic was 5-0 ahead in the second set, one game from serving up an incredible “double bagel” as he tore through his Czech opponent with a brilliant serving display.
As he was staring at an embarrassing defeat, a stunned Berdych laughed as he pretended to hand his racket to a ball-girl, suggesting that she may be able to take on his opponent.
But the World No. 6 rallied briefly to take Djokovic’s serve and then take the scores to a more respectable 5-2, before the reigning champion sealed his fifth title in Beijing, an event he has won the five times he has entered.
“Beijing is definitely my lucky place, I enjoy coming here,” Djokovic said to the crowd after his stunning victory over the third seed.
Gritty performance
In the women’s final, it was a gritty performance from current World No. 4 Sharapova, who handed Kvitova her first loss in nine games.
The fourth seed Russian appeared to have carried into the match the determination she showed in her powerful 6-0, 6-4 semifinal defeat of Serbian World No. 9 nine Ana Ivanovic.
Kvitova, the World No. 3, broke serve in the first game, but Sharapova fought back to force three break-points in the fourth, before deservedly breaking serve at the next opportunity.
With Sharapova at 5-4 ahead, Kvitova dragged two cross-court shots wide to give her opponent the set. But the Czech 24-year-old was dominant in the second set, racing to a 4-1 lead as she forced her opponent to stretch for a series of powerful baseline drives that were beyond reach.
Sharapova broke serve in the sixth game by forcing the left-handed Kvitova to miss-hit a fiercely struck drive to her right. But the 27-year-old then double-faulted to hand a 5-2 lead to Kvitova, who claimed the next game to set up the decider.
Sharapova was then at her ruthless best, taking two serves from Kvitova before a third daring attempt in the eighth game with the scores at 5-2 in her favour.
The marathon nine-minute duel saw Kvitova rescue a match point before closing out the game. But Sharapova concluded her show of force by taking all the points in her final service game to seal her fourth title of the year.
“After exchanging breaks in the first set, I was happy. I felt like I stepped it up,” Sharapova said.
“I was kind of happy that I was able to lift my game again in the third and come out with a win.”
The victory was Sharapova’s sixth over Kvitova in the eight games they have previously played, with the Russian winning the last four meetings before Sunday’s final.
The results (finals): China Open: Women: Maria Sharapova bt Petra Kvitova 6-4, 2-6, 6-3. Men: Novak Djokovic bt Tomas Berdych 6-0, 6-2.
Japan Open: Kei Nishikori bt Milos Raonic 7-6(5), 4-6, 6-4.

Patna stampede fallout: Top district officials removedBJP MP Shatrughan Sinha with a memorandum submitted to the Governor for the victims on Sunday. Source: PTI
Written by Santosh Singh | Patna | Posted: October 6, 2014 1:00 am
The Bihar government has removed several top officials, including Patna DM Manish Kumar and Commissioner N Vijaylakshmi, after the district administration came under severe attack over the Dusshera stampede at Gandhi Maidan which claimed 33 lives and left several injured.
Manish Kumar, N Vijaylakshmi, DIG Ajitabh Kumar and SSP Manu Maharaj have been “transferred”, but were asked to wait for their new postings.
A joint team of Bihar Home Secretary Amir Subhani and ADGP (headquarters) Gupteshwar Pandey on Sunday recorded statement of over two dozen police officers — from additional superintendents of police to sub inspectors — deployed at the “killer” southern gate opening at Exhibition Road. The team is likely to submit report to the government within 10 days.
Though the function on October 3 was organised by Ramlila committee, Patna Municipal Corporation was responsible for traffic control, crowd management and security. Lighting at the Gandhi Maidan is responsibility of Patna Municipal Corporation.
Most deaths took place along the 30-metre stretch from the gate to Ramgulam Chowk because of the area “being dark and outer area either fully encroached by vendors or clogged by parked vehicles”. Home Secretary Amir Subhani said: “We have been probing all angles to know if it was a rumour or a conspiracy that led to the stampede. We have collected CCTV footage of Gandhi Maidan. We are also trying to know if district administration failed to coordinate with Patna Municipal Corporation to provide adequate lighting at Gandhi Maidan during the Ravan Vadh”.
The ADGP Pandey said though 10 DSPs were demanded for Gandhi Maidan arrangements, they had been trying know why only five DSPs could be deployed. “We also want to know if all senior officials deputed for the function had been actually on duty or not, and how many of them stayed back till the crowd dispersed from the venue.”
Asked about the responsibility of Ramlila committee that organises the annual function, the ADGP said it was a private committee and “crowd management and law and order was the sole responsibility of district administration”.
Gandhi Maidan police has lodged an FIR against unknown persons for “spreading rumour of livewire falling on gate”, while it was cable connection wire that had tripped some visitors during exit.
Meanwhile, police control room that collected CCTV footage of Gandhi Maidan claimed that six of the eight gates were open at the time of stampede.

Special unit to focus on recovery of stolen jewelleryPrint
Written by Megha Sood | Mumbai | Posted: October 6, 2014 1:00 am | Updated: October 6, 2014 1:03 am
The Mumbai police have set up a dedicated unit to focus only on recovering jewellery stolen by chain-snatchers. Police said the move comes after it was observed that while the number of chain-snatching incidents in the city have reduced due to sustained efforts against the crime and its perpetrators, the recovery part still remains a challenge.
Police also face a big challenge in the prosecution stage where the recovery is not complete, as most of the stolen gold, and in some cases silver, would be melted by the time the trial begins. This also has proved difficult in getting convictions as melted gold cannot be retrieved and hence also cannot be shown as evidence of the stolen goods, said officials.
According to police sources, a squad of three officers and 12 constables has been formed to handle only the process of recovery in chain snatching cases, based in the Sahar police station premises. Sources said that a it was decided to take a different approach after it was realised that quick and easy money is the sole motive behind chain snatching.
“The unit will compile a database of chain-snatchers,” said Dhananjay Kulkarni, deputy commissioner of police (Crime). Officers working the unit said that they would keep a close watch on the chain snatching incidents in the city and collect information about each chain snatcher arrested. They would then find out the other cases against the chain-snatcher.
While officers at the police stations would continue to patrol their respective areas, the unit will collect information on chain-snatchers from the police stations, compare sketches with history-sheeters, study their activities and even make an analysis of their modus operandi.
According to the Mumbai Police’s statistics of the city in 2013 alone, the total value of jewellery stolen across the city was over Rs 13 crore. Only 793 of the over 2,000 cases could be detected, with less than Rs two crore worth of jewellery recovered.

Won't target Shiv Sena out of respect for Balasaheb Thackeray, says Prime Minister Narendra Modi
ET Bureau Oct 6, 2014, 01.02AM IST

Balasaheb Thackeray
(Modi addressed three…)
SANGLI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said he would not target the Shiva Sena in his campaign for the Maharashtra assembly elections as a mark of respect for the Sena's departed leader, Balasaheb Thackeray .
"This is the first assembly election in Maharashtra happening in Balasaheb's absence. I have immense respect for him," Modi said in his campaign rallies in Kolhapur and Sangli. The BJP and Shiva Sena have been allies for many years, before they parted ways because of disagreement over seat sharing for this month's assembly election.
Modi addressed three campaign rallies on Saturday and as many on Sunday. All rallies got massive response from the people. Reacting to media reports that he had not mentioned anything about the Shiv Sena in his rallies on the previous day, despite the former partner's public statements against the BJP, Modi said he had decided right at the beginning of the campaign that he would not be saying anything adverse about the Sena.
Modi's strategy seems significant as BJP leader Nitin Gadkari had mentioned just two days ago that the BJP feels that the option of a post-poll alliance with Shiv Sena is still open.
However in his campaign rallies, Modi repeatedly appealed to the voters to vote only for the BJP and vote for a single-party government in the state. "If the people of Maharashtra want development they must vote for stability. The days of yuti (alliance) are over vote only for the BJP because this is the only party that can give you stability," Modi said.
Launching an attack against the Congress and NCP in the Sugar belt of Western Maharashtra at Tasgaon in Sangli district and Kolhapur, Modi said: "The Congress has ruled this country for 60 years but has not given the people anything. Now this party is asking us for an explanation about what we have done in 60 days of our government. (NCP leader) Sharad Pawar says that BJP's campaign shows Maharashtra in a negative light. I want to reply to him that his party has ruined the state so much in 15 years that we had no option but to show all the negative things in our advertisements."
Modi alleged that the NCP and Congress, which together ruled the state for the past 15 years, had ruined the state's cooperative sector and agriculture sector. "This state's leader Sharad Pawar was the agriculture minister in the Central government for so many years, still thousands of farmers had to commit suicides. If this situation has to change, the voters have no option but to vote a single party government to power," he said.

Facebook May Soon Have Even More Of Your Personal InfoFacebook Reportedly Working On Healthcare Features And Apps
Reuters
By Christina Farr and Alexei Oreskovic
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Facebook Inc
already knows who your friends are and the kind of things that grab your attention. Soon, it could also know the state of your health.
On the heels of fellow Silicon Valley technology companies Apple Inc
and Google Inc
, Facebook is plotting its first steps into the fertile field of healthcare, said three people familiar with the matter. The people requested anonymity as the plans are still in development.
The company is exploring creating online "support communities" that would connect Facebook users suffering from various ailments. A small team is also considering new "preventative care" applications that would help people improve their lifestyles.
In recent months, the sources said, the social networking giant has been holding meetings with medical industry experts and entrepreneurs, and is setting up a research and development unit to test new health apps. Facebook is still in the idea-gathering stage, the people said.
Healthcare has historically been an area of interest for Facebook, but it has taken a backseat to more pressing products.
Recently, Facebook executives have come to realize that healthcare might work as a tool to increase engagement with the site.
One catalyst: the unexpected success of Facebook's "organ-donor status initiative," introduced in 2012. The day that Facebook altered profile pages to allow members to specify their organ donor-status, 13,054 people registered to be organ donors online in the United States, a 21 fold increase over the daily average of 616 registrations, according to a June 2013 study published in the American Journal of Transplantation.
Separately, Facebook product teams noticed that people with chronic ailments such as diabetes would search the social networking site for advice, said one former Facebook insider. In addition, the proliferation of patient networks such as PatientsLikeMe demonstrate that people are increasingly comfortable sharing symptoms and treatment experiences online.
Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg may step up his personal involvement in health. Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan, a pediatric resident at University of California San Francisco, recently donated $5 million to the Ravenswood Health Center in East Palo Alto.
Any advertising built around the health initiatives would not be as targeted as it could be on television or other media. Pharmaceutical companies, for instance, are prohibited from using Facebook to promote the sale of prescription drugs, in part because of concerns surrounding disclosures.
PRIVACY CONCERNS
Privacy, an area where the company has faced considerable criticism over the years, will likely prove a challenge. This week, the company apologized to users for manipulating news feeds for the purposes of research.
But Facebook may already have a few ideas to alleviate privacy concerns around its health initiatives. The company is considering rolling out its first health application quietly and under a different name, a source said. Market research commissioned by Facebook found that many of its users were unaware that photo-service Instagram is Facebook-owned, the source said.
Facebook's recent softening of its policy requiring users to go by their real names may also bolster the company's health plans. People with chronic conditions may prefer to use an alias when sharing their health experiences.
"I could see Facebook doing well with applications for lifestyle and wellness, but really sick patients with conditions like cancer aren't fooling around," said Frank Williams, chief executive of Evolent Health, a company that provides software and services to doctors and health systems.
People would need anonymity and an assurance that their data and comments wouldn't be shared with their online contacts, advertisers, or pharmaceutical companies, Williams said.

Coal handling to go up at Krishnapatnam PortUpdated: October 4, 2014 22:09 IST
Coal handling to go up at Krishnapatnam Port
N. Anand
coal
Krishnapatnam Port Company Ltd. (KPCL) has decided to increase its daily coal handling volume from one lakh tonnes to 1.50 lakh tonnes. This is due to increasing demand for coal from thermal, cement and steel plants located in Gummidipoondi.
Currently, 78,000 tonnes of coal was moved through 20 rakes, and another 27,500 tonnes through trucks and tippers to Bellary, Kadappa, Nandiyal and Gummidipoondi. Coal contributes about 70 per cent of KPCL total cargo volume.
Over 1,000 trucks of different capacities are used to move coal daily to AP and TN, and 110 trucks to Gummidipoondi. The present plan calls for doubling the number of trucks and tippers using just-in-time concept to deliver the coal.
On Saturday, KPCL officials entered into pact with 300 truckers in AP and TN..
Gummidipoondi is about 147 km from Krishnapatnam Port. Yet, the thermal, cement and steel plants preferred it for excellent logistics and speed of evacuation, sources said.
Talking to The Hindu, a KPCL official said: “These power and cement producers and steel manufacturers have started using our port as we are bringing in Cape Size vessels and Panamax vessels that could bring in huge volumes of coal in single transportation. ”
The Gummidipoondi sector did not have a railway yard to load and offload coal , he pointed out.
Last year, KPCL handled 25 MT of coal. This year, it would handle 38 MT, he said.

Leahy: Pro tem and photog of presidentsBy Jackie Kucinich October 5 Follow @JFKucinich

As the president pro tempore of the Senate, Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) has a different view of the world than most people — but few in his position have ever attempted to share such a unique vantage point with the world through photography.
In celebration of his 40th year in the Senate, the Brattleboro Museum and Art Center in Brattleboro, Vt., curated several of his photos that document his time in the Capitol as well as his travels around the world.
Leahy recently gave us a guided tour of the exhibit, which is on display at Georgetown Law Center until Oct. 19.
But with all the historic events he has documented during his lifetime, what was the one photograph he wasn’t able to get?
It was during a trip on Marine One with then-Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Yeltsin’s wife, Leahy said.
“I was riding with Boris Yeltsin on Marine One out to Andrews Air Force Base, and he and his wife are sitting in the president’s seat across from me,” Leahy said.
“And they had these things of candy in front of them. Mrs. Yeltsin says something to him in Russian, he responds in Russian, and she immediately opens her purse, takes both of [the candy trays] and dumps them out. Even before we took off.”
“We had barely gotten airborne, the steward comes and thinks, ‘I must have forgotten to put candy there,’ puts more candy in. He walks to the back of the helicopter,  [Yeltsin] says something to [his wife], she opens her purs" and dumps the candy in.
"I think, ‘Don’t they have candy on Moscow One or whatever he’s flying on?’ And I had the camera with me, and I just couldn’t bring myself” to take a photo.
"Since then, I’ve thought ‘Darn!’”

China flexing muscle more after launching first aircraft carrier: US Pacific Air ForcesBeijing
(Since commissioning Liaoning,…)
WASHINGTON: Since commissioning its first aircraft carrier, China's navy has conducted more exercises farther away from its shores and flexing its muscle by closely patrolling areas in disputed waters where Chinese companies are drilling for oil, a top US Air Force commander has said.
Air Force General Herbert "Hawk" Carlisle, the head of US Pacific Air Forces , said China's naval and air forces in particular are "very much continuing to push" and becoming more active in international waters and airspace in Asia.
"They still talk about the century of humiliation in the last century. They still talk about this as the rise of China," Carlisle was quoted as saying by a newspaper.
"They still talk about this as their great nation. And they want to continue to demonstrate that," he said.
Carlisle said US and Chinese forces are frequently encountering each other in parts of the East China and South China seas where they rarely came into contact in the past.
Since commissioning Liaoning, its first aircraft carrier in 2012, China's navy has conducted more exercises farther away from its shores and is closely patrolling areas in disputed waters where Chinese companies are drilling for oil.
Those movements have prompted the US military in turn to deploy its ships and reconnaissance aircraft to keep a close watch.
"All of that makes their tension go up a little bit," he said.
One such encounter got out of hand in August, when a Chinese J-11 fighter jet flashed past a Navy Poseidon P-8 patrol aircraft , and bringing its wingtip within 20 feet of the US plane.
The incident occurred during a tense period in the South China Sea, where Beijing's territorial claims over several resource-rich shoals overlap with those of neighbouring nations like Vietnam and the Philippines.
In May, China placed an oil rig in waters claimed by Vietnam, which set off a round of anti-Chinese protests and deadly riots in Vietnam. China removed the rig later.
Carlisle was more measured in his assessment, saying that there has always been "an ebb and flow" in the number of Chinese intercepts and that he did not think China's military leadership was looking to provoke a conflict.
"I personally don't think it needs to get too much hype," said Carlisle, who will leave his post in the Pacific this month to take a new assignment as chief of the Air Force's Air Combat Command at Joint Base Langley-Eustis in Virginia.
But he acknowledged that "the opportunity for something to go wrong" will likely increase as China's military gathers strength and moves farther afield.
To prevent such incidents, the Pentagon has tried to enhance communications channels and expand formal ties with the People's Liberation Army in recent years. Although US officials said progress has been made, they said that they did not expect to solve the issue overnight.

SCI  GAIL in talks for $3-bn LNG ships  dealSCI, GAIL in talks for $3-bn LNG ships' deal
Press Trust of India | Krishnapatnam Oct 06, 2014 12:43 AM IST
Shipping Corporation of India (SCI) and GAIL (India) Limited are currently in discussion to forge a tie-up under which the latter will acquire nine liquefied natural gas (LNG) ships for almost $3 billion and the former will operate these, a senior official of the shipping firm said.
SCI Director (liner and passenger services) Sarveen Narula said the shipper will have an option to pick up 25 per cent stake once a joint venture company is formed for the purpose and talks are held through respective ministries.
“We are trying to buy nine LNG ships, not through SCI but through GAIL. SCI will run those ships in partnership with GAIL. We are actively working with GAIL in selection of (other) partners. We may have the right to take up to 25 per cent of the stake in that (venture),” Narula said.
“The memorandum of understanding (MoU) is being finalised. We are already been in talks with them...very soon it will be done. It is being brokered through the government,” he added.
SCI is currently running four LNG ships through joint venture companies with Japanese partners, among others, in which the Indian public sector undertaking holds 26 per cent stake.
“That is why we are tying up with GAIL. We will have the technical expertise. The funding will be though GAIL. So this becomes a new business for us. Each ship would cost around $300-350 million,” Narula said when asked about the capital requirement for buying the vessels.
He spoke on the sidelines of the flagging off ceremony of SCI’s direct container services to Yangon from Krishnapatnam port container terminal on October 3. The shipping company has already approached the central government seeking permission to start a foreign subsidiary in Singapore for LNG shipping to India, he said.
According to the latest annual report of GAIL, the total Indian LNG imports required to meet the demand-domestic supply gap was 29.56 million standard cubic metres per day (mscmd) in 2008, which further rose to 48.8 mscmd in 2013.
GAIL has imported 25 LNG cargoes (equivalent to approximately 1.50 million tonnes per annum of LNG) during the last financial year from various international sources on short term as well as spot basis to meet immediate domestic gas requirement.
SCI currently has an MoU with GAIL for transporting LNG from the US to India in 2016-17 wherein it has step-in right up to 26 per cent and also providing technical consultancy.
According to the 2013-14 annual report of SCI, India was the fifth largest importer of LNG in 2013 accounting for 5.5 per cent of the total trade. Domestic natural gas supply is expected to grow at 5.6 per cent over FY13-15, while gas demand is expected to grow at 18 per cent thereby causing a demand-supply mismatch.
Narula further said another focused area for the company would be providing services to oil and gas companies in offshore activities.
Currently, SCI has been offering services to ONGC and is looking for opportunities in other parts of the world, he added.

Indian Chief for IndiaschiefPrint

Written by Jonathan Selvaraj | New Delhi | Posted: October 6, 2014 1:42 am | Updated: October 6, 2014 3:20 pm
There’s not much of a gap between the end of the Champions League and the start of the West Indies’ tour of India. So it wasn’t surprising that MS Dhoni, Champions League T20 winning Chennai Super Kings captain, wanted to make the most of his three day break. It was even less surprising that Dhoni chose to spend the first day of his time off at the Bike Festival of India. With over 50 motorcycles sitting in just his Delhi garage, it’s perhaps fair to say Dhoni likes two-wheelers. “Busy day 2morrow, off to Delhi for BFI. eagerly waiting to c the old classic motorcycles ..” Dhoni had tweeted even before the start of Saturday’s CLT20 final.
At the Buddh International circuit itself, where the BFI was underway, Dhoni spent much of his time at the Heritage Motoring Club of India stall that housed several vintage models. But unlike most visitors to the stall, Dhoni wasn’t just looking on enviously.
While Dhoni is seen as more of a sport biker and indeed his sprawling collection is of more recent vintage, apparently he was looking for something more classic. The stall housed a historic 550cc 1910 Swift — a landmark in the evolution of the motorcycle — a massive 1942 Army Harley Davidson and even a 1937 Royal Enfield. Much of Dhoni’s time was spent hulking the red beast in a corner. “One more classic ..” he tweeted along with a picture of the motorcycle.
Rather appropriately, the motorcycle the Indian skipper was interested in — and talks are already underway to complete a purchase — was a 1948 Indian Chief. With its blood red paint job, outrageously skirted fenders, a 1200 cc V twin that churned out 50 straining horses and the trademark Chief’s head on the front fender it’s not hard to see why the Indian caught Dhoni’s eye despite the eye-watering asking price of Rs 35 lakh.
But for all its eye catching looks, Indian cricket fans need to have their fingers crossed. “That bike can be a killer,” says Parvinder Singh a member of the HMCI and a restorer of classic motorcycles. “It isn’t a motorcycle that particularly easy to ride. Because it’s so beautiful, its very rare that people willingly sell them. Most of the ones you see on sale belong to people who got killed riding it,” Parvinder only half-joking.
‘Suicide shifter’
There’s plenty of reason’s why the Chief is so unforgiving. Tipping the scales at 550 pounds, bringing the monster to a standstill requires a lot of foresight. It’s gears go by the uncomfortably name “suicide shifter”. Most motorcycles have the clutch on left handle while the gear is shifted with the left foot. The Chief however has a car-style gearbox mounted along the right of the fuel tank while the left handle features the throttle continued…
it’s clear he isn’t a novice driver. It was definitely a surprise to see how much knowledge he has about motorcycles

Big year ahead  Clarke wants Aus to cut through thehypeMicheal Clarke is currently recovering from the hamstring injury he picked up in Zimbabawe. (Source: Express FILE)

A Test series against India, a World Cup on home soil and a much-anticipated Ashes campaign will put Australia’s cricketers under heavy scrutiny over the next year, but the team need to make themselves oblivious to the hype, according to captain Michael Clarke.
“Obviously, this is the start of a huge period in all our cricketing lives,” Clarke wrote in a column for News Ltd on Sunday, as Australia kick off their United Arab Emirates tour against Pakistan. “The trick for us will be removing as much of the hype and emotion as we can.
“I’ve found in the past that when I get swept up in the build-up to a big event, the ultimate prize has seemed far away and unattainable. We made it clear to the guys before last summer that this wasn’t about ‘the Ashes’ and all the hype and history that goes with that,” Clarke added of Australia’s 5-0 whitewash of England.
“It was about playing eleven English cricketers in five Tests on our own pitches. The public and the media will create the build-up. I love that. But I feel that our job as players is to cut through that emotion, do our jobs and, with any luck, make Australia proud.”
Australia’s Twenty20 side play Pakistan in a one-off match later on Sunday before a series of One-day matches precedes two Tests in Dubai and Abu Dhabi. Clarke, who gave up Twenty20 cricket three years ago, has been ruled out of the one-day matches with a hamstring problem and is battling to be fit for the first Test on October 22.
Australia’s top batsman and one of the sharpest captains in the game, the 33-year-old decided to overhaul his fitness regime after straining his hamstring before a One-day tournament in Zimbabwe and arrived in the Middle East six days before his Test team mates to keep working on his rehabilitation.
Long plagued by back problems, Clarke had injections to “free it up” before the flight and spent much of the journey walking up and down the plane, he said. His “run volume and speed” was still only 60-70 percent and he stopped short of declaring himself a likely starter for the first Test.
“As I have done my whole career I will do whatever it takes to give myself the best possible opportunity of playing,” he wrote. “I will leave nothing to chance but, equally, I will always put the team first.”
After beating South Africa away in a hard-fought series earlier this year, Australia briefly snatched the top Test ranking from the Proteas who duly took it back when they sealed a Test series win away to Sri Lanka in July.
Australia can recapture top spot with a 2-0 win over Pakistan, according to the International Cricket Council, the sport’s global governing body. “So we’re not looking at these two Tests against Pakistan in Dubai continued…
I’ve found in the past that when I get swept up in the build-up to a big event, the ultimate prize has seemed far away and unattainable

Delhi girl found  police believe FB campaign spooked kidnappersPrint
At police station Sunday night.
Written by Sarah Hafeez | New Delhi | Posted: October 6, 2014 1:39 am | Updated: October 6, 2014 10:10 pm
A week after she went missing from India Gate lawns while on an outing with her parents, three-year-old Jahnvi Ahuja was found Sunday night walking about alone in Lajwanti Garden, Janakpuri, in West Delhi.
On Sunday morning, Delhi Police chief B S Bassi had announced a Rs 50,000 reward for anyone providing information regarding Jahnvi.
Police suspect Jahnvi’s kidnappers panicked and abandoned her following widespread media coverage of her disappearance and the campaign launched on social network by her parents to find her.
Joint Commissioner of Police (New Delhi) M K Meena confirmed that the child had been identified by her parents as Jahnvi. Police said she was fine and had been handed over to her parents, who live in West Delhi’s Raghubir Nagar.
The details of her recovery were surrounded in drama. Police said they received a call around 8 pm from a local in Lajwanti Park, later identified as “Mukesh”, about a small girl wandering near a park in D block. The caller reportedly said the girl had a placard around her neck with her name, her father’s number and the fact that she had gone missing from India Gate written on it by hand.

Child star comes ofageIndia A team player Unmukt Chand in action during a warm up match against West Indies in Mumbai on Sunday. (Source: PTI)

You could be pardoned if you thought Unmukt Chand would have played for India already by now. After all, the last two U-19 captains before him to have led the nation to Junior World Cup glory — Mohammad Kaif and Virat Kohli — didn’t have to wait too long for their boys-to-men transformation. And to boot, Indian cricket had wasted no time in anointing the opener as the poster-boy of its future.
For many, Chand was the next Kohli. That was 2012. In the following two years, Chand remained a child star, waiting for the big break on the big stage.
As he waited, Chand’s stock took a massive dive. To the extent that some had even raised eyebrows on his selection to the India A squad to face the touring West Indians. Going into the two matches, there were few eyes on Chand, even with the entire gamut of the national selection committee in audience. But if he tickled their interest just a tad with a breezy unbeaten 79 at Brabourne Stadium on Friday, he must have gotten their complete attention at the Wankhede Stadium on Sunday with an enterprising 111-ball 101, a knock that ensured that the West Indians leave Mumbai with little gains and two losses against the second-string Indian side.
The only resistance from the Caribbean side came in the form of Denesh Ramdin, someone who would knew what Chand has gone through in his nascent career so far.
Two of a kind
Ramdin too had captained the West Indies at the U-19 World Cup. He too had been touted as a future star from the moment he played competitive cricket. But for more than a decade, he had remained the prodigal son of West Indian cricket. The one they expected to take world cricket by storm. But not only did he fail to live up to his early hype, the Trinidadian’s innate genius came to the fore more in flashes than in bursts.
Like it did at Wankhede under the lights. When Ramdin walked to bat, his team looked well set for another humiliating collapse and a comprehensive hammering.

Clean Home  Clean City: Alappuzha municipality shows thewayOne of the ‘aerobic composting units’ set up across city.
Written by Shaju Philip | Alappuzha | Posted: October 6, 2014 1:39 am | Updated: October 6, 2014 4:44 am
With the Modi government’s Swachh Bharat Mission kicking up a dust, the Kerala CPM recently resolved to take up “comprehensive garbage management as a new mission”. It doesn’t have to look very far. The Alappuzha municipality ruled by the party has managed to put in place a successful solid waste management system within two years of its launch.
As part of its ‘Nirmala Bhavanam, Nirmala Gagaram (Clean Home, Clean City)’ programme, the municipality set up biogas plants, pipe compost units in households and aerobic composting units in public places. It also set up surveillance cameras across the city, linked to the police control room, to catch those littering public places.
Twenty-two months later, the municipality with a population of 1.74 lakh no longer has 40-50 truckloads of garbage headed daily to a nearby dumping yard, saving Rs 10,000 to Rs 15,000 a day on fuel bill alone.
The programme was conceived following a protest by residents of Sarvodayapuram in the monsoon of 2012. They objected to more waste coming to the dumping yard located near the town. The yard at the time got 40-50 tonnes of unsorted waste daily.
As the Alappuzha municipality couldn’t send its waste to Sarvodayapuram, it started collecting in the city. Alappuzha MLA and CPM central committee member Dr T M Thomas Isaac was involved in the talks. The architect of the people’s planning movement started by the then LDF government in 1996 — under which local self-government units (panchayats or municipal bodies) were empowered to formulate development plans and execute them — the former finance minister asked why waste couldn’t be managed at the source itself.
“If human waste could be processed at our own houses, why couldn’t we manage kitchen waste? The idea of ‘Clean Home, Clean City’ began thus,” he says.
In November 2012, one of the 52 wards in the municipality was selected for implementing a pilot scheme. Biogas plants, both portable and fixed, were installed in households, with 50 per cent subsidy from government agencies. Within a month, the scheme was rolled out in 11 more wards, a few of them represented by the Congress.
The size of the biogas plants was decided on the basis of the quantity of solid waste a household produced. Those households which could not install plants due to financial or space constrains were urged to deposit their domestic waste in biogas plants of their neighbours.
Those who could not go in for biogas plants were told to opt for pipe composting, which was cost-effective and easy, involving two pipes lowered into a pit where waste would gather and get treated.
Aerobic composting units were then set up in various parts of the city, in places where people would dump their waste for collection by the municipality. These were meant for biodegradable waste and for commercial establishments, hotels and households that had not gone continued…

At last minute  BJP pulls out of event to felicitate men held for UPviolenceTeachers, social activists were honoured instead on Sunday. Gajendra Yadav
Written by Dipankar Ghose | Amroha | Posted: October 6, 2014 1:34 am | Updated: October 6, 2014 8:33 am
The BJP on Sunday cancelled a plan here to felicitate 63 party workers arrested in July on charges of clashing with the district administration of Moradabad, which had led to injuries to the district magistrate.
The BJP’s Amroha district unit admitted the event was cancelled an hour before it was to begin, following a call to do so by Uttar Pradesh BJP president Lakshmikant Bajpai.
While he was earlier expected to attend the event, Bajpai insisted the BJP was “never involved in it to begin with”. “This was a privately organised event, and the party had no role to play. However, when we found out that the party at the district level may be getting involved, we asked them to refrain from doing so,” he said.
Senior party leaders of the area added that the party didn’t want “negative publicity”, particularly in light of the recent bypoll setbacks that indicated a rejection of the BJP’s efforts to whip up passions over ‘love jehad’.
The Amroha BJP had announced a plan to felicitate the party workers arrested over the Moradabad clashes, who were released on bail in September. They had been held after a protest on July 4 led by them over the removal of a loudspeaker from a temple in Kanth had turned violent.
At the ceremony, to be held jointly by the BJP along with an “Arya Up-pratinidhi Sabha”, the party workers were to be felicitated for their great service in “social areas”. They were to be given the title ‘Jail Yatri’, and a shawl and memento for “their efforts”, in front of a crowd of at least 500 people.
At the function finally held on Sunday, the BJP workers were absent, and Arya Up-pratinidhi Sabha performed a yagya and awarded teachers and social activists from the area.
BJP Amroha unit chief Girish Tyagi said, “We intended to felicitate the workers as they had spent time in jail for a good cause. But we received a call from the state leadership around 10 am asking us not to be involved in any such ceremony. The party feels that various agencies are investigating and it is not correct to hold a reward ceremony like this before they come out with a decision.”
Tyagi admitted that they didn’t anticipate the cancellation. “Till the time the call came, we thought the state president himself would come to the function,” he said.
Senior district leaders of the BJP said that the party had become wary of the controversy the event was creating. “While the party still wants to go ahead with protecting the rights of the Hindus in the area, this event was seen as unnecessary given the negative publicity when Sangeet Som was felicitated after the Muzaffarnagar riots. Because the party suffered setbacks in the bypolls, it decided to tread cautiously,” a senior leader said.

Jules Bianchi’s accident in Sunday’s Japanese Grand Prix has prompted questions over whether the Formula One race should have been started earlier to beat deteriorating weather conditions. The Frenchman suffered severe head injury after his Marussia slid off the slippery track, drenched by rain brought in by the approaching typhoon Phanfone, and hit a recovery vehicle.
Adrian Sutil had crashed his Sauber at the same point a lap earlier. There had been talk earlier in the week of bringing the race forward to beat the worst of the typhoon but the decision was to start as scheduled at 1500 GMT. “We weren’t asked about our opinion so there is nothing I can say,” Sutil, who witnessed Bianchi’s accident, said when asked about it. “It was clear it got more wet and it would have been quite easy to make the race earlier.”
Retired triple world champion and Mercedes non-executive chairman Niki Lauda agreed: “They could have started earlier, there’s no question about it,” said the Austrian. “It was foreseeable. They could have started the race at one but I don’t take these decisions.”
The race started behind the safety car as rain drenched the 5.8 km circuit but, with conditions clearly too treacherous, it was red-flagged and the field led back into the pits at the end of the second lap. Conditions gradually improved enough for the drivers to race on intermediate tyres, though the showers returned near the end with the light also fading.
“For me personally it wasn’t (that bad),” Mercedes race winner Lewis Hamilton said. “There was more and more rain coming and… you started to see more reflections,” added the championship leader, who can count on a lot more grip in his car than Bianchi in his Marussia.
Brazilian Felipe Massa, however, said he was “screaming for the race to stop” when the rain returned towards the end. “I was screaming on the radio five laps before the Safety Car that there was too much water on the track,” said the Williams driver.

China Open: Cakewalk for Novak  Sharapova overcomesKvitovaNovak Djokovic of Serbia celebrates after winning against Tomas Berdych in the men's singles final match at the China Open. (Source: Reuters)
Reuters | Beijing | Posted: October 6, 2014 1:32 am | Updated: October 6, 2014 9:03 am
World number one Novak Djokovic destroyed Tomas Berdych in a lop-sided contest to win his fifth China Open crown on Sunday while Maria Sharapova overcame Petra Kvitova in the women’s final to move up to number two in the world rankings. Top seed Djokovic took 67 minutes to seal a 6-0 6-2 win against Berdych, who raised his arms in celebration when he won a game to avoid the ignominy of a double bagel with the Serb serving for the match at 5-0 in the second set.
Berdych managed to win back-to-back games, but it was just a matter of time before Djokovic sealed an easy win to continue his love affair with the Beijing tournament where he now has a 24-0 record.
“This was probably the best performance in a final I ever had,” a beaming Djokovic said after the masterclass. “Everything I tried worked, it was incredible. Beijing is definitely my lucky place, I enjoy being here,” he said before throwing his wristbands and towel to an ecstatic crowd. “Since my first China win in 2009 I have not lost a match on this court. It keeps on going,” said Djokovic who belted 19 winners, compared to his opponent’s nine.
A never-seen-before hiding
Berdych conceded he had not experienced such a mauling before.
“I met somebody in the final who I’ve never seen before,” said Berdych. “The way that he performed today was really outstanding. There is really not much I can add to that because, really, I was just swept off the court. I just said to my coach now that I probably played over 700 matches in my career, and I met guys like Andre (Agassi), Roger (Federer), all those probably in their best times. But I have never, ever experienced anything like that.”
Earlier in the women’s final, Wimbledon champion Kvitova broke her opponent in the very first game but Sharapova showed greater intensity towards the end to prevail 6-4 2-6 6-3 in two hours and 28 minutes. French Open champion Sharapova broke her Czech opponent twice to claim the first set, but Kvitova unleashed 15 winners in the second to force a decider.
Maria rallies
Sharapova, having dropped her first set in the tournament, raised her game in the third, racing to a 3-0 lead but could not capitalise on her first match point at 5-2 with an inside out forehand into the net. She eventually served out the match and raised her hands in celebration after Kvitova buried a return into the net.
“It was a bit of an up-and-down match I’d say — maybe not the best out of the tournament,” Sharapova told reporters. “But it’s never easy playing against Petra. You don’t always quite get a good rhythm. She goes for a lot of shots, very deep, and she’s a very good, confident player.
“She became the more continued…
This was probably the best performance in a final I ever had

Scuffles occur as Hong Kong protests face clear-outScuffles occur as Hong Kong protests face clear-out
AP/ PTI | Hong Kong Oct 05, 2014 01:15 PM IST
Police armed with pepper spray and batons clashed with demonstrators in Hong Kong, as fears grew today that officials would move in to clear the streets of pro-democracy protesters and end the standoff for good.
Large crowds of protesters scuffled with police overnight in the blue-collar Mong Kok district in Kowloon, a flashpoint that has seen violent clashes between pro-democracy student protesters and their antagonists over the weekend.
Police said the crowds had provoked officers with verbal abuse, while the students accuse police of failing to protect them from attacks by mobs intent on driving them away.
The students claim that police had allied with criminal gangs to clear them, but the government has vehemently denied it
As the protests entered their eighth day today, the atmosphere on the streets was tense amid fears police may use pepper spray and tear gas to disperse them, as they did last weekend.
The city's top leader, Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying, appeared on television yesterday evening to once again urge everyone to go home, saying key roads paralysed by protesters need to return to normal by tomorrow.
"The government and the police have the duty and determination to take all necessary actions to restore social order so the government and the 7 million people of Hong Kong can return to their normal work and life," Leung said.
Tens of thousands of people, many students, have taken to the streets in the past week to protest China's restrictions on the election for the city's top leader. The protests are the strongest challenge to the authorities in Hong Kong and in Beijing since the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
Beijing has promised that the city can have universal suffrage by 2017, but it says a committee of mostly pro-Beijing figures must screen candidates for the top job. The protesters are also demanding Leung's resignation, but he has refused.
The next steps are uncertain, after student leaders called off planned talks with the government until officials respond to claims that police tolerated attacks by alleged mobsters. Police had earlier arrested 19 people in the brawls in Mong Kok, including eight men believed to have backgrounds linked to triads, or organized crime.

SCI  GAIL in talks for $3 billion LNG ships dealSCI, GAIL in talks for $3-bn LNG ships' deal
Press Trust of India | Krishnapatnam Oct 06, 2014 12:43 AM IST
Shipping Corporation of India (SCI) and GAIL (India) Limited are currently in discussion to forge a tie-up under which the latter will acquire nine liquefied natural gas (LNG) ships for almost $3 billion and the former will operate these, a senior official of the shipping firm said.
SCI Director (liner and passenger services) Sarveen Narula said the shipper will have an option to pick up 25 per cent stake once a joint venture company is formed for the purpose and talks are held through respective ministries.
“We are trying to buy nine LNG ships, not through SCI but through GAIL. SCI will run those ships in partnership with GAIL. We are actively working with GAIL in selection of (other) partners. We may have the right to take up to 25 per cent of the stake in that (venture),” Narula said.
“The memorandum of understanding (MoU) is being finalised. We are already been in talks with them...very soon it will be done. It is being brokered through the government,” he added.
SCI is currently running four LNG ships through joint venture companies with Japanese partners, among others, in which the Indian public sector undertaking holds 26 per cent stake.
“That is why we are tying up with GAIL. We will have the technical expertise. The funding will be though GAIL. So this becomes a new business for us. Each ship would cost around $300-350 million,” Narula said when asked about the capital requirement for buying the vessels.
He spoke on the sidelines of the flagging off ceremony of SCI’s direct container services to Yangon from Krishnapatnam port container terminal on October 3. The shipping company has already approached the central government seeking permission to start a foreign subsidiary in Singapore for LNG shipping to India, he said.
According to the latest annual report of GAIL, the total Indian LNG imports required to meet the demand-domestic supply gap was 29.56 million standard cubic metres per day (mscmd) in 2008, which further rose to 48.8 mscmd in 2013.
GAIL has imported 25 LNG cargoes (equivalent to approximately 1.50 million tonnes per annum of LNG) during the last financial year from various international sources on short term as well as spot basis to meet immediate domestic gas requirement.
SCI currently has an MoU with GAIL for transporting LNG from the US to India in 2016-17 wherein it has step-in right up to 26 per cent and also providing technical consultancy.
According to the 2013-14 annual report of SCI, India was the fifth largest importer of LNG in 2013 accounting for 5.5 per cent of the total trade. Domestic natural gas supply is expected to grow at 5.6 per cent over FY13-15, while gas demand is expected to grow at 18 per cent thereby causing a demand-supply mismatch.
Narula further said another focused area for the company would be providing services to oil and gas companies in offshore activities.
Currently, SCI has been offering services to ONGC and is looking for opportunities in other parts of the world, he added.

In Ebola-hit West Africa  Indian pharma to showcase its waresIn Ebola-hit West Africa, Indian pharma to showcase its wares
IANS | Lagos Oct 05, 2014 02:58 PM IST
Even as the Ebola virus disease outbreak in West Africa is causing worldwide concern, the Indian pharmaceutical industry is set to expand its footprint in the region with its first ever exhibition outside India.
The Pharmaceutical Export Council of India (Pharmexcil) will host the first ever exhibition outside India, dubbed IPHEX Africa 2014, Nov 24-26 this year at the Lagos Palace Hotel in the West African nation of Nigeria, a statement by Pharmexcil has said.
The choice of Nigeria is based on the growing pharmaceutical trade with India over the last few years. This year Nigeria has become the largest export destination of India's pharmaceutical exports with a growth rate of 12.72%. The total exports from India to Nigeria increased to $384.30 million by the end of September this year, up from $340.92 million last year.
A breakdown of exports from India shows that bulk drugs that amounted to $49.98 million last year, amounted to $43.17 million as of September this year. For formulations, it rose to $339.38 million at the end of September this year against $296.9 in the same period last year.
"Further, presence in Nigeria will be advantageous for members to explore opportunities in other African countries. Members are already aware of Pharmexcil's initiative to open a warehouse in Nigeria with support of members and ministry of commerce, government of India," the statement added.
Pharmexcil said its last two exhibitions in Mumbai, India, have been highly successful and "have been able to position Brand India Pharma as responsible healthcare", adding that "embassies and missions of India abroad are taking all efforts to promote IPHEX and suggest good business prospects".
It said the exhibition would be exclusive for Indian exhibitors who would have an opportunity to generate immense business opportunities in Nigeria and other African nations.
Pharmexcil will be inviting hosted buyers, importers, distributors and agents from other African countries in Nigeria to participate in the buyer-seller meet being exclusively organised for Indian companies participating in the Pharmexcil pavilion.
It will also use the exhibition to organise a networking dinner with regulatory officials and all pharmaceutical-related stakeholders. Regulators from Nigeria and other African countries will be invited. There will also be a three-hour seminar to focus on the Indian pharmaceutical industry and thereby create a platform for business interactions.

Cameron orders spy chiefs to hunt down  Jiha...British PM David Cameron orders spy chiefs to hunt down 'Jihadi John'

(The Prime Minister has stepped…)
LONDON: Prime Minister David Cameron has asked his spy chiefs to find Islamic State executioner 'Jihadi John' so that he could dispatch special forces to kill or capture the masked man who beheaded the latest British hostage.
The Prime Minister has stepped up the hunt for British aid worker Alan Henning's murderer, who appears in IS beheading videos and has a British accent.
He summoned the heads of MI5, MI6 and GCHQ -- the main British spy agencies -- to his Chequers country retreat yesterday and told them he wanted them to provide him with targets for a special forces raid on the IS kidnappers, The Sunday Times reported.
The meeting came 12 hours after the terrorists released a video showing the Britain-born terrorist beheading Henning, a 47-year-old former taxi driver from Salford.
Cameron stepped in as Henning's brother-in-law, Colin Livesey , and one of his friends accused the government of failing to do enough to save him.
Henning's widow Barbara said the family were "numb with grief" at his murder and thanked those who had campaigned for his release.
But Livesey, her brother, said he was "angry" with the government and criticised their handling of the case and that of David Haines, the Scottish aid worker who was beheaded last month.
"They could have done more when they knew about it months and months ago," he said.
"Just the same with David Haines as well --- I don't think they did enough for him either."
Branding the terrorists "scum," he said he prayed they "get what's coming to them."
Majid Freeman , a friend of Henning who was on the same aid convoy when he was kidnapped, said: "We have been pressuring the government into doing something to secure his release, but they abandoned him. The British government left him out there."
The newspaper said that intelligence chiefs have supplied Cameron with information about the terrorist cell holding the remaining hostages.
But the information on their whereabouts is not detailed or reliable enough for him to allow an SAS raid because the terrorist group is moving around the Syrian desert.
Henning was abducted minutes after his aid convoy entered Syria on December 26. He was the fourth Western hostage to be killed by Islamic State since mid-August, following two American journalists and another British aid worker.

Mass grave found as Mexico probes town's violence
AP
Reuters Soldiers guard an area where a mass grave was found, in Colonia las Parotas on the outskirts of Iguala, in Guerrero on Saturday.
TOPICS
unrest, conflicts and war
Security forces investigating the role of municipal police in clashes in this southern city a week ago found a mass grave on the edge of town, raising fears the pits might hold 43 students missing since the violence that also resulted in six shooting deaths.
Guerrero State Prosecutor Inaky Blanco did not say on Saturday night how many bodies were in the burial pits uncovered on a hillside on Iguala’s outskirts, and he declined to speculate about whether the dead were the missing students.
“It would be irresponsible” to jump to conclusions before tests to identify the bodies, Mr. Blanco said. Officials said the federal Attorney General’s Office and the National Human Rights Commission had sent teams of experts to aid state authorities in identifying the remains.
Guerrero Gov. Angel Aguirre said the victims had been “savagely slaughtered”.
About 100 soldiers, marines and federal and state police cordoned off the area where the grave site was found in the poor Pueblo Viejo district of Iguala, which is about 120 miles (200 kilometres) south of Mexico City.
Mr. Blanco said eight more people had been arrested in the case, adding to the 22 Iguala city police officers detained after a police confrontation with student protesters last weekend set off a series of violent incidents in the city.
The prosecutor has said state investigators had obtained videos showing that local police arrested an undetermined number of students after the initial clash and took them away.
Mr. Blanco said his investigators had found that “elements of the municipal police are part of organized crime”. He also said his office was searching for Iguala Mayor Jose Luis Abarca and had alerted officials across Mexico to be on the lookout for him.
The governor had charged earlier in the week that organized crime had infiltrated the city government.
On Saturday night, a group of young people from the Aytozinapa Normal school protested outside the governor’s residence in the state capital of Chilpancingo. They threw Molotov cocktails and overturned a car after state authorities told them they would not allow them to travel to the graves to see the bodies and determine if they belong to their missing classmates.
Jesus Lopez, the father of one of the missing students, told The Associated Press that a delegation of family and school representatives would come to Iguala on Sunday to get information from authorities.
“We cannot say anything. We are very nervous, but until they inform us, there is nothing,” said Mr. Lopez, whose 19-year-old son, Giovani, hasn’t been seen since the violence last weekend.
State prosecutors have said the first bloodshed occurred when city police shot at buses that had been hijacked by protesting students from a teachers college, killing three youths and wounding 25. A few hours later, unidentified masked gunmen shot at two taxis and a bus carrying a soccer team on the main highway, killing two people on the bus and one in a taxi.
Violence is frequent in Guerrero, a southern state where poverty feeds social unrest and drug gangs clash over territory.
The Aytozinapa Normal school attended by the missing students, like many other schools in Mexico’s “rural teachers college” system, is known for militant and radical protests that often involve hijacking buses and delivery trucks.
In December 2011, two students from Aytozinapa died in a clash with police on the highway that leads to the Pacific coast resort of Acapulco. Students had allegedly hijacked buses and blocked the road to press demands for more funding and assured jobs after graduation. Two state police officers were charged in the shootings.
During that confrontation, students apparently set fire to pumps at a gas station on the highway when federal and state police moved in to quell the protest, and a gas station employee later died of burns suffered in the attack.

Wipro founder Azim Premji s son Rishad to join board with CFO Suresh Senapaty set to retireWipro founder Azim Premji's son Rishad Premji to join board as CFO Suresh Senapaty retires next year
Pankaj Mishra & Varun Sood, ET Bureau Oct 6, 2014, 07.08AM IST

Azim Premji
(Senapaty’s retirement…)
BANGALORE: India's third-biggest software exporter Wipro is preparing for a generational shift at the top after company veteran and CFO Suresh Senapaty retires next March. Rishad Premji , the elder son of Wipro's billionaire founder Azim Premji , and also the company's head of strategy, is set to join the board "sometime next year", at least two people familiar with the discussions said.
"It's not that he (Rishad) was not part of the board discussions — he's always been since becoming the CSO —but with formal induction, he will get closer to representing ownership on the board," the first person said. There are two triggers for Rishad's promotion to the board. Firstly, Suresh Senapaty's retirement leaves an executive leadership post to be filled, and secondly, Rishad's grooming over the past seven years in different roles in the company seems to have almost achieved the purpose. "In some sense, this is a generational shift," the second person said. "It's easily among the best managed family transitions that I have seen in India."
When contacted, a Wipro spokesperson asked not to speculate about board appointments.
Rishad Joined Wipro in 2007
"You may be aware that Wipro has a board of directors with a majority of them being independent. The board has various subcommittees, one of them being Nomination and Governance consisting of independent directors and chaired by Dr Ganguly," the spokesperson said.
"Matters relating to any change in board members including new appointments are subject matters dealt with by such committee before it is deliberated by the board for a final decision (of course, subject to shareholder approval)," the Wipro spokesperson added.
Experts said it makes sense for Premji to have his son represent the family while he is still on the board to ensure the transition. "The transition of leadership in a family enterprise is a challenging period for all stakeholders," said Mike Fassler, consultant at Family Business Consulting Group in Chicago, which helps wealthy families sort through conflicts.
Fassler said senior Premji's presence on board will help "bring comfort to all stakeholders" even as Rishad takes the next step to join the board. "Effecting the transition while the leading generation is still available to influence the next generation's development can be an incredibly powerful demonstration of the family's commitment to and influence on the continuity of the enterprise," said Fassler. When Rishad joins the board of Wipro, he will continue to retain his current position as head of strategy, according to a third executive familiar with the development.
"He is to head the corporate venture arm," said the executive. "Corporate venture arm is nothing but identifying and evaluating startups which Wipro will back. So he will continue to be head of strategy even when he is on the board." Wipro is currently in the midst of putting together a team of executives that will oversee the $100-million corporate venture arm, to be spearheaded by Rishad.
Premji junior joined Wipro in 2007, working in capital markets space under banking and financial services division at Wipro. Less than a year after joining the company, he was overseeing the integration of USbased Gallagher with Wipro, when the company bought the mortgage solutions provider in 2008.
"For six months, he (Rishad) worked on this integration," said one of the executives who worked with Rishad then. "For two months he worked out of Miami office and the rest of time while in India he used to work at graveyard hours shift, always on the phone, trying to answer questions from Gallagher employees and help integrate the company," said the executive. Later in 2010, Rishad was appointed head of strategy.
"One of the things which he (Rishad) has done since taking over his role is to institutionalise this role of M&A in each of the six service lines," said two executives. By institutionalising, the executives mean that Rishad has helped each of the six services lines at Wipro have an executive focused on acquiring companies that can help Wipro scale up business. "Each of the service lines sees the opportunities and shares it with the central team," said the executive. In the last four years as head of strategy, Rishad has also got a lot of executives with domain experience in each of the six service lines.
"So until now, say healthcare unit had a lot of software engineers," said one executive. "Now we have a lot of executives who have experience working with pharma companies, who understand the business. They are able to work closely with the team and tell them exactly what the client wants." This, the executives claim, is one of the reasons why Wipro has started winning more transformational deals. A point validated by Ayan Mukerji, head of telecoms and media business of Wipro, who in an interview to ET last month said the company's winnability rate in media and telecoms space has jumped fourfold in the past two years.
Nonetheless, Fassler believes that "next generation family enterprise leaders face some common challenges which include continuing to develop family commitment to the future of the enterprise, balancing reinvestment of capital for the future with current period dividends to shareholders, and development of their own leadership identity while honoring the past."

NASA to put astronauts in deep sleep for Mar...NASA to put astronauts in deep sleep for Mars mission?
By PTI | 5 Oct, 2014, 05.28PM IST
A NASA-backed study is exploring the feasibility of lowering the cost of a human expedition to Mars by putting the astronauts in deep sleep.
ET SPECIAL:
TORONTO: A NASA-backed study is exploring the feasibility of lowering the cost of a human expedition to Mars by putting the astronauts in deep sleep.
The deep sleep, called torpor, would reduce astronauts' metabolic functions with existing medical procedures.
"Therapeutic torpor has been around in theory since the 1980s and really since 2003 has been a staple for critical care trauma patients in hospitals," said aerospace engineer Mark Schaffer, with SpaceWorks Enterprises in Atlanta, earlier this week at the International Astronomical Congress here.
So far, the duration of a patient's time in torpor state has been limited to about one week.
Coupled with intravenous feeding, a crew could be put in hibernation for the transit time to Mars, which under the best-case scenario would take 180 days one-way, 'Discovery News' reported.
"We haven't had the need to keep someone in (therapeutic torpor) for longer than seven days. For human Mars missions, we need to push that to 90 days, 180 days," Schaffer said.
This will allow crews to live inside smaller ships with fewer amenities like galleys, exercise gear, water, food and clothing.
The SpaceWorks study, funded by NASA , shows a five-fold reduction in the amount of pressurised volume need for a hibernating crew and a three-fold reduction in the total amount of mass required, including consumables like food and water.
The study looked at a two-part system for putting Mars-bound astronauts in stasis and bringing them out.
The cooling would be done through an internasal system, which Schaffer admitted is "not very comfortable," but inhaling a coolant has several advantages over reducing body temperatures with external cooling pads.
Cooled from the outside, the body is more susceptible to shivering and possible tissue damage, Schaffer notes.
Simply stopping the flow of coolant will bring a person out of stasis, though the study included rewarming pads as a backup and to speed up the waking process in case of an emergency.
An alternative to having the whole crew in stasis is to have one person awake for two to three days, then hibernate for 14 days.
By staggering the shifts, no one person would be in stasis for more than 14 days at a time and one crew member would be awake to monitor the ship, conduct science experiments and handle maintenance chores.
More research is needed to assure prolonged stasis is safe, but initial results are promising, Schaffer added.

Patna stampede: Paswan demands independent  fair probeaccident (general)
Union Minister and LJP Chief Ram Vilas Paswan on Sunday sought an independent and fair probe into the stampede outside Gandhi Maidan in Patna on October 3 that left 33 people dead.
In order to know the reasons that led to the stampede there should be an independent and fair probe into the incident, Mr. Paswan said in his letter to Home Minister Rajnath Singh.
The Union Food, Consumer Affairs and Public Distribution Minister said action should be taken against those found guilty.
Mr. Paswan, who along with his son and LJP MP Chirag Paswan had visited the spot and the hospital where the injured were being treated, blamed the lack of arrangements by the local administration for the tragedy.
“There was just one passage for lakhs of people and that too was broken.... It is difficult to walk even in normal circumstances, so what could have happened during the stampede?” Mr. Paswan asked.
He said according to information received by him, there were no basic arrangements at the venue like presence of emergency teams, NDRF, ambulance and medical teams.

The most thoughtful critics of the Apple Watch are watch bloggersFashion
October 5, 2014
When the Apple Watch was launched after years of speculation, it was greeted with breathless coverage by the tech press. More recently, Apple has courted the fashion world—putting the watch in Paris’s trendy boutique Colette and having Jony Ive profiled by Vogue . But to get a real sense of what the Apple Watch is all about, you should listen to the watch bloggers.
Tap image to zoom
(A Blog to Watch)
Last week, Ariel Adams wrote up a hands-on consideration of the Apple Watch on his site, A Blog to Watch. Aside from some excellent close-ups of the watch in various sizes and finishes on and off the wrist, Adams had written a thoughtful analysis of how Apple’s watch works, its price points, its potential  and where it sits in the marketplace. And in his thoughtfulness, he actually manages to get something back from the Apple handlers over why the company used 38mm and 42mm to describe its watches in terms of height, as opposed to width (the standard used by the rest of the watch industry):
Apple confirmed that there was an internal debate about this. Some people wanted to go with the traditional way of describing a watch’s size, while others said that what was more important to assess a good fit was the height of a watch such that the edges of the case do not extend past the boundaries of one’s wrist. This is absolutely correct, and something I have been preaching for years. Apple decided that height was a better measurement, and thus decided to use that as a designation, arguably clarifying one of the more ambiguous areas of trying to size a watch without actually wearing it.
He observes that having higher-end versions of the watch necessitates selling them in places other than just Apple stores and Best Buys, and he holds the device and considers the Apple Watch from multiple points of view—as a piece of jewelry and a piece of tech, as a mass market watch that is still high-end, and one that will soon be held by people who have never held an expensive Rolex:
For a mass-produced product, the Apple Watch is excellent. While it isn’t hand-polished, nor does it have complicated surfaces like those seen on a Swiss timepiece, it is an amazing achievement, not just for Apple, but for the tech industry overall. I’ve never had what is essentially a high-volume, high-end gadget that felt so good in my hands. The sad thing is that most Apple Watch wearers will not be “watch people,” so they really won’t have too much to compare it with.
This follows on from a much-shared post by Benjamin Clymer  on his wristwatch site, Hodinkee, a few days after the watch was launched. Again, Clymer focused on size and the thinking behind them:
They didn’t exaggerate the options and make one decidedly male oriented at 44mm and a girly equivalent at 35mm or the like. Any man, woman, or child could pull off either size with ease. This may not seem like much, but remember this is Apple’s first watch, and it would be a very easy mistake to make it too big or too small.

(Hodinkee)
In his criticisms of the watch, he is equally thoughtful. He said it failed the “cuff test” in that the Apple Watch doesn’t fit under his shirt cuff without serious effort. But the most insightful aspect of his review, like Adams’s, is that he thinks of it from another’s point of a view:
Imagine a man who grew up in the middle class, went do a decent school, got an okay job, lives in a nice apartment in some metropolitan town, maybe drives a German car and occasionally splurges on something nice for himself. Do you see him wearing the Apple Watch? I don’t.
Compare the lucidity of these observations with what’s been coming out of the fashion press. The  sidebar on the device  in Vogue merely notes that Apple’s watch does everything Giovanni de’ Dondi’s clock from 1350 can do “plus it monitors your pulse and, if you like, shares it with Apple Watch-wearing friends.” The New York Times’s fashion critic, Vanessa Friedman,  spends most of an article about the designer Azzedine Alaïa’s party in honour of Ive and the Apple Watch in Paris talking about seating arrangements and whether Mick Jagger did or did not get up to sing, without much consideration of why Apple wanted to be in a room with all these tastemakers. And that’s ignoring all the articles on who may be the face of Apple Watch .
The tech press has often done worse. Most of the “reviews” are more press releases, regurgitating everything that Apple said its keynote and adding little else. Both worlds could learn something from the considered views of these two watch bloggers.

Govt to propose panel to set monetary policy with inflation focusGovernment in talks with RBI on panel to set monetary policy with an inflation focus
Deepshikha Sikarwar, ET Bureau Oct 6, 2014, 07.30AM IST
(The agreement, as suggested,…)
NEW DELHI: India is embarking on steps that will lead to the government agreeing to inflation targeting while monetary policy will be decided by a committee, in line with systems in the US and the UK, and marking the start of sweeping changes in the financial sector.
The finance ministry has begun discussions with the Reserve Bank of India on an agreement to put in place the framework that's needed along the lines of high-level panels such as the Urjit Patel committee and the BN Srikrishna-headed Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission.
The agreement will lead to creation of a committee to set monetary policy that will be geared to an inflation target. The contours of this plan will be made public so views can be sought before an accord is signed.
FSLRC suggested five-member panel
"Discussions are on with the RBI," said a finance ministry official, adding that the government is keen to have the framework in place soon.
The government had made its intentions clear in the July 10 budget presented by finance minister Arun Jaitley. "It is... essential to have a modern monetary policy framework to meet the challenge of an increasingly complex economy," Jaitley had said. "The government will, in close consultation with the RBI, put in place such a framework." The FSLRC had suggested setting up a fivemember monetary policy committee headed by the governor.
RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has said previously that Parliament should set the inflation target and the central bank should be mandated to achieve this.
Having a committee system in place would mark a radical shift in the way monetary policy is decided in the country. Currently, the governor is the sole authority to decide policy and the RBI board only has an advisory role. Following the change, policy will be decided by the proposed committee chaired by the governor through a vote.
The agreement is being proposed in the interim pending legislative changes on the lines of the 1997 deal between the RBI and the government to end the issuance of ad hoc treasury bills to finance budget deficits and replace that with the scheme of ways and means advances. Incidentally, the RBI has adopted inflation targeting as a basis of its monetary policy.
The consultations follow criticism of some FSLRC recommendations by Rajan and experts say it will be interesting to see what tack the central bank adopts in these early talks. The framework is being designed on the model followed in countries such as the US and the UK. In the latter, the treasury sets the remit of the monetary policy in discussion with the central bank, while decisions on policy are taken by a committee.
The proposed framework draws from the work of a number of expert committees on financial sector reforms including the highpowered expert committee on making Mumbai an international financial centre (IFC) and the Rajan panel on financial sector reforms, besides the Patel panel and the FSLRC. The new framework agreement would come into effect from a date decided by the RBI, the official said.
The Patel committee to revise and strengthen the monetary policy framework mooted a shift to the Consumer Price Index as the nominal anchor for inflation targeting and the setting up of a monetary policy committee headed by the governor with rate action decided by votes, the model followed by the US Federal Reserve. The FSLRC has recommended that price stability is a desirable goal in its own right, particularly in India, where inflation is known to hurt the poor and therefore the central bank must be given a quantitative objective that can be monitored by the central government for its monetary policy function.
The Rajan panel had said the RBI can best serve the cause of growth by focusing on controlling inflation, and intervening in currency markets only to limit excessive volatility. This focus can also best serve the cause of inclusion because the poorer sections are least hedged against inflation.
The RBI should formally have a single objective to stay close to a low inflation number, or within a range in the medium term, and move steadily to a single instrument, the short-term interest rate (the repo and reverse repo) to achieve this. The Mumbai IFC panel had said the gold standard for a monetary policy framework was a transparent, independent, inflation-targeting central bank.
Experts said the move marks a significant step in the direction of financial sector reforms. "This is a move towards modernising the monetary policy," said DK Joshi, chief economist at Crisil. "It would bring more clarity in the policy."

Giants Petit provides big reliefBy Rick Maese October 5 Follow @RickMaese
Yusmeiro Petit. (AP)
Yusmeiro Petit joined the Giants’ rotation in late August and started every fifth day until the end of the season. In each of his final two starts, Petit made it through just 5 1/3 innings. Coming out of the bullpen, he fared much better in his stellar six-inning relief performance Saturday night in Game 2 of the National League Division Series.
“That’s crazy,” said Petit, who picked up the win.
In all, seven San Francisco relievers combined to pitch nearly 11 shutout innings, but nothing compares to what Petit did.
“I think the job Petit did was incredible,” catcher Buster Posey said. “To throw as many pitches, as many innings as he did and keep them off the board – I mean, again, the job he did was unbelievable.”
The Giants moved Petit to the bullpen for the postseason, so he could be called on in long relief, but surely no one envisioned needing an outing anything like Saturday’s. Bochy turned to the 29-year old righty in the 12th, and over the next six innings, Petit stifled the Nats bats. He allowed no runs and just one hit, while striking out seven. He ended up tossing 80 pitches, most of them fastballs (54) and most of them strikes (46).
“You can’t say enough about what he did,” said first baseman Brandon Belt, who hit the game-winning homer in the 18th inning. “He kept us in that ballgame.”
Bochy had plans to use rookie Hunter Strickland in a closer role, which meant he had just two pitchers to get the team through the endless string of extra frames: Petit and Tim Lincecum.
“I was trying to get as much as I could out of him,” Bochy said.
Petit said he had one more good inning left in his right arm, but before Belt’s homer in the top of the 18th, Bochy was ready to replace Petit with Lincecum. The slim lead meant he could go straight to Strickland for the final three outs. Regardless, he felt his hand late in the game was a luxury of sorts.
“The thing we had in our pocket, we had Petit and Timmy fresh,” the manager said. “We knew we could stretch them out.”
Petit is a guy on whom many teams had given up over the years. He was traded by both the Mets and the Marlins, waived by the Diamondbacks and Mariners. He even spent 2011 pitching in the Mexican League. He began 2013 with the Giants’ Class AAA club in Fresno and had to battle to return to the big leagues.

Trinamool denies hand in Bardhaman blastUpdated: October 6, 2014 02:45 IST
Trinamool denies hand in Bardhaman blast
Kolkata Bureau
The Hindu TMC leader Mukul Roy
TOPICS
Kolkata
Denying the allegation that the Trinamool Congress had links with the blast at Khagragarh in Bardhaman (Burdwan) district last Thursday, party general secretary Mukul Roy said the investigation was following normal procedure. He lauded the police administration for a “proper and fast” investigation.
Two persons were killed and another was injured in the blast.
Earlier in the day, the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) charged the Trinamool with having links with the blast.
“How do we know if the BJP and the CPI(M) are not linked with the blast and is trying to create unrest in the State?” Mr. Roy asked. He alleged that the Opposition was making “irresponsible comments.” “Biman Bose, CPI(M) State secretary, and the BJP are trying to disturb the peace and thus denigrate the government ... by making irresponsible statements.”
Denying the allegation that the house where the blast occurred had a Trinamool office, Mr. Roy said it must be “substantiated.”
“Local people would have known, if the house had the Trinamool office. Electronic media would have filmed ... do you have any footage that establishes that the house had (party) office,” he asked.
“One may cook any allegation but it has to be substantiated. In the Babri Masjid demolition case, many allegations were made against BJP leaders, but nothing materialised,” he said.
BJP charge
BJP leader Siddharth Nath Singh said at a press conference in Delhi that Bangladeshi infiltrators had rented the housed. Mr. Singh said: “The local police destroyed all evidence” to “cover up the incident” so that the Trinamool remained “above suspicion.”
“The local police collected samples and destroyed it within seven hours. The evidence included mobile phones, ID, IM proofs and al-Qaeda’s jihadi literature. Since the Central forces were informed late, they could not reach on time. All these raise questions on the Mamata Banerjee government,” Mr. Singh said.
Central agency sources told The Hindu that their officials were not allowed entry into the house even two days after the explosion. However, West Bengal Home Secretary Basudeb Banerjee denied “non-cooperation” with the Central agencies.
West Bengal Left Front committee chairperson Biman Basu quoted newspaper reports to say pamphlets of “banned Muslim fundamentalist organisation” were recovered from the house. Later, the CPI(M) said in a statement that the Trinamool office was located in the house. “Soon after the explosion, the signboard of the Trinamool Congress was removed ... local people alleged that that the police tried to block the probe initially,” Mr. Bose said.

U.S. unemployment lowest since July 2008Unemployment falls below 6% for first time since 2008
By Tami Luhby   @Luhby October 3, 2014: 11:02 AM ET
 
Unemployment rate falls below 6%
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
The nation's unemployment rate fell below 6% in September for the first time in six years.
The rate came in at 5.9%, while employers added 248,000 jobs last month.
The unemployment rate fell last month because more people were getting jobs, not because they were dropping out of the labor force as they have at times during the economic recovery. The share of people in the workforce was essentially unchanged.
Jobs growth was strong in professional and business services, particularly in employment services and consulting. The retail and health care sectors, which have been a powerhouse throughout the recovery, also gained. Construction added 16,000 jobs.
Friday's report is the final one before the mid-term elections on Nov. 4. President Obama touted the strength of the economy recovery in a speech in Chicago Thursday, though he noted that most of the gains are going to the wealthy.
The president's critics , however, say the unemployment rate is declining because people are getting discourage and dropping out of the workforce entirely when they can't find jobs. The share of Americans participating in the labor force is now at its lowest point since 1978, at 62.7% .
The "drop out" factor has been a problem during the recovery, but the recent decrease in the unemployment rate, which stood at 7.2% a year ago, is due more to Americans landing jobs than giving up. Employers have added 2.6 million people to their payrolls since last September.
Related: Bank to pay everyone at least a 'living wage'
The recent hiring boost came after a surprisingly weak August, though the Department of Labor revised that month's figure upward to 180,000 jobs. Still, August was the first time figures came in below 200,000 since January. The August figures were affected by a strike at a New England grocery store chain . Workers there have now returned to work.
The consensus forecast from economists surveyed by CNNMoney was for a jobs gain of 215,000 jobs and an unemployment rate of 6.1%. On average, the economy has been adding well over 200,000 jobs a month this year, a positive sign.
This jobs report is being closely followed because economic data in recent days has been mixed. Everyone from Wall Street investors to Washington powerbrokers is trying to figure out if the U.S. is truly on solid footing or likely to slide back in its recovery like Europe has.
The strong report shows that that the economy has positive momentum going into the final quarter of 2014, said Sam Bullard, senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities.
"It's consistent with an economy that's broadening and strengthening," he said.
Related: Help wanted: College degree not needed
A key figure to watch is whether American wages are growing. Average hourly earnings changed little last month. They are up 2% over the past 12 months, just slightly ahead of inflation, which means most U.S. workers won't feel any better off.
Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen and other officials are closely monitoring the monthly jobs report. They are waiting for hiring to become healthy enough before raising interest rates.
The continuing softness in wage growth and inflation allows the Fed to remain patient when it comes to raising interest rates, said Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist with High Frequency Economics.
 
How to read the jobs report like a pro
Americans' views on hiring are mixed, however.
Gallup's U.S. Job Creation Index reached a six-year high in September, with 42% of employees surveyed saying their employer is hiring and expanding the size of its workforce. Companies are the ones adding to their payrolls, with the government sector continuing to shrink.
But others say there aren't that many job openings out there, especially for positions offering decent wages.
"It's still hard to find a good-paying job," said Jabari Jones, 32, a Forest Park, Ga., resident who said he was fortunate to recently land a $20 hourly job at Coca-Cola.
In a CNN/ORC survey released Thursday, 57% of those polled said the nation's economy was poor.

Samsung Makes Butt Robot With Mom Jeans To Prove Its Phones Don t BendYou know, unlike some of its more prominent competitors .
A video posted to Samsung's official blog Thursday shows the company's Galaxy Note 4 phone subjected to a number of tests. But the most important question of all is clear: Can a Samsung phone withstand a giant butt sitting on it a couple hundred times?
Samsung could have used a regular old human for the test, or a boring robot. Instead, it created this robotic-powered rump. To warm up, the phone was subjected to your standard "tap it back" style sit down.
As you can see, so far so good. But could the Samsung withstand a full-on Miley Cyrus powered twerking session?
OK, so maybe it's not quite that fast in the video. Still, we're pretty impressed.

Clash in Ahmedabad  manyinjuredPrint

A day before Eid-ul-Zuha celebrations, a clash broke out between a mob and the police win the communally sensitive Shahpur area of Ahmedabad late Sunday. The clash occurred when a team from the Ahmedabad Crime Branch reached Shahpur to arrest suspects in a firing incident in Shahibaug area that took place on Saturday night.
The situation turned tense for a few hours and police had to fire tear gas shells to control the mob.
The clash broke out at Rangila Chowky near Pattharwali Masjid when the police team landed in the area for investigation. A mob gathered at the spot and pelted stones. Soon, policemen from Shahpur and neighbouring police stations rushed to the spot to control the situation.
The Shahpur police said that locals were not ready to hear them and objected to the arrest of the suspect from the area. According to the police, the locals alleged that the suspects were being rounded up on false charges. However, the police claimed they went to Shahpur just to check the suspects’ role in animal slaughter.
Two police vans were torched and several private vehicles were damaged in the violence that lasted for a couple of hours.\
A sub-inspector, A G Gohil, was among three policemen injured in the clash. The mob snatched Gohil’s service revolver, the police said. DCP (Crime) Himanshu Shukla also suffered injuries on his leg.
Police Commissioner Shivanand Jha later held a meeting with the local committee members of Shahpur and neighbouring areas to ensure peace during the festival.

KBC dance with Big B costs senior officers  get RamannoticeCM had himself courted Bachchan in Raipur, with the state machinery ensuring that Singh’s house was the first halt of the star in the city.
Written by Ashutosh Bhardwaj | Raipur | Posted: October 6, 2014 1:48 am | Updated: October 6, 2014 4:49 am
They are among the most powerful bureaucrats of Chhattisgarh — one an Additional Chief Secretary and the other a Joint Secretary and the longest-serving OSD (officer on special duty) to Chief Minister Raman Singh. However, when Amitabh Bachchan and Kaun Banega Crorepati came calling on September 28, even they couldn’t control their excitement.
At a recording of the TV show in the city, the two officers and their wives who were occupying prime seats, courtesy VIP passes, got on to the stage and broke into a dance with Bachchan, reportedly to the superstar’s hit Mere angane mein tumhara kya kaam hai.
Both were last week served a written “reprimand notice” for “behaviour unbecoming of an officer” by Chief Secretary Vivek Dhand, on the orders of the CM. The notice warned them against such behaviour in public in the future.
While Additional Chief Secretary M K Rout heads the important departments of Panchayat, Rural and Labour, Raman Singh’s OSD Vikram Sisodia is also the  vice-president of the Chhattisgarh Olympic Association and president of the Chhattisgarh Tennis Association.
The show in question is yet to be aired, and except for those present at the recording, few know what exactly the officers did to invite the CM’s ire. According to sources, someone complained to Raman Singh about their behaviour.
Said an officer: “It’s not about dancing on stage. It’s the way officers conduct themselves. They must maintain decorum and should not be seen jumping queues and joining the public to dance.”
Asked about the notice, Rout, who is not in Raipur, said: “I have absolutely no idea.” Sisodia, who didn’t deny having danced, too claimed not to know about the notice. “I will have to check,” he said.
There are others who see the episode as the handiwork of the officers who themselves couldn’t make it to the TV show’s recording. “What’s wrong in dancing with the mahanayak (superstar)?” said an officer. “What wrong did they commit?”
Incidentally, the CM had himself courted Bachchan in Raipur, with the state machinery ensuring that Singh’s house was the first halt of the star in the city. Bachchan then visited several forthcoming projects — a fact promptly publicised — after which the state government announced that the actor had agreed to lend his voice to the state’s promotion.

U.S. Ebola Patient Fell Ill After Helping Woman: Report
FCC to Marriott: No  you cant force your customers onto terrible hotel WiFi( eyesofrc )
Marriott has agreed to fork over $600,000 after regulators said the hotel chain forced people to buy their pricey, slow WiFi instead of letting customers use their own personal hotspots.
The Federal Communications Commission said Friday that Marriott admitted to using a jamming system in at least one of its hotels in a move that prevented visitors from connecting to the Internet via mobile broadband. The agency said employees at one Tennessee hotel, the Gaylord Opryland, deliberately sought out visitors who were using WiFi hotspots and sent "de-authentication packets" to those devices, disconnecting them from laptops, tablets and phones.
It so happens that this policy runs directly counter to Section 333 of the Communications Act, the FCC's congressional charter. So now, in addition to the fine, Marriott will have to file reports every three months to the FCC showing it's on good behavior.
"It is unacceptable for any hotel to intentionally disable personal hotspots while also charging consumers and small businesses high fees to use the hotel’s own Wi-Fi network," said Travis LeBlanc, the FCC's top enforcement official.
Marriott sells its own WiFi access for $14.95 a day. Those fees can quickly add up, particularly when a customer is being charged separately for each new device , as some have complained. Marriott charges as much as $1,000 per device in some cases, according to the FCC.
Marriott, in a statement, insisted that its actions were legal and designed to thwart "rogue wireless hotspots."
"Like many other institutions and companies in a wide variety of industries, including hospitals and universities, the Gaylord Opryland protected its Wi-Fi network by using FCC-authorized equipment provided by well-known, reputable manufacturers," Marriott said. "We will continue to encourage the FCC to pursue a rulemaking in order to eliminate the ongoing confusion resulting from today's action and to assess the merits of its underlying policy."
@b_fung So at $14.95, Marriott can make up the fine in 40,000 room nights. Shouldn't take too long for the US' largest hotel chain ...
— Mike Feibus (@MikeFeibus) October 3, 2014
Of course, it won't take long for Marriott to recoup the financial cost of its alleged misbehavior.

(Mumbai-based Kaizen Management…)
SINGAPORE: Mumbai-based Kaizen Management Advisors Pvt Ltd will raise another $150 million next year, 50 per cent of which will be placed as equity investment in India's education sector, a top official said here.
The technology-focused equity investor has already invested $55 million in India from its first fund raised in 2012, its managing director and founder Sandeep Aneja said.
"We have so far invested $55 million in seven school-related developments," Aneja said after hosting a one-day symposium attended by investors and school managers from Asia Pacific.
Another $10 to 12 million from the remainder of $70 million first fund will be placed within the next five months.
All of the investment would be for the Indian educational sector, especially in technology-oriented projects.
Kaizen raised its first fund for equity investment from IFC, Swiss Fund for Emerging Markets, HDFC India , UBS Fund of Funds and Bartelsmann .
Aneja said his second round of fund raising would increase the number of equity investors including ADB and CDC, formerly called Commonwealth Development Corp, of the United Kingdom.
An average of $200 million a year was being invested in the Indian educational sector, which offers an attractive return on investment, about 22 per cent to 25 per cent a year, according to Aneja.
"Educational technology is an opportunity to drive better returns," said Aneja, pointing out the adoption of advanced technologies and online learnings by the global educational sector.
Having established in India, Kaizen would also be expanding into South East Asian markets, and would soon set up offices in Singapore and Manila.
"We are expanding into the region," said Aneja. Out of the $150 million to be raised next year, Kaizen would place $75 million in equity investment in India's education sector during 2015-2019 and the remaining $75 million would be invested as equity investment in educational projects in Singapore, Sri Lanka, Myanmar and the Philippines.
The investments, to be made from next year, would be in partnership with local investors in these countries.
India would need Rs 800,000 crore investment in educational sector over the next 15 years through to 2030, according to investors estimate at the joint Kaizen & Insead Educational Symposium 2014 which focused on "Global Trends, Local Realities".

(Airtel is latest to increase…)
NEW DELHI: Telecom operators have raised mobile internet rates up to 100% in June-September period across country. Airtel is latest to increase mobile rates by up to 33% while Vodafone and Idea have started gradually implementing the increased mobile internet rates from June.
The three companies jointly hold around 57% mobile services market share. While no comments were received from Airtel and Idea Cellular, Vodafone India spokesperson said "Around 2 months ago, we changed the base tariff of 2G for 1GB pack from Rs 155 to Rs 175. This has been carried out in a phased manner across circles." Airtel and Idea, too, have increased the rate of 1GB 2G mobile internet pack to around Rs 175 from about Rs 155.
Telecom operators generally don't make public announcement about increase in mobile tariff. The change is noticed on their website after the new rates are implemented. They generally inform their post-paid customer through SMS about change in rates of services before their next billing cycle starts. Pre-paid customers, which constitutes over 90% of market, get to know about rate revision when they go to recharge their mobile phone or through website of companies.
Telecom operators are required to report change in tariff to telecom regulator Trai. Vodafone and Idea Cellular increased rack rate, charged without any offer or scheme, by up to 100% from 2 paise per 10 kb of data usage to 4 paise per 10 kb. This means on Vodafone and Idea network 1 GB of 2G or 3G mobile internet will cost over Rs 4,000 (from Rs 2,000) which these companies under scheme are selling for around Rs 175.
Airtel started increasing mobile internet rates around first week of September. The company is now at par with Vodafone and Idea in terms of rack rate which is 4 paise per 10 kb.
However, the increase is only of 33% because the company was already charging 3 paise per 10 kb earlier. The 2G data pack rate of Airtel is highest among the three at 10 paise per 10 kb which means cost of 1GB mobile internet usage without any scheme or offer for a subscriber is over Rs 10,000 which company is now selling for Rs 176

Jindal Group eyes debt-ridden London MiningAfrican Minerals
(Jindal Group is considering…)
LONDON: Jindal Group is considering a last-minute move to acquire the debt-ridden UK firm London Mining, a media report said today.
The company has been battling big debts, crashing iron-ore prices and the ebola outbreak in Africa, where it operates a mine.
Its shares closed last week at just four pence after it said it was in talks with a strategic partner, but warned any deal could virtually wipe out investors, according to a newspaper report.
A rescue would be likely to require lenders to accept big losses as well, the report said. London Mining operates a small mine in Sierra Leone producing high grade iron-ore but is expensive to run.
Sierra Leone is one of the worst-affected African nations by the ebola pandemic. It has made matters worse for business, with cargo ships charging an extra $2 a tonne for docking in Freetown , Sierra Leone's capital.
A takeover by Jindal, whose operations span cement to oil and steel production, could involve "African Minerals," the newspaper said without clearly identifying the Indian firm.
The London-listed miner founded by tycoon Frank Timis runs a bigger operation nearby. Its shares have also been hammered. Last week it hired Standard Chartered, London Mining's biggest lender, to arrange $500 million in debt to see it through.
African Minerals owns a low-cost rail line and port that would allow London Mining to slash its delivery costs. Jindal is reported to have approached African Mining for an alliance.

There are lessons for the US in Jean-Claude Duvaliers deathDo not repeat mistakes.(AP Photo/Dieu Nalio Chery)
SHARE
Ronald Howell
October 5, 2014
The life of Jean-Claude Duvalier, otherwise known as the Haitian dictator Baby Doc, who died yesterday at his home in Port-au-Prince at age 63, taught me a significant lesson about the US’s historic responsibility for Haiti’s long-standing pains and tragedies.
Soon after Duvalier gave up power and fled Haiti in 1986, I made my first trip there, one of more than a dozen I would take over six years, sometimes staying for months, writing stories about the seemingly natural courage and artistic litheness of a people, but also about the many political killings linked to Duvalier partisans still in the country, and about the ongoing political dysfunction.
It became clear to me, from the beginning, that the US was complicit in all of it.
The special relationship between Haiti and the US goes back to the successful Haitian revolution of 1804, in which ex-slaves led by general Toussaint L’Ouverture overthrew French soldiers under Napoleon Bonaparte. This led to a collective nervous breakdown among the slaveholders in the young United States of America and was in large part responsible for the inhuman repressiveness that reigned in the slave-holding southern states and that continued even after the South was defeated in 1865 in the American Civil War.
The fear of Haiti’s blacks continued to show itself as the US, along with France and Spain, through the 1800s carried out an embargo on trade with Haiti, launching the country into a downward spiral. This in turn led to internal strife and economic instability that gave the US justification, in 1915, for sending in US marines. The American occupation of Haiti lasted two decades and, in a sense, became the foundation of Haiti’s twentieth century existence, in terms of the internal classes of people who were to rise to power through the coming decades.
Freedom-loving Haitians had hoped that the departure of Jean-Claude Duvalier in 1986 would be a precursor to democracy and ultimately to economic sustainability. Jean-Claude was the son and political inheritor François “Papa Doc” Duvalier, whose unrestrained cold-bloodedness during the 1960s took the lives of thousands of Haitians who tried against odds to speak truth to power. And the son, who took power upon the death of his father in 1971, was portrayed by US diplomats as a gentler figure than Papa. But the brutality of the Duvalier henchmen (known as the Tonton Macoutes) against everyday Haitians—and the corruption that made Duvalier friends richer—led to irrepressible public anger.
Seeing that their man could no longer remain in power, the US in 1986 graciously provided the airplane that transported Baby Doc (sometimes referred to as the dim-witted offspring of his Papa) to France, where he remained in exile for 25 years.
The corruption and lying (as well as the undercover complicities with the US) lasted beyond Duvalier’s departure in 1986. Even though Baby Doc was gone, the descent into chaos and poverty continued. The US gave money to military holders of power and continued to pay agents into Haiti, trying to maintain superficial semblances of human interest in the survival of a long suffering sibling nation of the American hemisphere.
Democracy appeared to come finally in the form of a radical progressive Catholic priest, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who took office in February of 1991; but Aristide was overthrown in a military coup seven months later.
From the very beginning it was clear to me, and to many others, that the US, through its agents in Haiti, was involved in that coup.
One of my memories in the days after the coup—in addition to seeing hundreds of bullet-riddle bodies of Aristide supported—was being near a government office where the top Haitian army officers were meeting after the ouster of Aristide. And who was in that meeting also but the top defense intelligence officer assigned to the American embassy.
Over the next several years USAID money would go to fund so-called rights groups and workers whose allegiances necessarily were with the providers of the funding. Many were known to be right-wingers once affiliated with the Duvaliers.
What gave a measure of hope to the lovers of democracy in Haiti was that in 1993 the Democrat Bill Clinton took over the US presidency from George H. W. Bush whose administration had overseen the grave misdoings of previous years. And, for sure, by 1994, US troops were sent to Haiti to ensure that the ousted President Aristide would be returned to office.
But the taste of people power was brief.
The truth of the matter was that Aristide was unable to function with the independence that even scarcely rich neighbors like the Dominican Republic are accustomed to. Undercover subversion, with US government backing, continued to hold sway. Aristide was unable to stop political killings and he himself was accused of corruption.
All this opened a door for Jean-Claude in 2000.
I had the distinct interesting experience in September of that year of speaking to Jean-Claude Duvalier by phone. He was in France and I was in the Valley Stream, Long Island, New York, offices of a right-wing political sympathizer of Duvalier’s, a Haitian businessman who had asked that I not used his name.
Duvalier, speaking in French in a very brief exchange, told me her would one day return to Haiti. We ran the story prominently in Newsday and it was picked up by many other news outlets.
But the best Duvalier quote from that period at a gathering of Duvalier supporters in Brooklyn about a week before I spoke with Baby Doc. According to a transcript read to me by a Duvalier opponent at the time, Baby Doc said: “The cry of the people reaches our heart like an agonizing call that cannot be ignored. Consequently, I offer myself as a guarantor of inevitable changes that must take place in the future, changes without which our country will perish.”
Many thought the assertion that he would return to Haiti was nothing more than a pipe dream, but in fact he did go back to the country 11 years later.
Despite government assertions that Duvalier would be held to account for his many alleged crimes during his time in power, he convinced authorities that he was not guilty of anything punishable; and he lived in luxury until the very end, which was this Saturday when he died of a heart attack at age 63.
Aristide, it should be known, had remained nominally in power through the 1990s, but in 2004 was again sent packing and shipped off to Africa, after thugs (who according to US Congressional testimony had been sponsored by US agents operating out of the neighboring Dominican Republic) overtook parts of the country and created another round of instability.
In March of 2004 I quoted Haitian expert Robert White (who had once been an ambassador to El Salvador and Paraguay) and saying that administration of George Bush (the son) found an opportunity to get rid of Aristide, much as those policy makers working for Bush’s father had done in 1991.
White and others pointed an accusatory finger at Roger Noriega, who was an assistant US secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs under the recent president Bush.
“Roger Noriega has been dedicated to ousting Aristide for many, many years, and now he’s in a singularly powerful position to accomplish it,” White told me.
Aristide, like Duvalier, eventually returned to Haiti in 2011, hoping to be of influence in the presidential election of the time.
But all is not well for Aristide. He has been accused of stealing millions of dollars, an accusation many of his backers say is absurd. And he was ordered recently to stay under house arrest, although supporters of his have maintained there is no Haitian provision for house arrest.
Meanwhile, Duvalier’s death drew what amounts to effective words of praised from the current Haitian president Michel Martelly on Twitter, calling Baby Doc “an authentic son of Haiti.” Martelly said he was sending his “sincere condolences to the family and to the nation.”
Martelly is on fairly good terms with the US. As they often say in French, “Plus ça change, plus c’est la même chose,” or, The more things change, the more they remain the same.”

The best way to teach kids math is not in a classroomWayne Kelsoe
October 5, 2014
As a semi-retired engineer, I often lament efforts to remove shop, technical drawing and other hands-on classes from students’ schedules when they might otherwise understand math as just a dry academic offering. The concept that shop classes serve solely as “industrial education” fail to note its vital role in preparing future architects, engineers, scientists and more. It is classes like shop that reinforce the connection between the tangible and the symbolic—math comes alive when numbers appear as dimensions that you can see and touch. Shapes and angles are observable, and how they meet, fit and feel is appealing to the senses.
A narrowing of experience is happening in lower grades. My friend’s son was struggling with the concepts of area and perimeter, and his teacher expected each student to memorize “P = 2xL + 2xW” and “A=LxW” and take it from there. My friend took his son out to a tennis court with chalk and a tape measure. They measured the perimeter, walked around it, and marked each meter off with chalk. Then they marked off squares and counted them: how many in a row, how many rows and how many total. The lad returned to class with an indelible understanding of how to use perimeter to build a fence and area to buy carpet or paint. He didn’t need a formula because he had a physical concept.
My friend’s son was in a class that evidently “saved time” by avoiding the physical embodiments of distance, space, science, and the connectedness of the world. They went straight to the mathematical symbols and operated on the premise that all one needs to do is memorize a suitable set of rules and operate on them—independent of a vision of the reality that they represent. None of the third graders were successful under the efforts of the teacher who was just following the lesson plan.
The major task of early learning is to build a robust mind-bridge between the tangible, observable world and the symbolic world of words and numbers that we later use as a means of building more complex models. As I spend time with my toddler grandson, I am impressed by his reasoning and observation skills, even though he is barely verbal. I realize that we begin life with non-verbal reasoning according to our observations and sensations—it is only later that we substitute the symbols of language to represent the observed reality.
Neuroscientists have told us for decades that memories and reasoning are a result of connections. Memories are stronger and longer lasting when multiple observations and senses are involved. I would argue that it is a fallacy to assume that we can achieve depth in key subjects by narrowing the breadth of education. By creating artificial walls between subjects, we are attempting to teach in a manner that mimics how the teachers may have learned their subjects late in their academic careers—but it may not be an effective way to learn in younger years. Such segregation of concepts and topics may appear to be efficient, but I would argue that it is less effective.
Lists of independent facts without a network of connections are hard to follow and harder to retain. The problem reminds me of trying to dig a deep, narrow hole in dry sand. As the hole goes down, the sides collapse and fill it back in. It is possible to dig a deep hole, but only if it stretches out to the sides.
I gave a graduation speech many years ago. When asked, “What is the biggest thing you learned after you left school and became a practicing engineer?” my response was that in school, when you have an exam, you at least know what subject you are taking the exam in. In real life, you don’t know if the solution of the day will come from math, physics, chemistry, or just as likely human behavior or the quality of product instructions.
To be sure, shop classes present obstacles. The equipment is costly, the teaching skills are not so common, and the use of modern power tools and even sharp hand tools, present risk and potential liability.
We may be on the edge of a time when the tangible and symbolic are joined by the virtual. Computer generated “reality” in the form of 3D creation may be this century’s “shop class.” The math is a bit less apparent, even though there is a huge amount of math going on in the background, but the relationships of dimensions and shapes are visible. With the availability of 3D printing, even some of the tactile sensations of a shop project may be available. A virtual “shop” also reduces safety concerns, and potentially adds hours of availability. It may also be more appealing, because virtual projects are not bound by the cost barriers that could prohibit the disadvantaged from obtaining necessary materials—a very grand imagination and ambition can be accommodated at no additional costs.
I have used various forms of Computer Aided Design tools for some 30 years and I look forward the continued “democratization” of those tools through less expensive computers and less expensive software. Systems capable of CAD cost about three years engineering salary in the beginning. More powerful computers and more powerful software is available now for a few hundred dollars each. Most video games are more complex than the early CAD systems, and gaming-capable computers are easily 10 times as powerful. We have lost an important bridge between the tangible and symbolic, but with the introduction and growth of a virtual component, we may be able restore that bridge and extend it.

They are among the most powerful bureaucrats of Chhattisgarh — one an Additional Chief Secretary and the other a Joint Secretary and the longest-serving OSD (officer on special duty) to Chief Minister Raman Singh. However, when Amitabh Bachchan and Kaun Banega Crorepati came calling on September 28, even they couldn’t control their excitement.
At a recording of the TV show in the city, the two officers and their wives who were occupying prime seats, courtesy VIP passes, got on to the stage and broke into a dance with Bachchan, reportedly to the superstar’s hit Mere angane mein tumhara kya kaam hai.
Both were last week served a written “reprimand notice” for “behaviour unbecoming of an officer” by Chief Secretary Vivek Dhand, on the orders of the CM. The notice warned them against such behaviour in public in the future.
While Additional Chief Secretary M K Rout heads the important departments of Panchayat, Rural and Labour, Raman Singh’s OSD Vikram Sisodia is also the  vice-president of the Chhattisgarh Olympic Association and president of the Chhattisgarh Tennis Association.
The show in question is yet to be aired, and except for those present at the recording, few know what exactly the officers did to invite the CM’s ire. According to sources, someone complained to Raman Singh about their behaviour.
Said an officer: “It’s not about dancing on stage. It’s the way officers conduct themselves. They must maintain decorum and should not be seen jumping queues and joining the public to dance.”
Asked about the notice, Rout, who is not in Raipur, said: “I have absolutely no idea.” Sisodia, who didn’t deny having danced, too claimed not to know about the notice. “I will have to check,” he said.
There are others who see the episode as the handiwork of the officers who themselves couldn’t make it to the TV show’s recording. “What’s wrong in dancing with the mahanayak (superstar)?” said an officer. “What wrong did they commit?”
Incidentally, the CM had himself courted Bachchan in Raipur, with the state machinery ensuring that Singh’s house was the first halt of the star in the city. Bachchan then visited several forthcoming projects — a fact promptly publicised — after which the state government announced that the actor had agreed to lend his voice to the state’s promotion.

HP plans to split into two companies: ReportHewlett-Packard to split into two companies
Hewlett-Packard to split into two companies
As one of the older big computer companies, for several years HP directors have discussed ways to restructure to keep up with technology upstarts.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
Silicon Valley stalwart Hewlett-Packard Co , which has struggled to adapt to the new era of mobile and online computing, plans to split into two companies as it looks to put more focus on the faster-growing corporate services market, according to a Wall Street Journal report on Sunday.
The move, which could be announced as early as Monday, would be a monumental reshaping of one of technology's most important pioneers, which still has more than 300,000 employees and is on track to book $112 billion in revenue this fiscal year.
Under the reported plan, HP will separate its computer and printer businesses from its corporate hardware and services operations, and spin the unit off through a tax-free distribution of shares to stockholders next year.
A company spokeswoman declined to comment on the report.
HP's printing and personal computing business accounts for about half its revenue and profit, according to last quarter's financial results. It is not clear how many of HP's more than 300,000 staff work in each of the planned businesses.
Founded by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard in a Palo Alto, California garage in 1939, HP was one of the companies that shaped Silicon Valley and the PC revolution. Lately, however, it has struggled to adapt to the shift towards mobile computing, and it has been overshadowed by younger rivals.
HP's market value of $66 billion is dwarfed by Apple Inc's $596 billion and Microsoft Corp's $380 billion.
It has also been overtaken by aggressive Chinese PC maker Lenovo, which is now the world's No. 1 PC maker by shipments. Dell, which is HP's closest U.S. competitor and facing similar pressure, was taken private by founder Michael Dell last year.
SPIN-OFF TREND
HP is the latest in a line of companies, often under shareholder pressure, to spin off operations in an attempt to become more agile and to capitalize on faster-growing businesses. Last week online auction company eBay Inc said it would spin off electronic payment service PayPal.
HP and some of its investors have long considered such a move, the Journal report noted. As one of the older big computer companies, for several years HP directors have discussed ways to restructure to keep up with technology upstarts.
A source familiar with the matter said HP had held merger talks with storage and cloud-computing firm EMC recently, as a way of moving more forcefully into online services.
Many investors and analysts have called for a break-up of the company, or a sale of the personal computer business, so that HP could focus on the more profitable operations of providing computer servers, networking and data storage to businesses.
Company executives have said in the past that personal computers underpin and support the company as a whole. HP did consider spinning off its PC division in 2011 under then-CEO Leo Apotheker, but ultimately decided against the idea.
The PC business has shown signs of life in recent quarters, growing broadly geographically as businesses replace aging machines. Even so, the report of the plan to split off that business surprised some on Wall Street.
"I wonder what would have changed in the board's thinking that previously they thought they needed computers together with services to properly serve large enterprises to now," said Hudson Square Research analyst Daniel Ernst.
"PCs and printing remain in long-term secular decline, and while HP has managed that business well, the challenges for that portion of the split company will only grow as the demand continues to erode, and commoditization forces prices down further."
The Journal, citing one of its sources, said the plans call for current HP CEO Meg Whitman to become CEO of the new so-called enterprise company and also be chairman of the PC and printer company.
Current HP lead independent director Patricia Russo would be chairman of the enterprise company. The CEO of the PC and printer company would be Dion Weisler, who is currently an executive in that division, the report said.

Hong Kong protesters remain at govt headquar...Hong Kong protesters remain at government headquarters as deadline to clear the area looms
By AFP | 6 Oct, 2014, 03.05AM IST
Several thousand defiant protesters remained camped in Hong Kong's Admiralty district on a major highway next to the government complex.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
HONG KONG: Hong Kong's pro-democracy protesters remained stubbornly encamped outside the city's government headquarters in the early hours of Monday, with no sign that they would meet a deadline to clear the area by morning.
Embattled Hong Kong leader Leung Chun-ying has said his administration is determined to "take all necessary actions to restore social order" and allow government staff to resume work by Monday morning.
Leung was forced to close the Central Government Offices on Friday because of the crowds of protesters blocking its access roads, with 3,000 civil servants unable to go to work.
But several thousand defiant protesters remained camped in Hong Kong's Admiralty district on a major highway next to the government complex, an AFP reporter said.
"We will stay here all night and wait for the police to attack," said 20-year-old protester Ken Chung, a mask covering his face.
"It's going to be a long fight." But there was a relaxed atmosphere amongst the largely youthful crowds, who sat chatting in small groups, checking their phones and sleeping on the floor as Monday began.
Many expressed doubt that the police would forcibly clear them from the highway.
"I heard some rumours that the police will clear tonight -- but they say that every day," said Karen Kwong, who has been coming to the protest for seven days.
Admiralty is home to the largest of several protest camps that have sprung up across the semi-autonomous Chinese city in the last week as tens of thousands took to the streets to demand Beijing grants free elections.
Sprawling over a large stretch of a major multi-lane highway, the Admiralty camp has been the focal point of protests that have brought key parts of the Asian financial hub to a standstill.

GM recalls reach 30 million for yearGM recalls reach 30 million for year

GM deaths rise, may keep rising
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
If you own a General Motors vehicle, it's worth the few seconds it takes to go on the company's website to check if your car has been recalled.
GM ( GM ) announced additional recalls Saturday, bringing its 2014 count to about 30 million vehicles.
An ignition problem is at the heart of the latest recall.
On certain Pontiac G8 and Chevrolet Caprice models, the vehicles "may experience unintended key rotation from the 'Run' to 'ACC' position if the driver's knee interacts with the ignition key," according to GM.
GM is under fire after disclosing a fatal ignition switch flaw in February. CEO Mary Barra testified in front of Congress this spring to explain how the problem was overlooked for a decade.
Related: 1 million GM cars with fatal defect still on road
The company has been reviewing all of its older vehicles for issues. CEO Mary Barra said last month the company is mostly done with that process.
The latest recalls announced today affect about 60,000 cars, including some Pontiac G8, Chevrolet Caprices and Cadillac models. The Caprice model is a police vehicle.
The Cadillacs have a different kind of problem that impacts the vehicle's fuel pump. Most dealers should be able to replace the faulty part, the company said.
No injuries or fatalities have been reported from these latest problems, although GM is aware of one crash.
Despite the high profile of the ignition switch recall, which has been tied to at least 23 deaths so far, many GM car owners aren't bothering to get the replacement parts. As CNNMoney reported this week, over a million cars with the fatal defect are still on the road.
The latest recalled models are:
2008-2009 Pontiac G8
2011-2013 Chevrolet Caprice PPV (police patrol vehicles)
2004-2007 Cadillac CTS-V

India  US to ramp up efforts to cut use of HFCsIndia, US set to ramp up efforts to cut use of hydroflurocarbons

The joint statement issued by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Barack Obama reiterates the decision taken in September last year. 
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
NEW DELHI: US to work together on cutting the use of hydroflurocarbons (HFCs), gases in airconditioners and refrigerators that have global warming potential, doesn't signal a major breakthrough. However, the symbolic value for both countries is immense - it allows the US to claim leadership role in the global effort to tackle climate change by grabbing low-hanging fruit and presents India an opportunity to shed its obstructionist image in international fora.
The joint statement issued by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Barack Obama reiterates the decision taken in September last year. Both leaders once again "recognised" the need to "use the institutions and expertise of the Montreal Protocol to reduce consumption and production of HFCs, while continuing to report and account for the quantities reduced under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change."
The Montreal Protocol is the UN-sponsored agreement concerned with protecting ozone layer, under which the consumption and production of chlorofluorocarbons was phased out and substituted by HFCs. The pledge to "urgently arrange" a meeting of the joint India-US task force on HFCs before the next meeting of the Montreal Protocol scheduled in November may be viewed by some as a move forward. However, the issues — safety, cost and commercial access to new or alternative technologies to replace HFCs — remain unresolved.
"Accounting isn't the main issue. The real concern is that there is no proven and economically viable alternative that is available. We have held three or four meetings with industry representatives and they raise the issue of viable alternatives," a senior official told ET.
Following the meeting of the joint task force, "the two sides would thereafter cooperate on next steps to tackle the challenge posed by HFCs to global warming." There are no timelines for the follow-up action, much like the decision between Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping in June last year.
The Modi-Obama statement reflects a renewed commitment to an existing understanding to work together to reduce the production and consumption of HFCs and to identify viable alternatives. The US has taken the lead to forge a consensus to allow for discussions on phasing out of HFCs under the Montreal Protocol.
The real value of the effort may be limited. HFCs account for about 1% of greenhouse gas emissions, according to UN estimates. Experts say the share could rise to 3% by 2030 and the United Nations Environment Programme estimates HFC emissions at 7% to 19% of carbon dioxide emissions in 2050.
For Washington , India's decision helps buttress the Obama administration's green credentials and addresses a domestic constituency that see countries such as India and China getting a free pass on tackling climate change. For New Delhi, it is a clear signal that it is unwilling to be the last man standing on phasing out HFCs and that it is mindful of the need to take efforts, even in small measures.

Coal blocks: Hindalco faces turmoil on SC ruling, pricing pressure
Megha Mandavia, ET Bureau Oct 6, 2014, 03.49AM IST
(The Kumar Mangalam Birlacontrolled company…)
NEW DELHI: Hindalco Industries is entering one of the toughest phases in its existence. The aluminium major, which has lost mining rights on all the coal blocks allocated to it and is witnessing uncertainty over several bauxite mines, will likely face turmoil in the next couple of years, say analysts, as cost of production increases and expenses to acquire coal assets afresh are likely to go up.
The Kumar Mangalam Birla-controlled company had Rs. 63,300 crore of debt at the end of March on a consolidated level. It is already dealing with poor aluminium demand in India and sluggish global prices. US-based unit Novelis — even though at the end of its capital-expenditure plan and is earning better now — is still facing pricing pressure in some markets.
Its net profit fell 28% to Rs. 2,175 crore in the fiscal year ended on March 31, despite a 9% increase in revenue at Rs. 87,695 crore.
"All ratios are looking poor. I admit to that," chairman Birla said at the annual general meeting last month. He predicted the situation to improve as Hindalco completes its projects in the works. "Gradually, in the next few years, our ratios will look much stronger than we ever had in the past," he said.
Analysts, too, expect the company to bounce back once the uncertainty is over. But, for the moment, more cash is set to flow out.
The Supreme Court recently revoked mining licences for more than 200 coal blocks given to several companies. Companies that had started mining operations were also told to pay a fine on the coal they have already mined.
Hindalco, which has one such mine where it has started production, said it would take a one-time hit of Rs. 500 crore on account of this penalty. It also needs to source all the coal it requires at market price. And the company is likely to try and get back its mines when the government puts up the cancelled blocks on sale again, likely through auctions.
Hindalco lost some of its bauxite mines after another Supreme Court order limited lease extensions without licence renewals.Hindalco said it is expected to get its licences renewed in six months and that it had enough bauxite, a key raw material in aluminiummaking. But state governments are yet to announce any concrete timeline on renewing licences.
In a report late last month, ratings firm Crisil said Hindalco's cost of production in the domestic alumin ium business may increase post March 31, 2015 be cause of the cancel lation of its captive coal blocks, "lead ing to lower-than expected cash ac cruals over the me dium term". It also revised the outlook on Hindalco's long term `AA' debt rat ing to "negative" from "stable".
Hindalco's consolidated debt-to-equity ratio currently stands at 1.57, while that on debt-to-earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation is 7.6.Other than the risks from high debt and cost overruns, uncertainties on the viability of new projects at Mahan in Madhya Pradesh and Sambalpur in Odisha remain. While Hindalco has spent all it had to on these projects, cash flow from these large investments is yet to accrue.Without captive coal, these projects are likely to become non-viable. Market coal at around Rs. 2,500 a tonne is three times more expensive than captive coal. Hindalco needs more than 10 million tonnes of coal annually.
To contain some of its rising depreciation and interest costs, Hindalco has been commissioning its projects even without access to cheap coal. Hindalco's aluminium producing capacity will increase to 1,300 kilo tonnes per annum from 600 ktpa when it completes ramping up its current projects.
State Bank of India, the largest lender to Hindalco's projects in India with total exposure of Rs. 17,200 crore, is not, too, worried. A senior official from SBI, who did not want to be named, said Hindalco should not face any repayment pressures as it is a company with a large operating profit. But there is uncertainty in the interim, and its turnaround depends heavily on the government's swiftness in auctioning coal mines and grant of mining leases.
"Hindalco's performance will remain impacted for the next one two years. There is too much uncertainty about Mahan coal. Even though there might not be too many bidders, there are other issues regarding forest area, gram sabha... there is uncertainty regarding bauxite mining, too," said Goutam Chakrabarty, an analyst at Emkay Global. The company's coal block in Mahan now stands cancelled and transporting coal from elsewhere to its landlocked Mahan smelter will be a challenge.
Hindalco's hopes are pinned on improving aluminium prices globally. It is also dependent on Novelis' performance for continued flow of dividends. Last year, Novelis paid $250 million as dividend. This was a huge contribution from Novelis, considering it generated about $254 million in cash between fiscal 2008 and 2014 cumulatively and its debt is under review for a possible default by Moody's.
Analysts expect that once all the uncertainty is over, Hindalco is well placed to win mines in coal auctions.
"With operational end-use plants, the size of its balance sheet, end of capex cycle, Hindalco is better placed to bid for coal blocks as and when the government is ready with bid documents and process," said Motilal Oswal analyst Sanjay Jain. "Smaller companies who have lost the coal blocks are at a disadvantage due to balance sheet stress and the disproportionately large size of coal blocks that they may have to bid for."

New Motor Vehicles Act proposes big finesNew Motor Vehicles Act proposes big fines for uninsured vehicles owners
By Shilpy Sinha , ET Bureau | 6 Oct, 2014, 08.27AM IST
Tweet
The draft version of the Bill, which was put on the ministry’s website on September 13, seeking feedback from the public, has largely attracted attention. 
MUMBAI: Driving an uninsured car or motorcycle may cost you dear, if proposals in the new Road Transport & Safety Bill are passed by the Parliament without changes.  General insurance companies, on the other hand, will be smiling all the way to the bank.
If a motorcyclist is caught riding without an insurance policy, the penalty will be Rs 10,000 while owners of light motor vehicles and autorickshaws will have to cough up Rs 25,000. For any car or a truck driver caught driving without an insurance policy, the penalty is as high as Rs 75,000. This compares to a fine of Rs 1,000 for all vehicles under the law currently in  place.
Bill Will Replace Motors Vehicles Act
The draft version of the Bill, which was put on the ministry's website on September 13, seeking feedback from the public, has largely attracted attention because it has proposed stringent penalties for traffic offences such as drunken driving and an accident in which a child is killed.
However, the fines for driving uninsured vehicles are also many times existing levels and could drive up insurance  penetration manifold if the final version is similar to the draft one. "This (the enhanced penalties) will increase penetration of motor insurance," said Vijay Kumar head of  motor insurance Bajaj Allianz General Insurance. The Bill will replace the Motors Vehicles Act, 1988.
Although insuring any automobile plying on the road is mandatory, many people violate the rule. A study by New India Assurance Ltd, state-run general insurer, has shown that nearly 70% of motorcy cles and scooters on the road are not insured. About a third of the cars and trucks are uninsured as well. Insurance company officials say that penalties should go beyond fines and include loss of licence for repeated violations. "More than the extent of fine, it is the ability not to drive that would be important for insurance companies," said Sanjay Datta, head of motor insurance at ICICI Lombard. "If the rules say that a three motorcytime offender will lose his licence, it will bring discipline."
To promote insurance penetration among automobile users, the Insurance Regulatory & Development Authority is easing its rules. It has allowed longer tenure policies - these include a three-year policy for twowheelers as well as third-party insurance. Long term products for car insurance are also in the works. Insurance companies have suggested to the government that third party liability should be limited to Rs 10 lakh. So far, liability for motor vehicles is unlimited while it is capped at Rs 5 lakh for aircraft and Rs 2 lakh for railways.
The industry also wants the claim allowed under two jurisdictions— one, where the accident has happened and the other where the vehicle is registered. Also, the claim has to be filed within three years of the accident taking place. The Bill has proposed setting up a motor accident fund to help grievously injured people and compensate legal representatives of a victim

Farmers to suffer losses as onion prices set to fall further

(Onion farmers are staring…)
PUNE: Onion farmers are staring at the prospect of losses this year as the already low prices could drop even further with the arrival of kharif crop in the market. The wholesale price of onion has fallen 40% in the past three months to Rs 12 per kg at Lasalgaon in Nashik, the country's onion hub.
This followed the government's decision to bring the commodity under the Essential Commodity Act to check soaring prices. Prices had begun to rise towards the end of June amid speculation that hailstorms, which hit Maharashtra in March and April, would adversely affect the crop.
But this proved wrong as the country had an all-time high onion harvest in the following months. Experts say such speculative movement of price could be checked to a large extent if authorities maintain correct data of the area under the crop cultivation. "No government agency could correctly estimate the huge increase in area under onion. Despite the heavy loss caused by hailstorm, we have so much of onion still coming to the market," said Nanasaheb Patil,chairman, Lasalgaon APMC and director National Agricultural Co-operative Marketing Federation (Nafed).
Onion arrival in Lasalgaon jumped 581% year-on-year to 3.75 lakh quintal in September this year. The market had seen only 55,000 quintal of onion in September 2013. The trend is continuing even this month.
Lasalgaon saw arrival of 13,000 quintal of onion on the first day of October, against 12,500 quintal in the entire October month last year. In addition, erratic weather pushed up the input costs of farmers. In normal course, onion prices increase between June and November as the stored stock dwindles.
With a higher price in later months, farmers are able to make up for the losses in storage. But it may not be the case this year as there is no shortage of the commodity. The 'Pol' variety (early kharif) of onion is expected to flood the markets by the first week of November. Traders expect prices to rise to about Rs 15/kg after Diwali. But no one now is now talking about a jump in onion prices.

Are A Lack of Boundaries Holding Your Career Backreddit
Do you have trouble saying "no" to people at work?  With the constantly growing list of opportunities we have to say "yes" to, most of us find setting boundaries more challenging than ever before.
Yes, I can take on that extra project, although my days are already too full.  Yes, I can have that difficult conversation, even though it's your responsibility and not mine. Yes, I can work over the weekend, even though my family and friends had plans.
Sound familiar at all?
"Learning to set and keep clear boundaries with your boss and colleagues is essential if you want to remain happy and productive at work," explained best-selling author and resilience, wellbeing and productivity coach Valorie Burton when I interviewed her recently.
Click here to listen to the free podcast.
"Boundaries are a definition.  Think of it like owning a house where you have specific boundaries around that property and you know what is your responsibility to take care of, and when you step out of that you know the area that's not your responsibility," suggested Valorie.
"When we begin to blur those lines, that's where we tend to find ourselves in situations that become very frustrating."
Setting boundaries means saying "no" by asking for the respect we want and honoring these needs.  Valorie recommends trying these five steps to making setting boundaries easier at work:
Get clear on the boundaries you need - Start by asking what are the boundaries you need to protect your own peace, joy and serenity at work.  Try to clearly envision what your life at work would be like if these boundaries were respected and gracefully enforced.  Ask yourself: "What does that give me? How does it feel when I have clear boundaries? How does it feel when I am operating at my optimal potential?"  Then notice the areas where you most feel frustrated, stressed or overwhelmed currently and how, when and by whom these boundaries are being crossed.
Challenge the stories that hold you back - When it comes to setting boundaries, we often catastrophize about the consequences of saying 'no' to other people at work.  It takes a lot of courage to sit down with your boss and say, "I need to do this differently. Can we talk this through?"  What if it upsets them, they no longer like you, or maybe you could even be fired! Ask yourself: "Who am I most afraid to say no to? What am I afraid will happen if I do?"  Make the space for self-reflection and write out what you need to say this person to help you feel more confident about honoring the boundaries you require to maintain your happiness and success at work.
Start with one conversation -  Don't try and set all your boundaries at once.  Take it one conversation at a time and practice identifying, asking and keeping a boundary.  Notice what works, adjust what doesn't and keep moving forward to make these conversations an effective part of the way you work.
Enforce your boundaries - Create a plan of action for what will happen when your boundaries are crossed . Be sure to compassionately let people know when you feel your boundaries are not being respected (most people will mean no malice, but may be unaware of the impact their behavior is having on you). Communicate clearly what choices you will need to make to honor the boundaries you've set to ensure you can successfully support yourself, your team and your organization.
Pay attention to what works - When you begin moving forward and setting better boundaries, give yourself credit for each step forward.  You'll find, just like a baby learning to walk, from time to time you may stumble but if you keep getting back up then eventually you won't fall as much. Setting boundaries takes practice so give yourself permission to keep learning and growing knowing that this is a skill vital for your success and happiness.
For more ways to set boundaries successfully at work be sure to check out Valorie's new book "Get Unstuck, Be Unstoppable" .
And if you'd like more tested, practical ways to show up, shine and succeed at work then grab this free podcast series from leading thinkers in the field of human flourishing.

Alleges wrongful termination, seeks damages
Bangalore October 3:  
Jack Palmer, who was responsible for starting a US investigation into Infosys’ visa practices, has filed a fresh lawsuit against the company for wrongfully terminating him and has sought damages.
The US national, who was fired last year, has in his latest lawsuit filed in a district court in New Jersey, asked Infosys to compensate him for damages and even rehire him, according to an email sent to BusinessLine by Palmer’s lawyer.
In his complaint, Palmer has named Chairman Emeritus NR Narayana Murthy; former CEO SD Shibulal, and former legal head Jeffrey Friedel.
However, the lawsuit does not mention the quantum of damages sought. The lawsuit also alleges that apart from retaliation, Infosys punished Palmer by blacklisting him, putting him on leave, denying him work, denying him promotions and bonuses, eventually demanding his resignation and denying him re-employment and has put him on a blacklist of former employees who are ineligible for rehire.
When contacted, an Infosys spokesperson said: “Palmer’s current complaint… is a repetition of issues that were tried and dismissed by a federal court in 2012. Palmer resigned in 2013 November and released the company from the charges he has alleged in the complaint. We believe this is without any legal merit and will vigorously defend this complaint and expect the issue to be resolved at the earliest.”

Watch: When a triad mob attacked Hong Kongs protestersBy Ishaan Tharoor October 4 Follow @ishaantharoor
The YouTube video above , published by supporters of Hong Kong's pro-democracy student movement, provides a useful synopsis of eve nts on Friday, when a mob of counter-protesters descended on a student-run Occupy site in the district of Mong Kok. The scuffles and violence that broke out horrified the city and led to student leaders pulling out of talks with the Hong Kong government that had, if only briefly, offered the prospect of a resolution to the week-long protests.
The rancor of the moment has lingered well into the next day, with the threat of further violence still hanging over the city. The pro-democracy camp is justifiably angry with the Hong Kong government and its police force for doing little to thwart the mobs of "blue ribbons" -- the color now associated with those opposed to the ongoing "yellow ribbon" protests -- from attacking occupied protest sites on Friday. As the video shows, even when police tried to evacuate the protesters away from the clutches of the mob, the demonstrators were buffeted on all sides by harassment and abuse.

The student protesters point to the contrast between what happened Friday to the heavy-handed actions taken the week before, when the police lobbed round after round of tear gas on peaceful protesters. Rights group Amnesty International accused the Hong Kong police of "failing in their duty" on Friday.
Many also believe the apparently coordinated nature of the counter-protester offensive suggests the involvement of Hong Kong's notorious organized crime syndicates, or triads, in collusion with the authorities.

On Saturday, Occupy protest sites in Causeway Bay and Mong Kok saw heated arguments between student protesters and elderly locals. The students had reclaimed the site in Mong Kok  overnight, but it became the source of acrimonious shouting and squabbling between the groups.
While there may be some truth to the activists' allegations of paid "thugs" attacking them, it's also clear that some local Hong Kongers are genuinely fed up with the continued occupations, which have snarled traffic and disrupted businesses. Liam Fitzpatrick, a Hong Kong-based editor at TIME magazine, offers a bit more background :
Most members of the blue-ribbon mobs, however, appear to working class, conservative Hong Kongers, who regard the student protests as a threat to economic stability when the ruinously high cost of living makes day-to-day survival difficult for many.
In North Point, a district further east of Admiralty and Causeway Bay that's historically been a beachhead for immigrants from the mainland, residents wearing blue ribbons rallied Saturday morning alongside the police.

The divisions within this city of 7.2 million people are becoming more and more pronounced, and the Hong Kong government seems confident in its ability to wait out the protesters, who themselves know that they are losing popular support.
During a news conference Saturday, the city's secretary for security, Lai Tung-Kwok, said the protesters' allegations that the police conspired with triads were "fabricated and unjustified" and applauded the efforts of his charges. "Our police will, as what they have been doing this past week, faithfully and truthfully enforce the law with patience," he said.

Its Sunday. Are you watching your football  ladiesBy Jessica Contrera October 5 Follow mjcontrera
Katy Perry got weird again yesterday, this time on ESPN. She wasn’t performing at halftime or selling chips in a sports bra; she was making football predictions on College Game Day.
“I’m picking this one based on looks,” she said before professing her crush on Oklahoma quarterback Trevor Knight.
We’re not sure whose idea it was for Perry to don a fuzzy pink jersey and discuss NCAA football, but it might be a sign that ESPN is taking a page out of the NFL book.
In case you’ve missed the NFL’s advertising frenzy in the midst of its mishandling of domestic abuse cases, the league has upped its ongoing effort to recruit women to be football fans. What was once limited to selling team swag in pastel colors is now a full-fledged mission to expand the fan base to those without Y chromosomes.
Take this 2013 ad. We imagine the pitch went something like: fierce-looking ladies + doing cool things in blazers + an adorable baby … and they’re all wearing tightly fitted NFL jerseys!
The same year, the league bought out print advertisements in seven women’s magazines, including a 16-page spread in Marie Claire called “The Savvy Girl’s Guide to Football.” Minka Kelly of “Friday Night Lights” — a show that had been off the air for two plus years — graced the cover .
This season, the commercial for the NFL shop is narrated by a woman explaining how her “Vikings family became a Vikings-Bengals-Eagles-Steelers-Cowboys family.” What’s team loyalty when you can sell $294 jerseys to moms?
Such adept sporty ladies can then “get their #gameface on” and paint their nails with a “#fanicure” thanks to NFL sponsor Covergirl’s line of beauty products for each NFL team. (Rhinestone-studded helmet apparently not for sale.)
Covergirl.com
That Covergirl ad for the Ravens, the team of Ray Rice, became the subject of protest during the fallout from the domestic violence scandal. But the makeup giant refused to drop its sponsorship of the NFL.
Surely the league is hoping that its female fans won’t drop the NFL either. In the past month, women have been hired to multiple high-level positions, including vice president  of public policy and government affairs, chief marketing officer and senior adviser on domestic conduct.
Still to be determined: whether such moves will do enough for the NFL to keep a stronghold on its biggest opportunity for growth.
And whether we’ll be seeing more of Katy Perry. According to the Wall Street Journal, she’s among the potential halftime show performers for Super Bowl 2015. It might not hurt that her College Gameday predictions were actually pretty good.

Matt Williams offers a more detailed explanation for pulling Jordan Zimmermann for Drew StorenBy James Wagner October 5 Follow @jameswagnerwp

Matt Williams prides himself on moving on. After bad games or decisions, he quickly brushes them aside and his attention turns to the next challenge. The Nationals, however, are in a dire situation, trailing the Giants, 2-0, in the NLDS with Game 3 on Monday in San Francisco. The plane ride here after a gut-wrenching, 18-inning loss was long but it gave players and coaches a chance to dissect the previous two games and figure out what needs to improve.
Williams, too, was part of the introspection. One decision gnawed at him during the cross-country, red-eye flight: his much-debated removal of Jordan Zimmermann with two out in the ninth inning of Game 2 after Zimmermann issued his first walk of the game and his insertion of closer Drew Storen, who blew the save after allowing hits to Buster Posey and Pablo Sandoval.
“Any time you make a decision on something and it doesn’t work, you kick yourself,” Williams said on Sunday. “I kicked myself all night. That’s human nature.”
Although Williams wasn’t happy with the results, he was still comfortable with the reasoning behind the decision-making. And a day after the decision, he offered a more lengthy and detailed explanation for his actions. In his own words:
“We also have a reason for that move. The reason for that move, as I explained last night, was Buster missed a breaking ball on him, hit a deep fly ball to right field on a fastball, hit a first-pitch slider and lined it to third base that Anthony Rendon made a great play on. All of those things go into the decision.
“To say, ‘Okay, we need Drew ready for the Buster.” If we get there, one, we gave Jordan the opportunity to go out there and complete the game. But knowing that if he gets in trouble, that we have our closer up and available and ready. That’s standard practice.
“You kick yourself any time it doesn’t work. However, you have to put your guys in a position to do their jobs and do what they do. So that being said, I don’t have a problem with it. It didn’t work out. But we’ve got our best guy, who is the closer coming in to pick up the guy that just gave us all he had for eight and two-thirds.
“Now, could you say that it was the wrong move? Of course you can. You could say that. Could you say it was the right move? Yes, you could say that as a well. It didn’t work out. That being said, I kick myself for bringing Drew in and having him tie the game. Beyond that, we had nine more innings to win it.”
There are several layers to Williams’ explanation but they boil down to a handful of key points: 1) Williams wanted to give Zimmermann a chance at completing the game. His pitch count was only at 95 when he took the mound in the ninth and he had retired 20 straight batters before he walked Joe Panik. 2) Williams didn’t want Zimmermann to face Posey if he was in trouble. Although the results didn’t show it, Posey had hit the ball hard against Zimmermann. 3) Storen is the Nationals’ closer, has done exceptionally well in that role and Williams had all the confidence in him to get one more out.
The situation made sense for Storen. The right-hander was one of the best relievers in baseball this season and, undoubtedly, the best on the Nationals this season. Since taking over  the job in early September, Storen was 10 for 10 in save situations. He also hadn’t allowed an earned run in 23 outings to end the season. Although Posey was 2 for 3 against Storen during his career, right-handers hit .184 against Storen this season.
An issue with Williams’ reasoning could be that he didn’t give Storen a chance to start the inning clean. It’s hard to ask a reliever to come in to a high-leverage situation with a runner on base. Storen has inherited 24 runners this season and allowed only 10 to score, a 42 percent success rate.
“I don’t want Drew coming into the game with first and second and two out,” Williams said. “I want to him the opportunity to get Posey. And he didn’t. And Sandoval hit a ball down the line. So, it happened. That’s baseball. What can you do about it except adjust from there and go on.”
Williams said Storen missed location with his sinker to Sandoval, leaving it over the plate too much. Pitch F/X shows the pitch was low and toward the outer half of the plate, and Sandoval simply flared it to left field for the game-changing RBI double.
“He just missed on one,” Williams said. “That’s what it is. He’s our closer. He’s been perfect in every situation we put him in since he’s been in that role exception of the last game he pitched. So we get in that situation tomorrow where we have the opportunity for him, we want him to get back out there and do what he does.”
Any ire with Williams about the decision could be misplaced. Williams has sound reasoning for bringing in Storen, a dominant right-handed reliever, in to face an exceptional right-handed batter to get the final out for a starter he felt was entering in a less-than-ideal matchup. It backfired. But there is also sound reasoning for leaving Zimmermann in. The playoffs are unique and perhaps breaking convention to leave Zimmermann in could have served the Nationals well. If the Nationals had lost either way — with Zimmermann or Storen on the mound — outcry for the other move would have been just as loud.
James Wagner joined the Post in August 2010 and, prior to covering the Nationals, covered high school sports across the region.

Retailer Tesco  Tatas work to get the fit rightFDI
(Tesco’s core business…)
MUMBAI: British retailer Tesco has moved a step closer to the Tatas by aligning the top management of its back-end unit with Trent Hypermarket as it prepares to open nearly 300 neighbourhood convenience stores modelled on Tesco Express.
Tesco's core business in India has been restricted mainly to Tesco Hindustan Wholesaling, which supplies merchandise, including some of its own labels, to a dozen Star Bazaar outlets, sized anywhere between 40,000-80,000 square feet and from selling food and grocery to apparel to consumer durables. Most of the top management from Tesco Hindustan Wholesaling has been inducted into Trent Hypermarket as part of an internal cost-cutting exercise even as it plans to open 300 Star Daily small-format stores in the next three years, according to an official aware of the plan.
When contacted, Tesco said its local partner should comment. Trent didn't respond to an email query. "They are mostly targeting residential complexes to set up their new stores sized anywhere between 500 and 2,000 square feet," added the official. Globally, stores such as 7-Eleven in Japan, Taiwan, Thailand and Singapore, Lawson in Japan and Oxxo in Mexico are among the largest retailers in their respective markets, reflecting the growing business of small outlets in several countries despite the presence of international supermarket and hypermarket chains.
"While the intent is on the right track, execution will be a challenge considering it's not easy to find many locations or residential localities especially in cities that can fit such stores," said Ruchi Sally, director at boutique retail consultancy Elargir Solutions.
Tesco runs more than 1,500 convenience stores averaging 2,200 square feet in small shopping precincts in residential areas and countryside in the UK. "The response to this new format has been encouraging and we are considering possibilities of replicating this model in areas where larger Star Bazaars already operate. The intent is simultaneously leveraging the supply chain gains of being proximately located to a Star Bazaar hypermarket store and at the same time being readily accessible to customers within dense catchments," said Trent's annual report for 2014.
In the year ended March 2014, like-forlike sales growth of Star Bazaar stores dropped 4.8% with total revenue of Rs 820.76 crore, posting a loss of Rs 55.79 crore. In May this year, fair trade regulator Competition Commission of India cleared Tesco's purchase of a 50% stake in Trent Hypermarket, making it the first FDI transaction in multi-brand retail since the sector was opened up in 2012.
The CCI approval came as a political debate over foreign direct investment (FDI) in multi-brand retail has been revived. Since four outlets out of the 16 Star stores operated by Trent Hypermarket were in Gujarat and Tamil Nadu that do not allow FDI in multi-brand retail trade, the stores were divested into a separate wholly owned subsidiary of Trent, Fiora Hypermarkets.

Uber replacing it s existing fleet with Inno...Tweet
The company launched operations in India last year with its luxury segment, Uber Black, in cities such as Bangalore, Delhi and Mumbai.
BANGALORE/NEW DELHI: Taxi hailing app Uber which made a splash last year debuting with a squadron of BMWs, Mercedes' and Audis appears to have dropped these luxury cars from its fleet and is instead focusing on adding more Innovas and Corollas.
The company launched operations in India last year with its luxury segment, Uber Black, in cities such as Bangalore, Delhi and Mumbai. However, it has scaled down its luxury fleet. In cities such as Bangalore, Uber has almost entirely moved payment for its luxury vehicles to a commission basis from a lump sum at the end of the month.
This has made operators move their fleet to economical sedans than an Audi or BMW, which are costlier to run. In Delhi too, Uber has moved its Uber Black drivers to a commission basis.
Luxury cab operators confirm this development. "When Uber entered India, they used to hire our luxury cars like an Audi or BMW for on a monthly basis for anywhere between Rs 85,000 to Rs 2 lakh per car," said the founder of one of the biggest luxury car operators in Bangalore on condition of anonymity. "In a few months, they asked us to move to a commissionbased model. As the rate was very low, we decided to stop services." Uber charges Rs 200 as the minimum fare followed by a rate of Rs 18 per km for a Uber Black cab.
Two Uber employees confirmed the development. However, Uber officially declined to comment on the story. "We have moved to 100% commission basis in Bangalore for Uber Black. In other cities such as Delhi and Mumbai, the fleet of luxury cabs such as Audi is reduced as we have added more Innovas," said an Uber official on condition of anonymity.
Several frequent Uber customers told ET that they have not been picked up in an Audi or a BMW for as long as six months. "Now all I get is to travel in cabs such as Toyota Innova or a Honda City , and I travel by Uber almost every other day," said a Bangalore-based entrepreneur.
Marketers feel that it will be difficult for Uber India to gain that upper class brand positioning again. "Downgrading a brand offering is a letdown for the upwardly mobile customers who will be difficult to regain," said Ambika Sharma, founder and MD of Pulp Strategy, a brand activation company based in Delhi, which works with clients such as Microsoft and Intel.
"It is advisable for luxury brands to create a lower segment while maintaining existing customers at higher prices, just as companies such as Burberry have done," Sharma added. According to sources, Uber spends about Rs 1-5 crore on launch in a new city in India and the offer of a premium vehicle like a BMW is just to create a brand in the minds of the SEC A customers.
This market entry strategy of Uber has peeved luxury cab operators. Bangalore based Shrusti Travels, which offers luxury cars on rent, had partnered with Uber when the global luxury car rental aggregator had launched its service in Karnataka.
However, the association did not last long. "We worked with them only for four months. Our working styles and requirements do not match," said a manager at Shrusti, who did not want to be named.

why does the fact that the current price is low (according to u) make it a good long term buy?
the govt doesn`t have to sell right now, but they have to sell within the next 3 yrs. the longer the disinvestment gets delayed, the longer the overhang will be on the stock price of nhpc. afterall, the govt HAS TO SELL 120 crore shares.
the mkts moved up sharply after the BJP victory in the general elections. even this scrip moved up to above 29 levels. but that level was not sustained and the subsequent fall has taken it back to the earlier level of 19! if the stock performs the way it has in a bullish mkt, what is the guarantee that the share price will move up within the next 3 yrs, for the govt to sell its huge stake at a better than current price? see the earlier chronology of events when the earlier disinvestment was to happen and the current happenings. it`s basically history repeating itself.

HIV pandemics genesis in the 1920s was in Kinshasa  say scientistsUpdated: October 3, 2014 23:02 IST
HIV pandemic’s genesis in the 1920s was in Kinshasa, say scientists

TOPICS
AIDS
A “perfect storm” of urban change that began in 1920s Kinshasa led to the catastrophic spread of HIV across Africa and into the wider world, according to scientists who used genetic sequencing and historical records to trace the origins of the pandemic.
Though the virus probably crossed from chimpanzees to humans in southern Cameroon years earlier, HIV remained a regional infection until it entered the capital of what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
From the 1920s until 1960, the pandemic HIV strain — there were others that fizzled out — spread from Kinshasa, crossed borders to other nations, and ultimately landed on distant continents. It has infected nearly 75 million people worldwide to date.
Fastest growing city
When the virus arrived, Kinshasa was bustling. The largest and fastest growing city in the region with transport links reaching up and down the country. The busy Congo river curved north and east to Kisangani more than 600 miles away. The railway carried scores of workers southeast to Katanga, a mining province reliant on immigrant labour, and on to Lubumbashi more than 900 miles away.
Records show that by the 1940s, more than a million people a year passed through Kinshasa on the railways alone. By 1960, the rate of new pandemic HIV infections outpaced the growth of the regional population, according to research published in Science.
While boats and trains spread the virus far, other factors played their part. Records suggest Kinshasa had a relatively high proportion of men and a consequent demand for sex workers. Some doctors may have unwittingly spread the virus further, through unsterilised jabs at sexual health clinics.
An international team of scientists led by the universities of Oxford in Britain and Leuven in Belgium reconstructed the history of the HIV pandemic using historical records and DNA samples of the virus dating back to the late 1950s. The DNA allowed them to draw up a family tree of the virus that traced its ancestry through time and space. Using statistical models, they could push farther back than the 1950s and locate the origin of the pandemic in 1920s Kinshasa. People with HIV in central Africa at the time did not have specific symptoms that would have been written down in their medical records. The virus causes the immune system to collapse, leaving people open to all manner of infections.
“For an epidemic like HIV where we’re trying to track back to before it was even discovered, genetics is the only source of information we have,” said Oliver Pybus, an evolutionary biologist at Oxford University and senior author on the study.
Rapid spread
The genetic data suggests that pandemic HIV spread rapidly through the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a country the size of western Europe.
From the late 1930s to the early 1950s, the virus spread by rail and river to Mbuji-Mayi and Lubumbashi in the south and Kisangani in the north. There the virus took hold and formed secondary reservoirs from where it spread to countries in southern and eastern Africa.
At first, HIV was an infection confined to specific groups of people. But the virus seemed to break out into the general population and spread around the world after what was then known as the Republic of the Congo achieved independence in 1960.
“Parts of the story can only be suggestive. Without a time machine it’s very difficult to prove causality. But we can be fairly sure we have the time and place where this happened,” Mr. Pybus said.
Combination of factors
“It seems a combination of factors in Kinshasa in the early 20th century created a perfect storm for the emergence of HIV, leading to a generalised epidemic with unstoppable momentum that unrolled across sub-Saharan Africa.”
Different strains of HIV have almost certainly jumped from apes to humans — through hunting or handling bushmeat — scores of times throughout history.
Only a dozen or so incidents have left their traces in the DNA of HIV strains around today. Some outbreaks infected hundreds of thousands of people in Africa but went no further. Only one, known as HIV-1 group M, went pandemic.
“We all want to know how this happened, how we got here,” said Mr. Pybus. “We wanted to answer the question: why did this one turn into a pandemic?” — © Guardian Newspapers Limited, 2014

Negi scalps five to restrict KKR to 180
There is little about T20 cricket, it appears, that fazes Suresh Raina. There is no discomfort, no hesitant shot-making, and definitely no restraint.
On Saturday, India’s heaviest scorer in the format clubbed a stunning 62-ball-109 at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium to guide Chennai Super Kings to its second Champions League T20 title. Set a target of 181 by Kolkata Knight Riders, CSK strolled home whistling, posting an eight-wicket victory with nine balls to spare.
If Raina stood out for his batting, the young spinner Pawan Negi had earlier starred with the ball, taking a five-for in challenging circumstances.
One-way traffic
In pursuit, CSK lost Dwayne Smith early, but thereafter it was one-way traffic. KKR felt Sunil Narine’s absence sorely; no bowler was able to stop Raina. The left-hander got down to business early, whacking Andre Russell over cover. Piyush Chawla then suffered; he was struck for two sixes in the sixth over, before being dispatched over the sight-screen.
Raina raised his fifty off 27 balls, with a four through the covers off Suryakumar Yadav. Kuldeep Yadav, on the day he was called up to the Indian team, was then given a chastening foretaste of international cricket. Raina sent him twice into the second tier, in an over that fetched 16 runs. The chinaman bowler finished with none for 44 from his four overs.
Almost ignored in comparison was Brendon McCullum’s innings of 39, as Raina and he added 118 (74b) for the second wicket. M.S. Dhoni arrived with 54 runs needed and joined in the fun at once. Raina carried onrelentlessly, although he was reprieved twice — on 78 and 88 — by a KKR side that didn’t cover itself in glory on the field. Raina brought up his third T20 hundred off 59 balls, by which time the contest was as good as over.
Solid start
Inserted into bat, Gambhir and Robin Uthappa allied to raise 91 (65b) for the opening wicket. This was a partnership of few early risks, although it must be said that the bowling exerted little pressure. It wasn’t until the 11th over that CSK made inroads, when Negi had Uthappa stumped with a delivery that sharply broke away from the batsman. The left-arm spinner then claimed Kallis in his next over, but it didn’t stop Gambhir. The captain had begun cautiously but he quickly found his range, lofting Negi over long on, and heaving DwayneBravo — CSK’s death-overs specialist — over square leg.
When Gambhir fell attempting to hurry things up, Manish Pandey took over as Ashish Nehra bled 20 runs in his third over. It was at this stage, though, that Negi thrived, sending back three KKR batsmen — Pandey, Ryan ten Doeschate and Suryakumar Yadav — in the space of five balls.
There was little mystery about Negi’s craft, but the young Delhi bowler appeared in complete control, returning figures of five for 22. CSK may have felt things swing its way, but Yusuf Pathan went after Nehra, who finished with none for 54, as KKR posted 180. That wasn’t enough as Raina proved later.

Public hygiene and politicsPrint
Written by Tavleen Singh | Posted: October 5, 2014 12:00 am
At last we have a Prime Minister who has noticed that India’s horrific public hygiene is a political problem. Those of you who sneered when you woke on Dussehra morning to find pictures of the Prime Minister with a broom in his hands on the front pages of your newspapers need to wipe that sneer off your faces. And, think again. You may discover that the message Narendra Modi was trying to send was that cleanliness was not something someone else should be doing — someone else of low caste and position. It is India’s misfortune that this belief is so strong that, to this day, there is hardly a high-caste home that does not practise casteism in the kitchen. In the grandest homes in Delhi and Mumbai, the ‘sweeper’ has a separate cup from which he drinks his tea and this is considered normal.
In the cities, it is harder to enforce caste apartheid, but in rural India it is easy. So to this day it is hard to find villages in which those of high caste live with those they consider beneath them. Gandhiji tried passionately to stop this evil and failed, as have a long line of other social reformers. So it is because of caste rules that India is one of the filthiest countries in the world. Squalor has nothing to do with poverty and everything to do with the malign idea that it is somebody else’s job to clean your filth. From time to time, we in the media carry heartbreaking, sick-making stories on manual scavengers. This newspaper did last week. But these stories are much too rare.
Besides, if you live in India you learn to ignore many things. Us intrepid hacks visit government offices regularly, but never report that the corridors of power reek of dirty toilets.
So well done Mr Prime Minister. Well done for taking it upon yourself to lead the fight against filth. In this week that we celebrate the victory of good over evil, we should remember how evil it is to think that someone whose job it is to clean up our filth should be considered lower than us upper-caste grandees. But the question to ask is — will Modi succeed where the Mahatma himself failed? And the answer could be yes, because his approach is different and the times have changed. Technology has made it possible to eliminate the need for anyone to do jobs that nobody should need to do. He is right when he says that if India can make the journey to Mars, then there is no reason why mass sanitation and public hygiene should be impossible.
The problem is a mindset created by a social system that is as old as India herself. So the solutions will have to come from technology. Urban waste management needs to be handled by trained professionals who have the technology to do it.
Allow me to give an example from our old enemy across the border. Last year, during Pakistan’s general election, continued…

Inside Track: Despite hurdlesPrime Minister Narendra Modi greets Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at a meeting in New York. (Source: AP)
Written by Coomi Kapoor | Posted: October 5, 2014 12:28 am
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s meeting with Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu in New York happened despite several hurdles. The foreign office was opposed, especially as the PM was not meeting any Palestinian representative. In fact, Modi made no reference to Palestine in his UN General Assembly speech in New York. The Indian Embassy went out of its way to deny that any meeting was scheduled, insisting that the PM had no free time in his crowded programme in New York. However, behind the scenes, a BJP office-bearer closely associated with the RSS was working hard to ensure that the meeting took place. Netanyahu too had problems of his own. His visit to the US fell between two important Jewish festivals, Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. Orthodox Jews are not permitted to travel on these dates. Netanyahu had to make sure he was in New York by September 28, Modi’s last day in the city. The last time PMs of the two countries met was 11 years ago.
Basic courtesies
Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif spoke to a half-empty hall at the UN General Assembly. The Indian mission wanted to ensure a full house when PM Narendra Modi addressed the UN, so Indian delegates were asked to fill up the empty chairs of some missions whose members had stayed away. There were, however, two glitches at the end of the speech. Modi was not instructed that he was expected to wait till a vote of thanks was proposed before he left the auditorium. As soon as Modi departed, the Indian contingent noisily got up and left the room even as the next speaker, Sheikh Hasina of Bangladesh, was about to speak. A UN official could be heard muttering, over a mike that was still on, that Indians did not observe basic courtesies.
Dhokla and undhiyu
The large media contingent that travelled to the US on its own to cover Narendra Modi’s visit was envious of the small group of journalists who travelled with the Prime Minister on his special aircraft. But the official press party also had a complaint. Because of Modi’s vegetarianism, they were only served — what some chose to call — “ghas phoos” on the flight. The chicken, fish and lamb preparations on previous PM flights were completely out. Breakfast consisted of cold dhoklas and sabudana and poha instead of hot scrambled eggs on toast and sausages as in the past. The meals hosted by the Indian Embassy were invariably vegetarian, dhoklas and undhiyu the standard fare. There were no drinks, only juices, at the dinner hosted by Indian Ambassador to the US S Jaishankar at Taj Pierre Hotel, New York, much to the guests’ chagrin.

For-Profit Prison Bankers Prey On Inmates  Families With Exorbitant FeesFor-Profit Prison Bankers Prey On Inmates' Families With Exorbitant Fees

By Daniel Wagner, The Center for Public Integrity
Editor's note: This is the first in a two-part series examining how financial companies charge high fees to the families of prison inmates. The second part, which will run Thursday, focuses on no-bid deals between Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase & Co. and the U.S. Treasury, under which they provide financial services to the federal Bureau of Prisons.
JOHNSON CITY, Tenn. — Pat Taylor doesn’t believe in going into debt. She keeps her bills in a freezer bag under her bed, next to old photo albums, and believes in paying them on time religiously. For Taylor, living within your means is part of being a good Christian.
Lately, Taylor, 64, has felt torn between that commitment and her desire to be a loving, supportive mother for her son Eddie.

Eddie, 38, is serving 20-year prison sentence at Bland Correctional Center for armed robbery. He’s doing his time at a medium-security Virginia state prison located 137 miles northwest of Johnson City, across the dips and valleys of the Blue Ridge Mountains here in the heart of Appalachia. The cost of supporting and visiting Eddie keeps going up, so Pat makes trade-offs.

“I would send him money even if it broke me, because I do go without paying some bills sometimes to go see him,” Pat says.
Between gas to make the trip and overpriced sandwiches from the prison vending machine, visiting Bland costs about $50, a strain on her housekeeper’s wages. So she alternates, visiting Eddie one week and sending him money the next.
JPay CEO Ryan Shapiro in his office north of Miami, Florida.
To get cash to her son, Pat used to purchase a money order at the post office for $1.25 and mail it to the prison, for a total cost of less than $2. But in March of last year, the Virginia Department of Corrections informed her that  JPay Inc. , a private company in Florida, would begin handling all deposits into inmates’ accounts.
Sending a money order through JPay takes too long, so Taylor started using her debit card to get him funds instead. To send Eddie $50, Taylor must pay $6.95 to JPay. Depending on how much she can afford to send, the fee can be as high as 35 percent. In other states, JPay’s fees approach 45 percent.
After the fee, the state takes out another 15 percent of her money for court fees and a mandatory savings account, which Eddie will receive upon his release in 2021, minus the interest, which goes to the Department of Corrections.
Eddie needs money to pay for basic needs like toothpaste, visits to the doctor and winter clothes. In some states families of inmates pay for toilet paper, electricity, even room and board, as governments increasingly shift the costs of imprisonment from taxpayers to the families of inmates.
“To give him $50, I have to send $70 off my card,” says Taylor, who moved to a smaller apartment on the outskirts of Johnson City in part because of the rising cost of supporting Eddie.
“They’re punishing the families, not the inmates.”
Price of prison
JPay and other prison bankers collect tens of millions of dollars every year from inmates’ families in fees for basic financial services. To make payments, some forego medical care, skip utility bills and limit contact with their imprisoned relatives,  the Center for Public Integrity  found in a six-month investigation.
Inmates earn as little as 12 cents per hour in many places, wages that have not increased for decades. The prices they pay for goods to meet their basic needs continue to increase.
By erecting a virtual tollbooth at the prison gate, JPay has become a critical financial conduit for an opaque constellation of vendors that profit from millions of poor families with incarcerated loved ones.
JPay streamlines the flow of cash into prisons, making it easier for corrections agencies to take a cut. Prisons do so directly, by deducting fees and charges before the money hits an inmate’s account. They also allow phone and commissary vendors to charge marked-up prices, then collect a share of the profits generated by these contractors.
Taken together, the costs imposed by JPay, phone companies, prison store operators and corrections agencies make it far more difficult for poor families to escape poverty so long as they have a loved one in the system.
Shifting costs to families
“It’s not just the money transfer that’s the problem, it’s the system it enables to shift costs onto families,” says  Lee Petro , an attorney who helped litigate for a national cap on some prison phone rates. Without companies like JPay, he says, “it would be much harder to take money from families and make families of inmates pay their own keep.”
In 12 years, JPay says it has grown to provide money transfers to more than 1.7 million offenders in 32 states, or nearly 70 percent of the inmates in U.S. prisons.
For the families of nearly 40 percent of those prisoners, JPay is the only way to send money to a loved one. Others can choose between JPay and a handful of smaller companies , most of them created by phone and commissary vendors to compete with the industry leader. Western Union also serves some prisons.
JPay handled nearly 7 million transactions in 2013, generating well over $50 million in revenue. It expects to transfer more than $1 billion this year. (The company declined to provide any financial details; those included in this article are culled from public records and interviews with current and former employees.)

“We invented this business,” said Ryan Shapiro, 37, the company’s founder and CEO, in a phone interview in June. “Everyone else tries to imitate what we did, and they don't do it as well.”
Shapiro says working with corrections includes extra costs for security and software integration. He says he charges only as much as he must to maintain a razor-thin profit margin.
But others provide similar services for less.
NIC Inc. , a competitor that helps states set up their websites, charges a flat fee of $2.40 in Maine to send money to inmates. Until recently, Arkansas charged 5 percent to send money through the state’s own Web portal. Floridians pay a fee of 3.5 percent to handle traffic tickets online.
Despite its kudzu-like growth, JPay so far has avoided scrutiny by consumer regulators.
In response to questions for this story, however, the New York Department of Financial Services’ consumer division is reviewing the company’s practices, according to a person familiar with the matter. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not allowed to discuss active investigations.
JPay’s rapid rise stems in part from the generous deal it offers many prison systems. They pay nothing to have JPay take over handling financial transfers. And for every payment it accepts in these states — prisoners typically receive about one per month — the company sends between 50 cents and $2.50 back to the prison operator. These profit-sharing arrangements, which vendors offer as deal-sweeteners in contract negotiations, are known in the industry as “commissions.”
JPay’s payments to Illinois last year came to about $4,000 a month, according to documents obtained under the state’s open records law.
Jails often deduct intake fees, medical co-pays or the cost of basic toiletries first, leaving the account with a negative balance. This prevents inmates from buying “optional” supplies like stationery or sturdier shoes until they have paid down the debt.
Such charges levied by jails for common items are not new. The pracitce began prior to the rise of JPay, mainly with phone companies and operators of prison stores. But by automating the process, prison bankers make it a lot easier.
$100 underwear
Negative account balances discourage cash-strapped people from helping relatives, says Linda Dolan, 58, a manager for a defense contractor in California. Last year, when her son was sentenced to 20 days in jail in St. Lucie County , Florida, for reckless driving, Linda wanted to buy him a second pair of underwear and socks. But the county’s intake fee and daily “rent” already had put the account about $70 in the red. Linda and her husband both were out of work and couldn’t afford to pay $100 for a pair of underwear.
“If relatives are putting money on somebody’s books while they’re an inmate, it’s to help them buy necessities,” Linda says. “I didn’t think it was right that the county was stealing the money.”
Capt. William Lawhorn of the St. Lucie County sheriff’s office said that inmates are charged a $25 initial booking fee, $3 a day for “subsistence” and medical co-pays, all of which can result in a negative balance. He said nobody is denied any type of needed service or care, and when inmates do have money, it’s used for candy and other junk food. Inmates in the county receive payments through Touchpay , a JPay competitor that often partners with foodservice giant Aramark.
Funding prisons out of the pockets of families and inmates has non-financial costs too, says Brian Nelson, who spent 28 years in an Illinois state prison for murder. Nelson says he has “become an asset to society” since he was released four years ago because he stayed in touch with family and priests even when he was in solitary confinement. When inmates can’t afford to maintain contact with the outside world, he says, they are less equipped to transition smoothly to civilian life.
The effect on poor families is especially harsh, Nelson says: “It’s a wife that has three children at home, and her husband is in jail, so now she has a choice: Do I send money to him so he can afford to stay in touch with the kids, or do I feed the kids?”
Inmates’ need for money is inescapable, Nelson says. Those in northern Illinois are not issued cold-weather clothes, he says, leaving them vulnerable to frostbite unless they can get money to pay for prison-approved long underwear and boots.

Razor thin margins
JPay founder Shapiro is eager to tell his company’s story and how he believes it helps families. It’s not just about faster payments. Once an inmate gains access to the money, JPay offers several ways to spend it, including  pay-per-page e-messaging , music downloads and  MP3 players . When inmates in some states are released, they receive their remaining money on JPay-branded  payment cards  that carry higher fees than those on most consumer payment cards. (See sidebar.)
Shapiro says that if his fees were any lower, his company would lose money. He declined to make the company’s financial details available and would not say how much he is paid.
Shapiro serves on the board of a foundation that advocates for inmates and carries full-page ads for JPay in its newsletters. The foundation received an $85,400 gift directly from JPay’s corporate treasury in 2009.
He lives on a tiny harbor island near the northern tip of Miami Beach in a home he bought for about a million dollars. Last year, through a company he controls called El Caballero LLC., Shapiro bought a  custom powerboat , dubbed Sea Block, that retails for a half-million dollars.
Heading to the company’s headquarters one July morning, he stopped first for CrossFit, a military-style training regime that he enjoys because it brings out his competitive side, then for daily prayer.
Families who use JPay love the company, he says. He boasts of its well-trafficked  Web forum  and of the 174,000 “likes” on  its Facebook page , where its marketers post cheery articles about incarceration. “The Jail Cats program at Gwinnett County Detention Center in Georgia is rescuing kittens and helping to rehabilitate incarcerated women,”  one recent post  read.
“We go out of our way to make sure that they feel comfortable — that, you know, you’re spending money with a company that cares about you,” Shapiro says.
If people don’t want to pay his fees, Shapiro says, they can always mail a money order, except in the “couple of states” that now charge fees for them.
Nearly 400,000 people are imprisoned in states where there is no free deposit option, a fact Shapiro was unaware of during a series of interviews this summer.
“When it’s up to us, it’s absolutely free,” he says.
Slow-moving money orders
For the first 14 years of Eddie’s sentence, Pat Taylor mailed money orders directly to the prison at no charge beyond the cost of the money order and a stamp. Then last year, she was instructed to make the money order out to JPay and send it to a Florida post office box. The company would credit it to Eddie’s account.
Under the new system, she says, it would take weeks for Eddie to see funds sent via money order. So Pat, like nearly everyone else she knows, gave in and began paying $6.95 to send the money from her debit card.
Across the country, delays and other obstacles make the “free option” inaccessible to many families, the Center found. More than a dozen families in five different states said that money orders have been credited much more slowly since JPay took over.
Shapiro says he is “absolutely shocked” by the complaints that money orders are delayed because he had never heard of such problems before. Most money orders are processed within two to three days, he said, unless the person sending money fails to fill out the form properly. He said Virginia is especially efficient and processes money orders within 24 to 48 hours.

“We are not slowing it down, there is no conspiracy,” he said.
He said JPay does “want people to convert from a money order customer to a digital customer, absolutely,” but only because electronic payments are more efficient. “We’re not trying to make an extra dollar everywhere we can,” Shapiro said.
Before JPay, Virginia prisons credited money orders to inmates’ accounts in roughly three days, families say. Today, money orders can take more than a month to reach an inmate’s account, Marvin Rodriguez-Barrera, an inmate at Virginia’s high-security Red Onion State Prison, wrote in a letter to prisoners’ rights advocates in February.
Faster to Guatemala
“I am from Central America, and it is cheaper for my family, and easier, to send money to Guatemala than for my family to send me money from this very state!” Rodriguez-Barrera wrote. “The old way of using money orders was cheaper, easier and in many instances faster.”
Those seeking to avoid the fees by sending a money order must print and fill out a JPay-provided  form  whose instructions are dwarfed by large print barking at them to “Put down your pen! Put away your car keys!” because “There’s a faster way to send money, go to JPay.com and sign up now!”
The aggressive marketing has worked. One former marketing director for the company lists as a key accomplishment on his LinkedIn profile that he “Converted 78 percent” of money order users to online users, boosting the company’s annual revenue by $985,000.
Shapiro said the information in the profile, including the former employee’s title, was inaccurate. He said he didn’t have data on how many money order users convert to electronic payments or how much revenue the company gains when they make the switch.

Inside JPay’s secure, fishbowl-like money order processing room, reams of envelopes sit in postal bins on the shelves. Signs around the room remind the handful of workers employed there which states allow them to deduct a fee and which offer the service for free.
In Pennsylvania, the first state where JPay accepted money orders by mail, executives were surprised to see the number of money orders plunge by two-thirds in the first two months, Chief Financial Officer Mark Silverman explained in a brief interview.
Shapiro said that Missouri used to process 30,000 money orders a month before JPay came in.
“With JPay, we drove that down to only 1,000 people sending money,” he says. “And that’s by choice.”
JPay’s marketing materials urge customers to choose the higher-cost option. During her twice-monthly visits to Bland, an isolated work camp nestled between rolling, green hills, Pat Taylor now sees JPay-branded fliers warning of the misery awaiting anyone who tries to use the “free option.”
On one side, a multi-ethnic lineup of models bury their faces in their hands and complain of what a “nightmare” it was to complete the money order, how it got lost or delayed.
“There’s a better way,” the flier promises on the reverse side, which depicts an attractive young woman seated with her laptop computer. For “Faster, Easier, Next-Day Delivery,” families can choose from a menu of high-fee options.
Tequila, cigars and lobbying
To impress state corrections officials and gain their business, JPay spends heavily on industry conventions attended by agency heads with contracting authority. During a 2012 convention of the American Correctional Association, the company threw what it called an “END OF THE WORLD PARTY” at a Denver wine bar that bills itself as “about you, and your inalienable right to the unbridled enjoyment of food and wine.”
The invitation, printed on a disposable beer coaster, promised “a bash, JPay-style: *fuerte* tequila, hand-rolled cigars, a live mariachi band.” Conventioneers could catch a JPay shuttle leaving from the hotel “ALL NIGHT LONG,” it said.

For years, JPay has sponsored an  award for former state corrections directors  presented by the Association of State Correctional Administrators, paying for the recipient’s trip and a Wexford crystal bowl inscribed with the honoree’s name.
JPay’s outreach extends to state legislatures as well, even though many of the company’s contracts forbid it from using fee revenue to lobby.  The company has  hired registered lobbyists  in at least seven states. Shapiro says JPay’s lawyers approved the use of company funds for that purpose.
In Ohio, it tapped Thomas Needles, a former aide to President George H. W. Bush. Needles gives generously to Republican candidates and also lobbies for for-profit universities. In Maryland, JPay hired Bruce Bereano, one of the state's best-paid lobbyists, who was disbarred after a 1994 conviction for overbilling his clients and using the money for campaign donations.
The company also sought to lobby Washington for access to the federal Bureau of Prisons’ 216,000 inmates — what Shapiro has called “the mother ship of all contracts,” which is now held by Bank of America.
It spent $20,000 in 2012 to hire Park Strategies, run by former U.S. Sen. Alfonse D’Amato of New York, in an effort to obtain the contract. That effort was not successful.
More inmates, smaller budgets
JPay was founded in 2002, just as the U.S. prison population neared the apex of a three-decade climb that more than quadrupled the number of inmates in state prisons. Shortly thereafter, as the economy went into recession, state budgets were squeezed and officials looked more aggressively for ways to cut spending on prisons.
Already, private vendors had stepped in with a solution: They would charge prisoners sky-high prices for phone services, snack foods, hygiene products and clothing, then return a large cut back to the prisons — often 40 percent or more.
Shapiro was the first entrepreneur to see how financial services might provide another stream of revenue. For a fee, he offered to deliver cash in ways that saved time and effort for corrections agencies, and often to give them a portion of the proceeds, just as the phone and commissary companies were doing.
“When we started, the states were very much saying to us, ‘There’s no need for procurement here because there’s no one else doing what you do,’ ” Shapiro said in a 2012 interview. Ten years later, he said, all of them were asking companies to submit bids for the work.
That doesn’t mean the door is open to competitors. Most states, including Virginia, now contract with JPay or its main competitor under a  master agreement  negotiated by Nevada in 2011 on behalf of a multi-state consortium. Participating states can simply sign on to the deal with one or both of the companies without the hassle of separately determining the best company for the job.
JPay is protected from other market forces, as well. When states offer its music players and tablet computers for sale to inmates, they often confiscate radios that people already own, according to inmates in Ohio. This leaves inmates dependent on JPay’s music downloads, which can cost 30 to 50 percent more than the same songs on iTunes, inmates say.
The profit-sharing arrangements are at the core of JPay’s origin story, Shapiro said in 2012. A couple of years out of college, he spent months driving around upstate New York, pitching JPay to “every sheriff, whether they had five inmates or 100 inmates” — without success.
Then someone in Passaic County, New Jersey, suggested that they offer the county 10 percent of their revenue, “so the jail would be less of a tax burden on the community.” The warden signed up on the spot.
Critics including Alex Friedmann, associate director of the  Human Rights Defense Center , an inmates’ advocacy group, says the profit-sharing amounts to a legal kickback. “They charge exhorbitant fees then kick back a percentage of their revenue. … The company doesn’t need that for profit,” Friedmann said.
Shapiro says he prefers the term “commission” because “the word kickback has a negative connotation, and it seems like some person is making that money and pocketing it and buying a Chevrolet or something, when in fact it’s going to use for the benefit of inmates — basketball hoops, volleyball, whatever.”
Most states put their share of the cash in an “Inmate Welfare Fund” that is supposed to be used for inmate benefits beyond what is guaranteed to them by law. As incarceration rates climbed, however, the definition of “inmate benefit” drifted, says Justin Jones, who was director of the Oklahoma Department of Corrections until last year.
“The Legislature allowed us to broaden the definition of inmate welfare and it got to the point, almost anything they would fund through appropriations could now be paid for as inmate welfare,” he says. “It ended up where we started using that money if an inmate went out to medical on an emergency and medical was end-of-year short,” he says. “We bought air conditioners, ice machines, X-ray machines.”
Jones was not a fan of the system. If legislatures want to impose longer prison sentences or “if they create new crimes, then the legislature should appropriate dollars for that,” he says. “I should not have to go in and redefine and stretch the definition of inmate welfare accounts.”
Double dipping
Taken together, JPay and other prison vendors create a system in which families are paying to send the money, and inmates are paying again to spend it, says Keith Miller, who is serving 21 ½ years at Bland for a series of drug-related, violent crimes committed in his early 20s. The earliest he may be released is 2021, when his mother will be 87 years old.

“The fact that [my mother] has to pay the fees to send the money and then the fact that [prison agencies] make a certain cut off it seems to me that [the prisons are] double-dipping into the money they’re sending,” he said in an interview at the prison. “It really doesn’t make sense to me that this should be allowed.”
Shapiro is skeptical that JPay’s fees make much of a difference for inmates’ families. He says companies that provide other services to inmates, such as phones and commissary, are the real problem.
“Compared to the commissary or phone revenue, we’re just a drop in the bucket,” he says.
That may be changing.
Last year, the Federal Communications Commission dusted off a 12-year-old petition filed by inmates’ families who argued that prison phone rates were unfairly high, preventing them from maintaining contact with loved ones. The commission  capped rates  for many calls under its authority to ensure that pay-phone rates are just, fair and reasonable.

Mignon Clyburn , who was acting chairwoman of the FCC when it passed the rate cap and now serves as one of three commissioners, says the action was necessary because people are “making unspeakable sacrifices to stay in touch with their loved ones.”

Vincent Townsend, president of  Pay-Tel Communications , a major provider of phones for inmates, said his industry “abused the public.”
‘Ethical, right, moral’
Other prison vendors “better pay attention to what’s ethical, right, moral,” he said. “Because if you don’t then some regulator’s going to step in, and you’re going to have to deal with it.”
There is a crucial difference: The telephone industry is closely regulated by the FCC, which has explicit authority to set rates for pay-phone calls. Financial and consumer protection regulators have less power over pricing.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau can sue companies for offering unfair, deceptive or abusive financial services. The bureau declined more than a dozen requests to discuss specific issues related to prison financial services.
The Federal Trade Commission, which has consumer-protection authority and the power to ensure that markets are competitive, declined to comment “on specific companies or conduct.”
Regulators in seven states have levied fines totaling $408,500 against JPay for operating without a license. The actions were not designed to disrupt its business, according to the Conference of State Bank Supervisors, a trade group that represents these regulators in Washington.
“State banking regulators are concerned with ensuring that businesses operating in their states are properly licensed and with enforcing applicable laws (including consumer protection laws),” the group’s spokeswoman said in an emailed statement.
‘Invent a better way’
Shapiro says he understands the challenges faced by poor families of inmates since JPay’s startup days, when he would spend “hours on the phone with a grandmother, talking about her day at Wal-Mart.”
He says he feels trapped by the structure of the industry he has come to dominate. He wishes the fees were lower, that states didn’t force him to charge more and give them a share and that he could “invent a better way” than asking people’s families to help pay for their imprisonment.
Yet Shapiro says he is satisfied to compete within what he admits is a broken system, even if the system may be punishing some innocent family members.
For many families, JPay has become that system. When Jewel Miller, 80, phoned JPay’s call center last month to ask why her payments are delayed, and why she must submit the same form every time she sends a money order to Keith, the operator hung up on her.
Jewel Miller calls JPay’s customer service center from her home in Swords Creek, Virginia.
In a series of interviews it became clear that Shapiro was unaware of some of the fees related to his business. He said he did not know, for example, that Florida now charges its own fee for money order deposits after JPay processes the payments.
These fees are spelled out in JPay’s contracts with states, which Shapiro signed. Florida’s says it will charge a 50 cent “Money Order by Mail” fee.
As of July, Shapiro was unaware of JPay’s own $1.95 fee to deposit money orders in Indiana, declaring, “If someone sends $100 with a money order to an Indiana inmate, that inmate gets $100. … I am positive.”
Two days later, he called back to say, “We’re working with the states right now to get some of those fees taken off.”
So far, the fees remain in place.

Foreign owned assets rise to $839 bn in April-Juneassets
(The difference in assets…)
NEW DELHI: The foreign-owned assets in India increased by $ 22.9 billion over the previous quarter to $ 839.3 billion during the quarter ended June 2014, according to RBI.
This is mainly due to increase of $ 10.6 billion in portfolio investment in India and increase of $ 7.6 billion in direct investment into the country.
Among other investment liabilities, currency and deposits increased by $ 2.4 billion and loans (mainly external commercial borrowings) rose by $ 1.2 billion, according to Reserve Bank data on International Investment Position (IIP) for April-June.
The ratio of India's international financial assets to international financial liabilities stood at 58.7 per cent in June 2014 (59.1 per cent in March 2014)
On the assets front, the Indian residents' financial assets abroad stood at $ 492.8 billion, up $ 10.4 billion from previous quarter due to a rise of $ 11.9 billion in reserve assets.
The gap between assets and liabilities in this regard led to the rise in net claims of non-residents on India by $ 12.6 billion to $ 346.6 billion as of June 2014.
"This change in the net position reflected a $ 22.9 billion increase in the value of foreign-owned assets in India vis-a-vis a $ 10.4 billion increase in the value of Indian residents' financial assets abroad," RBI said.
The difference in assets and liabilities, reflected by the net International Investment Position (IIP), is disseminated with one quarter lag.
The IIP data is an important input for understanding external sustainability and vulnerability, and is also useful in analysing the economic structure.

Yesudas strikes a sour note with comments on women’s attire
Staff Reporter
The Hindu Singer K.J Yesudas. File Photo: V. Sreenivasa Murthy
TOPICS
social issues (general)
“What should be covered must be covered. Women should not trouble others by wearing jeans,” K.J. Yesudas, musician, said here on Friday, inviting protests from political leaders, women’s groups and the public.
He was speaking at the inauguration of the Gandhi Jayanthi cleanliness drive at the Sri Swathi Thirunal College of Music here.
When women wear jeans, people are tempted to pay attention to what is beyond it, thus forcing them to do undesirable things, the well-known singer said. “They [women] should not try to become like men but must behave modestly,” he continued. The attire, he said, is unbecoming of Indian culture and what lends beauty to a woman is her demureness.
While the programme went ahead without protests, women’s groups took out marches later in the city. “Utterly tasteless and unworthy of such a great cultural artist,” was how CPI(M) Polit Bureau member Brinda Karat reacted when The Hindu spoke to her on Friday. “A person of his stature should be standing on the side of women in their fight against violence instead of putting his weight behind those justifying the violence and blaming them for the dress they wear,” she said while asking Mr. Yesudas to withdraw his statements immediately. Activist K. Ajitha said the acclaimed singer had acted like a typical male chauvinist. “It is now well accepted that the sexist attitude of male was behind rape and not the dress code of women,” she said while observing that the comment only betrayed the sexist streak in the singer.
Noted writer Sara Joseph said there was something wrong with the mindset of people who found fault with the way women dressed. “Jeans are a globally accepted outfit and there is nothing wrong in wearing it,” she said. Shooting holes in Mr. Yesudas’s argument against jeans by linking it to morality and culture, Ms. Joseph noted that the dress was widely used by women in the United States, where the singer spent much of his time. .
Film-maker Geetu Mohandas, whose debut feature film Liar’s Dice is the country’s official entry for the 87th Academy Awards, was cautious in her reaction while staying clear of “mindless blaming of a well-respected and gifted individual”. “But I would like to say that every citizen in our democratic country has the freedom and right to wear a dress of their choice,” she said.
The singer’s comments found an echo on social networking websites with sentiments ranging from deep disappointment and outrage to support for his freedom of expression
An unfortunate fallout of the social media outrage saw his daughters-in-law being dragged into the controversy, with users uploading photographs of them in jeans captioned with a question on the singer’s “hypocrisy”.

Azim Premji s son Rishad to join board next ...Wipro founder Azim Premji's son Rishad Premji to join board as CFO Suresh Senapaty retires next year

(Senapaty’s retirement…)
BANGALORE: India's third-biggest software exporter Wipro is preparing for a generational shift at the top after company veteran and CFO Suresh Senapaty retires next March. Rishad Premji , the elder son of Wipro's billionaire founder Azim Premji , and also the company's head of strategy, is set to join the board "sometime next year", at least two people familiar with the discussions said.
"It's not that he (Rishad) was not part of the board discussions — he's always been since becoming the CSO —but with formal induction, he will get closer to representing ownership on the board," the first person said. There are two triggers for Rishad's promotion to the board. Firstly, Suresh Senapaty's retirement leaves an executive leadership post to be filled, and secondly, Rishad's grooming over the past seven years in different roles in the company seems to have almost achieved the purpose. "In some sense, this is a generational shift," the second person said. "It's easily among the best managed family transitions that I have seen in India."
When contacted, a Wipro spokesperson asked not to speculate about board appointments.
Rishad Joined Wipro in 2007
"You may be aware that Wipro has a board of directors with a majority of them being independent. The board has various subcommittees, one of them being Nomination and Governance consisting of independent directors and chaired by Dr Ganguly," the spokesperson said.
"Matters relating to any change in board members including new appointments are subject matters dealt with by such committee before it is deliberated by the board for a final decision (of course, subject to shareholder approval)," the Wipro spokesperson added.
Experts said it makes sense for Premji to have his son represent the family while he is still on the board to ensure the transition. "The transition of leadership in a family enterprise is a challenging period for all stakeholders," said Mike Fassler, consultant at Family Business Consulting Group in Chicago, which helps wealthy families sort through conflicts.
Fassler said senior Premji's presence on board will help "bring comfort to all stakeholders" even as Rishad takes the next step to join the board. "Effecting the transition while the leading generation is still available to influence the next generation's development can be an incredibly powerful demonstration of the family's commitment to and influence on the continuity of the enterprise," said Fassler. When Rishad joins the board of Wipro, he will continue to retain his current position as head of strategy, according to a third executive familiar with the development.
"He is to head the corporate venture arm," said the executive. "Corporate venture arm is nothing but identifying and evaluating startups which Wipro will back. So he will continue to be head of strategy even when he is on the board." Wipro is currently in the midst of putting together a team of executives that will oversee the $100-million corporate venture arm, to be spearheaded by Rishad.
Premji junior joined Wipro in 2007, working in capital markets space under banking and financial services division at Wipro. Less than a year after joining the company, he was overseeing the integration of USbased Gallagher with Wipro, when the company bought the mortgage solutions provider in 2008.
"For six months, he (Rishad) worked on this integration," said one of the executives who worked with Rishad then. "For two months he worked out of Miami office and the rest of time while in India he used to work at graveyard hours shift, always on the phone, trying to answer questions from Gallagher employees and help integrate the company," said the executive. Later in 2010, Rishad was appointed head of strategy.
"One of the things which he (Rishad) has done since taking over his role is to institutionalise this role of M&A in each of the six service lines," said two executives. By institutionalising, the executives mean that Rishad has helped each of the six services lines at Wipro have an executive focused on acquiring companies that can help Wipro scale up business. "Each of the service lines sees the opportunities and shares it with the central team," said the executive. In the last four years as head of strategy, Rishad has also got a lot of executives with domain experience in each of the six service lines.
"So until now, say healthcare unit had a lot of software engineers," said one executive. "Now we have a lot of executives who have experience working with pharma companies, who understand the business. They are able to work closely with the team and tell them exactly what the client wants." This, the executives claim, is one of the reasons why Wipro has started winning more transformational deals. A point validated by Ayan Mukerji, head of telecoms and media business of Wipro, who in an interview to ET last month said the company's winnability rate in media and telecoms space has jumped fourfold in the past two years.
Nonetheless, Fassler believes that "next generation family enterprise leaders face some common challenges which include continuing to develop family commitment to the future of the enterprise, balancing reinvestment of capital for the future with current period dividends to shareholders, and development of their own leadership identity while honoring the past."

Man-animal conflict reaches a crescendoUpdated: October 6, 2014 02:52 IST
Man-animal conflict reaches a crescendo
S. Harpal Singh
Tweet
The man-animal conflict in Adilabad has turned piquant with both sides unrelentingly destroying the other with the government remaining a mute spectator. As many as nine persons have lost their lives and nearly 100 others injured in wild animal attacks since 2009-2010, while several animals have been killed by farmers in an effort to save their crops.
Not until long ago, Adilabad had one of the country’s highest spread of green cover with 43 per cent of its 16,000 sq km of area covered with trees. It also boasted of a healthy population of wild animals with as many as 30 tigers on top of the food chain, as reported about 30 years back.
The current population, minus the tigers, in the wild, is a low 8,814 including 3,313 wild boars. At least three human deaths were caused by wild boar attacks in recent years.
Illegal decimation of trees during the last three decades has depleted over 50 per cent of the green cover according to independent estimates, giving rise to the problematic situation. As encroachments by humans looking to increase agriculture production (claims for issue of rights on over 2 lakh acres of forest land were received by the government) has shrunk natural habitat, wild animals venture out searching for fodder.
Another major aspect of the issue is the ever increasing incidence of cattle grazing in jungles. The phenomenon has resulted in loss of huge extent of natural pastures thereby depriving wild herbivores of precious fodder.
The government has since 2009-2010 paid compensation of over Rs. 62.5 lakh in claims of deaths and injuries due to wild animal attacks and loss of cattle (153) and crop. “We are settling claims for compensation at a faster rate now in order to discourage farmers from setting up traps for wild animals such as putting up illegally electrified fencing around their fields,” points out Adilabad Chief Conservator of Forests, T.P. Thimma Reddy, as he talks of the efforts being made by the government to reduce the man-animal conflict.
The immediate solution to the man-animal conflict lies in the protection of the forest cover. “Yes, we are also taking up plantation of local varieties of trees so that forest communities restart their dependence on non-timber forest produce rather than depending upon timber in the forests for a livelihood,” Mr. Thimma Reddy observes.

Tesco moves closer to Tata; aligns top mgmt of back-end unit with Trent HypermarketFDI
(Tesco’s core business…)
MUMBAI: British retailer Tesco has moved a step closer to the Tatas by aligning the top management of its back-end unit with Trent Hypermarket as it prepares to open nearly 300 neighbourhood convenience stores modelled on Tesco Express.
Tesco's core business in India has been restricted mainly to Tesco Hindustan Wholesaling, which supplies merchandise, including some of its own labels, to a dozen Star Bazaar outlets, sized anywhere between 40,000-80,000 square feet and from selling food and grocery to apparel to consumer durables. Most of the top management from Tesco Hindustan Wholesaling has been inducted into Trent Hypermarket as part of an internal cost-cutting exercise even as it plans to open 300 Star Daily small-format stores in the next three years, according to an official aware of the plan.
When contacted, Tesco said its local partner should comment. Trent didn't respond to an email query. "They are mostly targeting residential complexes to set up their new stores sized anywhere between 500 and 2,000 square feet," added the official. Globally, stores such as 7-Eleven in Japan, Taiwan, Thailand and Singapore, Lawson in Japan and Oxxo in Mexico are among the largest retailers in their respective markets, reflecting the growing business of small outlets in several countries despite the presence of international supermarket and hypermarket chains.
"While the intent is on the right track, execution will be a challenge considering it's not easy to find many locations or residential localities especially in cities that can fit such stores," said Ruchi Sally, director at boutique retail consultancy Elargir Solutions.
Tesco runs more than 1,500 convenience stores averaging 2,200 square feet in small shopping precincts in residential areas and countryside in the UK. "The response to this new format has been encouraging and we are considering possibilities of replicating this model in areas where larger Star Bazaars already operate. The intent is simultaneously leveraging the supply chain gains of being proximately located to a Star Bazaar hypermarket store and at the same time being readily accessible to customers within dense catchments," said Trent's annual report for 2014.
In the year ended March 2014, like-forlike sales growth of Star Bazaar stores dropped 4.8% with total revenue of Rs 820.76 crore, posting a loss of Rs 55.79 crore. In May this year, fair trade regulator Competition Commission of India cleared Tesco's purchase of a 50% stake in Trent Hypermarket, making it the first FDI transaction in multi-brand retail since the sector was opened up in 2012.
The CCI approval came as a political debate over foreign direct investment (FDI) in multi-brand retail has been revived. Since four outlets out of the 16 Star stores operated by Trent Hypermarket were in Gujarat and Tamil Nadu that do not allow FDI in multi-brand retail trade, the stores were divested into a separate wholly owned subsidiary of Trent, Fiora Hypermarkets.

Dear Kushal, I am definitely enjoying the weekend and I hope you would too, all your points are pertinent and LIL has to prove them, but what I believe is that
1) On Digital Marketing, that is their biggest strength and forte, No Indian IT company can even breathe close, because I think that DM is a Business more than a support or staff function like IT. The kind of contacts and entrenchment they enjoy in this field is something which IT firms cannot replicate, because their focus is simply different, which is how to make consulting money out of the growth of the DM industry, whereas LIL is in the core of it.
2) Mobile Chat is important but I also believe that desktop and PC will stay and be a preferred medium, when people hunker down to their homes and offices after travel, and I think their mobile division should be cranking out good stuff as well given their Israel headquarters and since mobile is going to be central to their overall monetization strategy. I concede, that we are yet to see that transition.
3) When it comes to shopping I think it is the strategy that matters, and I am really impressed with what ZIFTR is doing for them. What awaits is the strategy. I think they need to cross barter products across geos and carve niche areas on top of a   steady stream of base revenues. The success of shopping I think  is going to hinge on their strategy per se. And North American companies are making money in dollars. The multiplication factor of Dollar revenue will contribute to the J or the U curve.
Thanks a lot for penning your thoughts, great ones.

Delay in Executive Action on Immigration Does Not Change GOP Culpability on Immigration Reformreddit
In the wake of the president's announcement that executive action on immigration will be delayed by several months, it is important that we not lose track of the fact that it was the House Republicans who not only blocked immigration reform, but passed several anti-immigrant bills that would cause devastating harm to immigrants.
Shortly after the 2012 election, the Republican National Committee wrote that unless the Republican party "embrace[s] and champion[s] comprehensive immigration reform . . . [its] appeal will continue to shrink to its core constituencies only." Speaker Boehner seemingly agreed, declaring that a "comprehensive approach [to immigration reform] is long overdue." On August 1, 2014, in the dead of the night, the House GOP officially rejected that advice and reversed course, passing two of the most anti-immigrant measures in recent memory. In doing so, they made it abundantly clear that the only path forward on immigration policy at this time is through executive action.
We feared as far back as August 2013 -- when House Republicans withdrew from a bipartisan House effort to draft a comprehensive immigration reform bill -- that real legislative reform was dead for the 113th Congress.  Those fears were confirmed this summer, when Speaker Boehner told the president and members of his conference that no immigration reform bill would be allowed a vote on the House floor.  Instead, Speaker Boehner and the House GOP used a humanitarian crisis endangering the lives of children in Central America as an excuse to advance legislation that would eliminate due process protections from all unaccompanied children fleeing persecution and abuse; deport hundreds of thousands of "DREAMers"; and deny protections to immigrant victims of sex trafficking and domestic abuse.
The bills were drafted to appease the extreme right wing of the House GOP.  Even Rep. Steve King (R-IA) boasted that the language passed by the House was "like I ordered it off the menu." H.R. 5230, nominally designed to increase funding for the border crisis, included a rider that would endanger the lives of unaccompanied children facing persecution or trafficking. Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) defended the measure by saying that it merely "tweak[ed]" a 2008 anti-trafficking law to "treat apprehended minors from Central America in the same expedited but humane fashion that we treat apprehended minors from Mexico and Canada." If true, such a bill would have been dangerous enough -- we know from the United Nations Refugee Agency that because of the diminished protections that unaccompanied Mexican children receive upon apprehension, child trafficking victims are returned to their traffickers and child victims of persecution and abuse are returned to face grave danger. But H.R. 5230 would do far more than that. The bill would subject all unaccompanied children - not just Central American children -- to even more cursory and insufficient procedural protections than those which apply currently to unaccompanied Mexican and Canadian children.
Under current law, an unaccompanied Mexican or Canadian child may withdraw her application for admission and return voluntarily to her country only after an immigration officer determines that the child can make an independent decision to withdraw such an application. This requirement prevents the return of very young children who lack the capacity to make an independent decision, as well as children with an impaired cognitive capacity.
H.R. 5230 would entirely eliminate this critical provision by striking section 235(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008. The decision to eliminate this basic procedural protection is exacerbated by another statutory change contained in the Republican bill.  Whereas current law limits when an unaccompanied Mexican child may be permitted to withdraw her application for admission and "voluntarily return" to Mexico in lieu of being placed in removal proceedings, H.R. 5230 ignores the voluntary nature of the return by converting a "may" into a "shall."  Under the bill, if a Border Patrol agent were to conclude (typically in a cursory, 10-minute interview conducted in public) that an unaccompanied child would face neither persecution nor trafficking upon return to her home country, that agent "shall" return the child to her home country. Capacity to make an independent decision to withdraw an application for admission and the willingness to withdraw such an application both become irrelevant when unaccompanied children who fail a cursory border screening are subject to mandatory repatriation. This change would make Border Patrol agents the judges and the jurors for tens of thousands of vulnerable children.
The dire warning of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops on the eve of the House vote could not have been more clear: the Republican bill "would make crippling changes to current U.S. trafficking victim protection law that we fear would send these vulnerable children, and others in the future who have fled trauma, exploitation, and violence, back into harm's way, likely resulting in continued degradation, injury, and death for many of them."
The House Republicans also passed a second bill, H.R. 5272, which the bill's sponsor, Rep. Marcia Blackburn (R-TN), claimed merely "tie[s] the President's hands as to future executive actions that he might take to expand amnesty to illegal entrants into this country" and "freeze[s] DACA." Again, such a bill would have been bad enough, cementing in place an immigration system that everyone knows to be broken and that fails to meet the needs of American families, businesses, and communities. In truth, the Republican bill would prevent Dreamers who already have received protection from deportation under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program from being able to renew their status, thereby condemning them once more to deportation. Moreover, the bill would reduce protections under current law for immigrant victims of sex trafficking and domestic abuse.
The bill would do this by prohibiting the federal government from using Federal funds or resources "to consider or adjudicate any new or previously denied application of any alien requesting consideration of deferred action for childhood arrivals." Because deferred action is a discretionary protection from removal to which beneficiaries have no claim as of right, an application to renew deferred action is essentially a new application for deferred action. Prohibiting the use of funds or resources to consider or adjudicate new applications under DACA would end the DACA renewal process. Although some Republican supporters of the bill tried to be coy about this aspect of the bill, the text of the bill was clear. In fact, Rep. Blackburn's communications director reportedly confirmed for the Associated Press that the bill "would prevent people who currently have DACA from renewing."
Equally dangerous, H.R. 5272 would prohibit the use of Federal funds or resources to grant work authorization to any person who "was not lawfully admitted into the United States . . . and is not in lawful status in the United States on the date of the enactment of this Act." Going far beyond the purported purpose of the bill, this provision would have the effect of denying work authorization to crime and trafficking victims who assist law enforcement and other immigrants eligible for certain forms of relief (including Cuban parolees). Even worse, by denying the ability of battered immigrant spouses who have left their abusers and successfully self-petitioned for an immigrant visa the ability to work for the many months it may take for a visa number to become available, the bill would undermine a basic premise of the Violence Against Women Act - that victims of domestic violence should be empowered to leave dangerous and abusive situations. This change would prevent countless battered immigrant spouses from ever leaving their abusers, and would drive others right back into their hands.
Rather than heeding the party's own advice following the 2012 election, these mean-spirited bills demonstrate a return to the GOP's history of supporting anti-immigrant measures. In 1994, Republicans backed the now infamous California Proposition 187, which sought to prohibit many immigrants from accessing health care, public education, and other social services. In the mid-1990s and again in 2011 after taking control of the House of Representatives, House Republicans pushed language to limit birthright citizenship protections guaranteed under the 14th Amendment. When Senate Democrats and Republicans joined together in the 109th Congress to pass sensible comprehensive immigration reform legislation, the Republican-controlled House pushed legislation to make felons out of immigrant families that resulted in massive protests in cities all over the United States. And when Senate Democrats and Republicans joined together last year to pass S. 744, a comprehensive immigration reform bill, House Judiciary Republicans advanced in Committee a different proposal to turn millions of undocumented immigrants into felons overnight.
If immigration hawks in the House GOP are permitted to take our broken immigration system hostage through sheer intransigence, it is American people, American businesses, American workers, and American families that will suffer. It is ultimately up to Congress to rewrite our immigration laws, but it is the responsibility of the president to identify opportunities under existing law to faithfully execute such laws in a manner that best serves the needs of the country. And the reality is that even under our broken immigration system, changes can and should be made to make our immigration enforcement efforts smarter and more humane and to improve avenues for legal immigration. Efforts to reform our broken immigration system did not begin last year. Many of us have been working to make our system fairer and more just for well over a decade. In the meantime, countless families have been torn apart, too many American children whose parent were deported have been placed in foster care, businesses have been denied necessary workers, and immigrant and American workers have been harmed by an economy that relies heavily upon millions of workers who are undocumented and easily exploited.
We had hoped that executive action by the president would have taken place sooner, given the House Republicans' obstructionism on immigration reform and the overriding national interest in updating our immigration system.  But make no mistake, when the president acts, it will be because the GOP has made it abundantly clear there is only one viable path forward on immigration.

NBC News Doctor: Cameraman Who Contracted Ebola  In Good Spiritsreddit
NBC News's Dr. Nancy Snyderman told Rachel Maddow on Thursday night that her cameraman in Liberia who has tested positive for Ebola is in "good spirits" and that she and her crew are being "extraordinarily vigilant" with regards to their own health.
Snyderman and her team have been quarantined since the 33-year-old cameraman, Ashoka Mukpo, began showing symptoms of the disease. All of them are being flown back to the United States. Snyderman and the crew will remain isolated for 21 days.
NBC initially withheld Mukpo's name, but released it as his parents began talking to the media.
Ebola has now killed over 3,300 people across West Africa.
Snyderman told Maddow that Mukpo "is a very experienced photojournalist who we hired to augment our team on the field in Monrovia," the Liberian capital. He had been working with the NBC crew for three days before he tested positive.
She described how Mukpo discovered that he was suffering from Ebola:
"As the day went on, he started to feel just tired, a little achy.  And, as you know, a lot of times when you’re in the field, you work long days and don't take very good care of yourself.  We just thought perhaps he needed some rest.  He signed off early, went home and called me that later than evening with an elevated temperature.
At that point, I suggested and requested that he self-quarantine himself and monitor his temperature by the hour, which he did, and checked in with me.
And this morning, he went to the clinic run Doctors Without Borders, and was checked for malaria, which is very common here, and then also tested positive for Ebola, and he is being kept in the clinic there right now."
Snyderman said that Mukpo was "in good spirits. He's ready to get home—of course, appropriately concerned."
She added that she and her crew were going above and beyond even the CDC's guidelines in their handling of their own health.
"We recognize that there is a big story back home," she said. "And, frankly, we want to be respectful to our colleagues and to the American public."

Ailing Boomers could be hope for job growthBy Jim Tankersley October 3 Follow @jimtankersley

Why would you create a job in America? That’s a once-unthinkable question for the world’s premier economy, but it’s a necessary one, because there are so many reasons not to create a job here today.
Friday’s monthly jobs report showed the economy added 248,000 jobs for September – which is solid, but not spectacular, job growth. That’s the story of the past 15 years – at their absolute best. Job creation has run historically slow or once-in-a-lifetime negative throughout the 21st century. Even President Obama, in a speech Thursday that celebrated the recovery from recession and predicted even better times ahead, conceded that “job growth could be so much faster, which would drive up wages.”
It’s important to ask, though, where that faster job growth will come from. The increasingly connected, increasingly automated global economy gives companies a lot of options for how to spend their money in search of profits. Most of them don’t involve hiring an American. You could hire someone in a developing country, for a fraction of the price. You could invest in software or machinery or robotics that do the work humans once handled. You could buy a foreign company for tax advantages or simply buy back shares of your own stock.
So why create a job here? Over the next several weeks, we’ll explore that question on Storyline, examining the trends that could drive hiring in the coming years and the policies that could be holding it back.
We begin with the simplest answer – and, historically, the most important one: Americans spend a lot of money.
How they spend money is changing, though, with heavy implications for job creation in the years ahead.
Dating back to the 1970s, about three in five U.S. jobs have been directly supported by consumer spending. That share has stayed level even as consumer spending has grown more and more important to the economy overall – it contributed about 61 percent of GDP in the mid-1960s and rose steadily thereafter, to 71 percent in 2012, according to the Labor Department.
That’s a critical decoupling, and one that sheds light on workers’ anxieties today. The reason consumer spending grew as a share of the economy, but consumer-related employment did not, is that Americans started spending more money on products made in other countries – and automation made it easier for American companies to produce more consumer goods and services with the same amount of workers.
In the coming decade, economists expect that trend to change. Stephanie Hugie Barello, a Labor Department economist, projects in a new report that consumer spending won’t grow anymore as a share of the economy, from now through 2022. That would suggest consumer-driven employment should start to fall as a share of the economy – but her projections say it will basically stay the same.
That’s because Americans are likely to spend a larger share of their money on health care and education – services that still require a lot of human labor – and less on other things.
The Baby Boomers are retiring and will require more medical care. Higher education is becoming a near-prerequisite for a well-paying job. These trends are sending more people to hospitals and to school, places where automation and outsourcing have not displaced nearly as many jobs as, say, manufacturing. In other words, they’ll need to hire to meet the domestic demand.
Barello projects health services alone will account for half of consumer-supported job growth in the next decade and one-third of all job growth. Those jobs will be funded by spending straight from consumers’ pockets but also from government safety-net programs (which is to say tax dollars and government borrowing).
This, then, would be a primary reason to create a new American job: to serve an ailing American consumer. But there are a few reasons to think it might not come true, at least not in the numbers currently predicted. Health spending growth has slowed recently – a fact Obama trumpeted in his speech Thursday, without mentioning that health-care hiring has slowed, too, from its pre-recession peak.
Technology could change the picture, too; in 10 years, we could have robot doctors and widespread attendance in online colleges. History suggests tech advancements will mess with forecasts at least a little bit: In 2002, a Labor Department report predicted big job gains from the bustling field of videotape rental services.

New retirement plan: Working 9-to-5 past 65By Jonnelle Marte October 3 Follow @jonnelle
WASHINGTON, DC: Paul Hyman is a lawyer in Washington, D.C. who still works full time at age 74. He said that not only does he still enjoy working but he fears boredom if he were to retire. (Photo by Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post)
Paul Hyman doesn’t much care for golf or beach resorts. He doesn’t have a boat and isn’t any good at painting.
Hyman, 74, isn’t into many of the things the friends his age say they like doing in retirement. The things that are important to him – social connections, friends, new challenges – he gets at work. So the partner at Hyman, Phelps & McNamara, a food and drug law firm based in Washington, says he isn’t retiring, at least not for now.
“Most of my contemporaries in law school, or a lot of them, have retired,” says Hyman, who helped launch the firm nearly 35 years ago. “A lot of them were sort of happy to stop doing what they were doing. I kind of like what I’m doing.”
Hyman is among a growing group of people working full time beyond age 65, generally considered full retirement age. As of September, 60 percent of workers age 65 and older had full-time jobs, up from about 55 percent in September of 2007, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Over that time, the share of workers with part-time jobs fell to 40 percent from about 45 percent.
Economists say it’s only natural that people are working longer because they’re living longer. Today, one in four people who reach age 65 will live past 90, according to the Social Security Administration. One in 10 will live past 95. With such longevity, financial advisers say, people need to be more creative about finding new income in retirement – which more often makes a job a regular part of the plan.
“The old idea of retirement of moving somewhere sunny and playing a lot of golf, that’s a 50-year-old idea,” says Andy Sieg, head of Global Wealth & Retirement Solutions for Bank of America Merrill Lynch, which is releasing a series of reports on how the views of retirement are changing. “People are screaming out for a new proposition. They want to stay engaged and be in the workplace.”
Forty-seven percent of today’s retirees say they have either worked or plan to work in retirement, according to a survey by Merrill Lynch and Age Wave, a research group. And people aren’t just staying at their jobs for the money, the study found. Sixty-two percent of retirees said their top reason for working in retirement was to stay mentally active, double the 31 percent who said they worked mostly for the money.
Not that the money isn’t a strong motivator. A survey released by the Federal Reserve in August found that 31 percent of Americans have no money saved for retirement and are not receiving a pension. That included 19 percent of people ages 55 to 64. How did they plan to make up for that shortfall? About 25 percent of those surveyed said they would work as long as possible.
Today’s workers also have greater financial incentives to keep working than previous generations did, says Richard Johnson, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute. Fewer workers are earning pensions. And working longer can help people sock away more savings – which more people are relying on for retirement income. Those who delay collecting Social Security see their annual benefits grow by 8 percent for every year beyond their full retirement age, until they reach 70.
Paul Brown, a 67-year-old security guard in Baltimore, says that because he’s in good health, he plans to keep working and to put off Social Security until 70. The money he makes is enough to cover his food, housing and transportation. And Brown, who worked for nearly three decades as a painter for a federal agency before transitioning to security, says the bigger Social Security benefit will be a nice supplement to the income he is expecting from his pension.
He also likes the daily routine. While many of the retired people who live with him in the senior home spend a lot of time indoors, he likes walking 15 minutes to work in the afternoons to a nearby building, where he keeps watch at night with another guard. “When I was a kid, I thought I would grow up and retire and play all day again,” he said. “But it doesn’t work that way.”
Even though he works 40 hours a week, he says, he still has plenty of time to see his cousins, go to church and volunteer at a local food bank. Retirement, he expects, will involve more of the same, with more time free for volunteering.
Another factor making it easier to work longer: the rise in education. People with office jobs or other positions that aren’t physically demanding can work longer than people in blue-collar jobs that are harder to keep up with age. Nearly 32 percent of people 25 and older had completed at least four years of college in 2013, up from about 18 percent in 1983, according to Census Bureau data. In 1940, just under 5 percent of people 25 and older had completed that much schooling.
Job flexibility helps. John Lowe, an energy law professor at Southern Methodist University’s Dedman School of Law in Dallas, says his flexible schedule is one of the main reasons he works full time at 73. Between summer breaks and winter holidays, he says he can teach abroad and take extended trips with his family.
The job also allows for longer breaks. On sabbatical for the fall semester, Lowe first spent a few months over the summer in Maine, where he spent afternoons sailing on his 36-foot boat. He is now in Thailand teaching a short course in petroleum law. When that’s over, he’ll travel with his wife and daughter.
In the spring, Lowe will return to his full-time job on campus, where he will teach two courses and guide students conducting research projects. Even with the full course load, he can sneak away early some afternoons for the occasional round of golf. “It’s not a hard job,” he says. “The culture of university is such that elderly people are respected and given a lot of support - and it’s fun.”
Of course, some people who intend to keep working are forced to retire early when their health changes. According to another Merrill Lynch and Age Wave survey, 86 percent of people over 65 say they have chronic conditions , including heart disease, diabetes, cancer and arthritis. Thirty-seven percent of respondents said they had to retire early because of a health reason.
For workers still in good health, especially those who like their work and are in well-paying jobs, there is little reason to stop. “There’s a big opportunity cost to retiring,” says Sara Rix, an analyst with the AARP Public Policy Institute who studies labor trends for older workers. “If they retire they lose a lot of money.”
Hyman, who started his law career with the Food and Drug Administration, is one of two founding partners still at the firm. (The other, who fellow partners used to call “the kid” because he is several years younger, is in his 60s.) One passed away, and another retired to Florida, where he takes pictures of birds and plays golf.
Hyman says he normally gets to the office about 9:30 a.m. and leaves most days by 7 p.m. While he doesn’t spend his days in court anymore, he still talks frequently with clients, consulting them and other lawyers at the firm about the language that should be used on ads and product labels – a part of the job he really enjoys.
Between the money he has saved in his 401(k) and other outside investments that have done well, Hyman says he could retire today if he needed to. Retiring will lead to a pay cut, but because his house and cars are paid off, he thinks he’ll be able to cover his expenses just fine. In the meantime, he’ll keep saving.
When Hyman and his fellow partners entered their 50s, they instituted a mandatory retirement policy under which the firm’s lawyers over the age of 70 would need to be approved each year by the board. Hyman has been cleared three times without issue. “Now, it won’t last forever,” he said one recent afternoon while sitting in his corner office. “Something will happen.”
“One of two things – one will be physical and the other will be mental,” he says, adding that an emotional change may make him feel ready for something new. “Something may set me off.”
For now, that day seems far away. Maybe it’s in his genes, he says. After all, his father, who was on a tax appeals board in Atlantic City, didn’t retire until he was 84.

Seniors rooftop retirement expenseBy Michelle Singletary September 25 Follow @SingletaryM
Some financial experts tell people they shouldn’t pay off their mortgage even as they are heading into retirement.
During a recent online chat, I received the following note from a reader: “I got a mailing from a realtor saying we should not pay off the mortgage because 1) ‘bad’ debt comes first, 2) you can deduct the interest, 3) you can invest that money at a higher rate, 4) if you pay it off, you might not have enough to retire on, and 5) a good investment plan can make those mortgage payments for you, so don’t make a ‘feel-good decision’ to pay it off. But my gut tells me you’re right. Can you back up your contention with similar arguments?”
I get so irritated when I hear about people being steered way from cutting down on one of the largest expenses they will have in retirement: their housing costs. For older Americans, home and home-related expenses account for 40 percent to 45 percent of their budgets, according to a new report by the nonpartisan Employee Benefit Research Institute.
As Nanci Hellmich reported in USA Today, in 2011, people ages 65 to 74 spent an average of $18,720 in the home category; the average was $14,732 for those ages 75 to 84.
Let me tackle each point mentioned by the reader:
1. Pay off bad debt first. Remember, there is no such thing as good or bad debt. Just debt — heavy and limiting.
2. You can deduct home-mortgage interest. The mortgage-interest deduction is different from a tax credit, a distinction that is sometimes lost on people trumpeting the tax break as a key reason to buy a home or keep a mortgage. A tax credit reduces the taxes you owe dollar for dollar. A deduction eliminates only a percentage of your tax obligation. If you don’t have a mortgage, you may pay more in taxes, but not as much as you would have to pay in annual interest on the home loan, especially in the beginning years. By the way, many people don’t even take the deduction. “Close to half of homeowners with mortgages — most of them middle- and lower-income families — receive no benefit from the deduction,” according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
3. You can invest that money at a higher rate. It’s true that you may earn more money in the market, but that is not a guarantee. Um, remember the Great Recession, the housing market collapse, the negative returns on investment and retirement accounts? The market goes up and down.
4. If you pay off your mortgage, you might not have enough to retire on. It is true that many seniors have paid off their home loans but have little savings to help supplement whatever retirement income they may have. But the goal isn’t to do one or the other – to either save for retirement or pay off your mortgage. You must do both. Save so you have cash, or investments you can sell to generate cash. Pay off your mortgage so you can reduce one of your largest expenses.
5. A good investment plan can make those mortgage payments for you. See my answer to No. 3 above.
A Wells Fargo/Gallup survey of 1,011 investors who have $10,000 or more in savings and investments found that nearly half of the investors (46 percent) are worried that they will outlive their retirement savings, Hellmich reported .

How would you fix Social Security?
The Washington Post’s new Get There money section has an interesting story and interactive feature to help explain the funding crisis in Social Security.
The solutions for solving the Social Security shortfall generally fall into two camps: Cut benefits or raise revenue.
“So far politicians haven’t mustered the will to take on the job,” writes The Washington Post’s Martha Hamilton. “Still, there is widespread agreement that it needs to be done and that there are plenty of ways to do it. And the need is growing greater.”
The “Social Security trust fund, where taxes paid by workers and employers are held when they exceed Social Security’s costs, will be depleted and unable to pay full benefits in 2033,” Hamilton points out. “At that point, Social Security would be able to pay only 77 percent of currently scheduled benefits with money still coming in from Social Security taxes.”

Healthy fast food
In last week’s newsletter, I wrote about a company that is offering people a discount if they upload pictures of their receipts from fast-food restaurants. The marketing campaign by HelloFresh is part of an effort to get new customers for its meal-delivery service featuring fresh and mostly natural foods, reported USA Today’s Bruce Horovitz.
So, for last week’s question I asked: Would you pay to have fresh food delivered to your home?
“I have paid for fresh, unprepared food delivery just to see what it was like,” wrote Kimberly Rotter of San Diego. “It was wonderful. I received well-packed boxes that contained, in pre-measured amounts, all the necessary ingredients (except staples like olive oil and salt) and instructions to prepare a delicious meal that I had chosen from a menu posted online. I think it’s a brilliant way to introduce someone to cooking, healthy ingredients and healthy meals. I already shop well and cook at home, so for me it was a matter of convenience (that ultimately wasn’t worth the cost).”

India attractive despite fears over Fed rate hike: JPMorgan AMChristian Preussner
(Our expectations are certainly…)
The Federal Reserve is more likely to increate interest rates in the second half of 2015, said Christian Preussner, executive director and head of international client portfolio management at JPMorgan Asset Management. In an interview with Biswajit Baruah, Preussner spoke about the impact of the US rate hike on India and slowing foreign portfolio flows among other matters. Edited excerpts:
We have seen bouts of volatility in emerging markets, including India, in the recent past as investors are getting increasingly worried about US interest rate hike. What are your expectations?
Our expectations are certainly a bit more conservative. Hence, our forecast is that rate hikes in the US will probably happen in the second half of next year. Then there will be more gradual increase in short-term interest rates there. The reason for saying this is that the inflation rate is still quite low at around 1.9-2%, and from that perspective, the Fed is not overly pressured in taking immediate action. At the same time, the Federal Reserve Bank wants to see a broader continuation of the unemployment rate going down. We would be seeing around 100-basis point rate hike by the end of 2015, and then gradual continuation of hikes into 2016.
How do you see emerging markets like India getting impacted from the Fed rate hike?
If the US is increasing rates, then from net investment perspective, it's more attractive to invest in the US markets. We expect the US GDP growth to be anywhere between 2.5% and 3%. It's definitely an environment where we see high single-digit to low double-digit total returns from US equities going forward. I don't think we are currently getting positive in emerging markets at this point in time. The Indian market has been doing already quite well and still continues to see upside potential.
Foreign portfolio inflows have hit a 7-month low in the last two months. Is this a cause for serious concern for Indian stocks?
The funds coming to India are essentially regional funds and within that India's weightage is 6%, and people are allocating 9-10% weightage to India and that's where most of the flows have to come to India. At this point of time, what is happening is incrementally people are not supporting country-dedicated funds, and within that India-dedicated funds. They are putting more in emerging markets as a theme and so India being overweight is getting the money flow from those types of funds. India is not getting pure India-dedicated money at this point of time. That's where you will see some aberration. But, if you look at the appetite for FIIs to invest, they are waiting for the issuances to come in, and then the flows will automatically happen. I would see it more as an aberration, rather than a worry.
In your global stocks portfolio, how is India positioned?
India is certainly coming out to be 'Overweight' among all the markets. If you look at asset classes which essentially tend to do well during rising US interest rates, it is the higher dividend emerging market equities then pure emerging market equities. If you see India, China, or the Asean region, they all tend to benefit when growth stabilises in the developed markets. The ECB has given a big boost to liquidity by pushing rates to near zero. The US is showing strong strength on the growth side. Japan has been reasonably steady. All this augers well for the emerging market equities because the rise in US interest rates is essentially a response to the growth, and it's not negative. It's essentially in response to the growth being normalised, so you don't require that excess easy monitoring conditions any more.
What kind of returns do you expect from Indian stocks, going forward?
We are talking about the next four years' earnings growth of around 22%. That's a substantial jump from the current 12% or 13%. So, if that is true, we are talking about doubling of markets over the next four years because markets are ultimately a slave of earnings growth. In the interim, there will be news flows, which could keep on impacting the markets, but we are not looking at anything in the short term. We are very confident that the economy is looking to reverse from here and continuously advocating for looking at the markets from three to five-year perspective, because the government itself is now talking about 5-year and 10-year objectives.
 
Which are the sectors you are bullish on?
The sectors we are pondering over are cyclicals; the good companies which are in a position to construct good roads at reasonable cost are going to benefit from the new government policies. Cement is something of a very clean sector which will be a direct beneficiary of the infrastructure development. In the auto segment, the four-wheeler segment is seeing revival, so that is something we are positive on. Within financials, we are concentrating on the private banking side. So these are the things we are positive on.
Pharma and technology stocks have staged a strong comeback in the September quarter. Would you like to advise investors to accumulate these ?
Pharma and IT stocks' valuations are stressed; we are more 'Neutral' on them and have cut our exposure.

Nats face tall task in solving Madison BumgarnerBy Rick Maese October 5 Follow @RickMaese
Game 3 starter Madison Bumgarner. (Getty Images)
It’s no less inspiring, but Madison Bumgarner isn’t so difficult to sketch out on paper. He has great size and a funky cross-fire delivery. Hitters have to account for four pitches, especially that cutter and fastball, and Bumgarner loves to take away the inside of the plate. And yet, all the studying in the world can’t fully prepare the game’s best hitters for what they’re going to see when they step into the batter’s box.
Just listen to Pittsburgh Manager Clint Hurdle, who pored over scouting reports, knowing his Pirates needed a win in the wild card last week to advance in the playoffs. All that studying and all Bumgarner did was pitch a complete game shutout, allowing just four hits while striking out 10.
“It was a different game that he pitched, a different game than we’d seen scouted,” Hurdle said.
Bumgarner is versatile on the hill with a jangling, overflowing toolbelt that would weigh down others. The Nationals’ hopes at extending their postseason hinges on their ability to not just anticipate but to execute against one of the league’s most challenging pitchers.
The Nats’ bats struggled against lesser starters in Games 1 and 2 of the National League Division Series, and the task surely will only be tougher facing the Giants’ ace in front of a raucous home crowd Monday. The environment and the stakes thrill Bumgarner, who’s already making his eight career postseason start (he’s 4-2 with a 3.02 ERA in playoff appearances).
“For me, I have to push all the nerves and things outside and find a way to just concentrate on pitching,” he said. “If you don’t, you get amped up and start leaving balls over the middle. That doesn’t work too well in this league.”
Bumgarner doesn’t complicate things. He speaks in a calm, melodic North Carolina cadence. “If you’re making good pitches,” he said, “more often than not, you’re going to be successful. If you’re not, you’re going to have a hard time.”
Barely 25 years old, Bumgarner seems like he’s been around for a decade or more. Most hitters in the National League will tell you that he’s only getting better. He posted career-highs this year in wins (18), strikeouts (219) complete games (4) and innings (217 1/3) – capped by last week’s overwhelming performance in Pittsburgh.
So what didn’t the Pirates properly anticipate?
“He used all of his pitches,” Hurdle said. “He was able to get his fastball in tight with the right-handers. He was able to spin the ball late, dump it late for chase. Used some change-ups early after guys he’d showed the fastball to during it. He also knew how to elevate.”
Here’s Washington Manager Matt Williams quickie scouting report: “Cross-fire fastballs to the right-handers. He pitches effectively. He’s a big guy. He throws the ball, you know, low- to mid-90s, but it’s even better than that because the ball jumps on you.”
That’s it?
“And he rakes,” Williams added.
Oh yeah, at the plate Bumgarner hit a career-high four homers and 15 RBI. If he somehow hit at that same clip over 500 at-bats, he’d post 30 home runs and 114 RBI in a season.
Said Doug Fister, the Nats’ Game 3 starter: “I definitely don’t take that, ‘Oh good, I get to face a pitcher’ mentality. …Bumgarner is obviously statistically a very good hitter, and that’s somebody I don’t take lightly.”
The Nats will focus on what Bumgarner can do on the mound Monday at AT&T Park. Late in the season, the 6-foot-5-inch lefty strung together five straight wins, which included a complete-game one-hitter against Colorado on Aug. 26. The Nats last faced him much earlier in the year, a June visit to Nationals Park where Bumgarner took the loss and allowed two runs on eight hits in seven innings. He struck out five and walked one.
In his career, Bumgarner is 2-3 in seven outings against the Nats with a 2.60 ERA.
Monday’s matchup also presents a rematch of sorts. Bumgarner and Fister squared off two years ago in the second game of the World Series between the Giants and Tigers. Bumgarner pitched seven scoreless innings, allowing only two hits and striking out eight en route to the win. Fister took the loss, but allowed just one run on four hits in six innings.
Bumgarner and the Giants, of course, went on to sweep the Tigers, and Bumgarner picked up his second World Series ring. He was all of 21 years old in 2010, when he won two postseason games for the Giants, giving up five earned runs in 20 2/3 innings. In San Francisco’s 2012 run, he posted a 1-2 record and was bounced early in both the division series and the league championship series.

death
A staunch Gandhian, educationist and philanthropist, 91-year-old Mahalingam’s end came on the Gandhi Jayanthi Day.
N. Mahalingam, Chairman of the Coimbatore-based Sakthi Group of Companies, passed away in Chennai on Thursday. He was 91.
According to sources, Mr. Mahalingam had been organising the Gandhi Vallalar Vizha for the last 49 years. He was at the event in Chennai on Thursday evening when he collapsed. He was rushed to a private hospital but declared dead.
Born on March 21, 1923 into an agricultural family at Somanthurai Chittoor, Pollachi, Mr. Mahalingam completed B.Sc. in physics at Loyola College, Chennai. He joined the College of Engineering, Guindy, and obtained a diploma in Mechanical Engineering in 1945.
He was a member of the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly from 1952 to 1967. He was instrumental in the implementation of the Parambikulam Aliyar Project, which was inaugurated when he was a legislator. He had been actively campaigning for the linking of rivers. A Gandhian, educationist and philanthropist, he received the Padma Bhushan in 2007. As an industrialist, he focused on agro-based industries, a family source said.
He became a member of the Indian National Congress in 1940 and was a member of the AICC between 1958 and 1968. He was a member of the State Planning Commission from 1971 to 1974 and from 1981 to 1982.
ABT Limited, Sakthi Sugars, and Sri Sakthi Textiles are some of the companies that are part of the Sakthi Group.
He had established several educational institutions and written a number of books. He is the founder and honorary editor of Kisan World, a monthly magazine, and Om Sakthi, a Tamil monthly. Mr. Mahalingam had served in the committee of the Southern India Mills Association and was president of the South Indian Sugar Mills Association, Tamil Nadu in 1972-1973.
He is the Chairman of the Gandhi Memorial Museum, Madurai. Ramalingar Mission, Chennai, was established in 1965 with Mr. Mahalingam as its president.
He is survived by his wife, three sons and a daughter.
The funeral was held on Friday evening.

Speak up for our sisters  spouses and mothersBy Steven Petrow October 3 Follow @StevenPetrow
“I fight sexism, what about you?” For the “What raises the skirt” event, the academic administration responsible for high schools in the Nantes’ region invited “girls, boys, high school students and staff to go to school wearing a skirt or a pin to fight against all forms of sexism”. (JEAN-SEBASTIEN EVRARD/Getty Images)
For the past few months, NPR’s “All Things Considered” has been exploring what it means to be a man in America today , and I was pleased to be a part of the conversation on air and online, when I led a chat about shifting gender roles and new questions about social etiquette.
In last week’s Washington Post live chat ( see full transcript here ) we continued the discussion of “Modern Man Manners.”
Q: How should a male respond when encountering street misogyny/sexual harassment (i.e. cat-calling) to a stranger by another stranger? Is responding appropriate, or does that only propagate the idea of “White Knight” behavior?
A:I think we should all speak up on behalf of each other — what a novel idea, right? Not to mention that a spouse, daughter, niece or friend could one day be the target of the catcall. One of the most powerful ways to challenge norms is to call people out on their use of language (or other infractions). I don’t mean rudely or in a way that puts you at risk  — do it privately yet firmly. In this particular scenario, you might go over to the fellow who whistled or whatever he did and say: “There’s really no need for that. You wouldn’t like someone to do that to your wife/girlfriend….”
And what happens when we say nothing? The offenders think they’re in the right … and will continue on in the future. By the way, there are worse things than being considered a “white knight” and one of them is a misogynist.
Agree or disagree with my advice? Let me know in the comment section below.

Narrow win for India AUpdated: October 6, 2014 01:41 IST
Narrow win for India ‘A’
G. Viswanath
PTI GOOD GOING: Unmukt Chand's century helped India 'A' post a total that was beyond's West Indies' reach.
PTI Unmukt Chand...purposeful knock.
One-day cricket
Unmukt, Ramdin hit tons
Denesh Ramdin’s all-round show nearly paved the way for an unlikely West Indies victory against India ‘A’ in the second warm-up match at the Wankhede Stadium on Sunday.
After holding five catches with the big gloves, he played the role of the buccaneer by smashing 102 (102 balls, 10x4, 3x6) under the lights.
The visitors were in trouble at 65 for four, but Ramdin’s stand of 101 for the fifth wicket with Darren Sammy reversed the trend. He departed, holing out to deep backward square leg, leaving Jason Holder and the lower order some hard work. The big blows did not happen often enough and West Indies, needing 23 of the last over, lost by 16 runs.
Losing the toss, West Indies did not find any solace from the five overs of off-spin sent down by Marlon Samuels and skipper Kieron Pollard pinned his faith on the fast bowlers for 42 overs.
Three of them in Ravi Rampaul, Jerome Taylor and Kemar Roach conceded over 50 runs. Short of man-power, West Indies took the field with coach Stuart Williams doing duty for a little over 30 overs and with a local substitute.
The deployment of all-out pace attack backfired with Unmukt Chand and Karun Nair countering the seamers with aplomb. Once Karun made his opening scoring shot count — an on-side blow off Holder for a six — proceedings gathered momentum and the home team straddling on Unmukt’s cautious knock of 101 (111b, 192m, 8x4, 3x6) posted a challenging total of 293.
Manoj Tiwary elected to bat and after a steady start by the openers, Unmukt and Karun (64, 63, 4x4, 6x4) raised 149 for the second wicket.
Without Lendl Simmons (back ailment) and Darren Bravo (laid low by a weak tummy), West Indies made a poor start with seamer Jasprit Bumrah again accounting for Leon Johnson and leg-spinner Karn Sharma hoodwinking Samuels and Pollard.
The scores: India ‘A’: Murali Vijay c Ramdin b Holder 21, Unmukt Chand b Taylor 101, Karun Nair c Blackwood b Roach 64, Manoj Tiwary c Ramdin b Taylor 7, Sanju Samson c Ramdin b Rampaul 5, G.S. Mann c Pollard b Roach 20, Stuart Binny c Ramdin b Pollard 15, Parvez Rasool (not out) 13, Karn Sharma c Holder b Pollard 5, Dhawal Kulakrni c Sammy b Rampaul 13, Jasprit Bumrah c Ramdin b Taylor 0; Extras (b-4, lb-1, nb-1,w-12):18; Total (in 48.1 overs): 282.
Fall of wickets: 1-26, 2-175, 3-184, 4-202, 5-224, 6-241, 7-250, 8-261, 9-282.
West Indies bowling: Ravi Rampaul 9-0-53-2, Jason Holder 10-1-44-1, Jerome Taylor 9.1-0-51-3, Kemar Roach 10-1-55-2, Jermaine Blackwood 1-0-7-0, Marlon Samuels 5-0 -38-0, Kieron Pollard 4-0-29-2.
West Indies: Leon Johnson c Vijay b Bumrah 7, Jermaine Blackwood c Gurkeerat Singh b Kulkarni 7, Marlon Samuels b Sharma 24, Denesh Ramdin c Bumrah b Karun 102, Kieron Pollard b Sharma 9, Darren Sammy c Samson b Kulkarni 50, Jason Holder c & b Bumrah 54, Jerome Taylor b Kulkarni 5, Ravi Rampaul run out 0, Kemar Roach (not out) 0, Stuart Williams (not out) 0; Extras (lb-3, nb-1, w-4): 8; Total (for nine wkts. in 50 overs): 266.

Doordarshan to telecast programmes in Europe, Middle East; broadcast TV on cellphones
Vasudha Venugopal, ET Bureau Oct 6, 2014, 02.31AM IST
NEW DELHI: Doordarshan might be in the limelight for its controversial decision to telecast live RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat's Vijaya Dashami address, but life for the national broadcaster is only set to become more exciting with the Narendra Modi government's increasing emphasis on state run media.
For starters, the broadcaster's 30-year-old dream of going global may finally come true in January next year when it will be beamed free of cost to 120 million homes East, say I&B ministry officials. After the Maharashtra polls, I&B Minister Prakash Javadekar will hold the first inter-ministerial meeting of secretaries of ministries of external affairs, information and broadcasting, tourism, culture, and home affairs to finalise the content to be delivered to these countries.
Prasar Bharati CEO Jawhar Sircar told ETthat the meeting is likely to set a deadline and chalk out a consultative group for the project. "We need to finalise right content to project a new, dynamic India," he said.
Pact with German Broadcaster
The new aspirations of India have to be portrayed in a manner that European and Middle Eastern audiences would appreciate and understand. Expert advice of ambassadors who have worked in these countries would be useful, as would be those of TV professionals who have foreign experience," he said.
DD has also revived a project of digitisation of archaic terrestrial transmitters, and if things go as planned, viewers in 10 cities across the country would be able to watch the 20 channels of DD and private channels streamed by Prasar Bharati on mobile smartphones, tablets or laptops for free in a few months. I&B officials said the plan to go international acquired a fresh life after Prasar Bharti signed an agreement with German public service broadcaster Deutsche Welle to distribute DD's international channel abroad, and things have been moving at a fast pace ever since.
The first time DD opened its window to the world was in March 1995 when it launched its international channel DD World, which was renamed DD India in 2002. While it was promised that Indian cultural and social programmes up-linked from New Delhi could be watched in 38 countries across the world through INSAT-4B and INSAT-3A satellites, the project did not work out as planned. "All these years the programmes were only pumped up from here but not downlinked in these countries, so they could never reach people there.
No down-linker was available to take the feed to TV homes in these countries. Indian embassies could not do much as there were marketing and budgetary constraints as also a lack of expertise in media marketing," an official said.
Hundreds of crores were spent on this exercise that did not yield any result, recall DD old-timers. In 2013, when the UPA government wanted full services for international broadcast, a project with an estimate ofRs 3,000 crore a year was proposed by DD but it was not considered mostly due to financial reasons. International public broadcasters such as BBC or those in China, Japan or France are known to spend over Rs 4,000 crore a year on channels to project their nations in foreign countries.
"So we looked for an economic partnership with a foreign public broadcaster that could offer us easy direct access to TV homes. Germany's Deutsche Welle agreed and vacated a slot on the popular Euro Hotbird satellite and we gave them one in India. This will be DD's first-ever presence in the west as the new government gave us a go-ahead," said a senior official. DD now will get the platform of Hotbird-13B, a DTH medium which reaches Europe, Northern Africa and the whole of Middle East with 1,543 TV channels, of which 1,117 are free-toair.
"The present government has shown much interest in utilising the potential of DD that reaches 170 million TV households directly. We are seriously looking at gaining back lost viewership with distinctive, highquality programmes and interesting content, leveraging our infrastructure, access and rich archives," said another official in the I&B ministry.

90% of coal-bearing forests could be mined: ...90% of coal-bearing forests could be mined, says Forest Survey of India
Urmi Goswami, ET Bureau Oct 6, 2014, 04.00AM IST
(The FSI has, at the request…)
NEW DELHI: Nearly 90% of coal bearing forest areas could be opened up for mining, with the Forest Survey of India (FSI), the government's top body for assessing and monitoring forests, recommending that mining be barred in just 11% of forest areas with proven reserves of the dry fuel.
The recommendation, if accepted, would increase domestic coal production, and could bring down imports. Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar is expected to make a decision soon. The FSI has, at the request of the environment ministry, conducted an assessment to determine how much of the forests should be kept out of bounds of mining activities.
Indications are that only those forests that are extremely rich in biodiversity and cannot be regenerated by human efforts will be classified as inviolate or out of bounds for mining. "Mining will not be allowed in national sanctuaries and parks and wildlife reserves," an official explained. This is a significant reduction from the 29% forest area that had been demarcated as out of bounds for coal mining.
Activists critical of committee's recommendations
This was done as part of the "no-go/go" exercise undertaken jointly by the Central Mine Planning & Design Institute, a subsidiary of Coal India, and the environment ministry in 2010. That classification of coal-bearing forest areas had been undertaken across the coal fields of Talcher, Ib Valley, Singrauli, Mandiraigarh, Wardha, Sohagpur, North Karanpura, West Bokaro and Hasdeo Arand. That analysis used forest density and cover as parameters for determining areas to be kept out of bounds, and adjusting the results by adopting a cluster approach for coal blocks, and reworking coal block boundaries.
Mining was to be permitted in 4,62,939 hectares of the 6,48,750 hectares of coal-bearing forests that were assessed. "India can't afford to keep 30% of its coal-bearing forests out of bounds. We need to increase power generation, don't forget that there are as many as 400 million people who have no access to electricity and power is crucial for industrial growth. As of now coal is the mainstay of the country's energy basket," a senior official said, explaining the need to open larger areas for coal mining.
The ministry, which is still considering the FSI's assessment, argues that it is not an indiscriminate exercise to open up more areas for coal mining. "The no-go/go exercise mapped forest areas and coal blocks, evaluating the areas in terms of density of forest cover, area of the coal block under forest cover or gross forest cover and weighted forest cover (classifying the forests as very dense, moderately dense and open forests).
The current assessment takes into considerations parameters such as wildlife, forest cover, forest type, and landscape," a senior official argued. The most recent exercise by the FSI is a dilution of the recommendations of the 2012 committee headed by then environment secretary Tishyarakshit Chatterjee, which was asked to formulate objective parameters for identification of inviolate forest areas. The committee had used six indicators - forest type, biological richness, wildlife value, density of forest cover, integrity of landscape and hydrological value — to decide on forest areas where mining will not be permitted. Its report, submitted in July 2012, didn't find favour with ministries like coal, which feared that large swathes of forests would be kept out of bounds for mining.
The new NDA government, which reviewed the committee's recommendation, decided to revisit the assessments after objections were raised by the coal ministry. It decided to reduce the number of parameters for determining "inviolate" forests from six to four — wildlife value, forest cover, forest type, and integrity of landscape. Officials argued that biological richness is accounted for under wildlife value, and hydrological value under forest cover.
Activists have been critical of the Chatterjee committee's recommendations arguing that its parameters were narrow as it didn't take into account the loss of livelihoods and homes for large populations who are dependent on forests. They argue that the FSI assessment is flawed as well.
"The environment ministry is looking at the big picture, now we hope that the coal ministry will also address issues like their poor reforestation record, adhering to conditions laid out in the environmental and forest clearances, use better technology to disrupt smaller patches of forest," a government official said. Some experts argue that increasing the forest area where mining could be allowed is unlikely to make a major dent in India's coal imports.
According to the International Energy Agency, in 2013 India was a net importer of 178 million tonnes of coal. Domestic output accounted for 613 million tonnes, or 7.8% of global coal production. An increase in domestic coal production is unlikely to do away with imports. A crucial reason for this is that domestic coal is high in ash content, and is often not favoured by power plants using supercritical technologies.

Suzuki working on new diesel engine for MarutiSuzuki Motor in advanced stage of developing new diesel engine
By Ketan Thakkar , ET Bureau | 6 Oct, 2014, 08.15AM IST
Tweet
India levies higher excise tax on vehicles having engine size of more than 1.5 litres and that is the reason for developing a separate variant.
Mumbai: Maruti Suzuki may have more diesel options from its own portfolio of engines to power its vehicle, as parent Suzuki Motor in an advanced stage of developing a new 1.5-litre four-cylinder power plant targeting the Indian market.
Suzuki has already developed an 800-cc diesel engine and Maruti is expected to start using it soon. That engine is built on a modular platform, so there are multiple derivatives of it are expected. After the 800-cc engine, it is working on two derivatives of a four-cylinder engine, a 1.6-litre variant for Europe and a 1.5-litre one for India. India levies higher excise tax on vehicles having engine size of more 1.5 litres.
ET broke the news on Suzuki's endeavor to develop an 800-cc diesel engine in July 2012.
Maruti, India's top car maker by volume, currently sources diesel engines from Italian auto maker Fiat. "This new engine is expected to complement the existing Fiat multi-jet engine and will not replace it. The aim is to offer wider choice to the customers," said one of the people close to the company.
"The first probable product (with the new diesel engine) is expected to the next-generation Ertiga, even the future SUV and a new MPV is expected to be powered by this 1.5-litre engine," this person said.
He said the Ciaz sedan will also likely get the engine when it is upgraded, two to three years down the line, when it gets its mid-life refresh
A Maruti spokesperson said the company doesn't comment on its future products.
In an interaction with ET earlier, Kenichi Ayukawa, Maruti's managing director, said Suzuki was aiming to develop its own family of diesel engine, but didn't share the specifics then.
Chairman RC Bhargava had told ET that despite the bridging price gap between diesel and petrol, diesel-powered vehicles will continue to see strong demand.
Bhargava said: "If Suzuki develops a diesel engine family, for sure it will help Maruti Suzuki."
With the advent of newer technologies, diesel vehicles have bridged shortcomings on refinement with petrol-powered variants. Diesel also offers better mileage, a major consideration for Indian vehicle buyers.
Suzuki is developing the diesel engines with key inputs from its Indian subsidiary's research and development division.
People involved with the development said that the endeavour to have the company's own diesel engine began way back in 2009-10. The royalty for the new engine will be determined after it is packaged into the product said the person in the know of the development.
Gaurav Vangaal, senior analyst for forecasting at consultancy firm at IHS Automotive, said having its own a 1.5-litre motor will give Maruti more engine flexibility for its B-segment cars.
Fiat engine has always been fantastic performing its job under the hood since a decade and trade off would be difficult for Maruti.
"In this competitive world of auto industry, the consumer choice for getting more performance driven power train cannot be undermined. I would say every customer is important to maintain leadership dominance and if you don't offer anyone else will and not giving an option to choose from, simply brings you out of the competition," added Vangaal.
Hormazd Sorabjee, editor of Autocar India, said the 1.3-litre multijet diesel engine that Maruti sources from Fiat is no longer a benchmark in the market and it is getting eclipsed by bigger and better engines from the competition - Renault, Honda Motor, Volkswagen and Ford Motor have all brought in 1.5-litre diesels.
A 1.5-litre engine is generally better suited for sedans and compact SUVs but by the time it comes, the opportunity could be lost.
"The real dilemma is whether Maruti Suzuki should be investing in their own diesel engine. The introduction comes at a time, when the world is moving towards more stringent emission norms. When India moves towards the next level of emission norms, the diesel engine will have to upgraded, which will push the cost up and may make diesel cars less competitive," Sorabjee said.

Govt to propose panel for setting monetary policy with inflation focusGovernment in talks with RBI on panel to set monetary policy with an inflation focus
Deepshikha Sikarwar, ET Bureau Oct 6, 2014, 07.30AM IST
(The agreement, as suggested,…)
NEW DELHI: India is embarking on steps that will lead to the government agreeing to inflation targeting while monetary policy will be decided by a committee, in line with systems in the US and the UK, and marking the start of sweeping changes in the financial sector.
The finance ministry has begun discussions with the Reserve Bank of India on an agreement to put in place the framework that's needed along the lines of high-level panels such as the Urjit Patel committee and the BN Srikrishna-headed Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission.
The agreement will lead to creation of a committee to set monetary policy that will be geared to an inflation target. The contours of this plan will be made public so views can be sought before an accord is signed.
FSLRC suggested five-member panel
"Discussions are on with the RBI," said a finance ministry official, adding that the government is keen to have the framework in place soon.
The government had made its intentions clear in the July 10 budget presented by finance minister Arun Jaitley. "It is... essential to have a modern monetary policy framework to meet the challenge of an increasingly complex economy," Jaitley had said. "The government will, in close consultation with the RBI, put in place such a framework." The FSLRC had suggested setting up a fivemember monetary policy committee headed by the governor.
RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has said previously that Parliament should set the inflation target and the central bank should be mandated to achieve this.
Having a committee system in place would mark a radical shift in the way monetary policy is decided in the country. Currently, the governor is the sole authority to decide policy and the RBI board only has an advisory role. Following the change, policy will be decided by the proposed committee chaired by the governor through a vote.
The agreement is being proposed in the interim pending legislative changes on the lines of the 1997 deal between the RBI and the government to end the issuance of ad hoc treasury bills to finance budget deficits and replace that with the scheme of ways and means advances. Incidentally, the RBI has adopted inflation targeting as a basis of its monetary policy.
The consultations follow criticism of some FSLRC recommendations by Rajan and experts say it will be interesting to see what tack the central bank adopts in these early talks. The framework is being designed on the model followed in countries such as the US and the UK. In the latter, the treasury sets the remit of the monetary policy in discussion with the central bank, while decisions on policy are taken by a committee.
The proposed framework draws from the work of a number of expert committees on financial sector reforms including the highpowered expert committee on making Mumbai an international financial centre (IFC) and the Rajan panel on financial sector reforms, besides the Patel panel and the FSLRC. The new framework agreement would come into effect from a date decided by the RBI, the official said.
The Patel committee to revise and strengthen the monetary policy framework mooted a shift to the Consumer Price Index as the nominal anchor for inflation targeting and the setting up of a monetary policy committee headed by the governor with rate action decided by votes, the model followed by the US Federal Reserve. The FSLRC has recommended that price stability is a desirable goal in its own right, particularly in India, where inflation is known to hurt the poor and therefore the central bank must be given a quantitative objective that can be monitored by the central government for its monetary policy function.
The Rajan panel had said the RBI can best serve the cause of growth by focusing on controlling inflation, and intervening in currency markets only to limit excessive volatility. This focus can also best serve the cause of inclusion because the poorer sections are least hedged against inflation.
The RBI should formally have a single objective to stay close to a low inflation number, or within a range in the medium term, and move steadily to a single instrument, the short-term interest rate (the repo and reverse repo) to achieve this. The Mumbai IFC panel had said the gold standard for a monetary policy framework was a transparent, independent, inflation-targeting central bank.
Experts said the move marks a significant step in the direction of financial sector reforms. "This is a move towards modernising the monetary policy," said DK Joshi, chief economist at Crisil. "It would bring more clarity in the policy."

TOPICS
crime, law and justice
Mexican forensic experts recovered 28 charred bodies from a clandestine grave on the outskirts of this city where police engaged in a deadly clash with student protesters a week ago, Guerrero state’s chief prosecutor said on Sunday.
State Prosecutor Inaky Blanco said the corpses were too badly damaged for immediate identification and he could not say whether any of the dead could be some of the 43 college students reported missing after the confrontation with police. He said genetic testing of the remains could take two weeks to two months.
Mr. Blanco said one of the 30 people detained in the case had told investigators that 17 students were taken to the grave site and killed there. But he stressed that investigators had not confirmed the person’s story.
State police and prosecutors have been investigating the Iguala city police for misconduct during a series of violent incidents last weekend that resulted in six shooting deaths and more than two dozen people injured. Investigators said video showed police taking away an undetermined number of student protesters after a confrontation.
Twenty-two officers were detained soon after the violence, and Mr. Blanco has said eight other people were arrested in recent days, including seven members of an organized crime gang.
Mr. Blanco said on Saturday that some of those arrested had provided key clues that led investigators to the unmarked burial pits on an isolated hillside on the edge of Iguala, which is about 120 miles (200 kilometres) south of Mexico City. Speaking at a televised news conference Sunday, he said the site is in rugged terrain about a mile (2 kilometres) from the nearest road.
The prosecutor said the bodies had been put in the pits on top of branches and tree trunks, which were doused with a flammable substance such as gasoline and set on fire.
Vidulfo Rosales, a lawyer helping families of the missing students, said relatives of 37 of the young people already had provided DNA samples that will be used to determine if the recovered remains belong to any of the students.
As investigators worked at the grave site, up to 2,000 protesters blocked a main highway in the state capital of Chilpancingo demanding justice. “You took them alive, we want them returned alive,” read a huge banner hung across the road linking Mexico City and Acapulco.
Jesus Lopez, an Acapulco street vendor whose 19-year-old son Giovani is among the missing, said he hoped the remains weren’t those of the students.
Other relatives “told us that (the remains) were burned, and that they couldn’t be the kids,” Mr. Lopez said. “But we’re really nervous.”
Mexico’s National Human Rights Commission opened its own investigation into the case for possible “serious human rights abuses,” such as extrajudicial executions and forced disappearances by Iguala city police.
The commission said in a statement on Sunday that it had warned about the “delicate” situation in Guerrero, a southern state where poverty feeds social unrest and drug gangs clash over territory.
Anger over the discovery of the graves exploded Saturday night when a group of young people from the Aytozinapa teachers college attended by the missing protested outside the governor’s residence in Chilpancingo. They threw Molotov cocktails and overturned a car after state officials told them they would not be allowed to travel to the graves to determine if the bodies are those of their missing classmates.
Like many other schools in Mexico’s “rural teachers college” system, Aytozinapa is known for militant and radical protests.

The Nationals season lies in Doug Fisters handsBy James Wagner October 5 Follow @jameswagnerwp

The Nationals face elimination on Monday afternoon in San Francisco, trailing the Giants 2-0 in the best-of-five NLDS. Their season rests in the hands of Doug Fister, who could be considered their best starter this season. And Fister, the Nationals’ most playoff-tested pitcher, may be the player best equipped to handle the enormity of the situation.
“Doesn’t matter where he pitches,” Manager Matt Williams said. “It could be here, it could be D.C., it could be the moon. Doesn’t matter. He’s going to work fast, change speeds and throw strikes. It never changes with him. Certainly experience within the playoffs and World Series helps everybody, and has a chance to experience it. But he’s unfazed.”
The Nationals face a stiff challenge on Monday: Crawl out of an 0-2 series hole — caused mostly by their suddenly-dormant offense — against the Giants in San Francisco and their best starter, Madison Bumgarner. Fister understands what is at stake but, in his three stints in the playoffs he has learned how to handle it all.
“We definitely have to treat it as a regular start,” Fister said. “You can’t all of a sudden change your plan or your routine or anything else. For me, I really tend to try and block out as much as of the exterior influences that can occur, whether it’s fans, whether it’s media, whatever it may be. You know, I try and go about my day the same as I have for the last six months, whatever it is. When it comes time to get up on the mound and play in front of whatever it is, 45,000, 50,000 people, I tend to take a second, step off the mound, look around, soak it in and then let it go and get back to business.”
Fister has been preparing for this postseason start for some time. He last started in a game on Sept. 26, the day the Nationals clinched the NL’s top seed. He pitched in an intrasquad game on Wednesday to stay fresh. I “know that what I’ve worked on for the last eight months is going to be at my fingertips,” he said.
During the first two games of the NLDS, Fister watched with a keen eye. He took note of the Giants hitters’ tendencies. He watched how they reacted to Tanner Roark’s sinker and Jordan Zimmermann’s location on Saturday. Fister is familiar with the Giants, the team he faced in the 2012 World Series. In Game 2 of that series, Fister squared off against Bumgarner, gave up one run over six innings and lost . (Fister was also hit by a line drive in the head that game and stayed in.)
“It’s definitely a benefit with having some experience,” Fister said. “This is still a game of coming out here and making sure that you know you’ve done the work that you’ve presented for yourself. But it just comes down to executing and that is a big thing. [The Giants] have played well for a long time and they are on quite a roll. But at the same time, we have been backed into a corner before.”
Fister has pitched in eight postseason games, starting seven of them, and has a 2.98 ERA over 48 1/3 innings. In the 2011 ALDS, the Tigers and Yankees were knotted at two games. Fister started Game 5, allowed only one run over five innings and propelled the Tigers to a 3-2 win and series victory. The Nationals hope that Fister can help stave off the end of their season.
“Doug’s one of the best guys in baseball,” outfielder Bryce Harper said. “He’s been in elimination games before, he won a big one at Yankee Stadium a couple years back, so having Dougie out there is going to be a lot of fun. He’s going home. Hopefully he can go out there and do what he’s been doing all year long and take care of business.”
James Wagner joined the Post in August 2010 and, prior to covering the Nationals, covered high school sports across the region.

The economic impact of air traffic sabotage3
In one way, the sabotage incident is worse than a snowstorm, in that people didn't have time to adjust, Hubbard said. "A snowstorm you can see coming two or three days in advance and make alternate plans," he said.
"This affects people not just based in Chicago but traveling through Chicago because it's a hub. With O'Hare, it propagates through the rest of the system," Hubbard said.
In the time-is-money evaluation, flight delays cost passengers $37 per hour on average, according to a 2010 report commissioned by the Federal Aviation Administration. Rebooking from a canceled flight costs passengers 18 hours each on average.
"The big impact is on people's time," Hubbard said.
One way to think about the economic cost is to note how much airlines have to pay passengers to be bumped to a later flight. It would not be unusual for an airline to offer a passenger a $200 travel voucher to volunteer to be rebooked on a flight just two hours later -- and that's the price to get just a few people to move. The cost to get so many people to move would be far more, he said.
American Airlines spokeswoman Leslie Scott said it was too soon to assess the economic effect.
“We’re still taking stock of what impact it will have both financially and with operational statistics,” she said.
United Airlines declined to comment on the economic impact of the sabotage.

Online Gap subsidiary bans sale of animal fur0
"Never did I think that when I go to Baby Gap that I was actually endorsing the sale of fur," said Maddux, who teaches at a community college and has a 3-month-old daughter. She said she had never before created a petition but felt driven to express her outrage.
The petition on Change.org, a digital advocacy platform, caught fire on social media. Late Friday, Debbie Mesloh, Gap's senior director of public affairs, responded to the petition: "Your opinions and views matter to us. That is why, effective immediately, Piperlime will no longer sell real fur products, whether they are made by our company or not."
The petition closed Saturday, after all real-fur products were removed from Piperlime.
"I am just overwhelmed and overjoyed and it's really heartening to know that me, a teacher in Williamsburg, is able to change corporate policy," Maddux said.
PETA, which said it also had been pressuring Gap to stop selling fur on Piperlime since the beginning of September, said Gap is among many major retailers that have gone fur-free, from Ralph Lauren to Overstock.com. Dan Mathews, senior vice president at PETA, said the group has asked Gap to also remove fur sold at Intermix, a luxury multi-brand retailer owned by Gap.
The immediate and far reach of online petitions has made them a powerful tool for consumers to communicate and help effect change among businesses.
Change.org cites several victories, including Abercrombie & Fitch's launch of a plus-size line after a teenager collected 80,000 signatures, as well as Jamba Juice's decision to phase out plastic foam after a 10-year-old collected more than 130,000 signatures.

Air Transportation Air Transportation Industry O'Hare International Airport United Airlines American Airlines Dulles International Airport Midway Airport
Frontier Airlines, continuing its blitz on Chicago, is expected Tuesday to announce four more flights from its new base at O'Hare International Airport as the discounter transitions out of Chicago's Midway Airport. 
The announcement comes on the heels of Frontier's seven new destinations from O'Hare announced this month, which makes Chicago one of Frontier's "focus cities," along with a few others, such as Cleveland and Trenton, N.J., that offer a concentration of flights outside its lone hub in Denver.

"It's a huge market. O'Hare is the preferred airport," Frontier CEO Dave Siegel said in an interview. "You have two legacy carriers there (United Airlines and American Airlines), but it's still an underserved market where we can bring our low fares and friendly service, expand the market and create some additional choice for customers."
The Denver-based ultralow-cost carrier has flown limited flights from Midway since the late 1990s. But this month, it began its first flight from O'Hare, six days a week to Dulles airport outside Washington. The move to O'Hare means it's now going head to head with its primary competition in the deep-discount market, Spirit Airlines. 
Both airlines are known for low fares and for aggressively charging fees, even for carry-on bags and seat assignments.

Siegel said getting into O'Hare has been a priority for him since he took over at Frontier in 2012. 
"We have the advantage of the low fares and the great product. What we had was a disadvantage in the airport that we serve," Siegel said. The merger of American Airlines and US Airways freed up a gate for Frontier, he said.
Does Frontier plan to discontinue its service from Midway? "We haven't made any final decisions there, but you can see our growth is out of O'Hare," Siegel said.
Frontier, which started in 1994, will begin flying this week from O'Hare to Cleveland, Denver and Atlanta, with flights beginning later in the month to Phoenix and Salt Lake City. Las Vegas, Miami, and Orlando and Tampa, Fla., will be added in December, with Philadelphia added in March. Its limited year-round service out of Midway has mostly been to its Denver base and, more recently, Trenton.
With recent airline mergers and cutbacks in the total number of seats available in the domestic airline industry, airfares have been rising, Siegel said.
"What we're trying to be is a counterbalance to that," he said. "We're the only ones who deliver low fares and a great product to go with it."
I have flown the competition and flown Frontier. Worst customer service in the industry. I will never fly them again-- low cost- HA. You WILL pay for it. I did

For a departure on a random date, Monday, Nov. 3, to Denver, Frontier's fare is about $184 from O'Hare, while the cheapest legacy carriers, American and Chicago-based United, both had fares at $266, according to prices on Orbitz.com. Spirit had a flight the same day for $154.
Some Frontier customers have been less than thrilled with the airline recently.
For months, Frontier has ranked worst in customer-complaint rates, according to reports at the Department of Transportation. In July, the most recent data available, 4.22 formal complaints were lodged against Frontier for every 100,000 passengers it carried, nearly double its rate from the year before and far worse than the second-worst carrier, United, at 3.39 complaints per 100,000. Spirit, also known to garner rampant complaints, does not yet report its complaint rates to the department. Siegel contends that Frontier would rank better.
Siegel said customer complaints stem less from a problem with quality at the airline and more from a misunderstanding among customers about Frontier's new business model, implemented this year. 
Its new pricing policies unbundle services even further than most airlines, charging $25 to $50 for carry-on bags that must be stowed in the overhead compartment and $3 to $15 for seat assignments, for example. The airline said that when it introduced the new fees, it lowered base fares by an average of 12 percent. 
Frontier also offers packages of service for an extra cost that bring it more in line with service on a traditional carrier.
"Most of those complaints are around a lack of understanding of the new pricing policies," Siegel said. "There is some confusion in the marketplace. … There's a customer-education process." 
What differentiates Frontier, Siegel said, is that its fees are "more reasonable" even if there are a lot of them, as well as what he describes as "Rocky Mountain hospitality" provided by Frontier employees. And its aircraft are known for painted wild animals on the tail, a feature Frontier retained when it recently redesigned its livery.
"Our goal is to get those numbers in line with the best airlines," Siegel said of Frontier's complaint rate. "What I would say is, 'Fly us, fly the competition and judge for yourself.'"

2 Officials Resign In Pennsylvania Porn ScandalPennsylvania Porn Scandal Prompts 2 Top State Officials To Resign

Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett disclosed the resignations of Environmental Protection Secretary Christopher Abruzzo and Glenn Parno, a top lawyer in the Department of Environmental Protection, in separate announcements.  (AP Photo/Matt Rourke, File)
HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — A widening scandal over the exchange of emails containing pornography by current and former members of the attorney general's office has gripped the Pennsylvania Capitol all week.
Pennsylvania's state Supreme Court chief justice demanded information on whether any judges were part of the exchanges. Gov. Tom Corbett, who was attorney general when the emails were exchanged, was forced to defend his management of the office as he campaigns for a second term.
And on Thursday, two top officials who followed Corbett from the attorney general's office into his gubernatorial administration resigned.
Corbett disclosed the resignations of Environmental Protection Secretary Christopher Abruzzo and Glenn Parno, a top lawyer in the Department of Environmental Protection, in separate announcements hours apart, just as the attorney general's office was releasing copies of their email messages to the governor's office and news organizations.
Their departures came a week after Attorney General Kathleen Kane's office identified them as being among eight ex-employees who sent or received hundreds of pornographic images or videos in emails that were discovered during Kane's review of the Jerry Sandusky child sex abuse prosecution.
All eight men, who also include state police Commissioner Frank Noonan, worked under Corbett while he was the state's elected attorney general from 2005 to 2011. Corbett had requested details on the emails in question before determining if the four men employed in his administration should keep their jobs.
Kane is a Democrat who took office last year. Corbett, a Republican, is in the closing weeks of an uphill re-election campaign against Democrat Tom Wolf.
A review of the heavily redacted emails revealed an abundance of comments that were sexually suggestive, mostly about photographs that were originally attached to the emails but were not included in the released material.
Some of the more than 300 emails that the attorney general's office says Noonan received bore sexually tinged subject lines, such as "Bikini Wax Job."
Another message, received by some but not all of the participants, included a slur used against people of Arab descent and others who wear headdresses. Others expressed insensitive remarks about gays.
Abruzzo did not mention the emails in his resignation letter, which was released by Corbett's office. He wrote that he had not been given an opportunity to review any evidence to support the assertions against him but that he did not want the allegations to become "a distraction" for the Corbett administration.
"While I have no recollection of the specific accounts described by the media, I accept full responsibility for any lack of judgment I may have exhibited in 2009," he wrote. "I do not condone that behavior and it is not a reflection of the person or professional that I am."
The letter was Abruzzo's first public comment on the emails.
Abruzzo, 48, started in the attorney general's office in 1996 and advanced to oversee its drug-related prosecutions. When Corbett became governor in 2011, he made Abruzzo one of his deputy chiefs of staff and, later, environmental protection secretary, a Cabinet post.
Noonan, who is directing the manhunt for a fugitive suspected of killing a state trooper and wounding another in an ambush at a northeastern Pennsylvania barracks, has not commented.
The attorney general's office said Noonan received more 300 of the emails, but Corbett said records indicate that "he did not participate in opening, originating, forwarding or replying to any message."
No reason was given for Parno's resignation.

How to Make Daily Progress in Your Businessreddit
Credit: Istockphoto
As a business owner, I have learned that nothing happens unless something moves. Progress is important to growing your business, and you must take daily action in order to make progress. The key is pacing yourself. Get a clear vision of where you want to go and then determine what you can do daily to get you closer to your goals.
Determine each day to implement something new into your business. Do it first thing in the morning, before you get caught up in emails, phone calls and social media. Take new actions while you are at your sharpest. This is how you will develop a new, next-level routine. Make your list at night before bed and set your intentions to take action as soon as you start your day.
When you decide to improve and make daily progress in your business, you must adopt a personal resolve to move forward regardless of the obstacles that may arise (and they always arise). This may require strengthening your own mental toughness to achieve higher levels of success. Your mentality should be to go and do, instead of to sit and think. Many entrepreneurs wear themselves out by over-thinking every little detail, which always leads to becoming overwhelmed. Acting fast can eliminate stress, worry and anxiety and boost your business and your confidence. The best way to figure something out is to take action and make adjustments. You can always fix it on the fly. At least then you'll be making progress!
Instead of filling your time with non-important things that don't contribute any real value to your quality of life, your ability to help others or to your business cash flow, do what's most important to your bottom line. When you learn the tremendous power of taking daily, fast action--acting now instead of later--you'll begin to see more opportunities, better ideas and better income flowing in your life.
I suggest taking the approach, "What if my life depended on it?" This will give you the sense of urgency needed to help you instantly get clear on what matters most. Then you can take decisive, quick action that yields profitable results. Train yourself to think, decide and take action on an idea, and you'll instantly become better than those who learn thousands of ideas but do nothing with them. The best thing about taking action is that it breeds more clarity! My experience has been that it's better to do something rather than nothing at all. So taking action quickly and consistently can help you gain more clarity on achieving your goals.
You can do way more than you think when you focus and avoid unnecessary distractions. A key to this is to surround yourself with optimum people who can get the job done fast, and are willing and ready to work with you to achieve your goals for your business. Clearly communicate with your team what you want and when you want it done. Then, see your projects through to completion.
In addition to using a productive team, keep in mind that order precedes increase. It will be impossible to create a new you if your life is full of chaos and clutter. You must get yourself organized in every area of your life. Clean and organize your house, your car, your closets, your office, your desk and your files. Go through your computer files and folders. Eliminate anything that is no longer needed. The more order that you create for yourself, the more you will find clarity, answers and direction toward reaching your goals. It will be much easier to focus in on making daily progress.
Here is my action-packed to-do list to get you going:
Write out a plan and list it the night before.
Visualize your outcome with daily morning meditation.
Read books on your area of expertise.
Plan your social media posts, and post often.
Hire help so you can delegate and get more done.
Get a coach or a mentor to help you think bigger and guide you through growing your business.
Also, write a list of all the ideas that have come to you--or that are coming to you right now--that you haven't taken action on. Most people sit on ideas waiting for more and more clarity before they conquer them. If you could only see how much money you are literally sitting on by not taking action on your ideas!
As a business owner, you should keep ongoing lists of goals you want to accomplish in your business and your life. You can use your goals list to dream big and envision the future of your business. Goals keep you moving in the direction of your dreams. Write your goals with a clear picture in mind. Create monthly goals that you can actually achieve in a 30-day time frame. Set the goal high enough to stretch yourself but low enough that you don't give up before you start. This will keep you motivated and you will find it much easier to make progress every day.
You can also write daily goals. Each morning, write down five goals--five things that you want to accomplish in your business. Daily goals help you to focus on making progress every single day. You get an overwhelmingly gratifying feeling of achievement when you have reached your daily goals. Also, these small, daily steps will keep you from becoming overwhelmed with growing your business.
For daily progress, live each day with the intent to accomplish something on your daily goals list and you'll quickly accomplish twice as much as your peers and soar to great heights, living your dream life!

US Job Growth is Rising Solidly  So Why Isn t PayEmployers in the United States are hiring at a brisk pace. Unemployment has sunk to a nearly healthy rate. Jobs are being filled across a range of industries.
Yet the September jobs report released Friday contained a puzzling fact: Paychecks still aren't growing.
Economists regard stagnant wages as a red flag for the 5-year-old recovery. Robust job growth has typically fueled rising wages. And without higher pay, workers have less money to spend and save and that, in turn, keeps the economy from strengthening further.
Whatever meager pay raises most workers have received in this recovery have been all but eaten up by low inflation. The average hourly wage for non-management workers has remained $20.67 for two months. It's risen just 2.3 per cent year-over-year, just slightly above inflation.
It just might be the pivotal challenge for families as well as for the economy. The size of a paycheck shapes budgets for consumers, whose spending accounts for most of the U.S. economy's activity.
Weak pay gains, along with lower-than-normal inflation, will also influence when the Federal Reserve decides to start raising interest rates. Without more pay raises spreading across the economy, the Fed has less pressure to raise a key short-term rate from its record low near zero.
So why hasn't vigorous hiring led to better paydays?
Three factors help explain the unusual trend:
1. Unemployment needs to go even lower
The last time monthly wage growth outpaced inflation in any meaningful way was from mid-2006 through 2007, just before the Great Recession started. The unemployment rate then ranged between 4.4 per cent and 4.8 per cent. If that pattern holds true, unemployment would have to drop another full percentage point from its current 5.9 per cent before wages break out of their funk.
Economists note that wages are generally a "lagging" indicator. What they mean is that pay typically starts rising well after the job market has shown significant improvement. As the economy takes off, employers eventually need more workers to meet customer demand. Unless those companies boost pay, they often won't attract enough qualified candidates for the jobs they want to fill.
Some economists think we might be close to that point already but say we might not know until months after the fact.
"We may find out six months from now that 6 percent was the trigger point," said Maury Harris, an economist at the bank UBS.
2. Younger workers earn less
As older, higher-paid baby boomers retire, they're being replaced by younger workers who earn less. That demographic shift limits how much average pay can grow.
Recent college graduates are earning $692 a week, according to a paper issued this year by the San Francisco Federal Reserve. That's just shy of $36,000 a year. It's also slightly less than the average wage for all non-management workers most of whom lack a college degree and the additional earnings power it carries.
Based on the jobs report, more young workers are flooding the job market and are willing to work for less, said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial.
Employers can reduce costs by hiring more 20-somethings who don't have families to support. Or, they can dangle the possibility of replacing their older workers with younger ones to limit pay hikes for their existing employees.
"It's much easier to lower an entry-level wage than a wage for an existing worker," Swonk said. "It's also a bargaining chip that goes to employers over workers."
3. A hangover from the recession
After the most destructive economic slump since the 1930s, it can take years to heal.
In a speech in August, Fed Chair Janet Yellen floated an intriguing explanation for lackluster wage growth: Employers seldom cut wages during a recession, even though it might, in theory, make financial sense to do so.
The reason they don't is that wage cuts can break employee morale and possibly disrupt business. Since employers shouldered higher wages than they wanted to during the recession, they might be making up the difference by paying workers less during the recovery.
If true, this means wages may lag for a while longer. Yet once they do, they might "increase at a more rapid clip," Bank of America suggested in an analysis Friday.
What's more, lots of people have given up looking for work after being laid off during the recession. The government can track this trend by measuring the percentage of adults who either have a job or are looking for one.
This rate will decline naturally as waves of baby boomers retire. But some economists say the rate fell more during the recession than demographic trends alone would indicate. The rate was 62.7 per cent in September, down 3.3 percentage points from just before the recession. A single percentage point represents about 1.5 million potential workers.
Some of the unemployed gave up their job searches long ago. So the government no longer considers them part of the labor force. Still, many of them might still be open to accepting a job if the right one emerges. This means employers might in theory have a deeper supply of possible workers to choose from than the jobs report indicates.
The irony is that these long-term unemployed may be waiting to be offered higher pay. Yet the potential for pay growth is limited when so many people need work.
"The fact that wages remain stuck despite 48 successive months of job gains suggests that employers' bargaining power remains exceptionally strong," said Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution.

Next Supreme Court Term Will Be  More Important Than Any In The Last 50 Years   Court Watcher SaysPrevious Story
Next Story
Tom Goldstein: Next Supreme Court Term Will Be 'More Important Than Any In The Last 50 Years'
reddit
One of the nation's most well-known observers of the Supreme Court says the high court will face more consequential legal questions in the next few years than it has in the last five decades.
Tom Goldstein, an attorney and blogger at the widely respected SCOTUSblog , told NBC's Chuck Todd on Friday that potential decisions on abortion, affirmative action, gay marriage and the Affordable Care Act will make the latter half of the current Supreme Court term one to remember.
"[K]eep an eye on the abortion case coming out of Texas. Practically, it controls the fate of Roe v. Wade," Goldstein said in a "Meet the Press" chat on Twitter.
Thirteen abortion clinics shut down in Texas overnight after a federal appeals court ruled this week to allow a strict new anti-abortion law to go into effect. That leaves Texas with only seven providers, all of them concentrated in urban areas.
Goldstein predicted that the justices would take up the issue of same-sex marriage, which has continued to gain legal recognition across the nation. Missouri became the latest state to join the ranks after a judge struck down part of its gay marriage ban on Friday.
"[S]ame-sex marriage is the case of the (young) century. They have to take it. My guess is they hear the Utah challenge," he added .
The high court passed up an opportunity to hear a challenge on gay marriage on Thursday. Justices have their pick of bans on same-sex marriage in Utah, Oklahoma, Virginia, Indiana and Wisconsin, which have all recently been overturned by lower courts.
Also on Goldstein's radar is yet another challenge to the Affordable Care Act. The court may decide to hear a lawsuit that, if successful, would eliminate subsidies to millions of Americans who currently receive subsidized health insurance under its state-run exchanges.
"Way, way too few people are paying attention to this Obamacare challenge. It would destroy the statute," he said.
The Supreme Court scribe also predicted that Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg would make liberals wait several more years before stepping down. Some Democrats would like the 81-year-old justice to retire during President Barack Obama's final two years in office, so as to not risk a conservative appointment should Republicans take the White House in 2016. Ginsburg has other thoughts , however.
"Justice Ginsburg is going exactly nowhere. Not until after 2016," Goldstein said .

Gay Marriage Debate Splinters GOPGay Marriage Debate Splinters GOP Into Three Camps

NEW YORK (AP) — As same-sex marriage cases cascade through the federal courts, Republican politicians find themselves awkwardly split into three camps.
There's a small but growing number who favor legalizing gay marriage, a hard-core faction that continues to denounce it, and a sizable group in between that seems to wish the issue would disappear.
At one end of the spectrum, at least eight GOP members of Congress have endorsed same-sex marriage, and two openly gay GOP candidates for the House hope to join them.
In Massachusetts, Richard Tisei has run ads featuring his husband. In California, Carl DeMaio ran an ad showing him and his long-term partner in San Diego's gay-pride parade.
On the other flank, conservative Republicans in Congress have introduced legislation seeking to protect states from being forced to recognize same-sex marriages. One of those lawmakers is Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, a potential presidential contender who drew applause at a recent conservative gathering by saying, "We stand for marriage," and insisting that his party not shy away from "family values."
Then there's the large group in middle, not ready to embrace same-sex marriage but wary of antagonizing its supporters, including what polls suggest is a solid majority of Republicans under age 30.
Several GOP governors fit into this category, including Chris Christie of New Jersey, Tom Corbett of Pennsylvania, Susana Martinez of New Mexico and Brian Sandoval of Nevada. Each decided within the past year to back away from all-out legal fights against gay marriage.
Sandoval said Nevada's gay-marriage ban "is no longer defensible in court."
In the Great Lakes region, three GOP governors who are up for re-election and may be nursing presidential ambitions rarely raise the topic on their own.
Rick Snyder of Michigan, Scott Walker of Wisconsin and John Kasich of Ohio haven't disavowed past support for their states' bans on gay marriage, but don't seem eager to make it a high-profile issue as the bans are challenged in court.
The Supreme Court may soon say whether it will take up one or more same-sex marriage cases in its term that begins Monday. Were the justices to rule that gays and lesbians have a constitutional right to marry in all 50 states, some activists and political analysts believe it would be a relief for the GOP's 2016 presidential hopefuls.
"Then they wouldn't have to talk about it," said Evan Wolfson, who heads the advocacy group Freedom to Marry. "They'd really like the Supreme Court to finish the job and be able to move on."
For now, the issue remains volatile in several campaigns.
Three conservative groups, including the National Organization for Marriage, recently told GOP leaders in Congress that they would actively oppose Tisei, DeMaio and the GOP Senate nominee in Oregon, Monica Wehby, in large part because of their support for same-sex marriage.
"These candidates are betraying the party," said the group's president, Brian Brown. "The base of the party is very solid on social issues. The leadership cannot throw this base to the curb and expect to win any national election."
From the other direction, American Unity PAC, launched in 2012 by billionaire hedge fund manager and Republican donor Paul Singer, has been donating money to federal and state GOP candidates who support same-sex marriage. Money from the political action committee helped Rep. Richard Hanna, a gay-rights supporter, fend off a more conservative challenger in the June primary in the central New York district.
Jeff Cook-McCormac, a senior adviser to American Unity, said the GOP establishment is increasingly reluctant to take an aggressive stance against same-sex marriage, which is legal in 19 states and the District of Columbia.
"Republicans now recognize that focusing on this issue in a divisive way doesn't sell," he said. "People on both sides of the issue can and should be able to peacefully coexist."
At an American Unity event in Washington on Thursday, the president of a leading gay-rights group, Chad Griffin of the Human Rights Campaign, said Republicans have "an indispensable role" in the push for marriage equality and nondiscrimination laws.
"Once folks realize that LGBT people and our families aren't boogeymen, that we have real stories to tell, that's when we start to move forward not as Democrats and Republicans, but as Americans," Griffin said.
A major test for the GOP may come at its 2016 national convention in Cleveland, when a coalition called Young Conservatives for the Freedom to Marry will learn the results of its campaign to strip the party platform of a plank opposing same-sex marriage.
The campaign's manager is Tyler Deaton, a GOP state committeeman in New Hampshire.
"The Republican Party has to become much more respectful and inclusive of gay people and the people who love them," Deaton said. "It's the right thing to do. It's the politically smart thing to do."
Among the members of the Young Conservatives' leadership committee are Meghan McCain, daughter of GOP Sen. John McCain of Arizona, and the three eldest daughters of former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman, a GOP moderate who ran for the presidency in 2012.
Another political offspring, Mary Cheney, spoke Sept. 17 at a dinner hosted by the gay GOP group Log Cabin Republicans. In 2012, Cheney, daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, married her longtime partner — a union that caused a rift last year with Mary's sister, Liz.
"Simply and clearly affirming the rights and dignity of gay men and women will not make us a weaker party — it will help make us a majority party," Mary Cheney said.
A former head of the GOP Senate campaign committee, political consultant Rob Jesmer, predicted that the same-sex marriage issue would fade in prominence as today's young Republicans take a bigger role in the party.
"It's going look completely out of step to oppose it under all circumstances," Jesmer said. "For people 40 and under, they look at you like you're from Mars."

Indian Companies Raise Rs 4,500 Crore via NCDs so far in FY15
Press Trust of India | Updated On: October 05, 2014 19:31 (IST)
New Delhi: Indian companies have mopped up close to Rs 4,500 crore via retail issuance of non-convertible debentures (NCDs) till September 18 in the current fiscal year, primarily to meet their working capital requirements.
The capital mopped up through this route exceeded the targets during the period.
About Rs 42,383 crore had been garnered through 35 issues of NCDs in the entire fiscal year 2013-14.
NCDs are loan-linked bonds that can't be converted into stock and usually offer higher interest rates than convertible debentures.
Most of the funds have been raised to support the working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes.
Firms including Shriram City Union Finance, Kosamattam Finance, SREI Infrastructure Finance, ECL Finance, Midland Microfin and Muthoot Finance collectively raised Rs 4,439 crore via NCDs in the current fiscal year through 12 issuances, data from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) showed.
This was more than the initially targeted Rs 1,850 crore.
Shriram Transport Finance Company raised Rs 1,967 crore as against the target of Rs 500 crore; Muthoot Finance mopped up Rs 466 crore against a base size of Rs 250 crore, and ECL Finance garnered Rs 400 crore as against Rs 200 crore.

Muthoot Finance tapped the NCD route more than once.
During the year-ago period (April-September 2013-14), the companies - SREI Infrastructure Finance, Shriram Transport Finance Company, Rural Electrification Corporation and Muthoot Finance - had raised Rs 4,713 crore.

IRF Turnover Hits Rs 1.5 Lakh Crore in April-SeptemberWorld Stocks Grind Higher After Central Bank Stimulus Signals
New Delhi: Interest rate futures' turnover nearly hit Rs 1.5 lakh crore on bourses in the first half 2014-15, even as trading value in September slipped by nearly 32 per cent as against the previous month.
Trading of interest rate futures (IRF) on BSE, National Stock Exchange (NSE) and MCX-SX cumulatively stood at about Rs 1.48 lakh crore during April-September.
In September, however, the total trading value on the three bourses dipped 31.8 per cent to Rs 19,516 crore over the preceding month.
Turnover of IRF cumulatively stood at Rs 28,644.62 crore in August, data from the bourses showed.
An IRF, generally a contract between a buyer and a seller agreeing to the future delivery of any interest-bearing asset such as government bonds, was launched on the three exchanges in January this year.
Individually, NSE accounted for the highest share (93.7 per cent) in turnover among the bourses, during the first six months of the current fiscal y7ear. The bourse recorded a turnover of Rs 1.38 lakh crore on its platform for IRF.
At the same time, the IRF value stood at about Rs 7,831 crore on BSE followed by Rs 1,413.16 crore on MCX-SX.
For September, NSE saw an IRF turnover of Rs 17,926.62 crore, down 33 per cent from the preceding month. However, the exchange is much above BSE and MCX-SX both in terms of trading value and volume in IRF.
Trading value on the BSE dropped 9.65 per cent to Rs 1,568.41 crore last month.
Besides, trading in IRF on MCX-SX also saw a sharp dip at about Rs 21 crore in September from Rs 92.18 crore in August. Trading of IRFs on this exchange was above the Rs 100 crore level in the first four months of 2014-15 where in July it had recorded highest value for the fiscal year at Rs 536 crore.
In terms of volume, the exchanges together traded 73.69 lakh contracts on their platforms during the first half of 2014-15, with as many as 9.78 lakh trades in the last month.
The number of trades recorded last month was 31.7 per cent lower than in August.
NSE registered trading of 69 lakh contracts while BSE IRF volumes stood at 3.90 lakh, for April-September period.
Besides, as many as 70,473 IRF contracts have been traded on MCX-SX for period under review.
Last month, the IRF contracts traded on NSE stood at 8.98 lakh, followed by BSE (78,484) and MCX-SX (1,047).
The cash-settled IRFs provides market participants with a better option to hedge risks arising from fluctuations in interest rates, which depend on various factors including Reserve Bank (RBI) policy, demand for liquidity and flow of overseas funds.
Banks, primary dealers, mutual funds, insurance firms, foreign institutional investors (FIIs), corporates and brokers, as well as retail investors can trade in this product.

Why do foreign coaches failUpdated: October 5, 2014 23:19 IST
Why do foreign coaches fail?
Makarand Waingankar
international
Coaches maybe classified into two categories; a performance coach and a skills coach, writes Makarand Waingankar
In the middle of a series or a tournament, experts and enthusiasts probe players’ techniques in order to find faults. What makes little sense is how such efforts repeatedly end up laying most of the blame on the coach.
The appointment of foreign coaches especially raises expectations and the country impatiently waits for the magic to unfold.
Coaches may be broadly classified into two categories; a performance coach and a skills coach.
A performance coach is one who is sound in strategies and sporting acumen and with his knowledge of the abilities of players, formulates game plans. A skills coach on the other hand identifies faults in players’ techniques and helps rectify them.
As the description of the latter category indicates, the job of a skills coach is not during a series but is a continuous pursuit of a player.
Such training must be done before the competition. It is also incorrect for us to expect a coach to provide dual expertise at the international level.
Greg Chappell’s appointment brought much hyped expectations which faded just as quickly as they peaked.
John Buchanan’s appointment as KKR coach also created much buzz. Buchanan’s confidence in proposing the multiple-captain system created the buzz. That system failed completely.
It is important to remember that the Australian team that Buchanan coached was with many legends.
Another coach, Mickey Arthur from South Africa too failed to produce results as coach of the Australian team. Perhaps some foreign coaches failed to recognise the differences in the dressing room cultures of the teams they coached.
Hurriedly imposing successful models from one part of the world in another has never been the answer.
The appointment of Bobby Simpson is exemplary in this regard. During his decade-long reign as coach he oversaw Australia’s most dominant period in world cricket.
However, Simpson failed to translate this success when appointed consultant of the Indian team during the 1999 World Cup.
When one watched his fielding sessions with the Indian team at the Vengsarkar Academy, it appeared that he himself was the most enthusiastic participant but in strategy management his advice was ignored by the coach.
Not consistent
Duncan Fletcher’s record as England coach was quite good. Mike Atherton, Michael Vaughan and Nasser Hussain have been singing his praises; and now Ravi Shastri too is convinced about Fletcher’s sound knowledge of technique and strategy.
Why then is he not able to produce results consistently, especially when the bowling and fielding coaches were of his choice?
The appointment of Shastri seems to have shifted the burden of delivering magic onto him.
Shastri has been a successful leader in the past as the captain of a young, inexperienced India and Mumbai team.
He has the knack of getting things done.
Real test
His real test as a Team Director is to get Fletcher and the support staff to work on each player’s weaknesses.
Sanjay Bangar, Bharat Arun and R. Sridhar have enough experience regarding the approach and attitudes of Indian players.
Once Shastri gets all four heads together, the pieces will fall into place.

Written by Sarah Hafeez | New Delhi | Posted: October 6, 2014 1:58 am | Updated: October 6, 2014 5:40 am
Minutes after Delhi Police confirmed they had traced Jahnvi and informed her parents, residents of Raghubir Nagar, where she stays with her parents, came out in the streets to celebrate her homecoming — a week after she went missing from India Gate.
More than 150 residents assembled in the area and were seen bursting crackers and dancing to wedding songs. For the residents, it was a miracle that Jahnvi’s kidnappers had released her just kilometres away from her house. They danced, shouting, “Jahnvi mil gayi hai, Jahnvi mil gayi hai (Jahnvi has been found).”
Her parents took her to a local gurdwara and also paid a visit to the Delhi Police Commissioner’s house in Pandara Park, relatives said.
As one walked deeper into the alleyways of the DDA flat area where Jahnvi lives, everyone was wide awake. In a colony where almost everyone sleeps before midnight, this Sunday night was different. Lights were turned on in many houses and one could hear residents listening to the news.
A resident said, “ No one is going to sleep tonight. Jahnvi is coming back.” Veena, a neighbour said, “We were planning not to celebrate Diwali if Jahnvi did not come back. But now that she has, we have pulled out the crackers left from Dussehra and are bursting them to welcome her.”
Even young children in the colony, who had heard about Jahnvi’s disappearance, were heard cheering, Jahnvi aa rahi hai (Jahnvi is coming back).
Jahnvi’s relatives were anxiously waiting for her at their two-room flat in one of the buildings. Remembering the strain of the past one week Ravi Ahuja, Jahnvi’s uncle said, “We have not eaten properly or slept since the day Jahnvi went missing on September 28.
We searched for her at India Gate for 48 hours. We came back home but refused to believe that we would never see her again. We then started a Facebook campaign, distributed posters carrying her pictures and relentlessly searched for her in our area also. We went door-to-door searching for her. In the last two days, we also held a candlelight march in the hope of creating awareness throughout the country to find her.”
At the Mayapuri police station when Jahnvi’s identity was confirmed by her parents, she was then taken to the RML for a medical examination.
After the resident identified Jahnvi, police officers rushed to the spot and informed their senior officers. Police then contacted her parents and asked them to come to Mayapuri police station in West Delhi to confirm the girl’s identity. It was a tense 30 minutes before the parents finally arrived and confirmed that it was Jahnvi.
Additional Commissioner of Police (New Delhi) S B S Tyagi said the kidnappers had shaved Jahnvi’s head, apparently to hide her identity. “I cannot say much at continued…

Small city routes hold big potential for Ind...Small city routes hold big potential for India airlines
By Reuters | 6 Oct, 2014, 03.49AM IST
Higher disposable incomes, an expanding middle class and rapid urbanisation have made India one of the world's fastest growing domestic aviation markets.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
NEW DELHI: The airport in Patna, one of the country's smaller cities, is so crowded that government authorities this year said they need to build another one.
The airport has seen the number of passengers, and daily flights, double in the last four years as the country's largest carrier IndiGo Airlines and smaller rivals like GoAir seek to cash in on a surge in demand for air travel from smaller regions to offset losses on highly competitive "trunk" routes linking big cities.
"We are close to capacity in our arrivals and departure lounges," said Santosh Kumar, who runs operations at Patna airport. "We can handle more planes but it is only possible with a bigger terminal. We need a bigger airport."
Higher disposable incomes, an expanding middle class and rapid urbanisation have made India one of the world's fastest growing domestic aviation markets, where passenger numbers are expected to grow by more than 75 per cent in the next six years to exceed 217 million.
Much of that growth is expected to come from smaller cities like Patna, where more people are flying for the first time. Passenger numbers from these places have risen nearly 17 per cent a year since 2009, compared to 7.6 per cent from larger hubs, data from industry analysts CAPA - Centre for Aviation show.
That trend is set to continue as more airports are built in smaller cities. This month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government picked five smaller cities to kick off a nationwide initiative to build about 50 new airports.
"The opportunity is changing," said Aditya Ghosh, president of IndiGo, which now flies larger Airbus A320 planes to and from Patna instead of smaller ATR jets. "On some of these smaller routes, the planes are more full than the trunk routes."
Fifth largest carrier GoAir has also boosted flights to and from Patna and other smaller cities, Chief Executive Giorgio de Roni said, as these regional routes now make more money than the more congested routes between Mumbai and Delhi.
Air India's regional unit is also looking at increasing its fleet to tap a larger share of this market, industry officials said. Air India did not respond to requests for comment.
While more established carriers see regional travel as a way to counter the razor-thin margins and losses on big city routes, a crop of new airlines are catering only to regional demand.
Zav Airways plans to start flying within the northeast in 2015, when Air Carnival also aims to fly within the south, according to CAPA.
Air Costa began flying within southern India last October and this year, it agreed to buy 50 jets from Embraer SA in the biggest aircraft deal for an Indian regional carrier so far this year.
Chief Financial Officer Vivek Choudhary said Air Costa was bracing for competition. "But we are capitalising on the first-mover advantage," he added.
For now, demand for regional travel outstrips supply, making the sector attractive for airlines. Air travel penetration in India remains small in global terms, with 0.04 annual trips per capita against 0.3 in China and more than two in the United States.
Industry analysts, however, warn that as more carriers pile into the sector, fares will fall and airlines will face the same pressure on yields as they do now on big city routes.
"There is huge latent demand in some of these smaller cities," said Dhiraj Mathur, an executive director at PwC India who focuses on aerospace and defence. "But there's always a danger from increased competition."

3 Reasons Why Millennials Remain a Complete Mystery to Youreddit
Do you still talk about Millennials like you just don't get them at your organization? Who are they? What motivates them? Why are their expectations and approaches so different? Millennials are rewriting the rules of the workplace and, like the end of the dinosaur age, the corporate world is struggling to catch on. There are corporate organizations that do understand but are now in the uncharted territory where new structure is invented, reinvented, and reinvented again until something sticks. They are on a whole new playing field. If your organization isn't on that playing field yet, here are 3 concepts to help make the leap.
Understand the Impact of Formative Year Events
Millennials had a drastically different childhood and coming of age experience than previous generations due to the wealth of information available to them due to technology. Put yourself in their shoes and understand the drivers behind the traits often named of Millennials: self-entitled, disloyal, indecisive, among others. For example, have you ever considered that the appearance of being entitled is driven instead by a need for immediacy from growing up with technology? Not just the need for immediate response, but the expectation for immediate growth as evidenced by the rapid rate of technology evolution in their childhood. Earlier promotions? Why wouldn't you expect your employees to grow at the rate of today's innovative cycle vs. yesterday's slower paced world?
See the Future from a Millennial's Eyes
Many Millennial career expectations and behaviors are linked to the way they see their future shaping up. Older generations are more accustomed to the idea of long-term financial security and innovation geared towards making life easier. While Millennials also have benefited from the advances in society, we see a future that is very unpredictable. The immense challenges we face in the future with financial stability, global markets and demographics, environmental catastrophe potential, and other challenges create a shorter term outlook, rely and look out for yourself, YOLO mentality (You Only Live Once).
Some of this mentality is also due to our young age. Consider that most Millennials heavily distrust both corporate organizations and government to take care of their long term future. For example, the PEW Research Center reported in March 2014 that only 6% of Millennials believe Social Security will be able to provide for them at the same level as today's retirees. The inability to rely on companies or the government to help take care of one's financial future is an alarming concept and truly drives this generation to look to alternative means to secure their long term future. This is just one example of the many immense concerns in the Millennial generation's outlook for the future.
Talk to a Millennial
Set aside your assumptions of this generation for a moment and go talk to them. You'll find that yes, there are Millennials who grew up heavily influenced by helicopter parents and the Self Esteem Movement, but you will also discover the wide diversity within the Millennial generation. In the U.S., this is the most diverse generation of all previous generations. The better practice is to not assume the background of a Millennial. For example, the perception of entitled could be because a Millennial had helicopter parents, but equivalently could be because a Millennial had divorced parents, low income background and has a strong drive to make it to the next level. These vastly different backgrounds can still lead to the same external behavior, but point towards different ways of managing the individual.
If you and your organization take the time to truly discover this generation, you'll find that Millennials are much more like yourself than you thought. You'll also find that they have real concerns and desires that, if understood can, not only drive increased engagement and retention of this generation, but help design businesses that will survive the disruptions and innovations coming in the next century.

Miami Beach Prepares For Annual 'King Tide' Flooding And A Taste Of Future Sea Level Rise

Vehicles negotiate heavily flooded streets as rain falls, Tuesday, Sept. 23, 2014, in Miami Beach, Fla. Certain neighborhoods regularly experience flooding during heavy rains and extreme high tides.  New storm water pumps are currently being installed along the bay front in Miami Beach. National and regional climate change risk assessments have used the flooding to illustrate the Miami area's vulnerability to rising sea levels.  | ASSOCIATED PRESS

MIAMI BEACH, Fla., Oct. 3 (Reuters) - Construction crews are  wading into chest high pools of muck in a race against time to  install pumps Miami Beach officials hope will help control an  annual super-high tide threatening to flood south Florida's  popular seaside city next week.
Around Oct. 9, a so-called "King Tide" is expected to push  almost an extra foot (30 cm) of water onto streets, going over   sea walls and forcing residents to wade through flooded streets,  an annual event causing widespread damage.
"It's been a nightmare," said Andreas Schreiner, who has  seen past high tides bring water up to and even inside his group  of neighborhood restaurants, causing tens of thousands of  dollars in losses due temporary shut downs and cleanup.
The event, caused by the alignment of the sun, moon and  Earth, provides a taste of the potential impact of a longer-term   two-foot sea level rise predicted for south Florida by 2060,  according to the United States Geological Survey.
The low-lying greater Miami area, with a population of 5.7  million, is one of the world's most at-risk urban communities,  scientists told a U.S. Senate subcommittee hearing in April.
The King Tide is expected to rise to almost four feet. With  seven miles of coastline, Miami Beach is already seeing more  frequent salt-water street flooding at high tide, according to  Miami Beach City Manager Jimmy Morales.
To combat such widespread flooding, the city has set aside  $300 million to 400 million to install up to 50 pumps in the  coming years in what some say is a vain effort to protect an  estimated $23 billion of real estate.
Bigger sea walls are not an option as Miami Beach's flooding  is caused largely by water rising underfoot through porous  limestone bedrock. Officials concede pumping water back into the  ocean is only a short-term solution.
Standing near four pumps that will each push 7,000 gallons  per second when switched on, Miami Beach's chief engineer, Bruce  Mowry, said rising seas pose a constant challenge.
"The technology is never as effective as it was when you  first installed it," he said.
The city is also retrofitting 300 outflow valves that allow  stormwater to drain into the bay, inserting plugs to prevent the  reverse flow of sea water. Dunes are being reinforced with sea  oats and engineers are looking into pumping water into  underground storage.
Apart from these measures, Miami Beach has begun to develop  a long-term plan for coping with sea level rise, including  pushing developers to sacrifice street-level space for more  elevated building designs.
"It's a retreat up," said Morales.
Doing so is critical to quell concerns of insurers and  lenders backing the city's blockbuster development.
"In order to keep the real estate market hot, we need to  assure people who understand this that we are doing everything  in our power," Morales added. "Do you wait till it's at your  ankles and knees?"     (Editing by David Adams and Steve Orlofsky)

It s Not All Doom and Gloom: What We Can Do Now for the Arcticreddit
Last week I was in New York, where policy makers and the public alike spoke out about climate change. None of us are strangers to the realities of climate change -- steadily climbing temperatures and carbon dioxide (CO2) levels, melting ice and rising sea levels. However, fewer people are aware of how they can help to tackle the problem.
While we often think about the effect of climate change on our lives and on the land we inhabit, it's also important to focus on the blue spaces that make up so much of the Earth.
The ocean covers two thirds of the planet, produces almost half of all the oxygen we breathe and sequesters more than a quarter of the CO2 we emit into the atmosphere. It is, in essence, the kidneys of our planet, keeping systems healthy, giving life -- and there is no way to put it on dialysis.
The ability of this life system to continue to provide these essential ecosystem services is being compromised. As rising temperatures reduce the oxygen carrying capacity of the ocean and the amount of CO2 being absorbed causes acidification , marine organisms and ecosystems are suffering. Habitats are being destroyed, fish stocks are over exploited and marine predators are becoming extinct at an alarming rate.
In the Arctic, the problem is particularly clear: it's melting. Beyond the four million people living there who are affected every day by rising temperatures, we all face the consequences of the changes in the Arctic. Extreme weather, rising sea levels and food insecurity, particularly in the most impoverished parts of the world, are all growing problems. As the ice is melting, a new ocean is being born -- one that some may try to exploit through fishing and oil and gas drilling, which is fraught with uncertainty and has the potential for devastating harm.
So where do we go from here? There is an extraordinary opportunity to rescue this new ocean, 'refreeze' what we can by establishing structures to protect this beautiful place before it's even fully born and understood. Just as a healthy body is more resilient to disease, a healthy ocean is more resilient to harmful change.
The International Declaration on the Future of the Arctic is a charter for Arctic protection being spearheaded by our friends at Greenpeace. I have signed the declaration and look forward to working with the leaders of the Arctic States and representatives from the United Nations to ensure that the Arctic is fully protected before it's too late.
In this time where we feel paralyzed by messages of doom and gloom, let's remember that we can change things. We can make a difference and we have a responsibility to future generations to ensure that our actions today don't destroy their future.
Millions have already declared their support for protecting the Arctic. Join us - sign the pledge here .

Liverpool's Adam Lallana celebrates after scoring the opening goal during their …
By Tom Hayward
LONDON (Reuters) - Yaya Toure and Sergio Aguero struck late as Premier League champions Manchester City climbed within two points of table-topping Chelsea thanks to a patient 2-0 victory at a resolute Aston Villa on Saturday.
Toure curled home a beautifully placed low shot in the 82nd minute before Aguero thundered in a second six minutes later after the visitors spurned a host of chances in what had been a dominant yet wasteful display.
City climbed to second with 14 points, one point ahead of third-placed Southampton and two behind Chelsea who host Arsenal in a London derby on Sunday.
Adam Lallana and Jordan Henderson scored as Liverpool registered their first league win since August by grinding out a hard-fought 2-1 victory over West Bromwich Albion at Anfield.
Papiss Cisse struck twice to ease the growing pressure on under-fire Newcastle United manager Alan Pardew in a 2-2 draw against Swansea City at the Liberty Stadium.
Sunderland beat Stoke City 3-1 for their first league win of the season, Hull City beat Crystal Palace 2-0 to condemn Neil Warnock to his first league defeat since returning to the south London club and Ross Wallace scored deep into stoppage time as Burnley grabbed a 2-2 draw against Leicester City.
CREATIVE MAESTRO
With creative maestro David Silva dictating City's attacks, chances were in regular supply, though their Bosnia forward Edin Dzeko was guilty of wasting three clear opportunities in the opening period.The second half began at a frantic paste with Aguero hitting the post before Kieran Richardson was let down by a poor touch as he raced clear at the opposite end.
As a goalless draw beckoned Toure, criticised in recent months for a series of anonymous performances, was granted space on the edge of the area and dispatched a precise shot.
Aguero doubled the lead minutes later with a powerful shot from the edge of the area as City recorded their first league clean sheet since the opening day of the campaign.
"It is a fantastic win. Full credit to Villa for the way they played but in the second half we did the job," Toure told Sky Sports.
"The most important thing for me is to try my best. I need to work harder and continue going and the most important thing for me and the team is to repeat what we did last year.
LACKLUSTRE DISPLAY
Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers dropped Mario Balotelli after being critical of the Italy striker's shortage of goals following a lacklustre 1-0 Champions League loss at FC Basel in midweek.
A reinvigorated West Brom were rarely troubled before England international Lallana gave the hosts the lead on the stroke of halftime.
The 26-year-old exchanged passes with England team mate Henderson before dispatching a sharp finish low into the bottom corner for his first Liverpool goal.
West Brom started the second half brightly and restored parity after 56 minutes through Saido Berahino's fifth league goal of the season.
The 21-year-old coolly converted his penalty after he was felled by Dejan Lovren, despite the infringement appearing to occur outside the area.    The visitors continued to take the game to Liverpool but fell behind again after Henderson collected Raheem Sterling's pass and finished smartly.
"It was vital (we won). We needed to find a way to win today against a side that is really high on confidence," Rodgers told Sky Sports.
"An excellent result on the back of a disappointing European result. Their penalty was outside the box but the players showed their character and resilience to keep going and find a winner. It was an outstanding win for us."
PRESSURE RELIEVED
Cisse was Newcastle's hero as he twice equalised after goals from Swansea's Wilfried Bony and Wayne Routledge to earn a point, though they are yet to win in the league this season.
"To go behind twice shows great character from the team. I'm pleased with a point," Pardew told Sky Sports
"We are where we are and there is a lot of pressure on us and it's difficult to play. Hopefully, we can get ourselves a couple of wins and we can get some confidence back and show we are a better side than we are at the moment."

How to choose the right mix of investmentsView Gallery
9 investment lessons you must know
Earn. Save. Invest. That is the mantra we are told to follow. We are even given options like stocks, fixed deposits, mutual funds, insurance, and so on.
Yet, it is not as easy as it seems. There are thousands of stocks, mutual funds, fixed deposits and insurance options to choose from. It can get really overwhelming.
So how do we plan our investments? Here are a few factors to consider:
1.       What are you investing for? Get your goals in order:
How do you know how to invest if you don’t know what you are investing for? So, sit down and figure your end objective first. Do you want to retire a crorepati? Or do you want to simply ensure your money is safe from inflation? Or is it that you want a second source of income to meet your additional cash needs? Or it could be that you are investing to fund a new house or your child’s education. All these considerations matter. It will help you plan your investments better.
2.       How soon do you want your profits? Fix your investment horizon:
Suppose you are working on a project, knowing your deadline will help you plan, right? Exactly the same way, your end goal will help you decide what your investment horizon is. It could be long-term, medium-term or short-term. Simply put, this is the deadline by which you should have made profits or amassed your required wealth. It definitely has a say in which investment options you choose. For example, a long-term investor may prefer costlier growth stocks or a mutual fund, while a short-term investor may prefer volatile stocks irrespective of the company’s growth prospects.
3.       Do you need cash? Your liquidity requirements should be analysed:
Liquidity is the cash you have in your hands or bank accounts ready to be spent. It could also include some short-term liquid investment options. This is a very important factor to consider. Remember, until you start getting your profits through dividends or sale of assets, all your investments will only be considered an expense. This means, you will only see money going out of your pocket into an account that you may not be able to touch for a considerable period of time. This can affect your investment plan. It is important that you have money left for day-to-day use after you pay for your investments. For example, suppose you earn Rs 30,000 per month, and you have expenses worth Rs 15,000. Your monthly investment cannot exceed Rs 15,000. Otherwise, you will have trouble paying for your day-to-day needs.
Once you figure out your liquidity, you need to ensure it tallies with your goal. Suppose your investment goal needs you to invest more than possible, then you have some serious thinking to do and change your investment style.
4.       How much risk are you willing to take? Get your risk profile done:
Every investment involves some degree of risk. While that may seem scary, remember this – higher the risk, greater are the chances of returns. So, every investor is essentially compromising. If you want higher returns, you expose yourself to risk. If you want a safety net, you are settling for lower-than-average returns. This is one of the most important factors to take into consideration.
A higher risk-appetite means you can invest in stocks, maybe even derivatives and world stock markets. A lower appetite means you have to stick to bank deposits, mutual funds, insurance and bonds. So, you have to determine how much risk you are willing to take as an investor.
5.       Do you have any prior investments? Ensure your assets are diversified:
Suppose your wardrobe is full of pants, wouldn’t you rather go buy some shirts or skirts? Similarly, if you already have a certain asset, why would you want to put more money in it? You should rather opt for some other investment option. This will help balance your portfolio.
For this purpose, check if you have any prior investments. Sometimes, parents invest on behalf of their kids. Once they turn 18, parents give up controls of the assets. This will be considered as part of your portfolio. Then, you can choose some other instrument. Moreover, diversification is very important as it helps reduce your risks. Your kitty can have some high-risk and some low-risk investments. While the first helps you grow your money, the latter will act as a safety net.
6.       Do you have funds to meet emergencies? Create one now!
Always keep aside a portion of your money in an emergency fund. Ideally, this should be equal to at least three months’ salary. While you may opt to keep this money in your bank account, why not put it in a liquid mutual fund that will also earn you returns? That, however, is your call. What matters more is to be smart and keep some money aside to meet any unforeseen emergencies.
7.       Will your investments increase your tax liability?
Which tax bracket do you fall in? It really does matter. Different investments attract various amounts of tax. For example, equity investing is free of tax in the long term, but attracts 15% tax in the short term. On the other hand, some other investments are taxed according to your overall tax rate. So if you are in the 30% tax bracket, it may make sense to opt for equity investing, which attracts a lower tax. Some options are also tax-free, while some can actually help you save taxes. It helps to consider this while deciding your investments.

New Delhi: The Coal Ministry has formed an inter-ministerial group (IMG) to study the trend in the rail freight tariffs over the last two-three years and its impact on the price of coal.
The six-member group, under the chairmanship of Joint Secretary, Coal, has representatives from the ministries of power and railways, according to an official memorandum.
Representatives from Coal India and the Central Electricity Authority are also part of this group, it said.
"The terms of reference of the group would be to study the trends in rail freight tariffs over the last two-three years and its effect on the price of coal," it said.
It also said that the group will make a report and submit it to the government.
The government had in June increased freight rates by 6.5 per cent.
The previous UPA government had increased the coal freight rate by 5.7 per cent in Railway Budget 2013-14.
Former Coal India (CIL) chairman and managing director S Narsing Rao had said, "Coal sector, including Coal India, will have no effect due to increase in coal freight charges."
Coal India, which accounts for over 80 per cent of the domestic coal production, had increased the price of a certain grade of coal from one of its mines in Godda district of Jharkhand in April.
The increase has been with effect from April 1 as per the decision taken by the Coal India board.

Under fire, Mamata Banerjee sets up special team to investigate Burdwan blast incident

Kolkata: After coming under fire over the blast at Trinamool Congress leader Nurul Hasan Choudhury's residence in Khagragarh locality of Burdwan district, the West Bengal government has now set up a special team to investigate the incident. Some suspected Indian Mujahideen (IM) terrorists were killed while allegedly trying to make an IED.
State Home Secretary Basudeb Banerjee also rejected reports that RDX was recovered from the site. He also denied allegations that the local police was not cooperating with the central agencies.
He said, "A composite task force has been created for further probe into the incident. There may be a connection between these terrorists and terror modules operating out of Bangladeshi soil. There is no question of non-cooperation with central agencies."
#west bengal #mamata banerjee #burdwan #burdwan blast
The TMC has hit back at BJP and the CPI(M) saying that they were trying to tarnish the TMC's image. TMC leader Mukul Roy said, "I am saying this again and again that this is all done to disturb the peace of Bengal. CPI-M and BJP are trying to tarnish the image of Mamata Banerjee and the TMC."
Both BJP and the CPI-M have accused the Mamata Banerjee government of providing a safe haven to terrorists.
"We can safely conclude that West Bengal under Mamata Banerjee's rule has become a safe haven for anti-national elements and jihadi activities," alleged BJP Secretary Siddharth Nath Singh.
CPI-M leader Mohammed Salim said, "It is a serious issue. In recent years communal hatred and fundamentalism has spread under the TMC regime. The matter should be investigated and truth should come out. The government must ensure and try to find out why such incidents are taking place."
The police have also questioned the widows of the two suspects killed. The two women were detained along with a suspect who was critically injured in the blast on Thursday afternoon.
The CID of West Bengal police was looking into possible involvement of terror outfits like Lashkar-e-Toiba and Harkat-ul Jihadi al-Islami in the blast which left two suspected terrorists dead.
It is suspected that the victims of the explosion were associated with a terror outfit as a large number of watch dials, SIM cards, and other tools required to make improvised explosive devices were found in the house, police had said on Saturday.

Congress protests Javadekar's resignation over live telecast of RSS chief's speech

New Delhi: Scores of Congress workers and leaders on Sunday held a protest demanding immediate resignation of Union Minister Prakash Javadekar accusing him of forcing Doordarshan to go for live telecast of RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat's speech from Nagpur two days ago.
The Delhi Congress workers led by its chief Arvinder Singh Lovely were detained outside the DPCC office in central Delhi when they tried to carry out a procession towards Doordarshan office at Mandi House.
"The government has been influencing Doordarsan to propagate RSS' agenda of saffronisation. The Congress party will not tolerate this and we demand resignation of I&B Minister Prakash Javadekar," Lovely said addressing the protesters. Mounting a direct attack on the BJP, he said the whole country knows that the RSS is an organisation which has always got enmeshed in controversies in its bid to spread communalism.
Congress workers protest demanding immediate resignation of Prakash Javadekar accusing him of forcing Doordarshan to go for live telecast of Mohan Bhagwat's speech.
#mohan bhagawat #congress #prakash javadekar #bjp
He said the direct telecast of the speech by RSS chief Mohan Bhagat has hurt the sentiments of people who strongly uphold the principles of secularism. The live telecast of Bhagwat's address in Nagpur on October 3 by Doordarshan stoked a controversy with almost all major opposition parties accusing the government of "misusing" the state broadcaster while BJP defended it. Lovely also demanded that Prime Minister Narendra Modi apologise to the people of the country on this matter.
He said such an "unconstitutional incident had happened in the country for the first time, which would not be tolerated by the Congress Party at any cost."
Chief spokesperson of Delhi Congress Mukesh Sharma said RSS was a controversial religious and political organisation and showing Bhagwat's address live on Doordarshan was not at all acceptable. "Congress will not allow the government to be run from Nagpur," he said.
The protesters also burnt an effigy. Dismissing criticism over the issue, Javadekar had said that Prasar Bharati, which controls Doordarshan, takes its own decisions. He maintained that it was a "newsworthy" event covered by private channels too. Lovely also questioned the silence of Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal on this issue and alleged that he appeared to be in full agreement with the BJP on the matter.

Haryana polls: Sushma Swaraj campaigns for her sister in Safidon16
0
Jind (Haryana): Union Minister Sushma Swaraj on Sunday promised if voted to power in Haryana, the Bharatiya Janata Party will provide Rs 2,000 pension to senior citizens and widows, stipend for unemployed youths and security guards in every bus for women safety.
She was campaigning in the Safidon constituency in the Jind district for the BJP candidate and her sister Vandana Sharma.
Seeking votes on the plank of development, she assured the people that BJP, if elected, will give a clean and good governance and work for the welfare of the poor. Reaching out the people of the region, she said that its an important election for the BJP.
Swaraj said that the if the BJP forms its government in the state the old-age pension will be hiked from Rs 1,000 to Rs 2,000.
#haryana assembly elections 2014 #haryana #sushma swaraj #vandana sharma
"Earlier the BJP use to fight polls in Haryana in alliance with other political outfits, but now the party is contesting the elections on its own," she said, seeking peoples' mandate for development of Haryana.
Swaraj said that in the Lok Sabha polls, BJP's mission was 272 plus seats and its 50 plus seats in Haryana elections now.
"We have made our mission possible in Lok Sabha by winning 282 seats of our own and will make it in Assembly elections in Haryana too," she said. Haryana has 90 Assembly seats.
"No section of the society will be overlooked by the BJP," she said.
Swaraj said that the if the BJP forms its government in the state the old-age pension will be hiked from Rs 1,000 to Rs 2,000, the highest ever in the country.
Youths will be trained in handicraft to make them self employed, she said, adding that, unemployment allowance of Rs 6,000 will be given to 12th pass and Rs 9,000 to BA pass unemployed youths in the state.
She criticised the present and earlier state governments for allegedly ignoring the welfare of the state.
She said that the BJP intends to give better facilities to villages, bring transparency in administration, root out corruption and end the menace of female foeticide. She also promised the four laning of the national and the state highways in the state.
Haryana has a total of 90 Assembly seats and BJP is for the first time contesting polls alone. Its alliances with INLD and later with Haryana Janhit Congress have fallen apart.
In the Lok Sabha polls this year, Congress won only one of the 10 seats while BJP won seven out of the eight it contested. INLD won two seats.

Haryana polls: Sonia has veil over her eyes  God save Congress  says Amit Shah16

Sonepat: BJP President Amit Shah hit out at Congress chief Sonia Gandhi over her "empty vessels" barb directed at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying she has a "veil over her eyes" and cannot see or hear the cries of the poor who are being harassed by the Congress regime in Haryana.
"I do not know what your (Gandhi's) understanding is. But can you deny that atrocities are being perpetrated on women in Haryana and they are crying? Is it not true that farmers' land is being snatched away and they are crying?
"The youth are also crying as they are not getting employment opportunities. Is it not true? Soniaji, I know you cannot see the truth as there is a veil over your eyes," Shah said during a poll rally in Sonepat district of Haryana.
BJP President Amit Shah hit out at Congress chief Sonia Gandhi over her "empty vessels" barb directed at Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
#haryana assembly elections 2014 #haryana #amit shah #congress
Countering Gandhi over her remarks, Shah said people shouting loudly give a stronger suggestion of venting their anguish rather than establishing a falsehood.
"You (Gandhi) cannot understand this pain as you don't visit villages, you were not born to the poor and do not visit Dalits. Our prime minister is son of the poor. He has reached where he has after selling tea and well understands the hardships of the poor in villages. Soniaji, God save you and your party if you find all this false," Shah said.
Gandhi had charged during a public meeting in Haryana that the prime minister was "showing off" as if everything has been done only after his government came to power, to which Shah reacted saying that it was difficult to undo the "ill-deeds" committed by Congress over the last 60 years.
Shah further averred that BJP had given the nation a prime minister who speaks.
He said the difference between the previous Congress-led UPA regime and the NDA government in its first 100 days was that, earlier Pakistan began and ended the shelling from across the border, but now it is India which silences the firing which is started by Pakistan.
"Pakistan cannot dare behead any Indian soldier now. That is the difference which the Modi government has made in its first 100 days," Shah said.
The Congress president also came under attack from Union Minister and BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad over her remarks against Modi.
"I am pained to say that even after remaining out of power, Soniaji's speech writers don't do their homework. That is why she some times says such things. She will realise her mistake if she sees it in a mirror," Prasad said.
He claimed that while Congress had given a weak prime minister to lead the UPA government, BJP has put a strong person at the helm of the Union Cabinet.

Dilli Haat to open doors to embassies  stategovtsIt was only recently that the department had mooted a plan to involve artistes, who have yet to find a platform, to perform at Dilli Haat.
Written by Divya A | New Delhi | Posted: October 6, 2014 2:00 am
With the opening of a third Dilli Haat in Janakpuri recently, the Delhi Tourism Department is coming out with uniform plans to rejuvenate and popularise all three Dilli Haats. After asking upcoming artistes to perform free of cost at Dilli Haat, the department is now offering the stage space to state governments and embassies to celebrate their important events.
“We are sending out proposals to state governments to celebrate their respective statehood days in the Capital, at any of the three Dilli Haat open air theatres. These will be offered free of cost,” S S Yadav, Secretary (Art and Culture), said. “Next in the pipeline is to invite embassies to celebrate their national days and important festivals at Dilli Haat,” he added.
It was only recently that the department had mooted a plan to involve artistes, who have yet to find a platform, to perform at Dilli Haat. Officials said while there are sporadic events at Dilli Haat in INA, the other two — at Pitampura and Janakpuri — don’t seem to be doing well in terms of footfall. “The effort is to increase their visibility and recall value among the public in general,” Yadav said.
“States have already been sent letters inviting them to hold not only their statehood days, but also their other cultural and regional festivals at Dilli Haat. While some of these events will be for invitees only, wherever publicity is required to pull crowds, it can be done simultaneously by the respective states as well as by the Dilli Haat management, through electronic mailers and printed pamphlets,” Harish Govil, chief manager at the INA Dilli Haat, said.
Govil said states like Punjab and West Bengal have been celebrating Baisakhi and Durga Puja festivals at Dilli Haat for several years now by holding cultural programmes and setting up craft stalls, but the new plan will take it to the next level by turning it into a bigger, regular affair.

No one is going to sleep tonight  Jahnvi is comingbackPrint
Jahnvi’s relatives were anxiously waiting for her at their two-room flat in one of the buildings.
Written by Sarah Hafeez | New Delhi | Posted: October 6, 2014 1:58 am | Updated: October 6, 2014 5:40 am
Minutes after Delhi Police confirmed they had traced Jahnvi and informed her parents, residents of Raghubir Nagar, where she stays with her parents, came out in the streets to celebrate her homecoming — a week after she went missing from India Gate.
More than 150 residents assembled in the area and were seen bursting crackers and dancing to wedding songs. For the residents, it was a miracle that Jahnvi’s kidnappers had released her just kilometres away from her house. They danced, shouting, “Jahnvi mil gayi hai, Jahnvi mil gayi hai (Jahnvi has been found).”
Her parents took her to a local gurdwara and also paid a visit to the Delhi Police Commissioner’s house in Pandara Park, relatives said.
As one walked deeper into the alleyways of the DDA flat area where Jahnvi lives, everyone was wide awake. In a colony where almost everyone sleeps before midnight, this Sunday night was different. Lights were turned on in many houses and one could hear residents listening to the news.
A resident said, “ No one is going to sleep tonight. Jahnvi is coming back.” Veena, a neighbour said, “We were planning not to celebrate Diwali if Jahnvi did not come back. But now that she has, we have pulled out the crackers left from Dussehra and are bursting them to welcome her.”
Even young children in the colony, who had heard about Jahnvi’s disappearance, were heard cheering, Jahnvi aa rahi hai (Jahnvi is coming back).
Jahnvi’s relatives were anxiously waiting for her at their two-room flat in one of the buildings. Remembering the strain of the past one week Ravi Ahuja, Jahnvi’s uncle said, “We have not eaten properly or slept since the day Jahnvi went missing on September 28.
We searched for her at India Gate for 48 hours. We came back home but refused to believe that we would never see her again. We then started a Facebook campaign, distributed posters carrying her pictures and relentlessly searched for her in our area also. We went door-to-door searching for her. In the last two days, we also held a candlelight march in the hope of creating awareness throughout the country to find her.”
At the Mayapuri police station when Jahnvi’s identity was confirmed by her parents, she was then taken to the RML for a medical examination.
After the resident identified Jahnvi, police officers rushed to the spot and informed their senior officers. Police then contacted her parents and asked them to come to Mayapuri police station in West Delhi to confirm the girl’s identity. It was a tense 30 minutes before the parents finally arrived and confirmed that it was Jahnvi.
Additional Commissioner of Police (New Delhi) S B S Tyagi said the kidnappers had shaved Jahnvi’s head, apparently to hide her identity. “I cannot say much at continued…

Pre-booking for iPhone 6 series in India fro...Save precious time tracking your investments
NEW DELHI: Mobile phone distributor Ingram Micro Monday said that it will offer the much-awaited iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus devices in India from 12.01 AM on October 17, with pre-orders to start at the same time on October 7.
The devices will be available at all leading modern trade stores and retail outlets across India, the company said in a statement. It however didn't give details of the price.
Apple's new devices are expected to corner a chunk of the premium market when they are introduced in India on the back of pent up aspirational demand. The brand's iconic status — besides features such as a larger, crisper screen, faster processor, better camera and onboard storage of as much as 128 GB — will continue to draw consumers, experts expect.
They add that of the two, the iPhone 6 Plus with a 5.5-inch display could fare better, given the demand for handsets with larger screen sizes.
The strong demand in India for the devices is borne out by prices in the grey market. On eBay India, the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were available for between Rs 57,990 and Rs 1.29 lakh, based on the model and internal memory.
In grey markets such as Mumbai's Heera Panna shopping complex and Kolkata's AC Market and Fancy Market, the 16GB variant of the iPhone 6 was the most commonly available model at around Rs 60,000-62,000.
Apple recently announced that it had sold more than 10 million units of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus models in just three days after the launch on September 19 in 10 markets, setting a new record for the company. It further announced the availability of the new iPhones in 20 additional countries and said the devices will be launched in 115 countries by the end of the year.
Apple CEO Tim Cook said last week that while the company has managed the manufacturing ramp-up better than ever before with the new iPhones, it could have sold many more if supply was better and is working hard to fill orders as quickly as possible.

Even as the ruling Trinamool Congress in West Bengal came under attack from opposition parties for alleged terror links following the October 2 blast in Bardhaman district reportedly in the house of a party member, a Union Home Ministry official indicated that the National Investigation Agency (NIA) might take over the investigation.
Two men, identified as Shakil Ahmad and Sovon Mondal, were killed in the blast.
“The government has taken cognisance of the incident and may transfer the case to the NIA for further investigations if necessary,” the official said. Preliminary findings by Central agencies indicated that the two men killed in the blast at the house of TMC leader Nurul Hasan Choudhury could be linked to an extremist group.
The local police have purportedly seized several watch dials and SIM cards from the house, rented to Shakil Ahmad.

Former Infosys employee files new lawsuitFormer Infosys employee files new lawsuit seeking damages
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: October 10, 2014  | 10:14 IST
(Photo: Reuters)
A former Infosys employee responsible for starting a US investigation into the company's visa practices has filed another lawsuit demanding damages for alleged wrongful termination.
US national Jack Palmer, who was employed by Infosys in Alabama, said in the lawsuit filed on Thursday with a New Jersey court that he had been discriminated against because he flagged that the company was flouting US visa rules.
The lawsuit, seen by Reuters, did not specify how much damages Mr Palmer was seeking. Infosys did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Last year, Infosys paid up $34 million to end an investigation related to the widespread practice by Indian firms of flying workers to client sites in the United States on temporary visas. US authorities had been looking into Infosys' use of visas since 2011.
Mr Palmer had previously tried to take Infosys to court, but his earlier case was dismissed in August 2012.
Employment visas are a politically charged topic in the United States, especially those related to Indian IT services companies that are seen as taking jobs away from Americans.

Here s One Way To Protest China s Preference For Boysreddit
“Every artist is concerned with these questions, of who we are and where we are going,” says Prune Nourry, pulling her long brown hair away from her face. The gesture is impatient, and you can see why: Nourry is the artist behind "Terracotta Daughters ," an ambitious, multi-year project that involves carting 108 life-size sculptures around the world before finally burying them in China.
It’s a task that demands stamina, and an intolerance for such distractions as hair in the face. On display through the end of the week at the China Institute in Lower Manhattan, the installation recalls China’s famed Terracotta warriors, which were buried in the soil of Xi'an and discovered centuries later. Only instead of thousands of clay male soldiers, Nourry’s army is made up of statues of girls.
Born in France, Nourry has found her inspiration in the world’s most populous countries. A previous project took her to India, where she made hybrid sculptures of cows mixed with girls, to explore the country’s conflicted attitude toward women. Now she is questioning the Chinese paradigm of gender selection, by trotting around the likenesses of girls to be feted worldwide in a manner befitting the original Terracotta warriors.
The schoolgirl-ish ponytails and neckties didn’t come from thin air. The templates were eight original molds sculpted by Nourry, which she based on photographs she took of actual girls, orphans between the ages of 10 through 13, selected by the nonprofit agency The Children of Madaifu . The idea was to generate a contribution through the Daughters projects. Proceeds from the sale of these molds and various bronze versions went to fund Nourry's army, and three years of education for all of the girls.
Nourry chose to work near the site of the Terracotta warriors' burial, where the production of knockoff warriors has become a cottage industry. She enlisted help from the craftsman of a particularly beautiful factory located a few miles from where the girls live. The site struck her both for the quality of the light streaming in (she filmed the project as it was carried out), and a sense that, once inside, you could be in any era.
Rows of identical clay soldiers lent a futuristic quality to a scene that was otherwise old world, “more like a workshop than a factory,” she says, with busted windows through which plants crept. She compares the fecund atmosphere to that of Angkor Wat, the great overgrown temple in Cambodia. Additionally, she loved what she calls the “charisma” of the craftsmen’s faces and gestures.
The project wasn’t an easy sell. “I was French, young, foreign, a woman, didn’t speak the language. And here I had this monumental idea,” she says. The craftsmen disagreed with the base logic of the enterprise. “We don’t believe her imagination,” says one, Xian Feng, in a 20-minute film accompanying the China Institute installation. “Terracotta soldiers are warriors, and in the army it’s impossible to see girls.” To deny that reality, Feng says, “didn’t feel right to my hands.”
As he fell deeper into the project that feeling lessened. Nourry tasked Feng, a master craftsman who she calls the “column of the studio,” with developing unique faces for each girl. Initially he felt uninspired, but soon realized he had all he needed at the local school gate. He began to keep an eye out for interesting features and hairstyles. “At that time I was completely absorbed,” he says.
Nourry says part of the project was to simply change the minds of the craftsmen, many of whom experience the effects of gender selection in their homes. (Feng, for instance, calls his family “basically all boys.”) To further individualize the soldiers, Nourry had the original molds sliced into horizontal pieces: torso, head, legs. These were used as templates that could be swapped into a variety of combinations, so no two girls are alike.
Their last stop is China, where Nourry will commence what she calls a “complex” burial project next year. The warriors are scheduled to be unearthed in 2030, the year China’s gender imbalance is predicted to peak. Such a prospect is bleak, but Feng might say that rarity makes something precious. One of his more profound asides in the film is also one of the most surprising. “I like boys, but I like girls better,” he says with a smile. “In general, my family has too many boys. So that’s why.”

10 Painters Who Are Changing Their Medium In The 21 Century" FEW modern myths about art have been as persistent or as annoying as the so-called death of painting ," Roberta Smith wrote back in 2010. "Too many people -- most obviously women -- are just beginning to make their mark with the medium and are becoming active in its public dialogue."
Critics have been pondering the mortality of painting for decades. But we don't even have to travel that far back in time to get a glimpse of the debate. " Does Painting Still Matter? " questioned Hyperallergic in April of 2013. " The Rectangular Canvas Is Dead ," The New Republic declared a few months after.  " The Show Is Over: Has Painting Really Had Its Day ?" Jonathan Jones contemplated a mere couple of weeks later. In fact, Art F City has a handy guide to "The Painting Is Dead" Argument right here. Bottom line: nobody really knows. And even if they did, who are they to call the time of death on a centuries-old art-making method?
We tend to veer on the side of Smith, who makes a great point -- women and artists of color are just now getting a chance to impact a field long dominated by, well, white dudes. That's where " 100 Painters of Tomorrow " lands as well. The massive art book, authored by Kurt Beers of Beers Contemporary, is rather hopeful on the future of painting. "Painting is enjoying a remarkable creative renaissance in the 21st century," a summary reads. To prove the point, Beers and publisher Thames & Hudson recruited famous art world figures -- Cecily Brown, Yuko Hasegawa, and Suzanne Hudson to name a few -- to identify the most exciting names in contemporary painting. From a pool of 4,300 international artists, they narrowed it down to 100, spanning abstract to figuration, oil to mixed media, canvas to installation.

IRF turnover hits Rs 1.5 lakh crore in April-SeptemberFIIS
(Trading of interest rate…)
NEW DELHI: The turnover of interest rate futures on bourses nearly hit Rs 1.5 lakh crore in the first half 2014-15, even as trading value in September slipped by nearly 32 per cent from the previous month level.
Trading of interest rate futures (IRF) on BSE, NSE and MCX-SX cumulatively stood at about Rs 1.48 lakh crore during April-September period.
In September, however, the total trading value on the three stock exchanges dipped by 31.8 per cent to Rs 19,516 crore over the preceding month.
Turnover of IRF cumulatively stood at Rs 28,644.62 crore in August, as per the data available with the bourses.
An IRF, generally a contract between a buyer and a seller agreeing to the future delivery of any interest-bearing asset such as government bonds, was launched on the three exchanges in January this year.
Individually, NSE accounted for the highest share (93.7 per cent) in turnover among the bourses, during the first six months of the current fiscal. The bourse recorded a turnover of Rs 1.38 lakh crore on its platform for IRF.
At the same time, the IRF value stood at about Rs 7,831 crore on BSE followed by Rs 1,413.16 crore on MCX-SX.
For September, NSE saw a IRF turnover at Rs 17,926.62 crore, down 33 per cent from the preceding month. However, the exchange is much above BSE and MCX-SX both in terms of trading value and volume in IRF.
Trading value on the BSE, last month, dropped by 9.65 per cent to Rs 1,568.41 crore.
Besides, trading in IRF on MCX-SX also saw a sharp dip at about Rs 21 crore in September from Rs 92.18 crore in August. Trading of IRFs on this exchange was above the Rs 100 crore level in the first four months of 2014-15 where in July it had recorded highest value for the fiscal at Rs 536 crore.
In terms of volume, the exchanges together traded 73.69 lakh contracts on their platforms during the first half of 2014-15, with as many as 9.78 lakh trades in the last month.
The number of trades recorded last month were 31.7 per cent lower than in August.
NSE registered trading of 69 lakh contracts, while BSE IRF volumes stood at 3.90 lakh, for April-September period.
Besides, as many as 70,473 IRF contracts have been traded on MCX-SX for period under review.
Last month, the IRF contracts traded on NSE stood at 8.98 lakh, BSE (78,484) and MCX-SX (1047).
The cash-settled IRFs provides market participants with a better option to hedge risks arising from fluctuations in interest rates, which depend on various factors including RBI policy, demand for liquidity and flow of overseas funds.
Banks, primary dealers, mutual funds, insurance firms, FIIs , corporates and brokers, as well as retail investors can trade in this product .

BSE issues guidance note on price-sensitive disclosuresBSE issues guidance note on price-sensitive disclosures
Press Trust of India | New Delhi Oct 05, 2014 12:40 PM IST
To ensure timely and correct disclosure of all price-sensitive information and other material details by listed companies for benefit of investors, leading bourse BSE has issued a detailed 'guidance note' for such disclosures.
It is mandatory for all listed companies to immediately inform the exchange about all material and/or price sensitive events, which could have a bearing on the performance, operations or price of the company or its shares.
An indicative list of such material events forms part of the Listing Agreement between the BSE and the companies that list their shares on the exchange's platform.
These details need to be disclosed as per Clause 36 of the Listing Agreement.
"In order to assist and guide companies in understanding which events need to be disclosed and what would constitute relevant details with respect to the obligation for making continuous disclosures as per Clause 36 of the Listing Agreement, a Guidance Note has been compiled," BSE said in a circular.
"Going forward companies are requested to be guided by the points included in the said note - it may be noted that this note is merely a guidance and not an exclusive list of events or details.
"The companies are urged to submit comprehensive disclosures relating to material events, as they develop or crystallise, from time to time," it added.
A similar circular has been issued by another leading bourse NSE as well with its own guidance note on such disclosures.
As per BSE's guidance note, the indicative list of material events on which listed entities are required to make disclosures to the exchange include -- events such as strikes, lock-outs, closure on account of power cuts, etc, change in the general character or nature of business and disruption of operations due to natural calamity.
Such events also include commencement of Commercial Production or operations, developments with respect to pricing/realisation arising out of change in the regulatory framework litigation / dispute with a material impact, revision in ratings, as also any other information having bearing on the operation/performance of the listed entity as well as price sensitive information.
BSE said that "it is observed that, in the absence of any standard or guidance on fair disclosures for the appreciation/ assessment of the event by investors/shareholders, companies are furnishing varying details in their disclosures for similar events.
"Such variations are not helpful to investors to set their expectations on the information content in the disclosures under Clause 36 and therefore it is felt necessary to issue this guidance note to help companies to make comprehensive disclosures relating to indicative list of material events given in the current Clause 36," it added.
BSE CEO Ashish Chauhan recently said that such a guidance note will help the companies to understand beforehand what kinds of disclosures they are required to make for investors to take informed decisions and would help remove ambiguities and avoid unnecessary trouble for companies at a later stage.
As per BSE's eight-page guidance note, every listed company should have aa policy determining an authority within the company that is entitled to take a view on the materiality of an event that qualifies for disclosure.
It also prescribes the nature, quantum and periodicity of disclosures that the companies need to make in different scenarios, such as in the case of change in business, natural calamity, impact of strikes or lock-outs, commencement or closure of commercial operations, regulatory actions, disputes, merger or acquisitions, rating changes and issuance of securities, among other important developments.

Exports of 8 in 13 Key Agriculture Products in Negative Zone: Trade BodyNew Delhi: Exports of several agriculture products including rice, spices and tobacco have registered negative growth in August mainly due to a decline in prices in the global commodity market.
Tea, coffee, cereals, cashew and oil meals too recorded negative growth during the month.
In all, 8 out of 13 main agriculture products that are closely monitored by the Commerce Ministry were in the negative zone.
"Prices of agri-produce in the global market is generally depressed due to oversupply. But, on the other hand, prices here are much above the global prices making domestic market a better option than exports," said Ajay Sahai, DG and chief executive of Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO).
"These twin factors are primarily responsible for decline in exports of many agri commodities."
During the month, exports of rice, spices and tobacco declined 3.15 per cent to $600 million, 2.18 per cent to $227 million and 14.7 per cent to $73 million respectively, according to data from the Commerce Ministry.
Other products which have reported negative growth include tea (6.72 per cent), coffee (10.5 per cent), cereals (50.6 per cent), cashew (1.82 per cent) and oil meals (64.3 per cent).
Decline in these exports is a key factor for slow growth in India's overall merchandise exports. Growth rate of India's exports slipped to 5-month low of 2.35 per cent in August at $26.95 billion, pushing up the trade deficit to $10.83 billion.
Agri-products account for over 10 per cent of the country's total exports.
As per estimates, outbound shipments of agri-produce in 2010-11 amounted to $17.35 billion; $27.43 billion in 2011-12; $31.86 billion in 2012-13, and about $45 billion in 2013-14.
In order to boost agri-exports, the ministry is asking exporters to explore new markets and ship value-added products.
Sectors which grew at a healthy rate in August include oil seeds (37.2 per cent), fruits and vegetables (3.46 per cent), processed items (6.71 per cent), marine products (35.5 per cent) and meat, dairy and poultry items (37.2 per cent).

Move intended to expand investment avenues: PFRDA chief
New Delhi, October 5:  
Pension regulator PFRDA will soon allow pension funds to invest in covered bonds and asset-backed securities (ABS), said Chairman RV Verma. The proposed move comes on the heels of the pension funds being allowed to invest in Basel-III compliant bank bonds.
“The main idea is to widen the investment avenues for the pension funds. Inclusion of covered bonds and ABS as eligible instruments for investment would help deepen the capital markets. It will also help the issuers of these two instruments, as more long-term funding will be available to them for asset creation,” Verma told BusinessLine.
He said the financial stability and development council – an apex level body of financial sector regulators – had backed “covered bonds”.
Pension funds will also soon be allowed to invest in ABS issued in line with guidelines specified by the relevant financial sector regulator. These funds will also be permitted to invest in covered bonds issued in line with RBI specified guidelines,” he added.
Covered bonds
Covered bonds are basically a type of collateralised debt. The bond seller, typically a bank or a financial institution, maintains a “cover pool” of high-quality assets on his balance sheet to which the bond buyer has priority claim (ahead of any other creditors) should the seller default.
“The additional comfort for an investor in covered bonds is that the bond buyer will have dual recourse to both the specific pool of assets backing the bond as also other assets in the balance sheet, should the seller become delinquent on its payments,” Verma said.
The Reserve Bank of India has already clarified that a bank as an investor could park its funds in covered bonds, which are seen as a means for banks to raise long-term funding at a lower cost.
“In covered bonds, investors will have less risk of defaults and therefore their return expectation will have to be low. Issuers will be able to raise money at lower cost,” Verma said.
The assets underlying a covered bond simply enhances the issuer’s promise to pay back the loan and are not intended to offer exposure to those pool of assets.
Asset-backed securities
On the other side, an investor in ABS has limited recourse in the sense that there will be no access to other balance sheet assets beyond the defined underlying pool in case of any default.
In ABS, assets are packaged together (such as loans) and their payment streams are sold.
A securitisation – process of creating ABS – is advantageous to banks as it reduces the amount of capital that the bank must hold to back its loans. However, covered bonds – where the loans are kept on the banks balance sheet – do not provide this benefit.

Redskins Coach Jay Gruden wont avoid Seattle CB Richard ShermanBy Liz Clarke October 5 Follow @lizclarketweet
(John McDonnell/The Washington Post)
When Green Bay faced the Super Bowl champion Seattle Seahawks in the teams’ opener this season, quarterback Aaron Rodgers conceded half the field to cornerback Richard Sherman .
Of Rodgers’ 33 passes in the game, not one was directed at a receiver covered by Sherman, whose 20 career interceptions in just three season lead the league.
The strategy both irked and honored Sherman. It didn’t play out so well for Rodgers, either, who was intercepted by Seattle’s other all-pro cornerback, Byron Maxwell, en route to a 36-16 defeat.
Washington (1-3) faces a similar conundrum in preparing for Monday night’s meeting with Seattle (2-1).
Coming off a humiliating defeat in which Kirk Cousins ’s interceptions accounted for four of the Redskins’ six turnovers, where exactly should the backup quarterback target his throws?
“It’s a heck of a deal,” Coach Jay Gruden conceded of game planning against a Seattle secondary stocked with big players known for big-time plays. But Gruden said he had no intention of limiting Cousins to half the field. The 6-foot-3 Sherman boasts tremendous range, speed, smarts and the mind-set of a wide receiver, having played the position at Stanford before being converted to a cornerback midway through his college career.
“He’s obviously a great corner,” Gruden said of Sherman, who led the NFL with eight interceptions last season. “But we feel like we have good receivers, and we have to go out and challenge whoever the corner is. That’s why we went out and got DeSean Jackson and Pierre Garçon and Andre Roberts. So hopefully those guys will be up to the challenge. They definitely have to step up their routes, their route discipline coming in and out of breaks. And the quarterback has to do a great job with the accuracy and anticipation for us to have a chance.
“We’re not going to shy away from anybody, but obviously we know both corners are very good.”
Cousins echoed the coach’s sentiments, likening game planning around potential matchups to a chess match.
“[Richard Sherman] is a great corner; we have a lot of respect for him,” Cousins said. “There’s a reason he signed a great contract (worth $54.7 million over four years) and has a lot of success and a Super Bowl ring. So, he’s a guy to be aware of on the field. But at the same time you don’t want to be letting it affect you too much. That’s a balance you have got to find.”
Through three games this season, Sherman has yet to get an interception. Maxwell and 6-3 strong safety Kam Chancellor each have one.
The Redskins head into Week 5 against the defending Super Bowl champion Seattle Seahawks and their dynamic secondary. The Washington Post's Mike Jones and Jason Reid say that quarterback Kirk Cousins should proceed with caution when looking down field. (Randolph Smith/The Washington Post)

AAP MLA hits out at Kejriwal in scathing FB postPrint
Garg’s letter to Kejriwal, which was uploaded on his Facebook page, said, You should accept the truth and stop promoting the rich and corrupt within the party. (Source: PTI)
Written by Dipankar Ghose | New Delhi | Posted: October 6, 2014 2:06 am | Updated: October 6, 2014 10:01 am
The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) was hit by another show of dissent on Sunday after the party’s Rohini MLA Rajesh Garg reportedly wrote a scathing letter to party national convenor Arvind Kejriwal on a social networking site, asking him to stop promoting “rich and corrupt” people in the party and reconsider his stance on fresh elections.
This comes after a series of high-profile names such as Shazia Ilmi and Yogendra Yadav have either left or shown disagreement with the party. Garg, however, is the first MLA after Vinod Kumar Binny to have spoken against the party. Binny, who was refused a ministerial position in the AAP cabinet post their Assembly election win in December 2013, was subsequently expelled from the AAP.
Garg’s letter to Kejriwal, which was uploaded on his Facebook page, said, “You should accept the truth and stop promoting the rich and corrupt within the party. You should try and understand the pain and the suffering of the ordinary worker of the party, who has actually forsaken everything to rid this country of corruption… When you keep asking for the Assembly to be dissolved, have you ever thought of what happens to the people, party workers and elected representatives of different parties?”
Garg hit out at Kejriwal for failing to consult people if Delhi needed fresh elections or not and said a “better message” would have gone out if he had done so. “If we had shown courage on February 14, 2014 (the date of the party resigning from government) then we would have been serving the people of Delhi as currently nothing is possible because there is no government. Whoever forms the government does not matter. We had come to serve the people and not to form government,” he said.
He said the AAP must look towards resolving “the debt of 1,000 crore instead of being obstinate about fresh elections”. “Can we not do good work while sitting in the Opposition? We must also look at one more thing, that if elections happen again and no party gets a clear majority then what will we say to the people,” Garg’s letter reads.
When Newsline attempted to contact Garg seeking to confirm the authenticity of the letter, he replied via text message and said, “What is written on FB is true… meeting with party people.”
The party remained tightlipped on the matter and said, “We will ascertain the full facts of the matter and then respond. However, we want to make it clear that Rajesh Garg is very much an intrinsic part of the AAP, and there is no chance of him defecting or quitting the continued…

Dilli Haat to open doors to embassies  state govtsIt was only recently that the department had mooted a plan to involve artistes, who have yet to find a platform, to perform at Dilli Haat.
Written by Divya A | New Delhi | Posted: October 6, 2014 2:00 am
With the opening of a third Dilli Haat in Janakpuri recently, the Delhi Tourism Department is coming out with uniform plans to rejuvenate and popularise all three Dilli Haats. After asking upcoming artistes to perform free of cost at Dilli Haat, the department is now offering the stage space to state governments and embassies to celebrate their important events.
“We are sending out proposals to state governments to celebrate their respective statehood days in the Capital, at any of the three Dilli Haat open air theatres. These will be offered free of cost,” S S Yadav, Secretary (Art and Culture), said. “Next in the pipeline is to invite embassies to celebrate their national days and important festivals at Dilli Haat,” he added.
It was only recently that the department had mooted a plan to involve artistes, who have yet to find a platform, to perform at Dilli Haat. Officials said while there are sporadic events at Dilli Haat in INA, the other two — at Pitampura and Janakpuri — don’t seem to be doing well in terms of footfall. “The effort is to increase their visibility and recall value among the public in general,” Yadav said.
“States have already been sent letters inviting them to hold not only their statehood days, but also their other cultural and regional festivals at Dilli Haat. While some of these events will be for invitees only, wherever publicity is required to pull crowds, it can be done simultaneously by the respective states as well as by the Dilli Haat management, through electronic mailers and printed pamphlets,” Harish Govil, chief manager at the INA Dilli Haat, said.
Govil said states like Punjab and West Bengal have been celebrating Baisakhi and Durga Puja festivals at Dilli Haat for several years now by holding cultural programmes and setting up craft stalls, but the new plan will take it to the next level by turning it into a bigger, regular affair.

Bawana tense a day before BakridThe scrapyard near the petrol pump. ( Source: Express photo by Amit Mehra )
Written by Shalini Narayan | New Delhi | Posted: October 6, 2014 1:56 am
A day before Bakrid, tension prevailed in the industrial area of Bawana’s JJ Colony in Outer Delhi. While a section of the Jat community claimed their cattle were being stolen and sacrificed for the festival, a section of the Muslim community has alleged a mob pelted stones at them and threatened them.
On Sunday, the Jats called a meeting in Harevli village to form a committee to protect cattle. At the meeting, hundreds of people from 10-12 neighbouring villages assembled and pledged to abstain from eating non-vegetarian food, pray to God everyday and chant ‘Om’ for two minutes, protect cattle and admit them to gaushalas or treat them at hospitals if they were found injured.
Security was stepped up in the area. Commenting on the situation, DCP (Outer) Vikramjit Singh said, “There is adequate security in the area. There is no cause for worry.”
Tension has been simmering since October 2 when a 20-year-old scrapdealer was arrested for allegedly committing an unnatural act with a cow adjacent to a service station at Pooth Khurd in Bawana. Speaking to Newsline, the manager of Jai Mata Di service station Ved Prakash said, “There is a scrapyard adjacent to the service station, where the man came four days ago and stayed there. Around 11 am on October 2, one of our customers went till the scrapyard to relieve himself when he noticed something amiss. He informed us. By the time we went looking for the man, he had fled. Within a few hours, we caught him. He confessed he had committed an unnatural act with the animal. He was beaten up by local people and arrested by police.”
A senior police officer said a case under Section 377 IPC and sections of committing cruelty to animals has been registered.
Following Thursday’s incident, sections of the Hindu community gathered outside the service station and protested, demanding that their cattle be protected. The group caused a traffic jam for several hours at two intersections on the Bawana main road.
Sections of the Muslim community claimed otherwise. Kalimullah, the pradhan of JJ Colony, said, “On October 2, a scrapdealer was beaten up by a mob next to a petrol pump. The mob suspected him of stealing their cattle. In the afternoon, a group of 70-80 Hindu men came on motorcycles and began pelting stones in our area. They said they were here to check if we had stolen any cattle and were ill-treating them. They randomly began checking houses in the area, which angered people. The men also made a PCR call, saying there was a truck carrying cattle found in our area. When police came, the situation was brought under control.”
“In 2012 also, when Bakrid fell between October 27 and 28, men came and threatened to attack us, blaming us for stealing their continued…

KOLKATA: Lotus is abloom in the former Maoist stronghold of Jangalmahal where Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee managed to restore normalcy after military strategist Koteswar Rao alias Kishenji was gunned down by security forces in November 2011.
The BJP is coming up as a major challenger to the ruling Trinamool Congress, which enjoyed political supremacy till January this year after Maoist militancy came to a halt in the three districts of West Midnapore, Purulia and Bankura that are together known as Jangalmahal. Since May, when Narendra Modi became prime minister, the BJP has enrolled about 110,000 members in the region and opened more than 140 party offices in places like Gopiballavpur, Garbeta, Jhargram in West Midnapore district, Sarenga, Raipur, Saltora Ranibandh and Taldangra in Bankura district and Jhalda, Arsa, Baghmundi, Ayodhaya Hills and Manbazar in Purulia district.
All these places were earlier known as "free zone" of the Maoists, who used to kill people and extort money from local rich to run their organisation. The Trinamool Congress appears to be losing control in this region because of its high-handedness and alleged attempts of some local leaders to extort money from the local people. Recently, Tarun Nayek of Taldangra in Bankura district, a long-time CPI (M) activist joined the BJP along with about hundred followers and converted the CPI (M) office into a local BJP unit.
"Many local CPI (M) activists in areas like Maoist-infested Raipur, Sarenga, Saltora have joined our party and converted their offices into BJP units," said Subhas Sarkar, a senior BJP leader of Bankura district who was the party candidate from Bankura Lok Sabha constituency this year. Many poor people whose families suffered economically after Maoists killed their earning members have also contacted him to join the party, said Sarkar.
CPI (M)'s Bankura district secretary Amiya Patra admitted that many of the party's activists had joined the BJP but said this was because "they feel that it might not be possible for us to combat Trinamool Congress which was intensifying terror tactics to strengthen their organisation".
Patra denied knowledge of the party offices being converted into BJP units, though, while alleging that the BJP was "capturing" offices of Jharkhand Disham Party in many places to open its new units in Bankura.
According to Sarkar, the BJP has opened more than 40 new party offices in the district since May. Among those who are joining the BJP are family members of seven Forward Bloc activists who were gunned down by the Maoists in Purulia's Baghbinda in December 2010.
"We are not willing to disclose the names of these Bloc activists as their families might face Trinamool attacks. But many of these victim families will join us soon," said Bikash Banerjee, the BJP's Purulia district president.
The BJP has opened 35 new offices in Purulia district since May, he added. Tushar Mukherjee, BJP's West Midnapore district president said the party was facing a unique problem.

NEW DELHI: Markets will closely track data for India's services sector, IIP number and quarterly earnings from IT major Infosys in a holiday-shortened week ahead, say experts.
Stock markets will remain closed on Monday for Bakri Id. Trend in investment by overseas investors and the movement of rupee against the dollar will also be closely tracked by the investors.

Tesco moves closer to Tata; aligns with TrentFDI
(Tesco’s core business…)
MUMBAI: British retailer Tesco has moved a step closer to the Tatas by aligning the top management of its back-end unit with Trent Hypermarket as it prepares to open nearly 300 neighbourhood convenience stores modelled on Tesco Express.
Tesco's core business in India has been restricted mainly to Tesco Hindustan Wholesaling, which supplies merchandise, including some of its own labels, to a dozen Star Bazaar outlets, sized anywhere between 40,000-80,000 square feet and from selling food and grocery to apparel to consumer durables. Most of the top management from Tesco Hindustan Wholesaling has been inducted into Trent Hypermarket as part of an internal cost-cutting exercise even as it plans to open 300 Star Daily small-format stores in the next three years, according to an official aware of the plan.
When contacted, Tesco said its local partner should comment. Trent didn't respond to an email query. "They are mostly targeting residential complexes to set up their new stores sized anywhere between 500 and 2,000 square feet," added the official. Globally, stores such as 7-Eleven in Japan, Taiwan, Thailand and Singapore, Lawson in Japan and Oxxo in Mexico are among the largest retailers in their respective markets, reflecting the growing business of small outlets in several countries despite the presence of international supermarket and hypermarket chains.
"While the intent is on the right track, execution will be a challenge considering it's not easy to find many locations or residential localities especially in cities that can fit such stores," said Ruchi Sally, director at boutique retail consultancy Elargir Solutions.
Tesco runs more than 1,500 convenience stores averaging 2,200 square feet in small shopping precincts in residential areas and countryside in the UK. "The response to this new format has been encouraging and we are considering possibilities of replicating this model in areas where larger Star Bazaars already operate. The intent is simultaneously leveraging the supply chain gains of being proximately located to a Star Bazaar hypermarket store and at the same time being readily accessible to customers within dense catchments," said Trent's annual report for 2014.
In the year ended March 2014, like-forlike sales growth of Star Bazaar stores dropped 4.8% with total revenue of Rs 820.76 crore, posting a loss of Rs 55.79 crore. In May this year, fair trade regulator Competition Commission of India cleared Tesco's purchase of a 50% stake in Trent Hypermarket, making it the first FDI transaction in multi-brand retail since the sector was opened up in 2012.
The CCI approval came as a political debate over foreign direct investment (FDI) in multi-brand retail has been revived. Since four outlets out of the 16 Star stores operated by Trent Hypermarket were in Gujarat and Tamil Nadu that do not allow FDI in multi-brand retail trade, the stores were divested into a separate wholly owned subsidiary of Trent, Fiora Hypermarkets.

Cristiano Ronaldo had another hat-trick to extend his scoring streak to eight consecutive games and lead Real Madrid to a 5—0 win over Athletic Bilbao in the Spanish league on Sunday.
Karim Benzema added two goals as Madrid’s speedy forwards picked apart a Bilbao side that proved brittle at the back and is now winless in its last seven games in all competitions.
Gareth Bale set up Ronaldo’s goals in the third and 55th minutes. Karim Benzema scored in the 41st and 69th, and Ronaldo scored again in the 88th.
Ronaldo’s treble gave the Ballon d’Or holder a league-leading 13 goals in six appearances and 17 overall this season.
Madrid’s sixth straight win across all competitions lifted it past Atletico Madrid into fourth place, four points behind leader Barcelona.

Wrong ideological choice has cost Obama dearlyObama throws liberalism under the bus
By Jonah Goldberg
Barack Obama Republican Party Philosophy Mitch McConnell Rand Paul American Enterprise Institute
Barack Obama is like every other Democrat.
President Barack Obama had a choice between liberalism and the Democratic Party. He chose the latter and it cost him dearly.
Liberalism, as an ideology, insists that government can do good and great things for the people and the world, if the people running the government are smart liberals. The Democratic Party says the exact same thing. But liberalism is an ideal, while the Democratic Party is that ideal’s representative here in the real world, and in the real world political parties disappoint.
Just to be clear — and to avoid a lot of “Oh, yeah? What about Republicans?!” responses — this is true of the GOP, too. Conservative ideology holds that government should only do those things that only government can and should do, and that list is very short. For instance, government shouldn’t be in the business of playing favorites in the economy. It shouldn’t “pick winners and losers.” Rather, it should be a fair umpire and let competition work its magic. Alas, Republican politicians routinely fall short of this ideal, preferring to be pro-business rather than pro-market. That, in so many words, is why the Export-Import Bank of the United States is immortal.
This presents just another perspective on a fundamental truth: Obama is incompetent.
Duke71
10
But this was supposed to be liberalism’s moment. This was supposed to be a new Progressive Era. Obama came into office vowing to be “transformative” just like Ronald Reagan — the difference being that Reagan ushered in an era of skepticism about government, and Obama wanted to usher in an era of hope and idealism about all the wonderful things government can do. In Obama’s mind this put him at odds with Republicans. And in a partisan sense it obviously did.
But as a matter of policy, Obama’s real challenge came from within. Government’s failures in recent years cannot be laid at the feet of the Republican Party but at the feet of the Democratic Party. If you were to ask most serious liberal policy wonks how they would make government more effective, a good number of their answers would involve doing things the Democratic base of the party would never, ever allow.
Smart liberalism has no love for bureaucratic inefficiencies. There’s nothing inherent to liberalism that says public-sector unions should have a stranglehold on the government payroll the way they do. FDR loathed the idea of government workers unionizing.
The biggest threat to job security at most federal agencies is death. Incompetence, negligence and redundancy are rarely seen as cause for termination. In 2010, the dismissal rate for 168,000 federal workers in the Washington, D.C., area was 0.26 percent. That’s point-two-six, not 26 percent or 2.6 percent. Local governments are little better. Short of murder or pedophilia, there’s almost nothing a tenured public school teacher can do that will get him or her summarily fired. Read all the Keynes, Niebuhr, Schlesinger, Lippmann, Galbraith you can. You’ll find nothing in there that even hints this is the way things ought to be.
If Obama wanted to restore faith in government, he would have pushed for mercilessly firing bad government workers and ending stupid government programs. And while he paid a little lip service to such things, his priorities were all in the other direction. That is because he had to dance with the girl that brung him. The Democratic Party isn’t simply the party of government, it is the party for government.
That’s why his stimulus package was top-heavy with bailouts for federal programs, state governments and public-sector workers. When he finally learned that there are no such things as “shovel-ready jobs,” it should have prompted him to ask, “Why not?” The answer would have led him to reforms that undoubtedly would have helped the American people — and the cause of liberalism! — but hurt his own base in the Democratic Party.
On Obama’s watch, we’ve seen horrifying incompetence, malfeasance or skullduggery at the Department of Veterans Affairs, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the IRS, DOJ, GAO and HHS. Republicans didn’t create the fiasco of the Affordable Care Act rollout; the architects of Obamacare did that all by themselves.
Just this week, the wheels have come off the bus at the Secret Service. You can denounce the anti-government rhetoric of Rand Paul, Ted Cruz and the Koch brothers all you like, but they didn’t cause any of these spectacular failures. If the CDC screws up its efforts to contain Ebola, it will be a far more powerful, lasting and damaging indictment of government competence than any floor speech by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY).
Obama set out to restore faith in government and liberalism. He ended up throwing them both under the bus for the sake of his party.

J&K: Five killed as Pakistan shells Arnia sectors main bazaarA villager shows mortar shells allegedly fired from the Pakistan side in Chanana village at the India-Pakistan International border at Arnia sector in Jammu and Kashmir on Saturday. (Source: PTI)
Written by Arun Sharma | Jammu | Posted: October 6, 2014 8:53 am | Updated: October 6, 2014 11:50 am
Five people were killed and nearly 50 others injured in Pakistani shelling in Arnia sector along the International Border near Jammu during early hours of Monday.
Sources said that four people died at the main bazaar in Arnia town itself when over a dozen mortar shells from across the border exploded around 3 am. It has been for the first time since 2003 that Pakistani shells have fallen in Arnia bazaar.
After a night long, unprovoked mortar shelling on civilian areas along the international border in Arnia sector, the Pakistani troops started targeting forward Indian positions along the Line of Control in Bhimber Gali (BG) area of Rajouri district on Monday.
Giving details, sources said that Pakistani troops started firing automatic weapons and mortars on the Indian side around 8.30 am. The Indian troops were retaliating and the exchange of fire between two sides was continuing till  reports last came in.

The Pakistani Rangers had been resorting to unprovoked mortar shelling and small arms fire along the international border since October 3. After a lull in of nearly a month, the Pakistani Rangers stepped up shelling during early hours of Monday around 12.30 am causing panic among the villagers. Apart from Arnia town, the villages most hit by shelling included Trewa, Suhagpur and Devigarh.
Border Security Force officials here said that Pakistani Rangers targeted ten BSF border outposts, besides civilian population with heavy mortar shelling and small arms fire in Arnia sector late last night. Pointing out that five civilians were killed and nearly 50 others injured in Pakistani shelling, they said that BSF also gave a befitting and calibrated reply to the Rangers. The loss in Pakistan territory is yet to be ascertained, they said, adding that the firing was continuing till reports last came in.
Giving details, sources said that the Pakistani guns had fallen silent after nearly half an hour long firing on the Indian side on Saturday night. Suddenly, they resumed mortar shelling at around 12.30 am forcing people in villages near the border to flee from their houses.

The shelling was so intense that people even in Arnia town came out of their houses and gathered in the main bazaar out of panic. Around 3 am, shells exploded in the bazaar killing five and injuring many others. The victims were rushed to the hospital, but one of them succumbed to injuries on the way.
Ever since US President Barack Obama and Prime Minister Narendra Modi committed to jointly fight terrorism, Pakistani troops and Rangers have continued…

Neha Dhupia slams Yesudas remarks against girls wearing jeansPress Trust of India | Indore | Posted: October 6, 2014 8:33 am
Bollywood actress Neha Dhupia condemned the remarks of veteran singer K J Yesudas against girls wearing jeans, saying such a “flawed” thinking regarding women’s apparel needs to be rectified.
“This is very unfortunate that women are being asked what to wear and what not, even as our country is moving forward. I feel that the flaw does not lie in the ensemble of women but in the minds of those who make such remarks. I think this thinking towards what half of our total population is wearing needs to be corrected,” Neha told reporters in response to a query regarding the singer’s remarks.
Neha was here for promotion of her upcoming film, ’21 Topon ki Salami’ directed by Ravindra Gautam. The film, also starring Anupam Kher, Divyendu Sharma and other star cast, is slated for release on October 10.
“It is challenging to bring yourself to the notice of the audience as an actress in a multi-cast film. I feel bored when am asked to act in a film wherein hero and heroine are the only lead characters,” she said.
Responding to a query, Neha said she would like to work in any biopic which is based on a true story.
Yesudas had on October 2 resented women wearing jeans, saying this went against the Indian culture.
“Women should not cause trouble to others by wearing jeans….What should be covered should be covered,” Yesudas had said.

Bangalore/Mumbai September 28:  
As the Indian holiday season approaches, Flipkart with other Indian e-tailers are gearing up to battle against Amazon.
As Diwali approaches, the corporate office of India's largest online retailer Flipkart at Koramangala is buzzing with activity, with marketing teams putting together a strategy that will continue to increase sales this festival season.

Why Microsoft named new OS as Windows 10Why Microsoft named new operating system as Windows 10?
ANI     Washington   Last Updated: October 3, 2014  | 10:14 IST
Photo: Reuters
After Microsoft unveiled and showed off a brief demo of their brand new operating system, Windows 10 , in San Francisco on Tuesday, speculations were rife on why the company chose to skip a number and name Windows 8's successor as Windows 10.
According to CNET, the decision was just a marketing gimmick. The Windows 8 has been mired in controversy for the last two years because of Microsoft's bold yet unfamiliar design language and functionality decisions. Therefore, Microsoft took a number leap to scrap all associations with its predecessor.
Another theory suggests that Microsoft may make future Windows release incremental and therefore, free after Windows 10. This would be the same strategy that Apple employed when it switched from numerals to feral cats after it released Mac OS X. This speculation has also been bolstered by reports that quoted Andreas Diantoro, the president of Microsoft Indonesia, as saying that the company is planning on making its next version of Windows free to its current Windows 8 users .
Speculators have also said that the decision was an attempt to prevent users from confusing Windows 9 with Windows 95 and 98. That could have created compatibility issues and caused the programs to stop working, or it could have led to version-check errors or other unknown problems.

Food Story: From Mumbai to Calicut  the evolution of the coastal cuisinePrint
What gives the coastal cuisine, its culinary edge? Trade, invasion and asylum seeking communities. (Picture courtesy: Wanderbug)
Written by Madhulika Dash | New Delhi | Posted: October 2, 2014 4:26 pm | Updated: October 3, 2014 10:00 am
Mention coastal cuisine, and it’s assumed that it would be seafood and coconut that would be talked about. The impression isn’t out of sync. Hard to believe but in first glance, the cuisine of coastal  India – East and West – appears to be meat and seafood heavy, thanks to the natural abundance. But then  for every prawn gassi that the coast boasts of, there is a vegetable ishtew, and for every jeermari chi kombdi there is a Calicut Brinjal Curry and a Phanasa Chi Bhaji, thus making the cuisine one of the more complex yet fascinating cuisine of India.
One of the breakfast staple in Goa, the poi comes from the Jews of Malabar.
In fact, it is said that if you ever look for king size breakfast, head coast. The southern coast of India itself makes some 30 odd varieties of  breakfast, which is all vegetarian, not your idli dosai affair, and none of the items have the same base ingredient repeated twice or the similar method used. In fact, the West Coast boasts of having some of the best relishes in the world.
What gives the coastal cuisine, its culinary edge? Trade, invasion and asylum seeking communities. Result, west coast – by which we head from Maharastra to Goa and Calicut – has seen not one but three different, big influences that have shaped the cuisine the way it is today.
Both in terms of ingredients, spices and cooking techniques. the one place that has led this culinary overhaul from the front is Calicut.  It was through this  “big bazaar of spices” (as termed by the Russian traveler Athanasius Nikitn in 1468) that many communities came and went – few for trade most for the wealth. But each in its zeal to explore took the cuisine to a higher standard.
The one dish that taste the same in Kochin as in Goa.
Ma Huan, the Chinese Muslim sailor part of the Imperial Chinese fleet under Cheng Ho landed in Calicut in 1403, was stunned to find the existence of pilafs. In fact, he describe Calicut (modern day Kozhikode) as the “noble emporium for all India” abounding in pepper, lac, ginger, a larger kind of cinnamon, myrobalans and zedary.

Short  intense workouts boost memoryIndo-Asian News Service | Posted: October 3, 2014 11:34 am
An intense workout for as little as 20 minutes can enhance episodic or long term memory about previous events by about 10 percent in healthy young adults, say researchers.
Many existing studies have shown that long aerobic exercises like running can boost memory but the present study had participants lift weights just once every two days before testing them.
“Even without doing expensive MRI scans, our results give us an idea of what areas of the brain might be supporting these exercise-induced memory benefits,” said Audrey Duarte, an associate professor from the Georgia Institute of Technology’ school of psychology in the US.
For the study, the team showed 90 photos to the participants on a computer screen before they started stretching their legs.
The participants returned to the lab 48 hours later and saw a series of 180 pictures – the 90 originals were mixed in with 90 new photos.
Those who exercised remembered about 60 percent of the photos.
“Our study indicates that people do not have to dedicate large amounts of time to give their brain a boost,” said Lisa Weinberg, a Georgia Tech graduate student who led the project.
Although the study used weight exercises, resistance activities such as squats or knee bends would likely produce the same results, noted Weinberg.
“The findings are encouraging because they are consistent with rodent literature that pinpoints exactly the parts of the brain that play a role in memory benefits caused by exercise,” concluded Lisa Weinberg.
The study appeared in the journal Acta Psychologica.

NEW DELHI/MUMBAI (Reuters) - Subrata Roy, the jailed head of Sahara conglomerate, is back in a cell after living in a makeshift prison office for two months while working on the sale of three luxury hotels in New York and London, a deal that is still hanging.
The Supreme Court had allowed the tycoon to use an office, phone, Internet connection and three secretaries in the Delhi prison to facilitate the sale of three hotels including Grosvenor House in London and the Plaza in New York.
Roy needs to raise 100 billion rupees ($1.6 billion) from the hotel sales to have a chance of obtaining release on bail.
He has been moved back to a cell after a court-imposed deadline for the use of the office expired, although the businessman had requested more time, Tihar Jail spokesman Mukesh Prasad said.
"He was asking officials. We told him we don't have the power to extend those facilities," the spokesman said.
Roy was jailed for contempt of court in March amid a long-running dispute with India's capital markets watchdog over Sahara's failure to repay billions of dollars to investors who were sold outlawed bonds.
A source close to the company said Roy did not have enough time to complete the sale.
"Any negotiation of big-ticket items takes time, out of which maximum time gets spent on conducting due diligence and working out the current valuations," the source said.
"Roy and his team are working hard and trying their best even in wake of the current restrictions that Roy is in now," he said.
A Sahara spokesman declined to comment.
Sahara has said it is in talks with multiple potential buyers but has refrained from naming any suitors.
In August, the Wall Street Journal's online edition reported that the Sultan of Brunei had made a $2 billion bid for the hotels, but a spokesperson for the Sultan later dismissed the report as inaccurate.
Last month, a senior company executive told Reuters that the firm would rather mortgage its trophy overseas hotel properties than sell them.
Unlisted Sahara, best known as the long-time former main sponsor of India's national cricket team, paid 470 million pounds ($759 million) in 2010 for Grosvenor House and about $570 million for the Plaza in 2012. It also owns the Dream Hotel in New York.

The Labor Department reported that US nonfarm payrolls rose by 248,000 last month and the jobless rate fell two-tenths of a point to 5.9 percent.
"There were a number of fears in the market, and the market had been giving up a lot of its gains.

A Reuters survey on Friday showed most of Wall Street's top bond firms still see the Federal Reserve starting to raise interest rates no later than June of next year.

The Russell 2000 index rose 0.8 percent, but was down 1.3 percent for the week, its fifth straight week of losses.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 208.64 points, or 1.24 percent, to 17,009.69, the S&P 500 gained 21.73 points, or 1.12 percent, to 1,967.9 and the Nasdaq Composite added 45.43 points, or 1.03 percent, to 4,475.62.
For the week, the Dow was down 0.6 percent, the S&P 500 was down 0.8 percent and the Nasdaq was down 0.8 percent.
The largest percentage gainer on the New York Stock Exchange was Zendesk INC, which rose 16.93 percent to USD 25.55, while the largest percentage decliner was Cliffs Natural Resources, down 16.80 percent at USD 8.32.
Among the most active stocks on the NYSE were Rite Aid, up 0.80 percent at USD 5.03 and Brazil's Petrobras, up 4.33 percent to USD 13.97.
On the Nasdaq, Apple, down 0.3 percent to USD 99.62, and Yahoo, up 1.3 percent at USD 41.03, were among the most actively traded.

The message behind the broom
urban health
Prime Minister Narendra Modi wanted to link his campaign to the toilet-cleaning ritual in Gandhi’s ashrams, to emphasise that the seemingly menial work was of great import in nation-building.
In launching the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan , or Clean India Mission, on Gandhi Jayanthi day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi sought to highlight the importance his administration attached to both sanitation and Mahatma Gandhi. Mr. Modi was evidently carrying forward the message in his Independence Day address on the need for more toilets in schools, and for India’s villages and towns to be free of dirt. But the high-profile launch of the mission on October 2 had its own meaning. Mr. Modi wanted to link his campaign to the toilet-cleaning ritual in Gandhi’s ashrams, to emphasise that the seemingly demeaning, menial work was of great import in nation-building. The noise surrounding the launch of the mission was intended to draw in all Indians to the cleanliness drive: everyone was expected to devote two hours a week to cleaning their surroundings. Surely, the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan has been successful as an event in increasing public awareness of the importance of sanitation. The imagery of the Prime Minister taking time off to wield the broom in central Delhi might be of some effect in some areas for some time. But if Mr. Modi was hoping for mass participation in a cleanliness drive that would keep India perpetually clean, public policy must go far beyond symbolism.
If India’s villages and towns are to be dirt-free, what is required is not the involvement of each and every citizen for two hours every week in the clean-up. While that would lend a Gandhian touch of personal involvement, it would surely be a colossal waste of productive hours of skilled personnel. It is one thing to involve political leaders, industrialists and celebrities in sweeping the streets to raise general awareness on sanitation, and quite another to expect every working adult to put in two hours a week in cleaning. True, without the cooperation of citizens, it would be impossible for any government or civic body to ensure clean streets and public places. But this is not the same as requiring everyone in the workforce to engage in actual cleaning. Efforts must be made to de-stigmatise the act of cleaning, and the participation of citizens in large numbers in a mass cleaning exercise, even if as a one-off or annual event, will have a positive effect. The government may not be able to do everything, but voluntarism cannot be a substitute for strengthening civic infrastructure. For ensuring cleanliness and hygiene and improving solid waste management, India’s civic bodies will need to be at the centre of the Clean India Campaign. The Swachh Bharat Abhiyan will have to be a sustainable programme, and its success ought not to depend on the hours each citizen puts in to sweep streets. A lot can be done to further the ideal of cleanliness without wielding the broom.

Pro-democracy protesters have taken to Hong Kong’s streets all week to demand the right to nominate who can run as their next leader in 2017 elections. Beijing insists only candidates it has approved will be able to stand. Student leaders said early today that they would meet the government if certain conditions were met, having scrapped planned negotiations the previous day over anger at police actions in earlier clashes.

In Mong Kok, a working-class district of shops and residences that was also the site of ugly scenes Friday, furious protesters claimed anti-democracy agitators from the city’s triad mobs were being arrested — only to be released back into the crowds again. “The police have been cooperating with gangsters,” said David Chan, a 22-year-old student.
“We have witnessed the police letting go of the gangsters. That’s why the peaceful protesters are so angry, We have no trust in them any more.” Hong Kong’s main student union, HKFS, said in a statement: “The government should investigate why the police were so lax in enforcement, accusations of helping criminals and to give an explanation to the public as soon as possible.”

Windies fuming over Narine episodeTweet
0
Azim Bassarath, a director of the West Indies Cricket Board [WICB] and president of the Trinidad & Tobago Cricket Board [TTCB], has expressed his outrage over the controversy surrounding offspinner Sunil Narine 's action in the Champions League Twenty20 and his subsequent withdrawal from the India tour.
Sunil Narine has the full backing of his Board. Narine was barred from bowling in the Champions League final after being reported for a suspect action twice in successive games. The WICB then decided to withdraw the spinner from the entire tour of India.
"I am very disappointed with the turn of events and the news concerning Sunil's action is quite a shock," Bassarath said. "Sunil has been bowling successfully in international cricket for quite a while and has never been reported to the ICC."
Referring to Clive Lloyd's disclosure, that the West Indies board and team management had been told Narine would be under the scanner in India, Bassarath stated that the bowler's absence would be a major loss to the team but the decision to withdraw him was correct.
"What is even more disturbing is that Clive Lloyd heard Sunil would get called for his action and this cannot be taken lightly," he said. "This news does not sit well since it suggests that Sunil was being targeted and I think the decision to bring him home was a good one.
"Sunil is a big asset to the West Indies team, especially in India where he has developed a reputation as one of the best bowlers in the world. He knows the conditions in India quite well and [his withdrawal] is a major loss to the West Indies team. After being thrashed by England recently I know India will be looking to rebound and not having Sunil there is a massive blow."
QUALITY OF UMPIRING
Bassarath also questioned the quality of umpiring at the Champions League and suggested the ICC should have a look at that.
"I think the ICC needs to have a serious look at this matter," Bassarath said. "The umpires involved so far are not on the Elite Umpires Panel and this should be addressed. There needs to be a better standard of umpiring at this tournament."
Rod Tucker, one of the umpires who reported Narine, is an Elite Panel umpire, along with Kumar Dharmasena who was the third umpire when the bowler was reported after the game against Dolphins.
Bassarath revealed that Narine had undergone testing in Australia in 2011 to ensure his action was legal before the third edition of the Champions League, in which he played for Trinidad & Tobago. Given Narine's extensive international and club appearances in the past few years, Bassarath felt the bowler did not need to be under the microscope. The TTCB president also said his board would support Narine and take steps to help him return to international cricket.
"Sunil passed the necessary testing in Australia and has gone on to forge a successful international career so I must reiterate how shocked we are by these events," he said. "Right now the TTCB is waiting on the WICB to determine a course of action.
"I am concerned that this incident will affect Sunil's confidence and hurt his cricket career. The TTCB is 100% behind Sunil and we willl ensure that he will be representing the West Indies soon. I spoke to his parents and they are concerned about what took place in India but we will wait until Sunil returns to Trinidad and put measures in place to ensure that he overcomes this incident."

 Raising his arm, Yousef Ali hugs his elderly father in front of one of Islam's holiest sites as they grin for a selfie -- a craze that has hit this year's hajj.
But not everyone is happy about young pilgrims from around the world constantly snapping "selfies", photographs taken of one's self, as they carry out the rites of hajj which are the high point of a Muslim's spiritual life.

From Tawaf -- circling the holy Kaaba structure in Mecca -- to prayers atop Mount Mercy in Arafat, and stoning of the "devil" in Mina, the key stages of hajj have all been recorded on cameras and smartphones for posterity, and for instant sharing through social media.
Hajj is the one of the world's largest religious gatherings. It has attracted over two million believers this year.
"As this is my first pilgrimage, it is important for me to document all the events taking place around me," Ali, 24, told AFP, snapping a picture of himself with a green sign reading "Big Jamarah", which refers to a wall where Muslims ritually stone Satan.

"Wherever I go, I take pictures, especially since nowadays we have these little cameras... that offer a full view of the area," the bearded Kuwaiti, casually dressed in sweatpants and a pair of trendy sandals, said with a smile.
The increasingly popular phenomenon has sparked controversy among more conservative Muslims, however, with some taking to Twitter to criticise pilgrims who take selfies.
"When we went for umra in the mid-90s, Dad nearly had his camera confiscated to shouts of 'haram!' Now, #HajjSelfie is A Thing. What a world," wrote one Tweeter.
Another user named Kahwaaa wrote: "It's a time to connect to allah and purify my soul. #hajjselfies selfies shouldn't be taken."
But others said the issue was being blown out of proportion.
"People creating a huge issue about #hajjselfies. If photos are allowed during Hajj then what is wrong with selfies?," asked Abdul Mufeez Shaheed.
Nothing at all, says Ali's father Mohammed Ali, 65.
"A person taking such pictures is documenting a rare event", a once-in-a-lifetime experience for many Muslims, he said, wearing a traditional white robe.
"This is a symbolic place representing history," Mohammed Ali added, pointing to the three sites which pilgrims began stoning on Saturday at the start of the Eid al-Adha feast of sacrifice, which is celebrated by Muslims worldwide.
#HajjSelfie
Two women covered in traditional black abayas and veils hurried towards the Big Jamarah wall, but not without stopping for a quick self portrait along the way.
"My daughter and I are taking selfies to show our hajj pictures to our family in Paris. It's also a nice memento," said one of the women, a Saudi pilgrim from Jeddah who gave her name only as Umm Abdallah, 44.
Her daughter Wafaa Ahmed, 19, said: "I love taking many selfies wherever I go to keep them for myself, as well as to show them to my friends and brothers."
Speaking to AFP by telephone, a professor of Islamic Sharia law in the Saudi capital Riyadh said that "if photographs are only for personal memory and not for disseminating, then no problem.
"But if they were for the purpose of showing off, then they are prohibited, such as the photography that takes place at the (hajj) rites."
The scholar requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of stating a religious opinion in the ultra-conservative kingdom.
"It is better for Muslims to avoid them," he said of selfies.
For the teenage pilgrim Wafaa Ahmed, "this is not a convincing view" because taking selfies "has nothing to do with religion".
The elderly pilgrim Mohammed Ali also discounts the scholar's opinion.
He says the camera "is a tool such as mobiles, used even by religious scholars who have not prohibited them, so why prohibit another tool of the modern era?"
As he speaks, a group of young Saudi men gather for a group selfie in front of a Jamarah wall before they stone the "devil".

New Delhi: A 3-year-old child who went missing from India Gate a week ago has been found in Janakpuri area of New Delhi on Sunday. Jahanvi was left in the market area by an unknown person with her family's number written on her neck.
Her parents identified her at Mayapuri police station.
Jahanvi had gone missing from New Delhi's VVIP area of India Gate since September 28. Despite the availability of CCTV footages and a phone number given by the girl's parent to trace, Delhi Police had remained clueless about the child.
#india gate #delhi #delhi police #janakpuri
Delhi Police commissioner BS Bassi had announced a cash reward of Rs 50,000 for anyone who helped in tracing the child.
Posters with the girl's photo, requesting help from people to trace her have gone viral on social media. On Facebook, a campaign by the name of 'Bring Back Jahnvi' has been launched to ensure that more and more people are made aware of it.
A protest was also held by family and relatives of the girl in this connection at India Gate which was later shifted to Jantar Mantar by the police.

By Tsvetelia Tsolova and Matthias Williams
SOFIA (Reuters) - The centre right GERB party looked set to win Bulgaria's "last chance" snap general election on Sunday but will fall short of a majority, a result that could mean another shaky coalition struggling to solve a bank crisis and revive growth.
GERB's leader, a former bodyguard and karate expert, warned it would be difficult to form a government in light of the exit poll results, but added his party would hold internal discussions on Monday on how to proceed.
The exit polls indicated GERB had won about 33 percent of the vote, twice as many as their main Socialist opponents. That will likely set the stage for days or weeks of haggling with smaller parties and the opposition to shore up support.
The new government will be the Balkan country's fifth in under two years, a period that has seen mass street protests topple a previous GERB administration and nearly fell its successor. More instability would be a turn-off for investors as well as voters, who have seen their country lurch from one crisis to the next. Foreign direct investment has fallen by more than a fifth this year.
Underscoring the high level of disillusionment with the political class, the exit polls suggested voter turnout was the lowest in the 25 years since Bulgaria emerged from communism.
They also pointed to a highly fractured result, with a record eight parties possibly entering parliament, as disappointment with the main parties strengthened the attractions of fringe players.
"Under this configuration, I do not see how a government can be formed," a sombre-sounding Borisov told reporters. Signalling he would likely try to form a coalition, Borisov also said he was prepared to take "all risks" to govern the country.
In a possible sign of trouble ahead, a senior official of the Reformist Bloc -- seen as GERB's most likely ally -- said he couldn't envisage Borisov as the next prime minister.
Socialist Party spokesman Atanas Merdzhanov called the result a "heavy defeat".
"With such a fragmented parliament, it's difficult to form a government and it also raises the question of how stable it will be," said Dimitar Bechev, a political analyst based at the London School of Economics (LSE).
PROBLEM BANK
A top priority for the new government will be to decide what to do with Corporate Commercial Bank (Corpbank), Bulgaria's fourth-biggest lender, which was closed after a run on deposits in June and whose fate has been in limbo ever since.
The bank's customers have been shut out of their accounts for more than three months and the main shareholder is charged with embezzlement. But efforts to sort out the mess were derailed by political squabbles and it is still not clear whether the authorities will rescue the bank, or how its depositors and bondholders might be treated.
The Corpbank crisis has fed the sense of frustration with Bulgaria's political class. Seven years after the nation of 7.3 million joined the EU with high hopes of prosperity, corruption remains endemic, while one in five Bulgarians lives below the poverty line. The average salary is just over 400 euros ($500) a month.
While casting his vote, Borisov had said Sunday's poll was a "last chance" to save Bulgaria and warned, if no government was formed and another election was called, "then there will be nothing left to fix in the country."
Bulgaria has been in the hands of a caretaker government since August, following the collapse of a Socialist-led administration whose year in power was overshadowed by mass protests, deadly floods and a row over Russian energy supplies.
"I decided to support some of the new faces. Why vote for those who have robbed us in the past years?" said shop assistant Lyubomira Besheva, in her 30s, at a polling station.
Officially no exit polls were allowed to be published until 1600 GMT, but that did not stop some media publishing voting patterns thinly disguised as weather reports or song contests.
NEED FOR REFORM
"We are all aware of the pile-up of serious problems that require urgent and heavy reforms," outgoing prime minister Georgi Bliznashki said while casting his vote.
Tucked into the EU's southeastern edge on the Black Sea, Bulgaria left communism behind a quarter of a century ago, but its loyalties are still divided between its old ally Moscow and Brussels.
Heavily dependent on Russian energy, Bulgaria is among the countries most vulnerable to a gas supply cut if the standoff between the West and Russia over Ukraine continues into winter.
Bulgaria's new government will have to walk a diplomatic tightrope over the proposed construction of the giant, Russian-led South Stream gas pipeline, which will bypass Ukraine. Under pressure from the EU and the United States, Sofia reluctantly halted work on the project in June.
The next administration will also have to persuade parliament to let the government raise new debt to fund a higher fiscal deficit and provide liquidity buffers for the banking system, and plug a large financial hole in the energy sector. To make matters worse, the EU has frozen hundreds of millions of dollars worth of development funds since last year, citing irregularities in the public procurement process.
"We all know that nothing will change, but the elections are another reason for us to analyse things as we know best -- with a salad and a brandy," said Kalin Vasilev in a Sofia pub.
"We know they (the politicians) will lie to us again," he said. "If you took things too seriously in Bulgaria, you'd have to shoot yourself."

By Martyn Herman
LONDON (Reuters) - The long-running feud between Arsene Wenger and Jose Mourinho shows no sign of healing after another high-profile falling out on Sunday, this time the result of a dispute over territory.
Midway through the first half of Chelsea's ultimately comfortable 2-0 victory over Arsenal which stretched their Premier league lead to five points, it became clear that Stamford Bridge was not big enough for two of the game's strongest personalities.
Especially when a seething Wenger encroached into Mourinho's technical area raging about a robust tackle by Gary Cahill on his Chile forward Alexis Sanchez.
What happened next was both comical and unedifying in equal measure with Mourinho facing off Wenger and then getting a hearty two-handed shove in the chest for his troubles.
With the crowd in uproar, all that was missing was a theatrical tumble to the ground by Mourinho, who continues to have the Indian sign over the Frenchman he has at various times  labelled a "voyeur" and "a specialist in failure".
While Cahill's tackle on Sanchez was barely legal, Wenger's reaction could land him a touchline ban, especially considering that if it had happened on the pitch it would likely have resulted in a red card for a player.
Calmer after the heat of battle, Wenger played down the incident with a dash of humour.
"I wanted to go for A to B and some one confronted me without any sign of welcome," Wenger, told reporters, the faintest of smiles on his lips. "It was a little push.
"B was Sanchez to see how badly he was injured."
Asked what Mourinho, who he is yet to get one over in 12 previous clashes, had said to him, Wenger added: "I don't  listen to what he says."
Mourinho saw things slightly differently, despite saying the incident was "no problem" and that there were "no outstanding issues" between the pair.
"It became heated because of the game, a big game, big rivals, an important match for both teams. These conditions make a game of emotions... but there are two technical areas, one for me and one for him and he was coming to my technical area and not coming for the right reasons, and I didn't like that."
For all the pantomime antics of the two managers, the game itself was disappointing as a spectacle.
Arsenal looked the more fluid side on occasions without really menacing the Chelsea goal and it was telling that Wenger pointed at a possible handball by former skipper Cesc Fabregas from Jack Wilshere's shot as his side's best chance.
Ruthless Chelsea were simply too solid and in Eden Hazard they had the best player on the pitch by a long way.
The home side had barely threatened the Arsenal goal in the opening 27 minutes but the Belgian whizzkid came to life.
His bamboozling run through Arsenal's defence invited Laurent Koscielny to hack him down in the area and he obliged, conceding the penalty which Hazard tucked away with aplomb.
Hazard teased Arsenal after the break before Diego Costa sealed victory from a superb Fabregas through ball.
"In these matches you need one of your top players to take some magic cards out of his pocket and (Hazard) did it when the game was 0-0 and tight," Mourinho said.
"He did an action that could have ended the game if it was a penalty and a red card and not a penalty and a yellow. That would have been game over.
"In the second half he kept the ball very well when we needed it, it was a complete performance by him today."
It was also a complete performance by Mourinho who got the better of Wenger tactically once again, then claimed the moral high ground to boot.
"To be fair I do so many wrong things in football and sometimes you are emotional but not this time," he said. "I was in my technical area and it wasn't my problem."

A finance ministry panel mandated to clear all big-ticket investments recently okayed the National Supercomputing Mission, jointly steered by the department of science and technology and the department of electronics and information technology.
“The seven-year-long project would be placed before cabinet soon,” a top government source told HT.
The mission intends to set up 73 supercomputing facilities on a buy-and-build approach at academic and research institutions across the country and network them into a grid. Three of them — the first ones to be set up over the first three years — would be India’s first supercomputers capable of peta-scale computing and would join a global league of just 37 such machines.
Peta-scale computing refers to the ability to add at least a quadrillion (1,000 trillion) real numbers in a second. “This speed is equivalent to 5,000-6,000 high-end laptops working in tandem,” said Professor Rajat Moona, director general of the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing that gave India her first supercomputer.
“This would boost high-performance computing for India several fold,” added K VijayRaghavan, secretary, science and technology department.
The seven-year plan has been divided into two phases — the first three years for construction of the machines and the next four for the applications that will use this grid. The supercomputers will occupy a space of over 20,000 square feet, or the size of 10 three-bedroom apartments.
At present, India has two supercomputing machines in the world’s top 100, and nine in the top 500.
Its fastest supercomputer at the Pune-based Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology is ranked 52.
A little less than half of all supercomputers in the top 500 — 233 — are in the US. But the world’s fastest, Tianhe-2 (MilkyWay-2), belongs to China’s National University of Defense Technology. A late entrant, China has 75 other supercomputers on the list — nearly as many as Japan (30), France (27) and Germany (23) put together.
“The new grid could be the first step in our desire to have a supercomputer machine in the top 20 list,” said Moona, pointing out that this could make a world of difference to the quality of research in the country.
“This can be transformative for our high-end training efforts and for developing home-grown applications for our needs in basic science and in applications in medicine, agriculture and technology,” said VijayRaghavan.
“Engineering problems such as weather and climate modelling, computational fluid dynamics, computational structural mechanisms are other areas of applications. Space research can also get a boost,” added Moona.

AAP MLA hits out at Kejriwal in scathing FBpostPrint

The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) was hit by another show of dissent on Sunday after the party’s Rohini MLA Rajesh Garg reportedly wrote a scathing letter to party national convenor Arvind Kejriwal on a social networking site, asking him to stop promoting “rich and corrupt” people in the party and reconsider his stance on fresh elections.
This comes after a series of high-profile names such as Shazia Ilmi and Yogendra Yadav have either left or shown disagreement with the party. Garg, however, is the first MLA after Vinod Kumar Binny to have spoken against the party. Binny, who was refused a ministerial position in the AAP cabinet post their Assembly election win in December 2013, was subsequently expelled from the AAP.
Garg’s letter to Kejriwal, which was uploaded on his Facebook page, said, “You should accept the truth and stop promoting the rich and corrupt within the party. You should try and understand the pain and the suffering of the ordinary worker of the party, who has actually forsaken everything to rid this country of corruption… When you keep asking for the Assembly to be dissolved, have you ever thought of what happens to the people, party workers and elected representatives of different parties?”
Garg hit out at Kejriwal for failing to consult people if Delhi needed fresh elections or not and said a “better message” would have gone out if he had done so. “If we had shown courage on February 14, 2014 (the date of the party resigning from government) then we would have been serving the people of Delhi as currently nothing is possible because there is no government. Whoever forms the government does not matter. We had come to serve the people and not to form government,” he said.
He said the AAP must look towards resolving “the debt of 1,000 crore instead of being obstinate about fresh elections”. “Can we not do good work while sitting in the Opposition? We must also look at one more thing, that if elections happen again and no party gets a clear majority then what will we say to the people,” Garg’s letter reads.
When Newsline attempted to contact Garg seeking to confirm the authenticity of the letter, he replied via text message and said, “What is written on FB is true… meeting with party people.”
The party remained tightlipped on the matter and said, “We will ascertain the full facts of the matter and then respond. However, we want to make it clear that Rajesh Garg is very much an intrinsic part of the AAP, and there is no chance of him defecting or quitting the continued…

Bawana tense a day beforeBakridThe scrapyard near the petrol pump. ( Source: Express photo by Amit Mehra )
Written by Shalini Narayan | New Delhi | Posted: October 6, 2014 1:56 am
A day before Bakrid, tension prevailed in the industrial area of Bawana’s JJ Colony in Outer Delhi. While a section of the Jat community claimed their cattle were being stolen and sacrificed for the festival, a section of the Muslim community has alleged a mob pelted stones at them and threatened them.
On Sunday, the Jats called a meeting in Harevli village to form a committee to protect cattle. At the meeting, hundreds of people from 10-12 neighbouring villages assembled and pledged to abstain from eating non-vegetarian food, pray to God everyday and chant ‘Om’ for two minutes, protect cattle and admit them to gaushalas or treat them at hospitals if they were found injured.
Security was stepped up in the area. Commenting on the situation, DCP (Outer) Vikramjit Singh said, “There is adequate security in the area. There is no cause for worry.”
Tension has been simmering since October 2 when a 20-year-old scrapdealer was arrested for allegedly committing an unnatural act with a cow adjacent to a service station at Pooth Khurd in Bawana. Speaking to Newsline, the manager of Jai Mata Di service station Ved Prakash said, “There is a scrapyard adjacent to the service station, where the man came four days ago and stayed there. Around 11 am on October 2, one of our customers went till the scrapyard to relieve himself when he noticed something amiss. He informed us. By the time we went looking for the man, he had fled. Within a few hours, we caught him. He confessed he had committed an unnatural act with the animal. He was beaten up by local people and arrested by police.”
A senior police officer said a case under Section 377 IPC and sections of committing cruelty to animals has been registered.
Following Thursday’s incident, sections of the Hindu community gathered outside the service station and protested, demanding that their cattle be protected. The group caused a traffic jam for several hours at two intersections on the Bawana main road.
Sections of the Muslim community claimed otherwise. Kalimullah, the pradhan of JJ Colony, said, “On October 2, a scrapdealer was beaten up by a mob next to a petrol pump. The mob suspected him of stealing their cattle. In the afternoon, a group of 70-80 Hindu men came on motorcycles and began pelting stones in our area. They said they were here to check if we had stolen any cattle and were ill-treating them. They randomly began checking houses in the area, which angered people. The men also made a PCR call, saying there was a truck carrying cattle found in our area. When police came, the situation was brought under control.”
“In 2012 also, when Bakrid fell between October 27 and 28, men came and threatened to attack us, blaming us for stealing their continued…

NJAC Bill has not removed flaws of collegium system, says Justice Shah

TOPICS
judiciary (system of justice)
As the NDA government moves to gain a foothold in judicial appointments through the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) Bill, Law Commission Chairman Justice A.P. Shah on Sunday criticised the proposed law in its present form as “disquieting.” According to Justice Shah it may perpetuate a “culture of trade-offs and sycophancy present in the collegium system of appointment.”
Justice Shah, who was consulted by the government during the framing of the NJAC Bill, described it as a “missed opportunity” for the government to provide guidance on Constitutional values integral to judicial appointments.
He was giving the Annual Capital Foundation Lecture on ‘Judging the Judges: Appointments to the Supreme Court and High Courts.’
According to him the NJAC Bill has not removed the flaws of the collegium system. “Constitutional Courts of this country cannot be run like closed country clubs.” Pointing to controversies like that of Justice P.D. Dinakaran, he said this opaque mode of functioning by the collegium has been one of its major failings.
Since 1993, the Supreme Court has been “packed” with Chief Justices of High Courts elevated by the collegium merely due to their seniority, and without looking at merit and other objective qualifications. This, he said, has led to a “decline in the standard of judges.”
Noting that the Bill erodes judicial independence, he pointed to how non-judicial members in the NJAC can veto a candidate irrespective of the views of three judicial members, including the Chief Justice of India.
“What is more dangerous is that it is likely that the veto power would perpetuate the culture of trade-offs and sycophancy which is present in the collegium system of appointment and makes it even more pernicious – since the trade-offs will not remain internal to the members of the collegium, but will be between the judiciary and the executive,” he said.
The former Chief Justice of India, R.M. Lodha, who was the chief guest at the lecture, said the ultimate goal of a Judicial Appointments Commission is to safeguard independence of judiciary. “There should not be a lurking fear in the judge that here is an authority who appointed me while giving his decision… if there is such a fear, there is no room for judicial independence,” Justice Lodha said.
Mr Shah said it is best that members have a cooling-off period of two to three years to ensure that they are not just independent in fact, but are also seen by the wider public as being independent of the Executive.
In an obvious reference to the former CJI, P. Sathasivam, he said: “One retired CJI whom I had great respect for... I was very disappointed when he accepted the Governor post of a southern State.”

Essential goods  prices under govt watchEssential goods' prices under govt watch
Sanjeeb Mukherjee | New Delhi Oct 06, 2014 12:50 AM IST
The Narendra Modi government has set up a mechanism to monitor prices of key essential commodities to ensure there is no unusual flaring in the ongoing festival season.
Officials said the exercise started sometime ago with the department of consumer affairs along with food and agriculture forming a select group to monitor prices.
The Prime Minister's Office is being sent daily updates on the food price situation in four major metropolitan cities.
The commodities being monitored are wheat, rice, edible oils and sugar.
In edible oils, prices of mustard, groundnut and palm oil are of particular importance because they are widely consumed during the festival season.
Four to five senior officials from the department of consumer affairs have toured various parts of the country to cross-check the price data furnished by state governments.
For instance, there was huge fluctuation in the retail sugar price data in Raipur some time ago. "There was something suspicious about the price movement as Chhattisgarh is neither a major consumer nor a big producer of sugar cane or sugar. Hence, we sent some officers to verify the data," a senior official from the department of consumer affairs said. The data was found inaccurate and corrected later, he said.
The exercise will continue in the coming days as well to ensure there is no speculation and a correct picture on prices emerges, the official said.
The whole mechanism is having a bearing on prices.
Retail prices of various commodities monitored either declined or showed a moderate increase between September 1 and October 1.
The average price at the national level was down Rs 5 .5 a kg in the common variety of rice to Rs 26.5 as on October 1 from Rs 32 on September 1, according to prices monitored by the department. Similarly, groundnut oil prices fell by Rs 31 to Rs 114 a litre from Rs 145 and palm oil by Rs 2 to Rs 65 a litre from Rs 67. However, prices of sugar were up by Rs 3 to Rs 37 a kg from Rs 34 a kg and mustard by Rs 1.67 a litre to Rs 91.67 from Rs 90. Wheat prices remained at Rs 18 a kg over this period.
Food prices had shown a rising trend immediately after the new government, the official added by Narendra Modi, took charge. Prices of onions, potatoes and tomatoes surged. On its part, the government took a series of measures including prohibiting export of onions and potatoes beyond a particular value and allowing state governments to impose stock-holding limits on onions and potatoes by bringing these under the Essential Commodities Act.
Retail prices of onions did not rise much between September 1 and October 1. These rose by Rs 2.5 a kg to Rs 27.5 a kg as on October 1. Prices of potatoes remained unchanged but at an elevated level of Rs 30 a kg. Tomatoes remained expensive, rising by Rs 5 at Rs 45 as on October 1 from Rs 40 as on September 1.
Retail price index-based food inflation has consistently remained high since the new government came to the office. It was 9.56 per cent in May, came down to 8.05 per cent the next month. But it again rose to 9.36 per cent in July and then further to 9.42 per cent in August.
However, wholesale food price index (WPI)-based inflation tells a different story. Food inflation in terms of WPI stood at 9.64 per cent in May, towards the end of which the new government took charge. Since then, it has declined to 5.15 per cent in August.

Jindal Group eyes takeover of debt-ridden  ebola outbreak hit  LondonMiningPress Trust of India | London | Posted: October 6, 2014 4:07 am
Indian conglomerate Jindal Group is considering a last-minute move to acquire the debt-ridden UK firm London Mining, a media report said today.
The company has been battling big debts, crashing iron-ore prices and the ebola outbreak in Africa, where it operates a mine.
Its shares closed last week at just four pence after it said it was in talks with a strategic partner, but warned any deal could virtually wipe out investors, The Sunday Times said.
A rescue would be likely to require lenders to accept big losses as well, the report said.
London Mining operates a small mine in Sierra Leone producing high grade iron-ore but is expensive to run.
Sierra Leone is one of the worst-affected African nations by the ebola pandemic.
It has made matters worse for business, with cargo ships charging an extra USD 2 a tonne for docking in Freetown, Sierra Leone’s capital.
A takeover by Jindal, whose operations span cement to oil and steel production, could involve “African Minerals,” the newspaper said without clearly identifying the Indian firm.
The London-listed miner founded by tycoon Frank Timis runs a bigger operation nearby.
Its shares have also been hammered.
Last week it hired Standard Chartered, London Mining’s biggest lender, to arrange USD 500 million in debt to see it through.
African Minerals owns a low-cost rail line and port that would allow London Mining to slash its delivery costs.
Jindal is reported to have approached African Mining for an alliance.

DERC to review fuel surcharge  power price in Delhi may go up inNovemberPress Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: October 6, 2014 3:48 am
Power price in the city may go up next month as Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (DERC) is all set to levy a fuel surcharge to help the private distribution companies adjust their power purchase cost.
While hiking the power tariff by up to 7.5 per cent for domestic consumers, the DERC in July had withdrawn Power Purchase Adjustment Cost (PPAC) of around 8 per cent till October.
Chairman of Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission P D Sudhakar said a decision on “readjusting” the tariff will be taken by end of the month after examining the petitions of the three private discoms to review the PPAC.
“We will take a decision on the fuel surcharge based on petitions of the discoms. A decision will be taken by end of this month and if there is a hike in tariff, then it will come into effect from November,” Sudhakar said.
The regulator had introduced PPAC in 2012 to help the private power distribution companies recover additional cost on account of increase in coal and gas prices.
Delhi gets power from a number of gas and coal-based power generation plants.
Power experts said the three discoms Tata Power Delhi Distribution Ltd, BSES Rajdhani Power Ltd and BSES Yamuna Power Ltd may see a hike in the range of 6 to 8 per cent.
While hiking the power tariff by up to 7.5 per cent for domestic consumers, the DERC in July had withdrawn PPAC of around 8 per cent for three months.
The withdrawal of the PPAC resulted in marginal decline of tariff for the consumers, whose monthly consumption does not exceed 400 units.
In January, the DERC had hiked the fuel surcharge to the tune of 8 per cent for BSES Yamuna Power Ltd, 6 per cent for BSES Rajdhani and 7 per cent for Tata Power Delhi Distribution Ltd.
The private power distribution companies, particularly, BRPL and BYPL, have been demanding significant hike in tariff, citing rise in power purchase cost.
Both the discoms supply power in 70 per cent areas in Delhi. According to DERC figures, the private discoms operating in the city have a revenue gap of a whopping Rs 19,500 crore.
As per official figures, around 80-90 per cent of total revenue of discoms goes into purchasing power from central and state government owned entities through long term power purchase agreement, at rates determined by the central and state regulators.
The experts said discoms’ cost of buying power from generating companies has increased by around 300 per cent in the last two years while the power tariff, in the corresponding period, has risen by around 70 per cent.
The city has seen a series of hike in power tariff in the last two years.
The tariff was hiked by 22 per cent in 2011 followed by five per cent hike in February 2012. The tariff was hiked by up to two per cent in May 2012 year and again by 26 per cent for domestic consumers in July 2012.
The tariff was hiked by up to three per cent in February last year and again continued…

Learnt from Virat on how to build an innings: RainaTwenty20
Suresh Raina on Saturday said he has matured as a player taking cues from his contemporaries including Virat Kohli, who has shown the way with big hundreds in ODI cricket.
“I have learnt a lot in these seven years. In the earlier years, there used to be Matthew Hayden along with Mike Hussey and also our coach Stephen Fleming, who helped me. In the Indian team, I learnt a lot from watching Virat Kohli, who convert starts into big hundreds in ODI cricket. Not to forget my partnerships with Dhoni. Also like to mention Yuvraj Singh’s name,” a beaming Raina said in a post-match interview.
“It’s important to perform on a big day. I believe they got 20 runs short bit I was determined to play till the end and see my team through. I have played Kuldeep, Yusuf (Pathan) and Piyush earlier and wanted to be positive,” said Raina.
Having broken the trophy jinx after three years, Raina said that team environment was key to CSK’s success.
“We have amazing players like Baz (Brendon McCullum), Faf (du Plessis) and Bravo and it’s an amazing atmosphere,” said Raina.
Skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni was happy with his team’s show.
“Overall it was a fantastic game for us,” said Dhoni.
“To start off, it was a good toss to win. It was slightly difficult for the opposition bowlers. Our fielding was not up to the mark. In finals, you have to take the game to the next level. So we didn’t start well with too many easy misfields,” he said.
He was also all praise for young spinner Pawan Negi, who grabbed five wickets.
“Negi is not afraid to toss the ball. It was important to do that to get something out of the wicket. Just like Kuldeep was also not afraid to toss the ball. He has the variety and will only mature as he graduates into international cricket,” said Dhoni.
For Dhoni, more than anything else, winning four out of the eight finals (IPL and CLT20 put together) is not bad at all as it gives him a 50 percent success rate.
“What’s important is to get to the knockouts. After that, you may win games, you may lose games. We have made eight finals, won four; I won’t say it is too bad. We made quite a few errors in the last two finals, so what we took out of those finals was really important. Raina was aggressive throughout and he ensured he stayed till the end.”
Kolkata Knight Riders captain Gautam Gambhir said that he was proud of his team’s performance.
“All of us should be proud of each other, the way we showed character,” said Gambhir.
Gambhir said that his team will only get better with time.
“The journey is not yet complete, it has just started. We thought 170-180 was a very good total, but in the second innings there was dew as well, it was difficult to grip the balls for spinners. We have great characters, tough characters. The guys should be proud of what they have achieved. They will be better next year.”

Azim Premji s son Rishad to join Wipro board with CFO Senapaty set to retireWipro founder Azim Premji's son Rishad Premji to join board as CFO Suresh Senapaty retires next year

(Senapaty’s retirement…)
BANGALORE: India's third-biggest software exporter Wipro is preparing for a generational shift at the top after company veteran and CFO Suresh Senapaty retires next March. Rishad Premji , the elder son of Wipro's billionaire founder Azim Premji , and also the company's head of strategy, is set to join the board "sometime next year", at least two people familiar with the discussions said.
"It's not that he (Rishad) was not part of the board discussions — he's always been since becoming the CSO —but with formal induction, he will get closer to representing ownership on the board," the first person said. There are two triggers for Rishad's promotion to the board. Firstly, Suresh Senapaty's retirement leaves an executive leadership post to be filled, and secondly, Rishad's grooming over the past seven years in different roles in the company seems to have almost achieved the purpose. "In some sense, this is a generational shift," the second person said. "It's easily among the best managed family transitions that I have seen in India."
When contacted, a Wipro spokesperson asked not to speculate about board appointments.
Rishad Joined Wipro in 2007
"You may be aware that Wipro has a board of directors with a majority of them being independent. The board has various subcommittees, one of them being Nomination and Governance consisting of independent directors and chaired by Dr Ganguly," the spokesperson said.
"Matters relating to any change in board members including new appointments are subject matters dealt with by such committee before it is deliberated by the board for a final decision (of course, subject to shareholder approval)," the Wipro spokesperson added.
Experts said it makes sense for Premji to have his son represent the family while he is still on the board to ensure the transition. "The transition of leadership in a family enterprise is a challenging period for all stakeholders," said Mike Fassler, consultant at Family Business Consulting Group in Chicago, which helps wealthy families sort through conflicts.
Fassler said senior Premji's presence on board will help "bring comfort to all stakeholders" even as Rishad takes the next step to join the board. "Effecting the transition while the leading generation is still available to influence the next generation's development can be an incredibly powerful demonstration of the family's commitment to and influence on the continuity of the enterprise," said Fassler. When Rishad joins the board of Wipro, he will continue to retain his current position as head of strategy, according to a third executive familiar with the development.
"He is to head the corporate venture arm," said the executive. "Corporate venture arm is nothing but identifying and evaluating startups which Wipro will back. So he will continue to be head of strategy even when he is on the board." Wipro is currently in the midst of putting together a team of executives that will oversee the $100-million corporate venture arm, to be spearheaded by Rishad.
Premji junior joined Wipro in 2007, working in capital markets space under banking and financial services division at Wipro. Less than a year after joining the company, he was overseeing the integration of USbased Gallagher with Wipro, when the company bought the mortgage solutions provider in 2008.
"For six months, he (Rishad) worked on this integration," said one of the executives who worked with Rishad then. "For two months he worked out of Miami office and the rest of time while in India he used to work at graveyard hours shift, always on the phone, trying to answer questions from Gallagher employees and help integrate the company," said the executive. Later in 2010, Rishad was appointed head of strategy.
"One of the things which he (Rishad) has done since taking over his role is to institutionalise this role of M&A in each of the six service lines," said two executives. By institutionalising, the executives mean that Rishad has helped each of the six services lines at Wipro have an executive focused on acquiring companies that can help Wipro scale up business. "Each of the service lines sees the opportunities and shares it with the central team," said the executive. In the last four years as head of strategy, Rishad has also got a lot of executives with domain experience in each of the six service lines.
"So until now, say healthcare unit had a lot of software engineers," said one executive. "Now we have a lot of executives who have experience working with pharma companies, who understand the business. They are able to work closely with the team and tell them exactly what the client wants." This, the executives claim, is one of the reasons why Wipro has started winning more transformational deals. A point validated by Ayan Mukerji, head of telecoms and media business of Wipro, who in an interview to ET last month said the company's winnability rate in media and telecoms space has jumped fourfold in the past two years.
Nonetheless, Fassler believes that "next generation family enterprise leaders face some common challenges which include continuing to develop family commitment to the future of the enterprise, balancing reinvestment of capital for the future with current period dividends to shareholders, and development of their own leadership identity while honoring the past."

Why Uber is dropping Mercs & BMWs from its f...Tweet
The company launched operations in India last year with its luxury segment, Uber Black, in cities such as Bangalore, Delhi and Mumbai.
BANGALORE/NEW DELHI: Taxi hailing app Uber which made a splash last year debuting with a squadron of BMWs, Mercedes' and Audis appears to have dropped these luxury cars from its fleet and is instead focusing on adding more Innovas and Corollas.
The company launched operations in India last year with its luxury segment, Uber Black, in cities such as Bangalore, Delhi and Mumbai. However, it has scaled down its luxury fleet. In cities such as Bangalore, Uber has almost entirely moved payment for its luxury vehicles to a commission basis from a lump sum at the end of the month.
This has made operators move their fleet to economical sedans than an Audi or BMW, which are costlier to run. In Delhi too, Uber has moved its Uber Black drivers to a commission basis.
Luxury cab operators confirm this development. "When Uber entered India, they used to hire our luxury cars like an Audi or BMW for on a monthly basis for anywhere between Rs 85,000 to Rs 2 lakh per car," said the founder of one of the biggest luxury car operators in Bangalore on condition of anonymity. "In a few months, they asked us to move to a commissionbased model. As the rate was very low, we decided to stop services." Uber charges Rs 200 as the minimum fare followed by a rate of Rs 18 per km for a Uber Black cab.
Two Uber employees confirmed the development. However, Uber officially declined to comment on the story. "We have moved to 100% commission basis in Bangalore for Uber Black. In other cities such as Delhi and Mumbai, the fleet of luxury cabs such as Audi is reduced as we have added more Innovas," said an Uber official on condition of anonymity.
Several frequent Uber customers told ET that they have not been picked up in an Audi or a BMW for as long as six months. "Now all I get is to travel in cabs such as Toyota Innova or a Honda City , and I travel by Uber almost every other day," said a Bangalore-based entrepreneur.
Marketers feel that it will be difficult for Uber India to gain that upper class brand positioning again. "Downgrading a brand offering is a letdown for the upwardly mobile customers who will be difficult to regain," said Ambika Sharma, founder and MD of Pulp Strategy, a brand activation company based in Delhi, which works with clients such as Microsoft and Intel.
"It is advisable for luxury brands to create a lower segment while maintaining existing customers at higher prices, just as companies such as Burberry have done," Sharma added. According to sources, Uber spends about Rs 1-5 crore on launch in a new city in India and the offer of a premium vehicle like a BMW is just to create a brand in the minds of the SEC A customers.
This market entry strategy of Uber has peeved luxury cab operators. Bangalore based Shrusti Travels, which offers luxury cars on rent, had partnered with Uber when the global luxury car rental aggregator had launched its service in Karnataka.
However, the association did not last long. "We worked with them only for four months. Our working styles and requirements do not match," said a manager at Shrusti, who did not want to be named.

Silicon Valley stalwart Hewlett-Packard Co , which has struggled to adapt to the new era of mobile and online computing, plans to split into two companies as it looks to put more focus on the faster-growing corporate services market, according to a Wall Street Journal report on Sunday.
The move, which could be announced as early as Monday, would be a monumental reshaping of one of technology's most important pioneers, which still has more than 300,000 employees and is on track to book $112 billion in revenue this fiscal year.
Under the reported plan, HP will separate its computer and printer businesses from its corporate hardware and services operations, and spin the unit off through a tax-free distribution of shares to stockholders next year.
A company spokeswoman declined to comment on the report.
HP's printing and personal computing business accounts for about half its revenue and profit, according to last quarter's financial results. It is not clear how many of HP's more than 300,000 staff work in each of the planned businesses.
Founded by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard in a Palo Alto, California garage in 1939, HP was one of the companies that shaped Silicon Valley and the PC revolution. Lately, however, it has struggled to adapt to the shift towards mobile computing, and it has been overshadowed by younger rivals.
HP's market value of $66 billion is dwarfed by Apple Inc's $596 billion and Microsoft Corp's $380 billion.
It has also been overtaken by aggressive Chinese PC maker Lenovo, which is now the world's No. 1 PC maker by shipments. Dell, which is HP's closest U.S. competitor and facing similar pressure, was taken private by founder Michael Dell last year.
SPIN-OFF TREND
HP is the latest in a line of companies, often under shareholder pressure, to spin off operations in an attempt to become more agile and to capitalize on faster-growing businesses. Last week online auction company eBay Inc said it would spin off electronic payment service PayPal.
HP and some of its investors have long considered such a move, the Journal report noted. As one of the older big computer companies, for several years HP directors have discussed ways to restructure to keep up with technology upstarts.
A source familiar with the matter said HP had held merger talks with storage and cloud-computing firm EMC recently, as a way of moving more forcefully into online services.
Many investors and analysts have called for a break-up of the company, or a sale of the personal computer business, so that HP could focus on the more profitable operations of providing computer servers, networking and data storage to businesses.
Company executives have said in the past that personal computers underpin and support the company as a whole. HP did consider spinning off its PC division in 2011 under then-CEO Leo Apotheker, but ultimately decided against the idea.
The PC business has shown signs of life in recent quarters, growing broadly geographically as businesses replace aging machines. Even so, the report of the plan to split off that business surprised some on Wall Street.
"I wonder what would have changed in the board's thinking that previously they thought they needed computers together with services to properly serve large enterprises to now," said Hudson Square Research analyst Daniel Ernst.
"PCs and printing remain in long-term secular decline, and while HP has managed that business well, the challenges for that portion of the split company will only grow as the demand continues to erode, and commoditization forces prices down further."
The Journal, citing one of its sources, said the plans call for current HP CEO Meg Whitman to become CEO of the new so-called enterprise company and also be chairman of the PC and printer company.
Current HP lead independent director Patricia Russo would be chairman of the enterprise company. The CEO of the PC and printer company would be Dion Weisler, who is currently an executive in that division, the report said.

J&K: Five killed as Pakistan shells Arnia sectors mainbazaarA villager shows mortar shells allegedly fired from the Pakistan side in Chanana village at the India-Pakistan International border at Arnia sector in Jammu and Kashmir on Saturday. (Source: PTI)
Written by Arun Sharma | Jammu | Posted: October 6, 2014 8:53 am | Updated: October 6, 2014 11:50 am
Five people were killed and nearly 50 others injured in Pakistani shelling in Arnia sector along the International Border near Jammu during early hours of Monday.
Sources said that four people died at the main bazaar in Arnia town itself when over a dozen mortar shells from across the border exploded around 3 am. It has been for the first time since 2003 that Pakistani shells have fallen in Arnia bazaar.
After a night long, unprovoked mortar shelling on civilian areas along the international border in Arnia sector, the Pakistani troops started targeting forward Indian positions along the Line of Control in Bhimber Gali (BG) area of Rajouri district on Monday.
Giving details, sources said that Pakistani troops started firing automatic weapons and mortars on the Indian side around 8.30 am. The Indian troops were retaliating and the exchange of fire between two sides was continuing till  reports last came in.

The Pakistani Rangers had been resorting to unprovoked mortar shelling and small arms fire along the international border since October 3. After a lull in of nearly a month, the Pakistani Rangers stepped up shelling during early hours of Monday around 12.30 am causing panic among the villagers. Apart from Arnia town, the villages most hit by shelling included Trewa, Suhagpur and Devigarh.
Border Security Force officials here said that Pakistani Rangers targeted ten BSF border outposts, besides civilian population with heavy mortar shelling and small arms fire in Arnia sector late last night. Pointing out that five civilians were killed and nearly 50 others injured in Pakistani shelling, they said that BSF also gave a befitting and calibrated reply to the Rangers. The loss in Pakistan territory is yet to be ascertained, they said, adding that the firing was continuing till reports last came in.
Giving details, sources said that the Pakistani guns had fallen silent after nearly half an hour long firing on the Indian side on Saturday night. Suddenly, they resumed mortar shelling at around 12.30 am forcing people in villages near the border to flee from their houses.

The shelling was so intense that people even in Arnia town came out of their houses and gathered in the main bazaar out of panic. Around 3 am, shells exploded in the bazaar killing five and injuring many others. The victims were rushed to the hospital, but one of them succumbed to injuries on the way.

5 killed  25 hurt as Pak fires at Indian posts  civilian areas in J&K districtFive killed, 29 injured in heavy shelling by Pakistani troops

("The number of civilians…)
JAMMU: Five villagers were killed and 29 injured in heavy mortar shelling and firing by Pakistani troops targeting hamlets and outposts along the International Border in Jammu district today in one of the worst ceasefire violations.
"Pakistani Rangers resorted to heavy and unprovoked firing and shelling of mortars on 10 corder outposts (BoPs) and civilian areas along international border (IB) in Arnia belt of Jammu district from 10 PM last night," a BSF spokesman said today.
They used small, automatic weapons and mortar bombs to target the border hamlets and BoPs along the borderline. BSF troops guarding the borderline retaliated effectively and gave a befitting reply, he said, adding that the intermittent firing exchanges are going on in the area.
In the shelling, five villagers were killed and 29 injured in several hamlets, Sub-Divisional Police Officer (SDPO), R S Pura Tehsil, Devender Shingh told PTI.
25 of the injured have been shifted to GMC hospital Jammu.
A large number of houses were damaged and livestock perished in the firing and shelling, said Singh, who was leading a team of police personnel who risked their lives to shift the injured people to hospital during the heavy shelling.
"People living in critical zones along the border will be evacuated," he said
A BSF spokesman said that the force did not suffer any casualty.
This was the 11th ceasefire violations along Indo-Pak border in Jammu and Kashmir during last four days. There have been seven ceasefire violations along Line of Control in Poonch and four along IB in Jammu.
On October 3, Pakistani troops and rangers violated ceasefire in Gulamarg sector of Kashmir Valley and in Poonch and Jammu sectors in which a girl was killed and six persons were injured.
Fear was writ large of the faces of kin of the injured, who were shifted to the hospital here. "We thought we will die any time, such was the firing of mortar bombs and their bursting sound," Karan Singh of Pindi village said.
"We have become sitting ducks for Pakistan to target us. Government should do something immediately. We cannot live on the border to die," Rano Devi said.
Yesterday, Pakistani troops violated ceasefire by resorting to unprovoked and heavy firing on Indian forward posts along LoC in Balnoie sub-sector of Poonch district around 0800 hours.
On October 4, Pakistani troops resorted heaviest firing and mortar shelling along LoC in in Poonch district of Jammu and Kashmir, drawing retaliation from Army.
On October 1 and 2, Pakistani troops violated ceasefire two times along LoC in Poonch district resulting in injuries to six people, including three women.
With assembly elections due in Jammu and Kashmir, the Pakistan-based militant leadership is desperate to push in a large number of militants into the Indian side in the cover of the heavy firing to carry out terrorism related activities, according to the Army.
"They want to disrupt the assembly elections in the state as they know that a large number of their cadre has already been eliminated. So to reinforce their numbers, they are desperately trying to infiltrate more people into the state and that is why there has been an increase in the number of ceasefire violations," Udhampur-based defense spokesman Col SD Goswami had said.
Before this, the heaviest ceasefire violation by the Pakistani troops was witnessed on August 26 night.
In a bid to defuse border tension, triggered by firing and shelling by Pakistani troops stretching to 45 days, the heaviest since 1971 war, India and Pakistan on August 29 held a crucial Sector Commander (DIG-Brigadier) level flag meeting on Octerio BoP in Jammu district's R S Pura sector.
On August 28, BSF troops held Commandant level flag-meeting with Rangers along IB at Ballard Post in Samba sector.
Pakistani troops also resorted to mortar shelling and firing in Jammu and Kashmir's Poonch district.
"Pakistan violated ceasefire today. They resorted to firing and mortar shelling on forward posts along LoC in Bhimber Gali (BG) belt of Poonch district around 0830 hours today," a Defence Spokesman said.
Indian troops effectively retaliated, he said adding that exchanges are going on in the area.

Traders bullish on Infosys on expectations of Vishal Sikka unveiling a growth map

(Analysts said many traders…)
MUMBAI: Savvy traders have placed bullish bets on Infosys ahead of its second quarter earnings due on Friday, October 10. Brokers and analysts said the long positions in Infosys futures and options contracts have been created on hopes that the software exporter's new chief executive officer Vishal Sikka may announce a road map for its future growth.
"Traders can expect 3-4% upside in Infosys stock price on the results day. Most of the positions in the futures segment are long in nature. Bears have gone into hiding from the stock," said Amit Gupta, head of derivatives at ICICI Direct. Infy futures open interest, or outstanding positions, at the beginning of the October series is currently around 33 lakh shares, compared to about 25 lakh shares at the beginning of the September series.
Analysts said many traders have squared off their short positions ahead of the results. Infosys saw a strong open interest build-up on the long side last week. The stock has also given a major breakout on the weekly charts above Rs 3,680, said Ashish Chaturmohta, head of technical and derivatives desk at Fortune Equity Broking. Infosys shares closed at Rs 3,847.20 on Wednesday.
Chaturmohta expects the stock to rise another 7-8% in the near term. In Infy call options, the highest open interest is at 4,000 strike in the October series. Analysts said the build-up suggests traders expect stock to rise to Rs 4,000.
"We expect the Infosys stock to move substantially higher in the October series. The open interest in out-of-the-money (OTM) call option (the strike price that is higher than the market price) has been increasing, which is a strong bullish indicator," said Alex Mathews, head of research at Geojit BNP Paribas.
Recently, CLSA has upgraded Infosys rating to 'Buy' from 'Outperform', and has increased its price target to Rs 4,500 from Rs 3,750. Infosys shares have rallied nearly 20% in the last three months, and have outperformed the BSE IT Index, which has gained 17.5%.
The broader benchmark Sensex has gained 4% during the same period. Amar Ambani, head of research at IIFL, said, "IT companies are expected to report strong quarterly performance driven by seasonal project ramp-ups, and currency tailwinds. There is also a high likelihood of incrementally encouraging commentary by most companies on revenue visibility given US growth acceleration."

Markets closed on account of Bakri IdMarkets closed on account of Eid-ul-Azha
SI Reporter | Mumbai Oct 06, 2014 09:12 AM IST
Indian equity, debt and commodity markets are closed today on account of Eid.
For the week, the market trend will be dictated by second quarter (July-September) earnings with Infosys scheduled to announce its earnings on October 10. For India's leading companies, earnings growth is expected to remain stable in the July-September quarter of the current financial year.
In Asia, Japanese stocks bounced strongly on Monday and the U.S. dollar held near four-year highs against a basket of currencies, spurred by U.S. jobs data after a week of worries about global growth and geopolitical tensions frayed investor nerves.
Tokyo's Nikkei jumped 1.3% while Hong Kong shares rose 0.3%, extending their recovery from falls last week when concerns about civil unrest in the Chinese-controlled city had spooked investors. There has been some signs of the protests fizzling out.
MSCI's dollar-denominated index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.1%, as the boost from positive U.S. data was offset by weaker Asian currencies and falls in Australian mining shares.
Stocks on Wall Street jumped more than 1.0% on Friday, with the S&P 500 posting its best day in almost two months to end at $1,967.90.
The US dollar was another clear winner, as the data highlighted the relative strength of the U.S. economy as many other major economies remain sluggish.

Obama-Modi statement reiterates need for bilateral mechanism: Nirmala Sitharaman
The Modi Government on Friday denied that the reference to Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) in the joint statement from U.S. President Barack Obama and Prime Minister Narendra Modi earlier this week, was an outcome of the U.S. “arm-twisting”. The U.S. consent to discussion of IPR issues through the bilateral mechanism is a re-affirmation of India’s stand that issues need bilateral discussion and not unilateral action, a Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) clarification said.
The clarification further said the bilateral mechanism agreed to for discussing IPR disputes — Trade Policy Forum (TPF) — was put in place by the UPA Government in March 2010 through a US-India statement, was signed by the then Commerce Minister and his U.S. counterpart. “We have not submitted to the U.S. or yielded ground…. We have reiterated that the U.S. should not act unilaterally,” Industry Minister Nirmala Sitharaman told The Hindu.
The joint statement, the DIPP clarified, in fact “merely reiterates” the position India has held since 2010 — this consistent position being that the IPR legal regime in India is fully TRIPS compliant and that issues to be discussed have to be taken up in bilateral forums like TPF. India has consistently refused to be subjected to unilateral action, the clarification added.
The U.S. has proposed unilateral action against India under its Special 301 report, which is an annual report on IPR under U.S. Trade Act.
India has been repeatedly raising the issue of copyright piracy and misappropriation of traditional knowledge with the U.S., the clarification added.
The joint Indo-U.S. statement issued during Prime Minister Modi’s recent visit to the U.S. had said: “Agreeing on the need to foster innovation in a manner that promotes economic growth and job creation, the leaders committed to establish an annual high level Intellectual Property (IP) Working Group with appropriate decision making and technical level meetings as a part of the trade policy forum”.
The TPF that had not met for three years is scheduled to meet later this month. It includes the Innovation and Creativity Focus Group for consultations between the two countries at least twice a year on improving IPR protection and enforcement, working towards greater IPR awareness and fostering innovation and creativity through increased collaboration between U.S. and Indian innovators, the clarification stated.

US jobless rate hits six year low  dollar risesUS jobless rate lowest in six years; dollar rises
Reuters        Last Updated: October 4, 2014  | 19:51 IST
Photo:  Reuters
A strong improvement in the US jobs market lifted the dollar to a four-year high against a basket of currencies on Friday while stocks also extended gains, taking heart from more evidence of a sustained recovery in the world's largest economy.
Closely followed non-farm payrolls data for September showed US employers had added 248,000 jobs, up from an upwardly revised 180,000 the previous month and beating forecasts of the 215,000 economists polled by Reuters had predicted beforehand. The jobless rate fell to a six-year low of 5.9 per cent.
Wall Street futures extended gains while the dollar hit a fresh four-year high of 86.498. US short-term interest-rate futures contracts fell and traders boosted bets the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates slightly earlier in 2015.
"Just when investors had been becoming nervous about global growth prospects with October so far seeing a broad sell-off in equity markets, today's non-farm payrolls figure could put a line in the sand for the indices," said Angus Campbell, senior analyst at FXPro.
This week has seen stocks, oil and other commodity markets suffer their biggest slump in months on worries about growth, political unrest and looming US interest rate rises and their impact on the dollar.
Dollar bulls, who have pushed the currency to a four-year high this week, had been counting on the robust jobs report following some healthy signals already this week.
Brent crude futures fell to $92.20 a barrel, trading near their lowest since 2012, with the overall tone quite bearish, amid ample supply.
Gold fell 1.3 per cent to a nine-month low of $1,197.95/oz while copper prices ticked up after hitting five-month lows the session before.
European bourses extended their earlier gains, rising 1 per cent.
The euro fell to a two-year low against the dollar, a day after the European Central Bank disappointed the markets on Thursday and triggered the biggest sell-off in over a year in markets like Italy.

The chief executive of e-commerce major Amazon, Jeffrey P Bezos, called on Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
"Jeffrey P. Bezos, President, Chairman and CEO of Amazon.com, called on the Prime Minister, Narendra Modi today," an official release said.
Bezos have been visiting Indian cities this week. Amazon, the world's largest e-tailer has already committed USD 2 billion investment in the country.
Earlier this week, Bezos had said that Amazon in evaluating setting up a data centre in India to tap into the multi-billion cloud opportunity.
"We are always evaluating new locations. We have AWS. We started it long time ago and it has grown into a very large business, separate from our consumer business... we are building new data centres and are looking where we should put them and evaluating these in India as well," Bezos had said.
For Amazon, which launched its marketplace in India last year, India is one of its fastest growing markets and is on track to touch USD 1 billion in gross sales.
Bezos had said the pace at which Internet penetration was increasing in India was stunning and that was one of the tailwinds for the growth of e-commerce.
"India is unbelievably energising; the people are focused on learning and extremely inventive," he had said.

'India poised to become next 'Anglo-Saxon' economy'
In this interview, CNBC-TV18 spoke with Rohit Sah, who has been covering the Indian market as part of an emerging-market basket since 1996: first at Oppenheimer and now at TCW International, where he is portfolio manager for the asset manager’s smallcap strategies.

CNBC-TV18 travelled to New York to cover Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s US visit. In the city, our journalists reached out to a host of Wall Street veterans to see what they make of the India story.
In this interview, CNBC-TV18 spoke with Rohit Sah, who has been covering the Indian market as part of an emerging-market basket since 1996: first at Oppenheimer and now at TCW International, where he is portfolio manager for the asset manager’s smallcap strategies.
Sah argued that out of all the BRICS countries, India alone looks set to join the select band of “Anglo-Saxon economies”. Read on to know what Sah meant by an “Anglo-Saxon” economy and why he thinks India is poised to become one.
Edited excerpts from the interview with CNBC-TV18's Latha Venkatesh.
Q: Why are you so confident that of all countries, India will be an Anglo-Saxon economy?
A: Let us define what an Anglo-Saxon economy is. First of all, it is characterised by low-government spending, it generally has an open current account, secure property rights and stock market and capital markets which are geared towards growth. So, if you look at the successful economies in the last 100 years, they have been the US, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada and Hong Kong.
India today is not an Anglo-Saxon economy, in 1947 it was. However, today we have a long way to go before we get to being an Anglo-Saxon economy.
However, this election of 2014 has provided a political mandate to move away from the Fabian socialism that has been practiced unfortunately for the last 60 plus years in India.
So, I am hopeful; I think the political mandate is there. You have a prime minister who has demonstrated his ability to execute such an economy in the state of Gujarat. So, we can only hope for the best after that.
Q: What makes you so confident? Modi has accepted the Food Security Act, he is not talking of privatisation; he didn’t even privatise PSUs in his own home state. So, why should you be confident that we should be in this Anglo-Saxon category?
A: I think the political reality in India is that it is a very poor country and a very unequal society. So, any Prime Minister of India has to take that into account. Modi comes in with a very large political capital base but that is a finite capital base. For him to be able to execute on the economic reforms where there will be losers as well as winners, you have to carry the country along with you.
So, these are initial steps, which have not done away with redistribution policies. I would say they have streamlined it but that is the reality of India. Over time you will see these things improve.
What I am expecting is that after the Maharashtra elections are over, you have to see some solid reforms come through for this optimism to be maintained about India.
Q: A lot of investors have already begun talking of a pulling back India’s so called Modi premium especially after that decision was not taken on gas price increase. How long are you willing to wait for action from the new government?
A: Let us begin with the Modi premium and let us just define exactly what that is. First of all, the economy in the last few years has gone down so much that people across economic spectrum have expressed frustration.
I have had some of the richest people come to my office and tell me that they have never voted in their life but this time around they are going to go and register and vote.
When analysts come to my room and say that if this election is not a good election result, they are going to send their children out of the country, I have read about rickshaw drivers in the city of Benaras talking about the dollar-rupee rates. When you look at all these various voices coming across the spectrum, it is clear the reality has sunk in; you need economic reforms. This redistribution approach of the Fabian socialisms of the Congress party is dead.
To me the telling election was the Rajasthan election of December 2013 when the blatantly populist government of [Ashok] Gehlot was completely wiped out. I think all these are very good indicators that Modi comes with a very high political capital which he can afford to spend.
However, one question I am not sure about is whether is it a Modi premium or is it a BJP premium? Have people voted for Modi or have people voted for the BJP and that is an uncertainty right now.
If you move to the next step, you have to give him some time to get in, wait to see all the files that are there, get the bureaucracy in action. However, I do expect serious action after the Maharashtra elections. So, right now he is talking the talk; we have to walk the walk after the Maharashtra elections; a lot of political capital is still left so.
Q: You are the king of small and midcap stocks in your fund; year-to-date (YTD) the Nifty has delivered about 25 percent gains, midcap and smallcaps have been giving between 45 and 65 percent gains. So, are we in bubble terrain here?
A: Let me tell you what a very experienced fund manager colleague of mine told me. He said he was short Cisco back in the 1980’s and he said he lost his shirt on it. The reason he lost his shirt was because the market correctly looked forward and said this is a fantastic story, this is going to be a 10-year story and Cisco peaked out at a USD 0.5 trillion market cap. So, I would say the same thing about the Indian smallcap market.
The Indian smallcap and midcap market unlike the largecap market is primarily geared towards the domestic economy. The domestic economy is coming off a very low base, you have tremendous tailwinds right now in favor of it and you have a government which has shown willingness to reform in the past. So, valuation is not an issue.
If you want to be buying the Indian smallcaps, what you have to focus is not on valuation but you have to focus on the quality of the management, the quality of the business and the financial returns that you are getting from these businesses and after that the market will take care of itself.
Q: Your biggest overweight sector is I noticed financials. You have 29.8 percent of your funds there. Now Rural Electrification Corporation (REC)  is the top holding in that list. Do you like the PSU banks?
A: Let me just give you an overview of the financial sector. In the last 12 years, the growth of India’s gross domestic product (GDP) in US dollar terms has been 12 percent. That is despite the fact that you had a Sonia Gandhi led government which didn’t know what they were doing or maybe they knew what they were doing but it wasn’t the right thing to do. Now, if you look forward I don’t see any reason why India can’t grow at 12 percent for the next 12 years with the right reforms. If you grow at 12 percent you double your economy in six years, in 12 years [growth is] quadrupled. So, you go from a USD 2 trillion economy today to an USD 8 trillion economy in 12 years time.
As we know that is one of the biggest accumulations of GDP in human history in that shorter time if that really does happen. The biggest beneficiary of this sort of GDP expansion have to be capital markets and financial deepening. So by default the financial sector has to be a big winner in the India that we hope to have in the next 12 years.
Now regarding public sector banks I am not optimistic. If I was the government what I would do is two things. First I would merge these banks as fast as I can. So, the PSU banks which are in the North with the South and sort of cut them down in size and importance that way. The second thing I would do is by default asset-stripping.
So for example, many of these PSU companies own a lot of property. What I would do is I would take these property holdings that the banks have and all their PSU companies have, put them in to a REIT, sell that REIT and you get some value out of these holdings that you have. However, in the long run these PSU banks are not the place to be.
Q: If not PSU banks what attracts you in the finance space in general is it private banks, is it non banks?
A: What I would do is I would think about the Indian economy growing from what it is today to becoming a global financial market and think about all the things that you need to get from here to there. So the first thing you need is very good rating agencies. So I would think about that sort spurt of the capital markets. I would definitely look at the private banks; both small, mid and large all of them. That is the easiest way to play the deepening of financial markets in India.
I would look at also the non-bank financial companies (NBFCs) but given governor Rajan’s pronouncement so far it seems to me you are better off buying the private sector banks rather than the non bank financial companies. Also there is companies which will benefit from financial inclusion. In the financial sector these are smaller companies, they would be some of the ones I would look at.
Q: You have PSUs like Nalco , Engineers India Limited (EIL) , and Bharat Earth Movers Limited (BEML) . Now what's common, what kind of PSUs do you normally like?
A: Again let's go back to the crystal ball and look at India in the next ten years, you have to develop a global continental sized economy and that's the right way to think of India in the future. You have an economy which will look very similar to the China and the US in next 12 years.
So you have to think in terms of what sectors have to grow a lot before you can get there and which sectors are the ones where the Indian public sector is very well geared towards. So I would look at logistics as one, I would at property as another one; I would look at any sector where the public sector company has a natural monopoly.
I would shy away from PSU banks and I would shy away from any manufacturing company that the Indian government owns and that's the way I would go.
Q: The prime divestment candidates that are on the anvil are Steel Authority of India (SAIL) , Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited (ONGC)  and Coal India . Do you fancy any of these stocks?
A: The Indian government has a demonstrated track record of selling these assets cheap simply because nobody believes them any more. So as a trade these are good trades. Coal India is a good trade, SAIL would be a good trade. I would hesitate to call them investments for the long-term. So I would stick to the companies in the public sector which are run every well.
Which are natural monopolies and I have already given you hints of which kind of sectors I would go into.
Q: Do you like the oil PSUs? They have been actually quite a rage on expectations of a fuel price decontrol and in fact lower subsidy burden?
A: Let me take ONGC as a very good example what problem might be for these companies. Most of ONGC’s revenues and profits come from Bombay High. Bombay High is unfortunately a very old oil field and it is literally dying under their feet, they are running just fast to just standstill. So in my criteria of companies which I buy which are highly profitable, fast growing and able to maintain the first two characteristics for a long time ONGC does not fall in to that market.
The only oil company in India which really does fall in to that market that I like which is high recycle ratios in oil companies, long lived oil assets and very fast payback periods on oil wells is Cairn India  but unfortunately Cairn India has serious corporate governance issues and so it is best to avoid Cairn India.
By default I would say the oil sector in India unfortunately is not the right place to be. India is the very geologically interesting country in terms of oil and gas discoveries. You have already had the KG-D6 as a potential world class asset but I am sure there will be others coming up in the future and what you want to do is you want to find those companies which are sitting on these kind of assets and may be it is ONGC in the future but the only time will tell.
Q: Actually most India investors seem to like autos ands auto ancillaries, why not they have done very well year to date, anything that you like in this space?
A: India has some very good auto ancillary companies I mean Motherson Sumi  and Bharat Forge  are the ones which immediately come to mind. I have not looked at others but those two are the ones I would recommend.
Q: This far this year liquidity has been very favourable for India. If the US Fed were to hike interest rates do you see a liquidity drought?
A: I don’t think the Fed is going to hike rates. I think the US economy is not as strong as everybody thinks. What we have is a growth scare as some people call it, the scare that the US economy is growing faster than it is able to and leading to inflation. I don’t see any such possibility happening. So, in that scenario what you have is the dollar strength. However, on flip side we also have China slowing down. So, commodity prices are coming down.
For India the most important things is not the Fed, it is the oil prices which are much more important, coal prices and so on. So, in that scenario India does very well because if the Fed is not raising rates, the liquidity will continue to move into emerging markets or at least to some emerging markets and India is by far the best story out there.
If the Fed were to raise rates that would probably mean that the US economy is doing a lot better than what I expected to do. If that is the case then the US will be importing a lot more goods from everywhere that should be good for global growth. However, only time will tell. Right now, I am assuming that the Fed cannot raise rates although the liquidity into emerging markets will slowdown.
The credit story in India is improving by the day and as long as Prime Minister Modi can deliver on his economic reforms I don’t see any reason why the foreign money will go to a future continental sized economy like India.
Q: Chinese slowdown and the commodities down cycle has been very good for India but how long do you think both these trends will last?
A: The commodity market is right now being torned between two different factors. On the supply side we have a real crisis developing. After 2016 when you look at the future copper supply, oil supply, natural gas supply and all these various commodity sectors that are there, we have a real supply shortage coming up. What has helped us right now and probably for the next few months is China has slowed down a lot more than expected. So, I think this run of good luck continues maybe till the end of next year at best.
After that if Modi hasn’t fixed the Indian commodity supply situation, we have a real problem in India. So, that is where I would leave it. I think the tailwind is behind India right now, probably dies out by the middle of next year and becomes a headwind by the end of next year.
Q: The evergreen big India stories are IT and pharma. You are under invested looks like in both these areas. Anything you like particularly?
A: I am not a big fan of the IT sector in India. I think it is actually a wrong classification. If you look at companies like Infosys  and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) , you do a simple calculation. You just calculate the ratio of their cash flow to employee and plot it backwards for the last several years. It doesn’t matter which company you pick up; you get the same number – about USD 4000-6000 per employee, per year, cash flow, profits.
The problem is not the number; the problem is it is flat. It hasn’t changed in the last several years. So, in other words if Infosys has to grow 20 percent, all you need to do is hire 20 percent more employees. That is not an IT company; that is a labour employment agency.
So, I am not very enthusiastic about the IT sector. Having said that, I have been wrong for the last five years; these have been some of the best performing stocks in India and globally I would say. However, there is a sell by date for some stocks and some sectors.
The pharma sector is one where there is a lot more hope. However, again you have to look at companies with new business models, not just the same old formulation of the existing medicines. You have to start with somebody who can generate sales in a different way.

Sandy Koufax Chose His Faith Over The World Series And Still Won It AllOn the field, Sandy Koufax wasn't just any baseball player . Off the field, he wasn't viewed that way either. The Hall of Fame pitcher isn't just remembered by baseball fans as " the man with the golden arm ," but is revered by his Jewish admirers as "the left arm of God" for his talent as well as the public observance of his faith, most notably during the 1965 World Series.
A legendary left-handed pitcher who spent his entire career with the Dodgers, Koufax dominated batters like few ever have, atop mounds in Brooklyn and Los Angeles -- as well as just about every major league locale in between. His preternatural gifts -- notably that knee-buckling curve and relatively overlooked fastball -- earned him three Cy Young Awards and all-time great status in an injury-shortened career that lasted from 1955 through 1966. Five years after retiring at the age of 30, Koufax became the youngest player ever inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1971.
For many Jewish fans, he was something even more important than a plaque in Cooperstown. The lanky, reserved product of Lafayette High School in Brooklyn was a role model for young Jewish boys -- and girls -- who dreamt big league dreams while also bolstering the hopes of Jewish adults who hoped to find success or even simply acceptance in an America they may have felt viewed them as outsiders.
Koufax's roles as Jewish talisman and big league superstar intersected during the 1965 World Series. The opening game of series between Koufax's Dodgers and the Minnesota Twins was scheduled for the afternoon of Oct. 6, the date of Yom Kippur . The holiest day of the year for Jews, Yom Kippur is the annual holy day of atonement that is set aside for fasting, religious service and repentance.
It is not a day for pitching in the World Series, even if you're the ace of the team representing the National League fresh off a historic Cy Young Award-winning season that included the eighth perfect game in MLB history. Koufax told Dodgers manager Walter Aston that he would not be available to pitch because it was a holy day.
"By refusing to pitch that day, Koufax became inextricably linked with the American Jewish experience," wrote author Jane Leavy in her bestselling biography of the pitcher published in 2002. "He was the New Patriarch: Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and Sandy. A moral exemplar, and single too! (Such a catch!)"
Reserved to the point of being considered reclusive , Koufax chose to speak little of his decision or his faith through the years. His few comments suggest the choice to remove himself from consideration for the start was not difficult to make.
“Respect,” Koufax responded before the 2014 season when asked by Jewish Week why he sat out the game.
He would also tell the publication that he felt " no pressure " from his teammates to start the game.
With Koufax unavailable, Alston gave the ball to Don Drysdale , a right-handed power pitcher who was named the 1962 Cy Young Award winner and earned his own spot in the Hall of Fame . Despite his own formidable talents, Drysdale struggled against the Twins in the series opener, surrendering seven runs over just 2.2 innings . When Alston came to the mound to remove him from the game, Drysdale quipped, "I bet right now you wish I was Jewish, too," according to ESPN.com . The Dodgers would lose Game 1, 8-2.
Back in uniform for the second game, Koufax was unable to even the series, giving up two runs over six innings as the Dodgers suffered a 5-1 loss . After the Dodgers won the next two games, Koufax twirled a complete-game, four-hit shutout in Game 5. The Twins would win Game 6 to force a winner-take-all Game 7. With Koufax on just two day's rest by virtue of having started the second and fifth games of the series rather than the first and fourth, Alston still gave him the ball.
He wouldn't regret it.
With the World Series hanging in the balance, Koufax pitched another complete-game shutout, allowing just three hits as the Dodgers won the decisive game 2-0 . Tired and struggling with his curve as the game advanced, Koufax turned to his fastball in the later innings as Drysdale, with an extra day's rest, waited in case he was needed.
Koufax would be named the World Series MVP and later Sports Illustrated's Sportsman Of The Year for 1965. Plagued by an arthritic left arm, he would retire after just one more sterling season. But his legacy was assured. Not only was he the pitcher that every lefty would be measured against , but he had broadened the horizon for innumerable Jewish kids.
"There are three things any self-respecting Jewish boy should want to grow up to be: a doctor, a lawyer, or Sandy Koufax," Alan Siegel wrote for The Atlantic in 2010.

No Decision on Making CAG Multi-Member Body: Finance MinistryFinance Minister Wants RBI to Make Cost of Capital Cheaper
New Delhi: No decision has been taken on a suggestion by the UPA government-appointed Shunglu Committee to make the Comptroller Auditor General (CAG) a multi-member body, the Finance Ministry has said.
The high-level committee, headed by former CAG V K Shunglu, had in March 2011 written to former prime minister Manmohan Singh suggesting changes in the country's top auditing body.
Replying to an RTI query, the Finance Ministry said that it was suggested for CAG that a three-member body would have greater transparency in its operation.
"Out of the three members, one member should possess professional accounting qualifications, CA or its transnational equivalent. This should not seem to exclude an Indian Audits and Accounts Service (IAAS) officer from the triumvirate, who has wide exposure to finance, audit and accounts and best international practices in these areas."
"No decision has been taken by the government (on these suggestions)," the ministry said in response to the RTI query filed by PTI.
The Shunglu panel, which probed alleged irregularities in 2010 Commonwealth Games-related projects executed by various government departments and private firms, had also suggested changes in Controller General of Accounts (CGA), Controller of Accounts under Delhi government, Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) and Delhi Development Authority (DDA).
In his six-page letter, Mr Shunglu had said that autonomy of Chief Technical Examination wing under the CVC needs to be increased and recommended outsourcing of professional hands to assist in its probe.
The Commonwealth Games were held from December 3-14, 2010 in the national capital.

Delhi Electricity Regulator to Review Fuel Surcharge, Tariff May Rise in November
Press Trust of India | Updated On: October 05, 2014 19:12 (IST)
US Seeks to Step Up India Trade Talks After WTO Deal
New Delhi: Power tariff in the city may go up next month as the Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (DERC) is all set to levy a fuel surcharge to help the private distribution companies adjust their power purchase cost.
While hiking the power tariff by up to 7.5 per cent for domestic consumers, the regulator had in July withdrawn the power purchase adjustment cost (PPAC) of around 8 per cent till October.
A decision on "readjusting" the tariff will be taken by end of the month after examining the petitions of the three private distribution companies to review the PPAC, Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission Chairman P D Sudhakar said.
"We will take a decision on the fuel surcharge based on petitions of the discoms. A decision will be taken by end of this month and if there is a hike in tariff, then it will come into effect from November," he told PTI.
The regulator had introduced PPAC in 2012 to help the private power distribution companies recover additional cost on account of increase in coal and gas prices.
Delhi gets power from a number of gas and coal-based power generation plants.
Power experts said the three distribution companies Tata Power Delhi Distribution Ltd, BSES Rajdhani Power Ltd and BSES Yamuna Power Ltd may see a hike in the range of 6 to 8 per cent.
While hiking the power tariff by up to 7.5 per cent for domestic consumers, DERC had in July withdrawn PPAC of around 8 per cent for three months.
The withdrawal of the PPAC resulted in marginal decline of tariff for the consumers, whose monthly consumption does not exceed 400 units.
In January, the DERC had hiked the fuel surcharge to the tune of 8 per cent for BSES Yamuna Power Ltd, 6 per cent for BSES Rajdhani and 7 per cent for Tata Power Delhi Distribution Ltd.
The private power distribution companies, particularly, BRPL and BYPL, have been demanding significant hike in tariff, citing rise in power purchase cost.

Ports gear up to handle surge in coal importsPorts gear up to handle surge in coal imports
Debabrata Das / Mamuni Das
Freight woes: At Paradip Port, rake availability has declined compared to last year: - KAMAL NARANG
While Paradip Port plans to dredge 2 berths, Kandla Port is buying more cranes
New Delhi, October 5:  
India’s major ports are taking to dredging and procuring more cranes to deal with a surge in imported coal. While Paradip Port plans to dredge two of its berths for handling bigger ships, Kandla Port has begun the process of procuring additional cranes.
The higher traffic is a result of the country’s fuel starved thermal power plants resorting to imports, as Coal India struggles to meet the demand. According to the Central Electricity Authority, 56 power plants in the country had critical (less than seven days) of coal stocks as on September 29.
Analysts estimate that coal and coking coal imports in August were 12 per cent higher than the same month last year at 9.41 million tonne. This is after a 3.87 per cent increase in imports during the first quarter of 2014-15 at 50.94 million tonne.
With import volumes increasing, importers have started using larger vessels to get a freight advantage.
Large vessels
“Importers are using 80,000 tonne gearless vessels instead of 60,000 tonne geared ones because of $1-2 per tonne advantage they get in the freight rate,” said a port official.
Gearless vessels depend on the equipment in ports to handle cargo while vessels with gears have cranes onboard. Paradip Port in Odisha can only handle such vessels at one berth.
An official at Paradip Port said that it is now in the process of dredging two more berths to have deeper channels for handling bigger ships. “The tenders are being placed to deepen the channel by December,” said the official.
Kandla Port, which registered over 17 per cent growth in coal handling in August, is in the process of procuring two floating cranes which will help unload cargo from the bigger vessels that cannot come very close to the port, said an official of the port.
At present, Kandla Port operates with two floating cranes. Moreover, two berths of Kandla Port — Tuna/Tekra — are being mechanised by the Adani Group and are expected to be operational by December.
However, evacuation of the imported coal from the ports is also proving to be a concern.
Due to lack of rake availability, the evacuation of coal from the Paradip Port is far from smooth, said an analyst with India Coal Market Watch.
There is still 2-3 million tonnes of coal at the port currently. “There are 400 pending indents with the Railways. Daily evacuation is 9-10 rakes while we would require 20-25 rakes a day,” said an official at the port.
Rake availability has actually declined for Paradip Port as it is only getting around 300 rakes a month at present while last year it was getting 600 rakes.

This lending library is trying to keep Hong Kongs democracy movement aliveThe Future of Hong Kong
October 5, 2014
HONG KONG—In the 2012 sci-fi novel,  Hong Kong Shutdown , the city is in chaos. Transportation is wrecked, the government is paralyzed, the police have resorted to violence, and mainland Chinese officials have swooped in to address the problem—a virus that hit the city of seven million—by cutting off Hong Kong from the rest of the world.
“It reminds me of Hong Kong today,” Shephard Ng, 22, tells Quartz, as he plucks the novel from a stack of used books that has just been wheeled into the main protest site of Hong Kong’s “umbrella movement,” which has floored the city over the past week. In the face of a government-issued ultimatum to leave protest sites by Monday morning , when police are rumored to arrive, some protesters are instead setting up a small community library there, a symbol of their determination to achieve free elections.
On a plaza in the Admiralty area of downtown, where thousands of demonstrators are sleeping on makeshift beds outside government offices and along a main thruway, the lending library boasts an English section, a Manga collection, and several shelves of books in Chinese. Titles range from How to Survive a Robot Uprising, and Dante Alighieri’s Inferno to On Democracy by Robert Dahl. The library is situated near the office of the city’s embattled chief executive, CY Leung, and a “mobile democracy classroom” where demonstrators hash out the links between free elections and environmentalism .
“We hope we can fuel discussion. We want to let people know more about democracy,” says Soman Wong, a social worker in Hong Kong, who at one o’clock in the morning is stacking books on a small wooden shelf, anticipating government workers returning to their offices nearby. Asked how long she thinks the protesters will stay, she says, “Until the government changes” and then adds, “As long as we can.”
One student group involved, the Hong Kong Federation of Students, held preparatory talks with government representatives after protesters pulled back from some protest sites earlier in the evening, according to the group’s Facebook page . The government has now asked that protesters clear the main road in Admiralty as well as areas near government offices to let workers back in come morning.

Hong Kong’s pro-democracy demonstrators, many of them students who have now boycotted two weeks of classes, are at a turning point. The movement’s initial push for universal suffrage could be derailed by strategic  disagreements among protesters , such as which sites to occupy and how to address pushback from authorities. Some student leaders began talks with government representatives late Sunday evening, while other protesters vowed to hold out for meaningful government concessions. “They can’t stop us now. Not even the leaders [of the protests],” says Chung, Pui-Man, 20, a student at Chinese University of Hong Kong, standing among the remaining hundreds of protesters along Harcourt Road, the main street in Admiralty.

The movement has also been threatened by  attacks on protesters  and scuffles with local residents angered by blocked traffic in major intersections and commercial districts. On Sunday evening, Admiralty was less crowded than it has been all week; secondary school teachers advised their students to stay at home out of fear of violence and at least one university head pleaded with protesters to evacuate.

Wong hopes the lending library—which also includes titles like Guard Hong Kong , a collection of letters between residents of Hong Kong and Tokyo about their cities and Proletarian Nights, on the workers movement in mid-19th century Paris—will reinvigorate the movement. One protester helping put together the library points to a copy of Noam Chomsky’s Media Control on the connection between government and media, and says, “This is just like Hong Kong’s TVB,” referring to a local pro-Beijing television station.
Other protesters like Chung, who plans to stay in Admiralty until the morning, are less bleary-eyed. “Deep down, you wonder, will it work? Probably nothing is going to change. We just fight for something.”

Modi attacks Pawar in NCP strongholds

TOPICS
political parties
Prime Minister Narendra Modi criticised Nationalist Congress Party leader Sharad Pawar at election rallies in Sangli and Kolhapur, considered party strongholds. Mr. Modi said, “You [Mr. Pawar] talk about Chhatrapati Shivaji. But who linked Mumbai airport with the name of Shivaji? It was Atalji’s [former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s] government. Why didn’t you ever think of it?”
The opposition parties have accused the BJP of trying to hijack the image of the Maratha warrior and an icon of Maharashtra for political gains. In a bid to silence the critics, Mr. Modi asked them to “stop challenging his ‘Shiv bhakti.’” “It is in our blood,” he said at Tasgaon in Sangli.
Stepping up his attack on Mr. Pawar, Mr. Modi said he had built a bigger statue of Shivaji in Surat (Gujarat) than what the NCP chief built in his home turf of Baramati.
Mr. Modi taunted Mr. Pawar for failing to address the water woes of the State, though he held the portfolio of Agriculture Minister.
“I know there is no possibility that you will imbibe the qualities of Shivaji. But as a CM or Agriculture Minister, you could have at least taken inspiration from Shivaji and provided water facilities to the people,” Mr. Modi said.
Mr. Modi maintained that alliance governments were at the heart of the State’s troubles. He appealed to voters to give his party a full mandate to ensure development.
“There is nobody to take responsibility [in an alliance]. The BJP will take responsibility. You give a full majority government, we will give you development and an account of our work. We won’t run away like the Congress,” he said.
Mr. Modi addressed the problems of the sugar industry, an important issue in the region. The politics of the NCP is closely linked to the sugar cooperatives. Under the Congress-NCP rule, sugar mills had turned into “workshops of politics,” while the farmers were left to die, Mr. Modi said.
Mr. Modi blamed the previous Congress governments, of which Mr. Pawar was a part, for stalling the Narmada project, which would provide “free electricity worth Rs. 4,000 crore to Maharashtra each year.”
Addressing the rally in Kolhapur, Mr. Modi attacked the Congress saying the party had discarded Mahatma Gandhi and the only “Gandhiji” they liked was the one embossed on currency notes.

Neha Dhupia slams Yesudas remarks against girls wearingjeansPress Trust of India | Indore | Posted: October 6, 2014 8:33 am
Bollywood actress Neha Dhupia condemned the remarks of veteran singer K J Yesudas against girls wearing jeans, saying such a “flawed” thinking regarding women’s apparel needs to be rectified.
“This is very unfortunate that women are being asked what to wear and what not, even as our country is moving forward. I feel that the flaw does not lie in the ensemble of women but in the minds of those who make such remarks. I think this thinking towards what half of our total population is wearing needs to be corrected,” Neha told reporters in response to a query regarding the singer’s remarks.
Neha was here for promotion of her upcoming film, ’21 Topon ki Salami’ directed by Ravindra Gautam. The film, also starring Anupam Kher, Divyendu Sharma and other star cast, is slated for release on October 10.
“It is challenging to bring yourself to the notice of the audience as an actress in a multi-cast film. I feel bored when am asked to act in a film wherein hero and heroine are the only lead characters,” she said.
Responding to a query, Neha said she would like to work in any biopic which is based on a true story.

Bakri Id
NEW DELHI: Indian stock market will remain shut on Monday, 6th October on account of public holiday. The BSE, NSE will remain closed for " Bakri Id ".
However, Asian markets were trading higher tracking gains on Wall Street which rose following a stronger-than-expected September U.S. jobs report that bolstered the outlook for the U.S. economy.
"The U.S. Labor Department reported nonfarm payrolls rose 248,000 in September, 33,000 more than median forecast while the jobless rate fell two-tenths of a point to a six-year low of 5.9 percent," Reuters reported.
Tokyo's Nikkei jumped nearly 1 per cent in early trade while South Korean shares rose 0.3 percent after a market holiday on Friday. Hang Seng was trading 0.4 per cent higher.
Back home, Nifty ended the day with a loss of 19 points at 7945 after a range bound session. The BSE Sensex closed 62 points lower at 26567.99 on Wednesday.
Immediate support for Nifty continues to remain at 7920 and if the index manages to respect 7920 as a support and clear the resistance of 8040 as well then we may see further upside till 8090, say analysts.
Markets will closely track data for India's services sector, IIP number and quarterly earnings from IT major Infosys in a holiday-shortened week ahead, say experts.
Important set of data and events are lined in the coming week. To begin with, HSBC Services PMI for August 2014 is due on Tuesday, 7 October 2014. Going ahead, the government will unveil industrial production data for August 2014 on Friday, 10 October 2014.
And lastly, the earning season will also begin from Friday, 10 October 2014 with IT major, Infosys ltd, announcing its Q2 numbers.
"Broadly, the CNX Nifty index has been trading within 7850-8050 for last six trading sessions and either side decisive break will trigger the next directional move," said Jayant Manglik, President-retail distribution, Religare Securities Limited.
"Meanwhile, traders should maintain extra caution and prefer defensive sectors like Pharma, FMCG for short term positions," he added.
Manglik is of the view that investors', on the other hand, should now focus more on stock specific approach before the beginning of earning season and adjust their portfolios accordingly.

What’s stopping you from getting rich? Not bad luck, but faulty investing strategies

(If you really want to get…)
You are a diligent saver, a careful investor and a meticulous planner. Yet, you have not been able to build wealth even as everyone around you seems to be wallowing in money. What's stopping you from getting rich? If it's bad luck, you can buy one of those good fortune charms hawked on late night TV shows. But if you really want to get to the root of the problem, you need to assess where you are going wrong in your investments.
Our cover story this week is about the money myths and investing flaws that prevent you from getting rich. It could be the lure of penny stocks or the tantalising potential of the futures and options segment. Small investors often lose their shirts (and nearly everything else) when they enter these high-risk arenas without adequate knowledge.
But mistakes can happen even if you play ultra safe. If a fixed deposit offers 9%, the post-tax returns for someone in the 30% tax bracket will be barely 6.3%. That's not too bad until you factor in 8% inflation. So even though the investor does not feel it, his money is losing value. This is one of the biggest investing mistakes Indians make when they pour money into fixed deposits. In the following pages, we have listed the common hurdles that prevent investors from getting rich.
Many of these hurdles are really self made. They can be done away with by changing your approach to investing. Gold, for instance, should not occupy more than 5-10% allocation in your portfolio. This can happen if you treat the yellow metal less as an investment and more as a hedging tool.
There's no point in dwelling on mistakes unless we can offer a solution. So, each financial mistake has been followed by advice on how to avoid it. This stress on utility has been ET Wealth's hallmark since the time it was launched. In this 200th issue of the newspaper, we hope to live up to the expectations of our readers.

5 dead  25 injured in major ceasefire violation by Pakistan along Jammu borderPakistan continues to violate ceasefire, kills 5 civilians
Tarun Upadhyay , Hindustan Times  Jammu/New Delhi, October 06, 2014
First Published: 07:50 IST(6/10/2014) | Last Updated: 09:27 IST(7/10/2014)

The Indian government hardened its stance and asked the Border Security Force (BSF) to “retaliate with full force” after five civilians were killed and 29 wounded in firing by Pakistani forces along the border in Jammu on Monday, official sources said.
 
Tensions flared after four Pakistani civilians, including two children and a woman, were killed in retaliatory firing by India as home minister Rajnath Singh and defence minister Arun Jaitley warned Pakistan to stop such attacks if it wanted peace talks with India.
 
“Ceasefire violation must stop. Pakistan must realise that a decisive government has come to power, which will not take such instances lying down,” Singh told HT in an interview.

India and Pakistan exchanged fire in Arnia and RS Pura sectors late on Monday, the heaviest firing between the two countries since India called off bilateral talks last month. Jaitley said the repeated ceasefire violations would not help normalise relations between the two countries and Indian armed forces were responding to all provocations from across the border.
 
"This is resulting in a series of ceasefire violations as a result of which innocent civilians have lost their lives. Pakistan must realise that the kind of environment it is generating between the two countries is certainly not going to help in normalising relations. The onus of creating a positive environment is on Pakistan which is utterly failing to do so," Jaitley said.

A senior government official told HT on condition of anonymity that border agencies, mainly the BSF and the army, had received instructions to not just match mortar for mortar but “outnumber the number of mortars in retaliation”.
 
“There is no hesitation to our response now. If Pakistan fires five mortars, we can retaliate with 10,” he said.
 
The violence puts more strain on already-tense ties between India and Pakistan after New Delhi called off planned foreign secretary-level talks following the Pakistani ambassador’s meeting with Kashmiri separatist leaders last month.
 
Worst affected by the Pakistani firing in India was Mashain-de-kothe village, where four members of a family were killed. Mortars also landed at Arnia town, about three km from the International Border (IB), forcing thousands of people to flee their homes.
 
“When firing started we thought it would be another routine thing. But when heavy mortars started pounding our homes and heard cries, it was our worst nightmare,” said Soma Devi, a relative of the family that lost four members to the firing.
 
BSF sources said India will not have a flag meeting after the firing which began late last Thursday in a bid to disrupt Dussehra celebrations. Media reports said three militants were killed as the army foiled an infiltration bid along the Line of Control in Tangdhar sector.
 
The Pakistani ministry of foreign affairs issued a statement condemning what it described as India’s “unprovoked firing”.
 
“The government of Pakistan has lodged a strong protest with the government of India through diplomatic channels and called for restraining its forces from constant violation of the ceasefire," it said in the statement.
 
With tension prevailing on the border, the traditional exchange of sweets between Indian and Pakistani troops at the Attari border in Punjab on Eid was called off. However, sweets were exchanged at Chakan-da-bagh area in Poonch.

Bullion sinks to lowest in 15 months on robu...Bullion sinks to lowest in 15 months on robust US data

Gold has also failed to capitalise on geopolitical tensions caused by military conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the rise of Islamic State, which has declared a cross-border caliphate in Iraq and Syria.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
SINGAPORE: Gold tumbled to its lowest level in around 15 months on Monday after better-than-expected US jobs data boosted the dollar, dampening safe-haven appetite for bullion and pushing silver and platinum to multi-year lows.
Gold, which often influences other precious metals, has also failed to capitalise on geopolitical tensions caused by military conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the rise of Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.
By 0641 GMT, cash gold was little changed at $1,191.30 an ounce after earlier falling to $1,183.46 an ounce, its weakest since June 2013.
Platinum touched its lowest since 2009, silver fell to its weakest since 2010, and palladium hit an 8-month low.
"A strong dollar is a major problem for gold. Sentiment is very bearish but I think we expect some kind of rebound," said Ronald Leung, chief dealer at Lee Cheong Gold Dealers in Hong Kong, who pegged support at $1,180 an ounce.
"There's a little bit of physical buying, but premiums haven't changed. We have to see what happens later in the day. If demand is coming, of course, it will push up the premiums."
Premiums for gold were quoted at $1.20 to $1.60 an ounce to the spot London prices, unchanged from last week, despite a sharp drop in cash gold prices.
The absence of main gold consumer China is weighing on the physical market, which usually sees a pick up in demand from jewellers and retail investors when prices fall.
Chinese markets have been shut for national holidays and will reopen on Wednesday.
US gold was $1,191.70 an ounce, down 0.10 per cent.
The dollar held on Monday near a more than four-year high, touched after last week's upbeat US nonfarm payrolls report increased speculation that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates in mid-2015 or earlier.
Data from the Labor Department on Friday showed US non-farm payrolls rose 248,000 last month and the jobless rate fell to 5.9 per cent, the lowest since July 2008, underscoring that the US economy continues to improve.
In Tokyo, sellers pushed up premiums for gold bars to 25 cents to spot London prices from zero last week to offset the decline in global prices.
"At this moment, demand is not good. But maybe when the holiday in China is over, the premiums may go up further," said a dealer in Tokyo.
Markets in Singapore, a key bullion trading centre in Southeast Asia, were also closed for a public holiday.

Why Indian airlines are zooming in on smaller citiesIndian airlines target smaller cities as main routes' margins contract
Reuters | New Delhi Oct 07, 2014 12:43 AM IST
The airport in Patna, one of India's smaller cities and the capital of its poorest state, Bihar, is so crowded that government authorities this year said they need to build another one.
The airport has seen the number of passengers and daily flights double in four years as the country's largest carrier IndiGo Airlines and smaller rivals like GoAir seek to cash on a surge in demand for air travel from smaller regions, to offset losses on highly competitive "trunk" routes linking big cities.
"We are close to capacity in our arrivals and departure lounges," said Santosh Kumar, who runs operations at Patna airport. "We can handle more planes but it is only possible with a bigger terminal. We need a bigger airport."
Higher disposable incomes, an expanding middle class and rapid urbanisation have made India one of the world's fastest growing domestic aviation markets, where passenger numbers are expected to grow by 75 per cent in the next six years, to exceed 217 million.
Much of that growth is expected to come from smaller cities like Patna, where more people are flying for the first time. Passenger numbers from these places have risen nearly 17 per cent a year since 2009, compared to 7.6 per cent from larger hubs, the data from the Asia-Pacific Centre for Aviation show.
That trend is set to continue as more airports are built in smaller cities. This month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government picked five smaller cities to kick off a nationwide initiative to build about 50 new airports.
"The opportunity is changing," said Aditya Ghosh, president of IndiGo, which now flies larger Airbus A320 planes to and from Patna, instead of smaller ATR jets. "On some of these smaller routes, the planes are more full than the trunk routes."
Fifth largest carrier GoAir has also boosted flights to and from Patna and other smaller cities, Chief Executive Giorgio de Roni said, as these regional routes now make more money than the more congested routes between Mumbai and Delhi.
State carrier Air India's regional unit is also looking at increasing its fleet to tap a larger share of this market, industry officials said. Air India did not respond to requests for comments.
While more established carriers see regional travel as a way to counter the razor-thin margins and losses on big city routes, a crop of new airlines are catering only to regional demand.
Zav Airways plans to start flying within the northeast in 2015, when Air Carnival also aims to fly within the south, according to CAPA.
Air Costa began flying within southern India last October and this year, it agreed to buy 50 jets from Embraer SA, in the biggest aircraft deal for an Indian regional carrier so far this year.
Chief Financial Officer Vivek Choudhary said Air Costa was bracing for competition. "But we are capitalising on the first-mover advantage," he added.
For now, demand for regional travel outstrips supply, making the sector attractive for airlines. Air travel penetration in India remains small in global terms, with 0.04 annual trips per capita against 0.3 in China and more than two in the US.
Industry analysts, however, warn that as more carriers pile into the sector, fares will fall and airlines will face the same pressure on yields as they do now on big city routes.
 
"There is huge latent demand in some of these smaller cities," said Dhiraj Mathur, an executive director at PwC India who focuses on aerospace and defence. "But there's always a danger from increased competition."

Indo-Asian News Service | Mumbai | Posted: October 6, 2014 9:50 am
Actress Jacqueline Fernandez is blessed with flawless skin and she gives credit to home remedies especially curd and honey.
“When it comes to my skin, I experiment with a lot of home remedies. I often use dahi (curd) and honey in a pack to cool and soothe my face,” the former beauty queen told IANS during her recent visit to the capital.
“I also use ice packs for my face and eyes. I wrap ice cubes in thin muslin or tissue and then place them gently on cheeks and eyes,” she added.
Jacqueline, who is also the brand ambassador of The Body Shop, was here to unveil the festive collection of Britain’s retail house and give scholarship to 10 NGO kids on behalf of the brand.
Giving an insight to her perfect body, she said: “Take care of yourself by eating right, sleeping right and exercising regularly! These are the only rules I swear by. If you follow this religiously and use the right products, your skin and hair will thank you.”
“I am very particular about cleansing. I believe in clean skin and using a good cleanser, toner and moisturiser,” added the actress who was recently seen in Salman Khan-starrer “Kick”.
Her future projects include “Roy” with Ranbir Kapoor.

J&K: 5 killed as Pakistan shells Arnia sectors mainbazaarA villager shows mortar shells allegedly fired from the Pakistan side in Chanana village at the India-Pakistan International border at Arnia sector in Jammu and Kashmir on Saturday. (Source: PTI)
Written by Arun Sharma | Jammu | Posted: October 6, 2014 8:53 am | Updated: October 6, 2014 11:50 am
Five people were killed and nearly 50 others injured in Pakistani shelling in Arnia sector along the International Border near Jammu during early hours of Monday.
Sources said that four people died at the main bazaar in Arnia town itself when over a dozen mortar shells from across the border exploded around 3 am. It has been for the first time since 2003 that Pakistani shells have fallen in Arnia bazaar.
After a night long, unprovoked mortar shelling on civilian areas along the international border in Arnia sector, the Pakistani troops started targeting forward Indian positions along the Line of Control in Bhimber Gali (BG) area of Rajouri district on Monday.
Giving details, sources said that Pakistani troops started firing automatic weapons and mortars on the Indian side around 8.30 am. The Indian troops were retaliating and the exchange of fire between two sides was continuing till  reports last came in.

The Pakistani Rangers had been resorting to unprovoked mortar shelling and small arms fire along the international border since October 3. After a lull in of nearly a month, the Pakistani Rangers stepped up shelling during early hours of Monday around 12.30 am causing panic among the villagers. Apart from Arnia town, the villages most hit by shelling included Trewa, Suhagpur and Devigarh.
Border Security Force officials here said that Pakistani Rangers targeted ten BSF border outposts, besides civilian population with heavy mortar shelling and small arms fire in Arnia sector late last night. Pointing out that five civilians were killed and nearly 50 others injured in Pakistani shelling, they said that BSF also gave a befitting and calibrated reply to the Rangers. The loss in Pakistan territory is yet to be ascertained, they said, adding that the firing was continuing till reports last came in.
Giving details, sources said that the Pakistani guns had fallen silent after nearly half an hour long firing on the Indian side on Saturday night. Suddenly, they resumed mortar shelling at around 12.30 am forcing people in villages near the border to flee from their houses.

The shelling was so intense that people even in Arnia town came out of their houses and gathered in the main bazaar out of panic. Around 3 am, shells exploded in the bazaar killing five and injuring many others. The victims were rushed to the hospital, but one of them succumbed to injuries on the way.
Ever since US President Barack Obama and Prime Minister Narendra Modi committed to jointly fight terrorism, Pakistani troops and Rangers have continued…

Doordardshan to be beamed in Europe & Middle...You are here: Home > Collections
Doordarshan to telecast programmes in Europe, Middle East; broadcast TV on cellphones
Vasudha Venugopal, ET Bureau Oct 6, 2014, 02.31AM IST
NEW DELHI: Doordarshan might be in the limelight for its controversial decision to telecast live RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat's Vijaya Dashami address, but life for the national broadcaster is only set to become more exciting with the Narendra Modi government's increasing emphasis on state run media.
For starters, the broadcaster's 30-year-old dream of going global may finally come true in January next year when it will be beamed free of cost to 120 million homes East, say I&B ministry officials. After the Maharashtra polls, I&B Minister Prakash Javadekar will hold the first inter-ministerial meeting of secretaries of ministries of external affairs, information and broadcasting, tourism, culture, and home affairs to finalise the content to be delivered to these countries.
Prasar Bharati CEO Jawhar Sircar told ETthat the meeting is likely to set a deadline and chalk out a consultative group for the project. "We need to finalise right content to project a new, dynamic India," he said.
Pact with German Broadcaster
The new aspirations of India have to be portrayed in a manner that European and Middle Eastern audiences would appreciate and understand. Expert advice of ambassadors who have worked in these countries would be useful, as would be those of TV professionals who have foreign experience," he said.
DD has also revived a project of digitisation of archaic terrestrial transmitters, and if things go as planned, viewers in 10 cities across the country would be able to watch the 20 channels of DD and private channels streamed by Prasar Bharati on mobile smartphones, tablets or laptops for free in a few months. I&B officials said the plan to go international acquired a fresh life after Prasar Bharti signed an agreement with German public service broadcaster Deutsche Welle to distribute DD's international channel abroad, and things have been moving at a fast pace ever since.
The first time DD opened its window to the world was in March 1995 when it launched its international channel DD World, which was renamed DD India in 2002. While it was promised that Indian cultural and social programmes up-linked from New Delhi could be watched in 38 countries across the world through INSAT-4B and INSAT-3A satellites, the project did not work out as planned. "All these years the programmes were only pumped up from here but not downlinked in these countries, so they could never reach people there.
No down-linker was available to take the feed to TV homes in these countries. Indian embassies could not do much as there were marketing and budgetary constraints as also a lack of expertise in media marketing," an official said.
Hundreds of crores were spent on this exercise that did not yield any result, recall DD old-timers. In 2013, when the UPA government wanted full services for international broadcast, a project with an estimate ofRs 3,000 crore a year was proposed by DD but it was not considered mostly due to financial reasons. International public broadcasters such as BBC or those in China, Japan or France are known to spend over Rs 4,000 crore a year on channels to project their nations in foreign countries.
"So we looked for an economic partnership with a foreign public broadcaster that could offer us easy direct access to TV homes. Germany's Deutsche Welle agreed and vacated a slot on the popular Euro Hotbird satellite and we gave them one in India. This will be DD's first-ever presence in the west as the new government gave us a go-ahead," said a senior official. DD now will get the platform of Hotbird-13B, a DTH medium which reaches Europe, Northern Africa and the whole of Middle East with 1,543 TV channels, of which 1,117 are free-toair.
"The present government has shown much interest in utilising the potential of DD that reaches 170 million TV households directly. We are seriously looking at gaining back lost viewership with distinctive, highquality programmes and interesting content, leveraging our infrastructure, access and rich archives," said another official in the I&B ministry.

90% of coal-bearing forests could be mined: FSI90% of coal-bearing forests could be mined, says Forest Survey of India
Urmi Goswami, ET Bureau Oct 6, 2014, 04.00AM IST
(The FSI has, at the request…)
NEW DELHI: Nearly 90% of coal bearing forest areas could be opened up for mining, with the Forest Survey of India (FSI), the government's top body for assessing and monitoring forests, recommending that mining be barred in just 11% of forest areas with proven reserves of the dry fuel.
The recommendation, if accepted, would increase domestic coal production, and could bring down imports. Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar is expected to make a decision soon. The FSI has, at the request of the environment ministry, conducted an assessment to determine how much of the forests should be kept out of bounds of mining activities.
Indications are that only those forests that are extremely rich in biodiversity and cannot be regenerated by human efforts will be classified as inviolate or out of bounds for mining. "Mining will not be allowed in national sanctuaries and parks and wildlife reserves," an official explained. This is a significant reduction from the 29% forest area that had been demarcated as out of bounds for coal mining.
Activists critical of committee's recommendations
This was done as part of the "no-go/go" exercise undertaken jointly by the Central Mine Planning & Design Institute, a subsidiary of Coal India, and the environment ministry in 2010. That classification of coal-bearing forest areas had been undertaken across the coal fields of Talcher, Ib Valley, Singrauli, Mandiraigarh, Wardha, Sohagpur, North Karanpura, West Bokaro and Hasdeo Arand. That analysis used forest density and cover as parameters for determining areas to be kept out of bounds, and adjusting the results by adopting a cluster approach for coal blocks, and reworking coal block boundaries.
Mining was to be permitted in 4,62,939 hectares of the 6,48,750 hectares of coal-bearing forests that were assessed. "India can't afford to keep 30% of its coal-bearing forests out of bounds. We need to increase power generation, don't forget that there are as many as 400 million people who have no access to electricity and power is crucial for industrial growth. As of now coal is the mainstay of the country's energy basket," a senior official said, explaining the need to open larger areas for coal mining.
The ministry, which is still considering the FSI's assessment, argues that it is not an indiscriminate exercise to open up more areas for coal mining. "The no-go/go exercise mapped forest areas and coal blocks, evaluating the areas in terms of density of forest cover, area of the coal block under forest cover or gross forest cover and weighted forest cover (classifying the forests as very dense, moderately dense and open forests).
The current assessment takes into considerations parameters such as wildlife, forest cover, forest type, and landscape," a senior official argued. The most recent exercise by the FSI is a dilution of the recommendations of the 2012 committee headed by then environment secretary Tishyarakshit Chatterjee, which was asked to formulate objective parameters for identification of inviolate forest areas. The committee had used six indicators - forest type, biological richness, wildlife value, density of forest cover, integrity of landscape and hydrological value — to decide on forest areas where mining will not be permitted. Its report, submitted in July 2012, didn't find favour with ministries like coal, which feared that large swathes of forests would be kept out of bounds for mining.
The new NDA government, which reviewed the committee's recommendation, decided to revisit the assessments after objections were raised by the coal ministry. It decided to reduce the number of parameters for determining "inviolate" forests from six to four — wildlife value, forest cover, forest type, and integrity of landscape. Officials argued that biological richness is accounted for under wildlife value, and hydrological value under forest cover.
Activists have been critical of the Chatterjee committee's recommendations arguing that its parameters were narrow as it didn't take into account the loss of livelihoods and homes for large populations who are dependent on forests. They argue that the FSI assessment is flawed as well.
"The environment ministry is looking at the big picture, now we hope that the coal ministry will also address issues like their poor reforestation record, adhering to conditions laid out in the environmental and forest clearances, use better technology to disrupt smaller patches of forest," a government official said. Some experts argue that increasing the forest area where mining could be allowed is unlikely to make a major dent in India's coal imports.
According to the International Energy Agency, in 2013 India was a net importer of 178 million tonnes of coal. Domestic output accounted for 613 million tonnes, or 7.8% of global coal production. An increase in domestic coal production is unlikely to do away with imports. A crucial reason for this is that domestic coal is high in ash content, and is often not favoured by power plants using supercritical technologies.

Thanks Prashant: Mukherjee said the price quoted by the three bidders were below IFCI`s expectations and hence the non-binding offers were turned down. So, the offers made by were indicative only and that too below IFCI`s expectation. I think IFCI is looking around for plus 15% over IDFC selling price of 4200. If it sells for Rs 4200 (highly unlikely), the top boss will have to do a lot of explaination. Hence the rejection. Just for info, Rs 68 was last year`s dividend per NSE share.

Pharmacy sales help Walgreen Co. 'be well' in September.
Walgreen Co. reported a September sales increase of 9.4 percent to $6.48 billion compared with the same month last year, boosted largely by an increase in its pharmacy sales and prescriptions filled.
 
Shares of Walgreen, the largest U.S. drugstore operator, were up 2.3 percent to $61.12 in midmorning trading.
 
Sales at Walgreen stores open at least a year rose 1.7 percent and prescriptions filled, adjusted for calendar day differences, were up 3.9 percent. Pharmacy sales were up 11.3 percent at these stores.
 
Deerfield-based Walgreen has also administered 2.1 million flu shots so far this season, 200,000 more flu shots so far this season compared with the same period last year.
 
Walgreen on Tuesday reported a fourth-quarter loss because of an $866 million accounting charge from its decision to acquire ahead of schedule the remaining 55 percent of European counterpart Alliance Boots GmbH. The $15.3 billion deal should close early next year. Without the charge, though, analysts said reported earnings were no surprise.
 
Walgreen executives decided to expand globally for the first time in 2012, when it bought a 45 percent stake in Alliance Boots. The new holding company Walgreens Boots Alliance will be incorporated in Delaware and will help the company grow from about 8,300 stores in the U.S. to 12,400 in 14 countries.
 
A few years ago, Walgreen introduced a Balance Rewards loyalty program and on Thursday announced a partnership with health information company WebMD to award customers with points for exercise. The company plans to continue strategic partnerships with digital-focused companies, Walgreen officials have said.

Jeffrey P. Bezos, chief executive officer of Amazon.com , Friday met Prime Minister Narendra Modi, an official statement said.
Bezos, who is in India for a visit, had earlier termed India an amazing country, which is full of opportunities and boasts of people who are hard-working, vibrant and have a zest to succeed.
Amazon has high expectations from its Indian operations, he noted.
"People feel that we are in India for the last one year.. we started a software development office in Bangalore 10 years ago. In the last one year the local team is doing shockingly, stunningly well. We are open for a year and we have very high expectations," he said in a conversation with former Nasscom president Kiran Karnik at an event organised by the Federation of Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
The US-based Amazon recently said it was investing $2 billion in India's e-commerce space. With 243 million Internet users, India's e-commerce industry is growing at 38 percent year-on-year.
"With this additional investment of $2 billion, Amazon team can continue to think big, innovate and raise the bar for customers in India. At current scale and growth rates, India is on track to be our fastest country ever to a billion dollars in gross sales," said Bezos.
"What is stunning about India is the speed at which it is growing and that is one of the tailwinds for the growth of e-commerce," he said, adding that "India is unbelievably energising; the people are focused on learning and extremely inventive."

Raina reveals the secret of his successTweet
0
It has been a four-year long wait for Chennai Super Kings since they won their first Champions League title in 2010. Contrary to their reputation of being regular finalists, it was a rather bleak period for them as they failed to make it to the final even once. So it was a relief for MS Dhoni and his team-mates that they were able to break a worrying trend. Pawan Negi, playing only his second game of the tournament, starred with a five-wicket haul before Suresh Raina controlled the chase with a clinical century,
The spoils of victory. (IANS)"I am so happy we delivered in a crucial situation, especially Pawan Negi bowled well and they were 20 runs short, but I and Baz [ Brendon McCullum ] had a good partnership and finished off," Raina said. "I was looking to be positive in the first six overs. I know they had Piyush and Kuldeep and Yusuf - I have played a lot against them before. I knew if I get to a fifty I have to make sure to stay till the last over because if one wicket fell, the pressure would have come to the next batsman. "
Raina had played a similar innings - a 25-ball 87 - in a tough chase against Kings XI Punjab during the knockout stage of the IPL this year, but his run-out robbed the team of momentum and Super Kings lost the match by 24 runs. Dhoni said that even though Super Kings were floundering in the knockouts, their were learnings from all those losses.
"What's important is to get to the knockouts. After that you may win games, you may lose games," Dhoni said. "We have made eight finals, won four, I won't say it is bad. We made quite a few errors in the last two finals, so what we took out of those finals was really important.
"Raina did that in this game. In the last semi-final we played, he started well but was run-out and we were not able to chase the runs. Today he was aggressive throughout and calculative. Raina's batting was fantastic because we needed someone to be there till the end and he is someone who plays spin really well."
Dhoni added that the toss was crucial as dew was expected to be a factor later in the day. "We thought there would be dew later and because the start was an hour early, we thought our spinners could still get a bit of help," he said. "It was slightly difficult for the opposition bowlers. But I think we didn't start well. Our fielding was not up to the mark. In finals, you have to take the game to the next level. It's not about the bowling, we made too many misfields."
GOOD OPENING STAND
Those misfields meant that Kolkata Knight Riders were off to a good start with Robin Uthappa and Gautam Gambhir adding 91 for the first wicket. Gambhir maintained an aggressive stance throughout his innings and did not let the more established Super Kings spinners settle. The counter-punch, however, came from an unexpected quarter. Negi, the left-arm spinner, reaped the rewards of tossing the ball on a helpful pitch and returned a five-wicket haul that was crucial in limiting the Knight Riders score to 180.
"Negi is not afraid to toss the ball," Dhoni said. "That was quite crucial because if there is dew and you keep bowling flat, you do not get much purchase out of the wicket. I was happy that he was still looking to flight the ball. Gambhir batted well for them. Because of him, our left-arm spinners were not able to contain them but once he got out, we were able to put pressure on other right-hand batsmen."
In the absence of Sunil Narine , all eyes had been on the young chinaman bowler Kuldeep Yadav, who had also been named in the India squad for the one-dayers against West Indies. Although, he was dismantled by Raina in his spell, Dhoni had encouraging words to say about him.
"Kuldeep was fantastic," Dhoni said. "He is a bowler who is not afraid to toss the ball, he has got variations. He bowled really well throughout the tournament. Also, this time of the year, more often than not you get a bit of dew, which makes it difficult for the spinners. It gives them the kind of experience they need once they graduate to the next level. At the same time, they share dressing room with legends of the game. It's crucial they learn a lot out of them. You don't get opportunities like this."

How Paper Boat is making waves in soft drinks marketHow Hector Beverages' Paper Boat is making waves in a cluttered soft drinks market
Rajiv Singh, ET Bureau Oct 5, 2014, 05.57AM IST
Tags:
James Nuttall
(Paper Boat started with…)
What happens when friends start sailing in a ship? "The ship turns into a boat called friendship," says Neeraj Kakkar, CEO of Hector Beverages, the makers of energy drink Tzinga and traditional beverage brand Paper Boat.
In April 2011, four friends — Neeraj Kakkar, Suhas Misra, Neeraj Biyani and James Nuttall — decided to take the bull by the horns. Hector Beverages, their Gurgaon-based startup, rolled out Tzinga in Delhi and Bangalore for Rs 20 per 200-ml pack — almost one-fifth of the cost of the biggest energy drink brand in the market, Red Bull (Rs 95). It hit bull's eye, well, sort of.
In a short span, Tzinga became the second-largest energy drink brand in the country. "It's the largest brand in Bangalore and the north east. But overall Red Bull is far, far ahead of us," acknowledges Kakkar.
With the bull yet to be tamed, distribution cost of Tzinga kept increasing. Limited variants of the energy drink meant the company could not optimize the distribution cost to the fullest and breakeven looked a remote possibility.
"So we needed more production options," recalls Kakkar. The friends started brainstorming. Kakkar and Nuttall, who studied together at Wharton Business School, UPenn, hit upon an idea of a version of vitamin water or another energy drink. "We wanted to copy what was successful in America," adds 39-year-old Kakkar.
The idea didn't materialize. But on one hot summer day, when all of them were having lunch together, Nuttall decided to make aam panna. "Misra used to get aam panna made by his mother, and it was terrific. That was the genesis of Paper Boat," says Kakkar.
Paper Boat has had a dream run over the past seven months. With over 1.5 million packs going off the shelves every month, it is selling more than Tzinga. To meet demand, Hector is setting up a plant in Mysore. While the current facility in Manesar produces 80 bottles per minute, the Mysore plant will turn out 220 bottles per minute from March 2015.
  Setting Sail
Paper Boat started with two variants in August 2013: aam panna and jaljeera; these were followed by aamras, kalakhatta, kokum, golgappe ka pani and imli. Another five variants will be launched next month and five more will occupy the shelves early next year. Kakkar and his team have mapped the traditional beverages of all states and plan to roll out a lot more variants after firmly establishing at least 25.
Aam panna and jaljeera sound logical. But golgappe ka pani? "There is a story behind it," says Kakkar, adding that there is little in common between his mother and wife. "The only common trait is they have golgappas at a stall and both have a plea: 'bhaiya thoda aur pani dena'," he says bursting into laughter.
"This is phenomenal — how two women who have nothing much in common behave in such a similar manner!" Are there more stories? Indeed, there are. "Paper Boat is all about stories and memories," says Kakkar, who quit his job at Coca-Cola when he was 33 and went abroad to pursue an MBA.
His father was quite upset and Kakkar's in-laws thought their daughter's future was doomed. "My father didn't speak to me for about a year," he says.
It was only when Kakkar showed his father a picture along with Infosys co-founder NR Narayana Murthy that he started talking. In March 2011, Murthy's venture capital firm Catamaran and Bangalore-based Footprint Ventures invested Rs 6 crore in Hector Beverages.
Josh Bornstein, managing partner at Footprint Ventures, was completely sold on Hector and was convinced that Kakkar and his friends were on the right path with Tzinga.
"We knew India would be more interested in a fortified functional drink than carbonated stuff," he says. "And how many people make aam panna at home," he asks, adding there is a huge pent-up demand for ethnic beverages.
The Right Anchor
VT Bharadwaj, managing director at Sequoia Capital, found the idea of traditional drinks so captivating that he wanted to become a part of the Paper Boat story. Hector raised $8 million in a second round of funding in May 2013 from Sequoia. The existing investors also took part in the funding.
"I said OMG when I heard their Paper Boat plan," recalls Bharadwaj. "We have had ample examples of regional food but nobody ever thought of drinks which could make waves in the beverage market."
According to industry estimates, the fortified functional drink market (non-carbonated) is set to touch Rs 1,080 crore next year. Though it is still roughly just a tenth of the Rs 10,000 crore carbonated soft drinks market, analysts say the speed at which people are moving towards healthier beverage options augurs well for Paper Boat.

MOUNTAIN VIEW, CALIFORNIA: Sam Altman, president of Y Combinator (YC), known as a boot camp for startups, was chosen to head the famed Silicon Valley accelerator by founder & entrepreneur Paul Graham earlier this year. Graham, while anointing his successor, wrote in a blog post that Sam is what YC needs at this stage in its evolution. Altman co-founded Loopt, a location-based social networking mobile app, which was part of the first YC startup class in 2005, and had been a part-time YC partner since 2011. YC's portfolio companies have a combined valuation of over $30 billion with the likes of Dropbox, Airbnb, Reddit, among others, using the accelerator as a launch pad. Altman told TOI that YC was making efforts to actively engage with founders beyond the Valley and India is one such market. Excerpts from an interview...
Starting this fall, you'll be teaching a class at Stanford on how to start up, which will be available online. What's the reason for doing this now?
We want this information to be accessible to anyone in the world, so the classes will be available online for anyone to watch for free. We'll talk about how to come up with ideas and evaluate them, how to get users and grow, how to do sales and marketing, how to hire, how to raise money, company culture, operations and management, business strategy, and more. You can't teach everything necessary to succeed in starting a company, but I suspect we can teach a surprising amount. We're doing this because we believe helping a lot of people be better at starting companies will be good for everyone.
How's YC different from other startup accelerators?
YC pioneered the accelerator model. Twice a year, we invest a small amount of money ($120,000) in a large number of startups (most recently 68).The startups move to Silicon Valley for three months, during which we work intensively with them to get the company into the best possible shape and refine their pitch to investors. We have almost 1,500 alumni - many of them very successful - and within that group there are experts in just about every domain. On top of getting access to advice from the partners, YC startups also have a vast support system of founders who act as mentors to each other.
YC funded ClearTax this summer, which is catering to the Indian market. What's the interest around startups coming out of India from investors here?
We've so far funded four Indian startups - HackerRank, TapToLearn, Plivo and ClearTax. The important thing to note here is that investors are interested in companies that are making things for the Indian market. The other companies we've funded which had Indian founders were making products for the global market. We had 12 founders in Summer 2014 batch who reported that India was their country of origin.

PUNE: Meru Cabs' Gupta offers training module for better driving experience
A Mumbai-based startup started a new driving course which offers training in safe driving techniques both to first time drivers as well as licence holders.
The training module, offered by Motor Education and Training Academy (META), was started by Meru Cabs founder Neeraj Gupta and includes skills ranging from defensive driving, driving in different climates and a thorough training on road safety and rules.
"We wanted to change the experience of driving on Indian roads. The standard learning we have today regarding car driving is `ghumana and dhabana'. We wanted both first timers and trained drivers to undergo formal training based on international standards followed in the US, Australia and Europe," said Gopal Mani , CEO at META. Mani is also an equity partner in the venture.
"In India, about 42,000 youth aged between 15 and 24 are killed annually due to road accidents and 77per cent of these are due to driving error, as per WHO statistics," Mani said. More than 15,000 drivers from 10 states have undergone skill certification programme from META for the National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) in the last six months. "Besides training these drivers, we also help them get placed by partnering them with corporate companies and big hotels that are looking for responsible drivers," said Mani. Prabhat Pande, a driver with Meru Cabs, who took this course said, "Though I have been driving for many years now, I found their upgrading course illuminating as I am better aware of driving emergencies that can crop up, how to tackle them, basic road safety and also customer services."
META charges Rs 4,000 to Rs 5,000 for the course for regular customers and Rs 7,000 to Rs 8,000 for driver courses.
META operates in 10 states through its own offices and partnerships with driving schools. "We started off with a revenue of Rs 30 lakh in 2012-13 and Rs 40 lakh in 2013-14. We are looking to make revenue of Rs 6 crore in 2014-15," Mani said. The company plans to raise Rs 18 crore of debt and equity investment to fund expansion.
Dilip Chenoy , MD and CEO of NSDC said 500,000 trained drivers are required for commercial driving every year. "Besides taxi drivers, the heavy vehicle industry also requires a huge number of drivers trained in driving and road safety. We are actively looking to work with startups such as META to increase skill training among drivers in India," he said.

Swachh Bharat Abhiyan: Itll take more than brooms to clean IndiaPM Modi's Swachh Bharat Abhiyan: It’ll take more than brooms to clean India

A look at the jaw-dropping dimensions of the problem makes one wonder whether Modi really has a chance to meet his target to clean up India by 2019.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
With the Prime Minister himself taking up the broom along with his cabinet colleagues, BJP cadres and lakhs of government employees, the Swachh Bharat ( Clean India ) campaign got off to an energetic start on Thursday. But a look at the jaw-dropping dimensions of the problem makes one wonder whether Modi really has a chance to meet his target to clean up India by 2019.
Here are some sobering stats. Urban India generates about 47 million tons of solid waste (garbage) every year or about 1.3 lakh tons every day, according to a study by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). But this is only in cities and towns with a municipal body reporting. Another 30% of urban India lives outside these cities. If you add their garbage, the total would amount to about 68 million tons.
According to a calculation done by TERI in 1998, the garbage generated till 2011 would cover 2,20,000 football fields piled 9 meters (27 feet) high with garbage.
Increasing amount of garbage generation is to be expected as population and GDP grow. But here's the thing: nearly one third of the garbage is not collected at all - it is just left to rot away in streets and alleys. So, in one year, about 14 million tons of garbage is left to rot in urban India's streets.
The 70% that is collected is taken and dumped either in landfills or just any space available outside the main habitation. Only about 18% of the collected garbage is treated to recycle or make fuel. In other words, about 27 million tons of garbage is collected and dumped out of the city.
Since half of Indian garbage is typically organic matter which is compostable, the dumped garbage rots gets blown around and finally decomposes and mixes with the ground. The remaining untreatable part - mainly plastics - can be seen flying around.
What this gigantic mess needs is a plan for collection, segregation, proper dumping and treatment across the country. An estimate of the urban development ministry in 2009 had put the cost for doing this at about Rs.48,582 crore.
The other dimension of sanitation is sewage or wastewater disposal. CPCB estimates that in 2009, 38 billion liters of sewage was generated per day from 498 tier I cities. Installed capacity to treat this giant river of wastewater is 12 billion litres or less than one-third of the requirement. This means the remaining 26 billion liters is getting dumped into our streams and rivers daily, making many of them terminally sick.
In the four metros - Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata - of the 16 billion liters sewage generated per day, only 8 billion liters get treated. In the 410 tier II cities, about 3 billion liters of sewage was generated per day but only a tiny fraction, 0.23 billion liters was treated.

Everything you need to know about SIPsPrint
We often go shopping and buy goods on EMI basis. This is when we pay for the good in installments. It is a popular and convenient means of shopping as it does not burn a hole in our pockets in one-go. It helps conserve cash in our wallets and bank accounts until the end of the month.
Now, this can be done with your mutual fund investments too. Systematic Investment Plans or SIP helps you invest a fixed amount every month or quarter. Thus, it helps spread our investments over time.
SIP is very beneficial as an investment option. Here is why:
1)  Discipline: The more you invest, the better are your chances of success in the long-term. This includes investing as early in life as possible. However, it is very difficult to form a new habit. You may end up over-spending or forgetting to invest. SIP helps inject discipline in this case and invest regularly. Since the SIP can automatically debit from your account, you have no chance of forgetting to invest.
2) Power of compounding: There is a reason why you are advised to invest as early in life as possible. It is to tap into the power of compounding. When you invest, you earn profits in terms of interest payments or profits from sale or dividends. The latter two get credited to your bank account, where they then earn an interest. Over time, you earn interest on your interest payments too. This amplifies your total profits. This is why many investors prefer to reinvest their interests and profits rather than using it for expenses. SIP helps you tap into the power of compounding by increasing the time period of your investing, even if it is in small amounts.
3) Decide your investment: With an SIP, you can tailor your investments to fit your profile. You can select the scheme, the amount you want to invest or even the number of MF units you wish to buy. If you fix the amount in rupees, the number of units you buy each month will change. Similarly, if you decide to buy a fixed number of units, the amount you pay each month may differ. Either way, it can fit your bill.
4) Cost averaging: This is another key advantage of an SIP. In the stock market, timing is important. The same stock or even mutual fund may be available at different prices on consecutive days or months. An SIP helps you reduce your average cost of investment. For example, you buy 100 units of a scheme for Rs 100 each in January, and another 100 for Rs 90 in February and another 100 in March for Rs 95. You average cost of investment is Rs 95 per unit. So, tomorrow if you sell all your units for Rs 100, you earn a profit of Rs 5/unit. This would not have been possible if you had bought all 300 units in lump sum in January. This is called rupee-cost averaging.
5) Small investors: Often, there is a minimum threshold for investing in mutual funds. It could vary from fund to fund. This could act as a barrier for small investors. With an SIP, however, you can start even with an amount as small as Rs 500 or Rs 1,000.

How to make your car last longerMake your car last longer
India Today Group –  Wed 27 Aug, 2014 4:08 PM IST
Print
For most of us the car is an essential part of our day to day life. When you're commuting to work or dropping your kids to school, you don't think much about maintaining your car's value. However, when you plan to sell or exchange your vehicle you could be in for a shock. You might find that your car's value is much lower than the price you expect. Hence, it is essential to maintain the value of your car if you wish to protect the investment you have made. Take out a little time from you busy schedule and make some extra considerations. Here are some easy ways to maintain the value of your car.
Why is Value Important
Like you would want to maintain the value of any investment, you would want to do the same with the value of your car. Buying new isn't always the trick to retain the value of a car. But keeping the car you own in top shape is the key when it comes to increasing resale value.
Avoid Excessive Mileage
If retaining value is the key, use your car for essential journeys, and try to use public transport if you can. If you're planning on taking a long trip consider using a rental vehicle. Excessive mileage on your vehicle can lower its value considerably. If you have a long commute, see if there is somebody you work with that would be willing to carpool.
Treating Your Car as an Investment
While depreciation of your car is inevitable, you can make an effort to maximise its value by treating it as an investment. This may include limiting who drives your car, watching where it is parked, and any other things that are necessary to protect your car. Top tip remains to avoid handing over your car to hotel valets as well. Remember, the more shine you retain, the better value you get.
Do not Eat, Smoke or Drink in your
Car Food, drinks and cigarette smoke can leave a lingering smell inside. This could reduce the car's resale value. Any amount of stains, cigarette burns or even damaged plastic parts can result in reduced value.
Keep your Vehicle Serviced
Your car maintenance schedules should be checked regularly. Not only does routine car care help avoid unnecessary, last-minute repairs, it also demonstrates to future prospectors that you appreciated your car by properly maintaining it. Aim to stick to the manufacturer's service schedule if you can. Routine care shows potential buyers that the car has been looked after and some buyers are willing to pay more for this. It is also advisable to maintain a service history of the vehicle. So keep those bills properly in a file.
Store your Car Carefully
If you are not going to use your car for more than a month, store it properly to prevent unnecessary damage and repairs upon your return. Storing your car outdoors can lead to damage by extremes of weather. Sunshine can cause your car's paintwork and interiors to fade, and extreme cold can cause engine damage. Not to forget a sudden thunder storm which can bring down a tree thus damaging your car.
Avoid Unnecessary Wear and Tear
Excessive wear and tear is not a favorable way to maintain the value of your car. Quick take-offs, hard braking, extreme speeding and driving over poor roads can take a toll on a car's mechanicals.You should also always try to keep your vehicle clean inside and out. Use proper products for various surfaces. Regular washing of your car will also remove the salty deposits that can cause rust. Avoid Accidents and Collisions If a car has a history of accidents and collisions, it is difficult to get the best resale value. If an accident occurs, make sure you go to a reputed body shop for repairs. Address minor damages like windshield nicks and cracks and scratches immediately. The owner should also reveal information about major repairs made to the car. Be honest and inform the buyer about the top notch repair you have carried out and he will not walk away for sure.

Naseeruddin Shah not in favour of Homi Adajania making another  Cocktail"I love Homi. I just love his insanity. He is very good with his work," Naseer said.
Indo-Asian News Service | Mumbai | Posted: October 5, 2014 5:36 pm
Naseeruddin Shah praises Homi Adajania for valuing “aesthetics” and “authenticity” and adds that the director is also savvy enough to make a “completely synthetic and crass film like ‘Cocktail’.”
After working with the director in his dark drama “Being Cyrus” and his recent quirky film “Finding Fanny”, the National Award-winning actor seems to be quite impressed with Adajania’s way of working.
“I love Homi. I just love his insanity. He is very good with his work,” Naseer told IANS.
“He values aesthetics and authenticity and at the same time he is savvy enough to make a completely synthetic and crass film like ‘Cocktail’ and didn’t get carried away by the success of a film like that… That is very courageous,” he said.
He added: “If he would have been making another film like ‘Cocktail’, I would have kicked his ass and secondly, I wouldn’t have done it. I am happy and proud Homi has made a film like ‘Finding Fanny’ where he could have easily made a film like ‘Cocktail’.
“I don’t feel making ‘Cocktail’ was necessary because he could have made ‘Finding Fanny’ equally well five years ago.”
Adajania’s 2012 release “Cocktail” was a romantic comedy-drama and the Saif Ali Khan, Deepika Padukone and Diana Penty-starrer had become one of the biggest earners of the year.
Meanwhile, Naseer, who had made his directorial debut in 2006 with “Yun Hota To Kya Hota”, has no plans of helming another film at the moment.
“No direction. I am happy directing on stage,” he said and added: “I might (direct), but I don’t have the energy. It’s too much of hard work.”

Airtel  Vodafone  Idea hike mobile Internet rates by up to 100%Oct 05, 2014 at 06:54pm IST
Airtel, Vodafone, Idea hike mobile Internet rates by up to 100%

New Delhi: Telecom operators have raised mobile internet rates up to 100 per cent in June-September period across country.
Airtel is latest to increase mobile rates by up to 33 per cent while Vodafone and Idea have started gradually implementing the increased mobile internet rates from June.
Telecom operators generally don't make public announcement about increase in mobile tariff. The change is noticed on their website after the new rates are implemented.
#airtel #vodafone #idea #mobile internet
The three companies jointly hold around 57 per cent mobile services market share.
While no comments were received from Airtel and Idea Cellular, Vodafone India spokesperson said "Around 2 months ago, we changed the base tariff of 2G for 1GB pack from Rs 155 to Rs 175. This has been carried out in a phased manner across circles."
Airtel and Idea too have increased the rate of 1GB 2G mobile internet pack to around Rs 175 from about Rs 155 GB.
Telecom operators generally don't make public announcement about increase in mobile tariff. The change is noticed on their website after the new rates are implemented.
They generally inform their post paid customer through SMS about change in rates of services before their next billing cycle starts.
Pre-paid customers, which constitutes over 90 per cent of market, get to know about rate revision when they go to recharge their mobile phone or through website of companies.
Telecom operators are required to report change in tariff to telecom regulator TRAI.
Vodafone and Idea Cellular increased rack rate, charged without any offer or scheme, by up to 100 per cent from 2 paise per 10 kb of data usage to 4 paise per 10 kb.
This means on Vodafone and Idea network 1 GB of 2G or 3G mobile internet will cost over Rs 4,000 (from Rs 2,000) which these companies under scheme are selling for around Rs 175.
Airtel started increasing mobile internet rates around first week of September. The company is now at par with Vodafone and Idea in terms of rack rate which is 4 paise per 10 kb. However, the increase is only of 33 per cent because the company was already charging 3 paise per 10 kb earlier.
The 2G data pack rate of Airtel is highest among the three at 10 paise per 10 kb which means cost of 1GB mobile internet usage without any scheme or offer for a subscriber is over Rs 10,000 which company is now selling for Rs 176.

Women more likely to watch same-sex porn: Study27
1
London: Women are more likely to watch same-sex porn videos than heterosexual porn videos, says an interesting study, adding that women watch more porn than men.
The findings revealed that top three categories for female viewers are "lesbian," "gay (male)," and "teen," while the top categories for men are "teen," and "mature".
"By segmenting by gender within our analytics tools, we were able to generate data that brings us one step closer to answering the time old question: what do women want," wrote researchers from porn search engine Pornhub.
According to a study, the top three categories for female viewers are "lesbian," "gay (male)," and "teen," while the top categories for men are "teen," and "mature". ( Pornography , via Shutterstock)

The study, done along with internet media company Buzzfeed, provides insight into the gender differences when viewing pornography, Latin Times reported.
An earlier study published in the journal Cyberpsychology, Behavior and Social Networking had found that women are just as likely to be addicted to pornography as men.

Patna stampede: Four top officials removedPatna stampede: Four top officials removed
PTI
Tweet
Patna, Oct 5:  
Patna Divisional Commissioner N Vijaylaxmi and three other top civil and police officials of the district administration were today removed from their posts by the Bihar government, two days after the stampede in the state capital that left 33 dead.
Besides Vijaylaxmi, the three others who were shifted were DIG Patna Range Ajitabh Kumar, Patna District’s District Magistrate Manish Kumar Verma and Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Manu Maharaj, an official notification said.
The transfers were effected even as the state government vowed to punish those responsible for the “lapses” that led to the stampede.
Vijaylaxmi has been replaced by Tirhut Divisional Commissioner Narmadeshwar Lal while Upendra Kumar Sinha, the SP (Railway) in Patna, will take up Ajitabh Kumar’s post.
East Champaran District Magistrate Abhay Kumar Singh will replace Verma while Maharaj’s Muzaffarpur counterpart Jitendra Rana will be the new SSP of Patna.
Vijaylaxmi and Verma have been asked to report to the General Administration (GA) Department till further orders, the notification said.
Though the latest round of transfers in the police and GA Department is seen as fallout of the stampede outside the Gandhi Maidan on October 3, the state government remained tight lighted on the development with a senior minister merely saying that transfers have been effected to meet requirements of the state administration.
“Notifications have been issued for transfer of a number of IAS and IPS officials....beyond which I would not like to say anything,” Water Resources Department (WRD) Vijay Kumar Chaudhary told PTI.
“The state government is not going to spare anyone responsible for ‘lapses’ that led to the stampede outside the Gandhi Maidan,” he said.
He said that the probe team would jointly hold a public inquiry at the district Collectorate on October 7 to hear accounts of eyewitnesses and other people willing to depose.
The state government would also publish advertisements in newspapers appealing to the people to share information about the incident, he said.
On the lack of lighting arrangement at the venue on the day of the Dusshera celebrations, Chaudhary said the state government was aware of the matter, but would await the probe report to act.
The state government has instituted an inquiry and it is being conducted by Home Secretary Amir Subhani and Additional Director General of Police, Headquarters, Gupteshwar Pandey.
Pandey said the probe would be completed within a week and a report would be submitted to the State government.

Nicholas Sparks responds to fired headmaster’s lawsuit
PTI
authors and poets
Author Nicholas Sparks has responded to a lawsuit filed against him by the former principal of the school he founded in 2006, revealing he feels “saddened” by accusations of racism and homophobia.
Saul Hillel Benjamin claimed in a lawsuit that he was fired from his post at Epiphany School of Global Studies in North Carolina after a series of run-ins with ‘The Notebook’ writer over policies towards African-American and gay students, reported Us magazine.
In his papers, he accuses Sparks of fostering an environment of exclusion, racism and homophobia at the school, alleging the author once forced him to justify his Jewish faith before the school as students hurled abuse at him and staff applauded their insults.
“I emphatically reject his (Benjamin) claims, but beyond that I am deeply saddened by their nature, given the fact that I founded Epiphany with the express purpose of creating a truly global and multicultural institution, accessible to individuals of all races, religions, and orientations. This is a painful experience for me,” he responded with a post on his Facebook page.

Sensex  Nifty closed on account of Bakri Id; Asian markets rallySensex, Nifty closed on account of Bakri Eid; Asian markets rally

Bakri Id
NEW DELHI: Indian stock market will remain shut on Monday, 6th October on account of public holiday. The BSE, NSE will remain closed for " Bakri Id ".
However, Asian markets were trading higher tracking gains on Wall Street which rose following a stronger-than-expected September U.S. jobs report that bolstered the outlook for the U.S. economy.
"The U.S. Labor Department reported nonfarm payrolls rose 248,000 in September, 33,000 more than median forecast while the jobless rate fell two-tenths of a point to a six-year low of 5.9 percent," Reuters reported.
Tokyo's Nikkei jumped nearly 1 per cent in early trade while South Korean shares rose 0.3 percent after a market holiday on Friday. Hang Seng was trading 0.4 per cent higher.
Back home, Nifty ended the day with a loss of 19 points at 7945 after a range bound session. The BSE Sensex closed 62 points lower at 26567.99 on Wednesday.
Immediate support for Nifty continues to remain at 7920 and if the index manages to respect 7920 as a support and clear the resistance of 8040 as well then we may see further upside till 8090, say analysts.
Markets will closely track data for India's services sector, IIP number and quarterly earnings from IT major Infosys in a holiday-shortened week ahead, say experts.
Important set of data and events are lined in the coming week. To begin with, HSBC Services PMI for August 2014 is due on Tuesday, 7 October 2014. Going ahead, the government will unveil industrial production data for August 2014 on Friday, 10 October 2014.
And lastly, the earning season will also begin from Friday, 10 October 2014 with IT major, Infosys ltd, announcing its Q2 numbers.
"Broadly, the CNX Nifty index has been trading within 7850-8050 for last six trading sessions and either side decisive break will trigger the next directional move," said Jayant Manglik, President-retail distribution, Religare Securities Limited.
"Meanwhile, traders should maintain extra caution and prefer defensive sectors like Pharma, FMCG for short term positions," he added.
Manglik is of the view that investors', on the other hand, should now focus more on stock specific approach before the beginning of earning season and adjust their portfolios accordingly.

Japanese stocks  dollar shine on upbeat U.S. jobsJapanese stocks, dollar shine on upbeat U.S. jobs
By Reuters | 6 Oct, 2014, 09.13AM IST
Save precious time tracking your investments
TOKYO: Japanese stocks bounced strongly on Monday and the U.S. dollar held near four-year highs against a basket of currencies, spurred by U.S. jobs data after a week of worries about global growth and geopolitical tensions frayed investor nerves.
Tokyo's Nikkei jumped 1.3 percent while Hong Kong shares rose 0.3 percent, extending their recovery from falls last week when concerns about civil unrest in the Chinese-controlled city had spooked investors. There has been some signs of the protests fizzling out.
MSCI's dollar-denominated index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.1 percent, as the boost from positive U.S. data was offset by weaker Asian currencies and falls in Australian mining shares.
The U.S. Labor Department reported nonfarm payrolls rose 248,000 in September, 33,000 more than median forecast while the jobless rate fell two-tenths of a point to a six-year low of 5.9 percent.
Stocks on Wall Street jumped more than 1.0 percent on Friday, with the S&P 500 posting its best day in almost two months to end at $1,967.90.
The U.S. dollar was another clear winner, as the data highlighted the relative strength of the U.S. economy as many other major economies remain sluggish.
The dollar index stood at 86.636, down slightly on Monday but still very close to a four-year high of 86.746 hit on Friday, when it had risen 1.3 percent.
The euro traded at $1.2515, having fallen to $1.25005 on Friday, its lowest level in more than two years.
The dollar fetched 109.61 yen, near last week's six-year high of 110.09 yen.
"The theme in the currency market at the moment is the divergence of economic growth... But the pace of the dollar's rally may slow down a bit from now. The 110 yen level seems to be heavy," said Shusuke Yamada, chief Japan FX strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
In early thin Asian trade, sterling hit a 11-month low $1.5943.
As the dollar rose, commodity prices came under pressure, with gold prices hit a 15-month low of $1,183.51 per ounce . It last stood at $1,188.89, down 0.2 percent on the day.
The U.S. Treasuries bond prices fell on the jobs data, but they quickly recovered most of the lost ground. The 10-year notes yielded 2.4448 percent on Monday, little changed from just before the data release.
While jobs growth was solid, some investors also focused on the small growth in wages. Average hourly earnings rose just 2.0 percent from a year earlier, well below above three percent before the Great recession in 2008-09.
As limited wage growth suggests low inflationary pressure, affording the Federal Reserve room to wait before raising interest rates, interest rate futures markets showed limited reaction, moving only a few ticks.
Federal fund rate futures are fully priced for a rate hike in July.
Asia has little data to trade on, but one focus later in the day is on Brazil, where leftist President Dilma Rousseff placed first in Sunday's election but did not get enough votes to avoid a runoff on Oct. 26.
She will face pro-business rival Aecio Neves, who made a dramatic late surge into second place.
Over the past month, the Brazilian real and shares tended to weaken when polls show Rousseff gaining as many investors believe a more market-friendly administration could help boost demand for Brazilian assets.
The real hit six-year low of 2.5070 reais per dollar on Friday, hitting the 2.50 mark, a level seen by some as fuelling inflation and increasing the chances of additional central bank market intervention.

Five obstacles before Narendra Modis Swachh BharatMissionThe Prime Minister’s Swachh Bharat Mission aims to get people to rediscover their roots, and leaves, and other discarded matter
Written by Dilip Bobb | Posted: October 6, 2014 10:14 am | Updated: October 6, 2014 11:26 am
It’s the start of a new broomance. The Prime Minister’s Swachh Bharat Mission aims to get people to rediscover their roots, and leaves, and other discarded matter so they can make a clean break with the past. With ministers and bureaucrats and those who wield clout now wielding a broom, we are in for some sweeping changes. Yet, there is literally a mountain to climb and there clearly need to be specific targets. Here are some obvious targets.
The spitter: That slimiest of species, the spitter only breeds in the subcontinent and can be identified by the sound ‘swachh’, which is heard when spit hits the road, wall or nearest object. It seems to be connected to an affliction of the salivary glands, since Indians spit with alarming frequency and velocity with no regard for the mess they are leaving behind or any disease they may be spreading, much to the disgust of non-spitters who are clearly a minority community and unprotected against ugly spats. Spitters need to be identified and soon; spittoon in other words.
The paan Indian: A species similar to the spitter, except with a more colourful background, or foreground, since that is where he/she usually squirts the spittle collected by eating paan, leaving blood-like stains on walls and sidewalks. Again, a filthy habit perfected in the subcontinent, it has spread far and wide, on every available surface. In Indian cities, to locate a paan shop, just follow the stains. If the Clean India campaign is to succeed, these need to be segregated and put in enclosures, much like the zoo, with a large sign saying ‘Beware, paan eaters’.
The urinator: We Indians have passed the urine test with flying colours, or, more appropriately, with the fly open, showing our true colours. Not a very pretty sight, but it also shows why we have such a piss-poor record in sanitation, with most Indian men preferring the nearest wall to the nearest toilet to soak the atmosphere. Pee shooters run a muck in India and, sadly, it’s not for lack of toilets; in every Indian city, if you see a car, motorbike or scooter parked by the side of the road, you can be sure the owner is up against the nearest wall, adding to the malodorous graffiti already inscribed there. We cannot kiss in public, but it’s fine to piss in public. What the urinators need is urine therapy, as prescribed by an earlier prime minister.
The squatters: Not the ones unlawfully grabbing real estate, but those we see in a real state from passing trains very early in the morning, which is why we peculiarly refer to it as ‘night soil’. It could also do with a phenomenon called mooning. It’s such a human waste, but we are told that 600 million Indians defecate in the open. That fact may help illustrate the modern phrase, ‘shit happens’. Unfortunately, there’s no solution in sight, just ablution.
The litterati: If we can take a walk without something squishing, squelching, crackling, snapping or crumbling under our feet, we must be in a foreign country. We love to litter and are the litterati of the world, which is why we produce over one million metric tonnes of garbage each day. It’s also why 13 of the 20 dirtiest cities in the world are in India. The Aam Aadmi Party’s choice of a broom as party symbol was not random, even if our choice of where to dump our garbage often is. A majority of the population in India seems to believe that waste disposal means a slimming diet.

Didnt get that joke Your sense of humour changes withageIndo-Asian News Service | Posted: October 6, 2014 10:13 am
Things that you find funny today may not amuse you when you grow older, a study suggests, indicating that with age, our sense of humour also changes.
While young and middle-aged adults considered aggressive humour to be funny, older adults did not, the findings showed.
“Television sitcoms in which characters make jokes at someone else’s expense are no laughing matter for older adults,” said co-researcher Tehan Stanley, an assistant professor of psychology at University of Akron in the US.
The older adults preferred “affiliative humour” in which a number of characters share and navigate an awkward situation.
The researchers studied how young, middle-aged and older adults reacted to “aggressive humour”.
The findings appeared in the journal Psychology and Aging.

3. Opinion
Last month, senior Bihar BJP leader Sushil Modi declared that if Yogi Adityanath, BJP MP from Gorakhpur, had spoken of “love jihad” in Bihar the way he did in Uttar Pradesh, he “would have contradicted him”.
 
4. Sports
For many, Chand was the next Kohli. That was 2012. In the following two years, Chand remained a child star, waiting for the big break on the big stage.
 
5. Swachh Bharat campaign in Alappuzha

Payal Rohatgi revisits her modelling days onTVFor the shoot, Payal Rohatgi donned a shimmering golden dress.
Indo-Asian News Service | Mumbai | Posted: October 6, 2014 9:54 am
Actress Payal Rohatgi reminisced her modelling days while walking the ramp for her “Humsafars” debut TV show.
Payal plays the role of Anam, who is a part of her brother-in-law’s fashion house.
The actress, who tried her luck in Bollywood with a string of movies like “Tauba Tauba” and “Dhol”, had to walk on the ramp as a showstopper for the upcoming track of the show.
Commenting on the experience, she said in a statement: “Having won the Supermodel Miss Tourism World title, walking on the ramp brought back memories of my modelling days. I was nervous initially, but once I hit the ramp I guess I was confident.”
For the shoot, the actress donned a shimmering golden dress.
“The outfit was very well cut as it had the perfect blend of glam quotient and tradition, keeping in mind the Muslim backdrop (of the character). I loved the gold and silver combination,” Payal added.
“Humsafars” features Harshad Chopra in the lead role with actress Shivya Pathania, who was crowned Miss Shimla in 2013.

With products reflecting current fashion trends, khadi showrooms aim for a record Deepavali sale
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s speech aired on All India Radio on October 3, advocating the use of khadi, has evoked hope among khadi enthusiasts and authorities working towards its promotion.
“Nearly 50,000 people in Madurai district benefit directly and indirectly because of their involvement in industries related to khadi,” says J. John Peter, secretary of Khadi Gramodyog Bhavan near Crime Branch in the city, an institution certified by Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC). According to him, at a time when the commission is taking a slew of measures to popularise khadi among the masses, the Prime Minister’s announcement has given them a boost and will infuse energy into the khadi sale. “His speech was very encouraging. We have undertaken steps to promote khadi in a big way so as to compete with multinational brands,” Mr. Peter says.
Authorities in the Gramodyog Bhavan say the Deepavali season last year saw a record sale of more than Rs.6 crore and the target has been fixed at Rs.8 crore this year. And the announcement of the Prime Minister has come at an ideal time, they say.
Job opportunities
N. Selvaraj, Director in charge of the KVIC, Madurai region, says one of the visions of the commission is to generate employment avenues for youth in rural areas. “It was Mahatma Gandhi who created an industrial revolution by popularising khadi so that it gave employment to the needy,” he recalls.
According to Mr. Selvaraj, as many as 5,000 institutions in India, registered under the KVIC, are promoting khadi. “We have 7,050 retail outlets all over the country. Nearly 125 lakh people are employed in khadi and village industries. Last year, these outlets recorded a sale of Rs.28,000 crore,” he says.
A new design development plan and khadi reform and development programme are on the anvil, Mr. Selvaraj says.
The fabrics are classified as silk khadi, woollen khadi and poly vastra. While khadi garments such as shirts, dhotis, saris, blouses and salwars have been in the market for several years, dresses for children were introduced recently. “We also organise activities to promote khadi in educational institutions. We put up stalls in engineering, arts and science colleges and universities where we also get suggestions from students on improvising the products in tune with current trends,” says Mr. Peter.
More colours have been introduced in shirts, and khadi fabrics from other States also adorn showrooms in the city. “The fabrics are good for the health of people as well. That is why we think the dresses for children will evoke a good response since they will be comfortable to wear in summer,” he adds.
S. Bala Yokini, a veterinarian, has been buying khadi silk saris for the past 10 years. “The prices are reasonable and the quality is really good. The saris last longer,” she says. Dr. Bala Yokini says more people should patronise khadi products.
Silk sari collections such as Samutrika and printed and embroidery products cost Rs.4,500 to Rs.20,000. “Silk saris with pure silver zari are unique to khadi showrooms,” says an official.
The leather footwear manufactured at khadi are priced between Rs.250 and Rs.400. “We manufacture footwear with quality products, but price them less so that they are affordable to all. We also make special footwear for diabetics,” says K. Selvaraj, who is in-charge of the footwear unit at Khadi Gramodyog Bhavan here.
N. Ravikumar, a tailor at Gramodyog Bhavan, says he is unable to meet the demand. “I stitch 300 shirts in a month. The demand for shirts is on the rise,” he adds.
“The KVIC is doing a yeoman service in eradicating unemployment in rural areas. The push from the top authorities in the government will definitely help the khadi sale to gain momentum,” notes R. Shankar Narayanan, Assistant General Manager of National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD).

How eating with parents prevents kids fromobesityIndo-Asian News Service | Posted: October 6, 2014 10:24 am
Even having as few as one or two family meals a week during adolescence may protect your kids from being obese when they turn into adults, says a study.
Researchers believe that coming together for meals may provide opportunities for emotional connections among family members, the food is more likely to be healthy and adolescents may be exposed to the parental model of healthy eating behaviour.
“Informing parents that even having one or two family meals per week may protect their child from being overweight or obese in young adulthood would be important,” said co-researcher Jerica Berge from the University of Minnesota in the US.
For Project EAT (Eating and Activity among Teens), the researchers used data from a 10-year longitudinal study (2,287 participants), to examine weight-related variables (dietary intake, physical activity and weight control behaviour) among adolescents.
Among adolescents who reported that they never ate family meals together, 60 percent were overweight and 29 percent were obese at the 10-year follow-up.
Overall, even having as few as one or two family meals a week during adolescence were significantly associated with reduced odds of being overweight or obese at the 10-year follow-up compared with those reporting never having had family meals during adolescence.
The study is forthcoming in the Journal of Pediatrics.

Women more likely to watch same-sexpornIndo-Asian News Service | Posted: October 6, 2014 10:18 am
Women are more likely to watch same-sex porn videos than heterosexual porn videos, says an interesting study, adding that women watch more porn than men.
The findings revealed that top three categories for female viewers are “lesbian,” “gay (male),” and “teen,” while the top categories for men are “teen,” and “mature”.
“By segmenting by gender within our analytics tools, we were able to generate data that brings us one step closer to answering the time old question: what do women want,” wrote researchers from porn search engine Pornhub.
The study, done along with internet media company Buzzfeed, provides insight into the gender differences when viewing pornography, Latin Times reported.
An earlier study published in the journal Cyberpsychology, Behavior and Social Networking had found that women are just as likely to be addicted to pornography as men.

Indiana aid worker captured by Islamic State says in a letter is afraid todieIn this 2000 photo provided by the Kassig Family, Abdul-Rahman Kassig poses for a photo with his mother, Paula Kassig, at Cumberland Falls State Resort Park near Corbin, Ky. (Source: AP)
Associated Press | Indianapolis | Posted: October 6, 2014 10:16 am | Updated: October 6, 2014 2:10 pm
An Indiana aid worker threatened with beheading by the Islamic State group said in a June letter that he’s afraid to die and is saddened by the pain his captivity must be causing his family, his parents said Sunday.
In a statement released to media, Ed and Paula Kassig said their 26-year-old son, Abdul-Rahman Kassig, thanked them for their strength and commitment. And he appeared to try to prepare them for his death.

“I am obviously pretty scared to die but the hardest part is not knowing, wondering, hoping, and wondering if I should even hope at all,” Kassig said in the letter, according to his parents. “I am very sad that all this has happened and for what all of you back home are going through. If I do die, I figure that at least you and I can seek refuge and comfort in knowing that I went out as a result of trying to alleviate suffering and helping those in need.”

Kassig was taken captive by the Islamic State group Oct. 1, 2013, in Syria, where he was providing aid for refugees fleeing that country’s civil war.
The group said in a video after the beheading of British aid worker Alan Henning last week that Kassig would be next. The Kassigs pleaded for their son’s freedom in a video statement released Saturday.

According to a former Islamic State hostage, Kassig voluntarily converted to Islam sometime between his capture and December 2013, the Kassigs said. He was known as Peter Kassig before his conversion.

Bullion sinks to lowest in 15 mths | Brent s...Bullion sinks to lowest in 15 months on robust US data

Gold has also failed to capitalise on geopolitical tensions caused by military conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the rise of Islamic State, which has declared a cross-border caliphate in Iraq and Syria.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
SINGAPORE: Gold tumbled to its lowest level in around 15 months on Monday after better-than-expected US jobs data boosted the dollar, dampening safe-haven appetite for bullion and pushing silver and platinum to multi-year lows.
Gold, which often influences other precious metals, has also failed to capitalise on geopolitical tensions caused by military conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the rise of Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.
By 0641 GMT, cash gold was little changed at $1,191.30 an ounce after earlier falling to $1,183.46 an ounce, its weakest since June 2013.
Platinum touched its lowest since 2009, silver fell to its weakest since 2010, and palladium hit an 8-month low.
"A strong dollar is a major problem for gold. Sentiment is very bearish but I think we expect some kind of rebound," said Ronald Leung, chief dealer at Lee Cheong Gold Dealers in Hong Kong, who pegged support at $1,180 an ounce.
"There's a little bit of physical buying, but premiums haven't changed. We have to see what happens later in the day. If demand is coming, of course, it will push up the premiums."
Premiums for gold were quoted at $1.20 to $1.60 an ounce to the spot London prices, unchanged from last week, despite a sharp drop in cash gold prices.
The absence of main gold consumer China is weighing on the physical market, which usually sees a pick up in demand from jewellers and retail investors when prices fall.
Chinese markets have been shut for national holidays and will reopen on Wednesday.
US gold was $1,191.70 an ounce, down 0.10 per cent.
The dollar held on Monday near a more than four-year high, touched after last week's upbeat US nonfarm payrolls report increased speculation that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates in mid-2015 or earlier.
Data from the Labor Department on Friday showed US non-farm payrolls rose 248,000 last month and the jobless rate fell to 5.9 per cent, the lowest since July 2008, underscoring that the US economy continues to improve.
In Tokyo, sellers pushed up premiums for gold bars to 25 cents to spot London prices from zero last week to offset the decline in global prices.
"At this moment, demand is not good. But maybe when the holiday in China is over, the premiums may go up further," said a dealer in Tokyo.
Markets in Singapore, a key bullion trading centre in Southeast Asia, were also closed for a public holiday.

Tips to organize a house partyStory
Table Planners
Organising a house party is a breeze, once you know how. Event organisers Neha and Joshua share some useful tips.
Tips to organize a house party
THE DEVIL'S IN THE DETAIL
Let your style of dining table arrangement reflect the mood of the party. For an informal gathering, a muted tablecloth laid with tableware in a contrasting colour works best. Minimalistic and patterned stone crockery is catching on. Pair these with a white tablecloth for maximum effect. Want to avoid jarring colours? Place fresh flowers on the table.
FOCUS ON APPETIZERS
It's trendy to go all-out on appetizers and serve just one or two innovative mains. Platters of tapas and canapÃ©s, accompanied by great wine, put guests at ease. Usually, one carb-heavy dish is great at the end, such as a creamy lasagne or a pilaf with tossed veggies . A single live station that serves pastas or crepes is another favourite.
MENU WITH A VARIETY
Instead of cold-shouldering the vegetarians, try to incorporate their dietary requirements. Stock a wide range of appetizers that will suit vegetarians as well as non-vegetarians who may be allergic to shrimp. These are basic restrictions that are easy to accommodate. Focus on seasonal ingredients because these bring out the best flavours.
INDULGE THE SWEET TOOTH
There are no 'shoulds' in dining and entertaining. However, as a guideline, we would say that a grand dessert - such as a decadent chocolate fudge - is perfect if you have called a few friends over. But if you're hosting a large group, a variety of desserts is sure to delight your guests. Explore options with fruit, chocolate and minimal sugar.
SEATING ARRANGEMENTS
In case you are serving food buffet-style, arrange for seats that allow more than three or four people to sit together. Quirky place cards based on the theme of your party is another concept that's catching on. It encourages mingling among guests.

RBI to issue norms on small  payments banks by NovRBI to issue final norms on small, payments banks by end-November
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: September 30, 2014  | 16:36 IST
(Photo: Reuters)
The Reserve Bank of India will issue final guidelines on small and payments banks by November end, aimed at expanding the banking space and paving way for corporates to enter these two segments.
"Based on the feedback received, final guidelines on licensing of these banks will be issued by end-November 2014," RBI said in its bi-monthly policy review on Tuesday.
Draft guidelines for Small Banks and Payments Banks were issued by the central bank in July and comments were invited till August 28.
The final norms will allow micro finance institutions (MFIs), telecom players, non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) and public sector companies eligible to apply for bank licences once RBI invites applications for the same.
The proposed small banks will provide a whole suite of basic banking products such as deposits and supply of credit, but in a limited area of operation.
On the other hand, payments banks will offer a limited range of products such as acceptance of demand deposits and remittances of funds. They will have a widespread network of access points particularly in remote areas, either through their own branch network or through Business Correspondents (BCs) or through networks provided by others.
"Both payments banks and small banks are 'niche' or 'differentiated' banks, with the common objective of furthering financial inclusion," RBI had said while issuing the draft guidelines for licensing these banks.
Small banks can collect deposits and disburse small-ticket loans to farmers and small and medium businesses, unorganised sector through high technology-low cost operations, as per draft regulations.
Payment banks will cater to marginalised sections of society, including migrant labourers, for collecting deposits and remitting funds. They would, however, not be allowed to indulge in lending operation.
Such banks can be set up with a minimum capital of Rs 100 crore as against Rs 500 crore required for normal commercial banks, as per the draft norms.
With regard to Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs), the central bank said changes in the regulatory framework would be introduced by end-October 2014.
The new framework would cover prudential regulations on core capital, asset classification and provisioning norms, regulation on deposit acceptance, corporate governance and consumer protection measures.
With these changes coming into force, the RBI will recommence registering new NBFCs, it said.

The One Argument In Favor Of Student LoansThe One Argument In Favor Of Student Loans
Posted:

College is worth it. That's the straightforward conclusion of a recent study from the Brookings Institution's Hamilton Project. "A college degree -- in any major -- is important for advancing one's earnings potential," the study's authors write. Median earnings are higher no matter what you study, and the advantage you have over high school graduates lasts throughout your career. The difference isn't minor, either: Over a lifetime, the Hamilton study notes, "the typical bachelor's degree graduate worker earns $1.19 million, which is twice what the typical high school graduate earns."
College, as The Washington Post's Dylan Matthews detailed in 2012 , is a great investment. And despite growing anxiety about Americans' rising student-loan bill, using debt to partially finance one's education makes it an even better investment.
Here's a chart clearly showing the boost you get from a college degree:
The message is stark: Go to college, major in something you like so that you'll graduate (yes, art history is worth it ), and you will typically make more money. Hamilton even has a fantastic interactive graph that lets you see how much more money you can expect to earn based on your major:
Granted, gaining that advantage in lifetime earnings does cost something, and the cost of college is rising -- a trend that no student is happy about. Those rising costs are at least partially a result of the abundance of loan options available to students. Those same loans, however, let Americans borrow their way toward a higher lifetime income.
College debt, which is increasingly synonymous with a college education, has many potential downsides: It depresses the housing market , crowds out other spending , and leaves graduates vulnerable to default, marred credit ratings and all kinds of nasty practices .
There are real reasons to worry that student debt is too easy to acquire right now. There are other ways of financing college that would make it an even better deal for Americans, like the government using its excellent credit to borrow more money to fund more federally backed loans -- or, even better, grants. Increased funding for state schools also wouldn't hurt. Student-loan burdens from for-profit colleges tend to be very high, and come with shady collection methods and a degree of dubious long-term value.
Still, education is a fantastic way to invest in your own earning potential, and debt is a great way to invest in things that yield predictable returns. Investors famously love leverage . It boosts returns, because borrowing money from someone else is a cheaper way to buy something than putting up cash yourself, and because the tax code loves leverage too: The interest companies pay on debt is tax-deductible.
In a limited way, student loans give Americans access to the magic of leverage, with the bonus of tax deductions. Ordinary Americans can get access to loans to buy all sorts of things that fall in value and usefulness shortly after they're bought: cars, clothes, electronics, furniture, appliances. Even homes, which you can take out a mortgage to buy, can rise in value, but their price is volatile, and the thing itself is immobile and requires money to maintain.
A college degree has none of these drawbacks. It's the only type of loan Americans can use to directly invest in their long-term personal economic well-being.
There are lots of bad reasons to go into debt. A college degree is a good reason to borrow money.

India s business leaders: On the Joy of GivingIf I think the cause is good and the person who is leading it is trustworthy, I give.
Rakesh Jhunjhunwala
Partner
Rare Enterprises
Every year October 2-8 mark the DaanUtsav or the Joy of Giving week – a weeklong celebration of giving (philanthropy) in India. While more and more Indians are participating in this revolution, the numbers are still abysmally low. One report suggests that India’s rich give away just 5 percent of a household income in a year. However, there are few leaders who are at the forefront of this revolution like Azim Premji and Shiv Nadar, to name a few.
The other such leaders include Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, Partner, Rare Enterprises, Amit Chandra, MD, Bain Capital, and Dr Devi Shetty, Chairman and Founder of Narayana Health. All of them are involved in identifying important causes and efforts raising funds for them (both their own money and encouraging others to give).

Rakesh Jhunjhunwala decided many years ago that he would give away 25 percent of his wealth over his lifetime. Some of the causes that he supports are Agastya, which is a cause that helps promote the interest of science amongst children, the Olympic gold quest, schools and orphanages.
In an exclusive chat to CNBC-TV18’s Menaka Doshi, Jhunjhunwala said that he donates in the range of Rs 20-25 crore. To identify the causes, he said he looks at the “crusade and the crusader.”
“I do not have any audits. If I think the cause is good and the person who is leading it is trustworthy, I give,” he said.
Jhunjhunwala said his biggest contribution goes to Agastya as it teaches science to rural and poor children. He says it’s not the subject but the purpose (arising curiosity in the young minds) behind it that is more important. He hopes to give Rs 5000 crore on July 5, 2020 to his foundation, in the form of cash (not shares).
Amit Chandra feels it’s important to have an emotional connect both with the cause and people behind it. He said he likes to do things that are transformational in nature—where institutions will get created, which is stand for social excellence.
“We are very fortunate to partner with Dr Devi Shetty in building Asia’s largest children’s hospital in Mumbai,” he said.
The tide of giving in this country has really become very big, said Dr Shetty, adding that the Indian mindset has undergone drastic changes. Indians are becoming lot more forthcoming and giving than they were before.
“I’m not looking for someone writing a cheque for billions of dollars. I just want everyone to think that bringing smile on somebody else’s face on a daily basis is the best gift that you can give to this world,” he said.
Below is the edited transcript of Rakesh Jhunjhunwala’s, Amit Chandra’s and Dr Devi Shetty’s interview with CNBC-TV18's Menaka Doshi.
Q: You decided many years ago that you would give away 25 percent of your wealth over your lifetime. Some of the causes that you support and I have come to know of are Agasthya which is a cause that helps promote the interest of science amongst children, the Olympic gold quest, which is already well known, the Shoshit Seva Kendra which is a school for children of Musahar community, an orphanage in Vashi. These are just some of the projects I am told that you support. What I would like to know is how do you identify the causes that you would like to support on a medium to long term basis?
Jhunjhunwala: If you have the desire to give, there are so many people who approach you that this is an organisation, it needs funds, it needs help, it needs backing. I don’t have a very formal organisation. It is not that I am giving some hundreds of crores of rupees here. I give 25 percent of my dividend income every year. I give between Rs 20-25 crore and then I look at the crusade and the crusader. I don’t have any audits, if I think the cause is good and the person who is leading the cause is good and trustworthy I give.
Q: Would you say that you have sort of identified causes based on areas that you want to put your work in. For instance education which I am told is the sector that receives the maximum amount of funds through Indian philanthropy. So is it education or in your case is it child care. Are there sectors that appeal to you more than others?
Jhunjhunwala: At the moment the biggest contribution that I give is to Agasthya and I give it to Agasthya because the purpose of Agasthya is to teach science to rural and poor children in India. The importance of teaching science is not so important as the purpose of arousing curiosity in children.
For me the source of all my knowledge was my curiosity. I was a very curious child and my father always encouraged that curiosity and I still have that curiosity. So, I feel it is a very noble cause and it is a very cost effective model. In five years we are going to interact with 9 million children. It is not going to cost more than Rs 125 per child and we are going to interact with each child four times. I hope to give Rs 5,000 crore on July 5th 2020 to my foundation not in the form of share but in the form of cash.
Then I will have a really formal organisation where I have shortlisted some of the causes which are close to my heart and then I will really make an effort to see that these long-term causes are well served. At the moment my giving is more of, I know this organisation, it is doing good work and I must support it. I support the Tata Cancer Hospital in Kolkata, then I support an organisation called Impact in Delhi which is working towards education of ladies. Education is very important from two points of view, it is a source of prosperity ultimately and that is what makes me feel that I have equated a poor child with a rich one. Equality of mankind is a dream, equality of opportunity is something we should make an effort of. So I am also drawn towards education.
Q: You have decided to give your money away and importantly what you have also said is overtime you want to devote at least 30 percent of your time to causes that work towards philanthropy or philanthropic causes. Talk me through how you approach causes what are some of the causes that you have decided to put your money and time into. I have a list which includes Jai Vakeel which is a school for special children that you and your wife support. Soshit Seva Kendra, again for Musahar children; Mr Rakesh is also involved in that, Akanksha which is already well known. Ashoka University which is very different kind of project altogether and then of course a project which is work in progress a super specialty children’s hospital here in Mumbai for children across the country. How do you pick these projects?
Chandra: My wife and I who are partners in this journey try to do a few things and some of them are common to what Rakesh said as well. Often it is about the people connect. You have to feel for the cause and you have to feel for the people behind the cause. So in lots of these cases, for example we are supporters of Agasthya like Rakesh is and we love the passion of the founder and we love the cause of education. In case of Jai Vakeel my wife is involved in running the institution so there is a deep personal connect that we have.
In case of Ashoka my good friend Ashish Dhawan has played a leadership role in setting the institution up. So emotional connect both with the cause and with the people behind it is very important.
The second issue is really we like to do things which are transformational in nature and where institutions will get created which will really stand for social excellence. We are very fortunate for example to partner with Dr Shetty in building Asia’s largest children’s hospital right in our backyard in Mumbai and that is a good example. We know once one will be set up and will stand for excellence, the next ten will actually follow.
Ashoka similarly is a very ambitious dream to create one of the world’s best universities in India and it is off to a great start. We know that once one such institution breaks into the top 100 or 200 there will be many more which follow.
So the second pillar for us is really to do things where excellence will become evident and people will feel that if they can do it why can’t we do it and we need that spirit of confidence to be infused amongst everyone, not just philanthropist but the common man as well that they can actually contribute to improving the country.
Q: How much money are you giving away if I may ask you that? If not the actual amount, can you give me a proportion of your income?
Chandra: My wife and I endeavour to give away 75 percent of our income every year. There are years where we have managed to fortunately give away close to 100 percent. It is a little lumpy, some years we manage to hit that, some years we are closer to the 75 percent range but for us we try to make sure that we are solving for at least giving that as a target. Often our engagements are multi year commitments, lot of our commitments run forward for two-three years. So as long as we make the money we give it away.
Q: You, Rakesh Jhunjhunwala are wealthy people so when people are watching this show they are going to say Rakesh Jhunjhunwala has a lot of money he can afford to give it away or Amit Chandra is giving away 75 percent of his wealth but that is because he has built considerable wealth over time. Is it as much the amount of money in your experience, is it actually the fact that you combine it with time as I am sure does Rakesh as well because he has to oversee the money that he has given away. How do you explain to people that they can do it too?
Chandra: Everybody can be philanthropic and philanthropic means basically just making sure that you are alleviating social misery around you and doing something for society around you. It doesn't matter whether you are doing it with Rs 100 if that is all you have to give or you are doing it with hundreds of crores which is what some of our billionaires have to give.
In fact the programme that enthuses me the most is the payroll giving programme that Give India runs in which nearly 35,000-40,000 professionals in India at the entry level and these are people who are earning Rs 10,000-15,000 a month, give away as little as Rs 150 per month on a monthly basis to causes that they select.
To me that contribution is as valuable if not more valuable than what people like us who are more fortunate, blessed with a little bit of wealth are away to give away.
I just came back from Patna to see the school that Rakesh and I are involved in -- Shoshit Seva Sangh -- which is really not just a school for teaching education at a very high level to the Musahar (rat-eaters) kids, it is about transforming the entire community.
What struck me there was contributions to the school have been made by Musahar kids themselves including one child who won Rs 25 lakhs on Kaun Banega Crorepati and when Amitabh Bachchan asked him what will you do with this money? He said my family really needs the money but I am actually going to give it back to the cause and that is a family which has nothing and he is giving away everything.
So it is a journey, we should not be judgemental about who gives how much. It is important to start the journey and give whatever you can at any point of time. But like anything else question yourself are you giving it the right way and then are you giving the right amount and things will move on from there.
Q: Dr Devi Shetty has devoted his entire life to this cause both through the money that he puts to it but more importantly the work that he has done with Narayana Health: 26 hospitals across 16 cities in India with over close to 7000 beds. You are a living example of philanthropy. I want you to talk to us about what your experience has been over the years of how much more philanthropic Indians are getting if at all and how that can be channelized into projects like yours?
Shetty: I have seen a major change happening in our country in this aspect of giving away. I have been begging people for the last 25 years since I started my journey in Kolkata just to sponsor some poor child's operation. You are aware that India produces about 600-800 children a day with a heart disease. So it is a very large number and parents cannot afford to get their children operated if they require.
It started off as a few telephone calls to my friends and about eight years ago a small group of people in Bangalore who run small time commercial operations in commercial street of Bangalore, they came together and they started an entity called Have a Heart Foundation. They started sponsoring children's heart operations. In no time it became very big and today they sponsor over 100 heart surgeries on children every month. They sponsor children in Bangalore, in Kolkata, Jaipur wherever we have hospitals.
Now they want more and more children to come. They would have operated on more than 5000-6000 children and they are not millionaires, they are regular business people but the tide of giving in this country has really become very big.
If there are people like Amit who can bring people together, they can really change this country, I am very optimistic. Indians are no more the same old people I used to deal with 20 years ago. People are lot more forthcoming, lot more giving then they were before.
Q: There are two things about your model that I want to understand better because they go to the issue of scale and scale is so important in this whole process of giving, if we want to transform philanthropy in India as opposed to incremental change. One is that your Narayana Health is a for-profit business is what I understand but you use the ability of some patients to pay for their healthcare and offset the cost of those who cannot pay for their healthcare, that is one point. The second point is how has scale enabled you to approach your donors in a more effective fashion? If you could share your experiences on both of these counts and explain to us what role scale plays in philanthropy?
Shetty: Scale is extremely important, writing off one or two children's heart operations is no big deal. 12 percent of the heart surgeries done in India are done by us, so for us, sponsoring a few operations is no big deal.
But I will just give you an example of scale. Around six-seven years ago we decided that children from poor families should become doctors and they are not joining medical colleges today mainly because medical education is thought to be very expensive. So we launched a program in West Bengal. We wanted 2000 children from villages of West Bengal to join the medical colleges every year: that was the target.
We started with about 200 students, these are the brightest kids from rural West Bengal who are extremely good in studies, are passionate about becoming doctors. So when they are 13 years old, all they needed to do was to commit to us that they will become doctors. With that commitment we give them a scholarship of about Rs 500 per month.
It is not the Rs 500 that matters, they are chosen by us and we mentor them and these kids really work hard and good number of them join medical colleges.
Now we want to scale up this programme in Karnataka and Bihar and UP, we are overwhelmed with the response. Everyone wants to contribute, Rs 500 a month is no big deal. So essentially we would like children from poor families to become doctors because outstanding doctors across the world generally come from deprived background because these are the kids who have the fire in the belly, who can work for 24 hours and change the rules of the game.
But these kids have no opportunity for anyone to mentor them. So this is the role that we have adopted. So if we can scale it up across the country, then we can be the producer of doctors for the whole world and it can happen within five-ten years time, this is the beauty of these small time programmes, conceived well by organisations with some repute without big investment.
Q: How would you tackle the issue of scale? There are two projects that you are currently working on which are collaborative projects where you have brought several donors together. So there is scale in giving and then of course the way the projects approach a cause there would be scale in that as well. There is the children's hospital that you are building along with Dr Shetty and what some ten, fifteen, twenty corporate founders sponsors in Mumbai.
Chandra: Yes twelve corporate families and couple of companies as well as a part of the corporate social responsibility (CSR) budget. This is the other change, Dr Shetty talked about he seeing changes in India. The one most remarkable change that I am seeing is collaborative philanthropy. What we are increasingly seeing is that what each one of us individually cannot do we are able to do by coming together as a group. The children's hospital in Mumbai will be a great example of that where twelve families will come together to put up a world class hospital.
Many of those families individually could probably donate and set up a ward in normal circumstances but could not do a hospital. It required in that case visionary leadership of Dr. Shetty and Mr. Ramadorai who have put the project together and the role we have played is in committing capital as well as helping get the other families on board. That's a good example of collaborative philanthropy.
I know Rakesh does a lot of collaborative philanthropy, every place where he is engaged with he provides a lot of credibility by being engaged and people draw comfort from that. Lots of people are engaged then with him to make things happen there. Ashoka University is a great example of again a leader like Ashish Dhawan coming together with few other corporate leaders and saying that we can build a world class university in India.
None of the fifty donors so far to that project individually are capable of setting up a college, leave alone a university. But coming together, that project has actually happened.
Q: How did you make it happen this coming together?
Chandra: There is of course a little bit of being at the right place at the right time. As Dr Shetty said things are changing today but there are two things which are important in my view one is the dream must have excellence in it. Excellence attracts a lot of interest. When Rakesh talks about Agastya, I know part of what attracts Rakesh to Agastya is Ramji Raghavan the founder of Agastya deeply believes in science and curiosity at a very high level.
Similarly with both the projects I talked about if it wasn't for the fact that you had you know people like Mr Ramadorai, Dr Shetty, Ashish Dhawan involved with these projects who really are people who stand for excellence in what they do, it would be very difficult for people to come together behind them.
That's a critical aspect that is attracting people and of course being at the right place at the right time is helping which is today people are thinking differently. There are lots of people who say that we would like to make sure that a large part of whatever we are blessed with goes back in to society during our life times as oppose to gets either consumed or gets simply given away as inheritance.
Q: Rakesh I am sure it's been your experience that when people find out that you support certain causes they want to be involved in those causes as well because those causes comes with the credibility of a Rakesh Jhunjhunwala attach them. Of course those causes themselves are important but you want to know that you are going to give money in safe hands and if Rakesh Jhunjhunwala trusts them, you would trust them as well.
Jhunjhunwala: It's not that we are supporting causes because some individual is associated. Always groups of individuals are associated and their sheer work if you look at Shoshit Seva Sangh in Bihar, that gentleman is a retired employee of Government of India. He is giving his life to see that musahar children the community, which eats rats, get education. I don't know how anybody can doubt what he is doing?
Q: Joy of giving is one thing but many people who give their money also want to try and measure the impact of that in some fashion or the other. I don't mean to make this sound commercial. But you want to know whether giving that money has been successful or not. So how do you measure that? I am trying to understand form your experiences how do you measure that?
Jhunjhunwala: First I supported Agastya in 2001, we are now in 2014, it was the idea, the concept, the crusader which I liked very much. Now the results are not going to come in two years and three years. It has taken us 12 years but now we get far more funds than we can use. It is now becoming so popular.
So it takes time and you have to have belief in the cause and the person whose doing that cause just like any business, organization or an activity. When you progress there are going to be difficulties, there are going to be challenges you got to have belief.
I don't measure things by audits may be because I don't have a very formal organisation. But these results are to see before your eyes. What is most important is the human character which is involved in carrying out this activity. If I feel the cause is good and the person is selfless, I mean I support Impact in Delhi. It is set up by the IIM class of 1984, all of them today are leading companies. Two, three of them are full time associates with it. I mean they are going to come with a cause so IIM graduates of 1984 I have no reason to doubt that they are doing it for any other purpose rather than selfless services.
Q: I am just trying to understand because these are questions that do come up in the process of giving, am I giving to the right people, how do I measure what the outcome of my giving is, is it really making a difference at all? How do you tackle these questions, I am sure you get asked these questions everyday?
Jhunjhunwala: It is like this, I give a certain amount of money to the Tata Cancer Hospital in Kolkata every year to treat children for cancer, children who cannot afford cancer treatment. I don't go and examine anything there. The house of Tata are at the forefront of charity in India, I am giving money to them to spend on children who have cancer, do you think I need to audit that? Do you think I need to understand are they spending that money correctly? You choose the cause, choose the organisation, choose the crusader.
Chandra: Rakesh is making a very important point. If you are backing the right people then it becomes much easier to open up your heart and do whatever you can to your best potential. Impact however is now becoming a more and more central issue especially because of the CSR funding which has happened and companies are used to measuring everything, its EPS and ROE and everything. So increasingly organisations are having to put in place metrics which help make it clear to the donor that people are getting bang for the buck.
In most causes you can actually do it, Rakesh is completely right, the difference between the corporate world and the not-for-profit world is that the results often take much longer in the not-for-profit world and so you need to have patience. You are little bit more of a venture capitalist than a stock market investor in that space and so you therefore make the initial bet based on credibility of people. But eventually what you want to see is you want to see the results, it has to be visible to you.
But for some causes like education you can measure things, you can say what is my pass rate. The Akanksha Foundation which is helping running municipal schools in Mumbai and Pune has now for two years in a row had a 100 percent success rate in SSC with two-thirds of the kids getting first class, 25 percent getting distinction, these are all kids from really poor background.
I think in some areas it is very important to put in place very simple matrices which give you comfort like in education you can simply measure, you can have EI which is a goal standard in educational assessment, audit your kids in third standard, fifth standard, eighth standard.
Q: How does somebody who doesn't have the time to get involved in all of this, sort of figure this out? You are fully involved in all of this so you figure it all out?
A: There are two approaches that you can choose, one is that you choose one thing and really get much more involved with it. Just like you have other interests in life, you take interest in something around you and there is often no substitute if you do that.
The second approach is actually to piggyback where if you do not have the time you basically follow others who you know have the time and are putting in the effort. So in lots of areas even Rakesh talked a little bit about this as well sometimes he is affiliated with things where he knows other people are involved that provides lot of comfort.
Let's not forget the world's largest donation ever made was the donation that Warren Buffet has made to Bill Gates Foundation and he is not at all involved in auditing the outcomes. He knows he has a sense and feel of the work that is happening and so often just making sure that you are working with people who are credible and who have the ability and desire to get engaged, is good enough.
Q: I want to then get to that point that Rakesh has so importantly raised which is that one part of philanthropy is the individual philanthropy that we have already spoken of. The other part which is potentially only going to grow from hereon exponentially maybe is corporate social responsibility prompted by the changes to the new Companies Act and the provisions requiring in companies to spend the certain minimum amount to its CSR. Rakesh you made the very important point that in the past few years when we have seen corporates get involved they bring a sense of organisation to philanthropy, they bring a sense of structure to philanthropy therefore outcomes are also easier sometimes to measure and therefore trust levels get enhances. Do you think CSR if companies deal with it correctly from here onwards can be a big game changer in the area of philanthropy?
Jhunjhunwala: Before I answer this question I want to say one thing when you say about measurement, there is a joy why do I give because there is a joy and it is my responsibility. The giver of this wealth is God and he has cast upon me a responsibility that I must use some part of this wealth for good social purpose. Now I give, suppose it does not produce good result that does not take away my joy I will try better next time.
About corporate social responsibility first of all I don't agree with the government I don't agree with this legislation. But as the citizen of this country I have to follow the law which is made by Parliament because it is a tax, government according to me is incorrect to impose a charity tax on anybody. But anyway we are citizens of this country we have to follow it. Having said that I feel it will bring much more organization and structure in giving.
2 percent of corporate India's profitability is huge, it is about Rs 20,000-25,000 crore in a year, more and for that money to be given on a recurring basis will have a very good effect and also it will raise awareness among people, among corporates may be even people lower down the run that giving is important and I hope that corporates involve their employees in giving.
Q: How do you see these additional Rs 25-30000 crore that potentially could come to many different social ventures or many needy areas, how do you see that changing the game? Do we have the capacity to absorb that money, will corporates bring better organisation and accountability to the process?
Jhunjhunwala: 2 percent of corporate tax collections will be much higher, it would be nearly about Rs 50000 crore a year.
Q: Yes but that is on the assumption that all corporates will jump into this immediately right now. It is a comply-or-explain thing.
Jhunjhunwala: No they have to do it in law.
Q: Do we have the ability to absorb this, what will corporates bring to the game?
Shetty: I think the first two-three years there will be chaos because majority of the NGOs who are into social welfare activities, they are too small and very unprofessional. If you give them more than Rs 2-3 crore they wont know what to do with that. So there will be chaos. But we are a country of extremely smart people but we will learn and this will be a gamechanger because in the area of healthcare, in the area of education, you cannot really have return on investment the way you can get in a business investment. We need a philanthropic funding for establishing all the modern healthcare or various educational avenues for children from poor families.
For instance, cancer treatment: poor people are as vulnerable for cancer as rich people. And if a child or an adult has cancer and requires radio therapy, establishing radio therapy infrastructure in any hospital will cost them minimum Rs 12-15 crore. If you spend that kind of money on radio therapy equipment there is no way majority of poor can afford it. But beauty of radio therapy is if the money comes as a CSR money, then you can virtually do radio therapy free of cost because there is hardly any recurrent investment.
So this is the way the CSR money can make a big difference. Right now if big money comes to this field of CSR, there wont be that many organisations which have infrastructure and capability to manage. So there will be lot of chaos but within two years India will set an example for rest of the world to follow. I agree with Rakesh that we don't need a law but unfortunately without law good number of companies also are not very forthcoming to donate. So this will be one of the ways to make everyone donate irrespective of their philosophy and I believe that this will be a game changer especially in the area of healthcare and education.
Q: You sit on both sides of the fences. You give away a lot of your money and your time. You are also on the boards of some companies that are now figuring out how to device a CSR policy that is truly effective, that is worth all this anguish over the law, so to speak. What is it that you’re working through? How are advising these companies based on your own experience?
Chandra: The good news is that at least the leading companies already have at least some point of view on what they want to do. They have been doing it for generations. However, the smaller one’s and some of them who have not been philanthropic are very quickly finding their feet and figuring out how to deploy money and there is a big challenge because as Dr Shetty put it and Rakesh articulated, numbers are actually mind boggling. There are at least 100 companies which will give away more than Rs 5-10 crore a year, in some cases it will run in to Rs 100 crore. So, the scale up that you will have to see will be really astonishing.
Q: What are the opportunities and challenges you see in that?
Chandra: Couple of things are happening. One is new projects are emerging and new opportunities are emerging where like Ashoka is a great example. No one before Ashish and the founding team put together the project had thought of raising Rs 500 crore from 100 donors to build a world class university. Today, the fact that this law exist means it is pulling in a group of people and opportunity is getting created partially because the funding is available. The children’s hospital that Dr. Shetty is leading is another great example. It is partially enabled by CSR funding. The fact that higher level of funding is available is bringing in new projects, scaled project which were not feasible earlier; point number one.
Point number two is the non-governmental organization (NGOs) as well, particularly the progressive ones are beginning to prepare themselves from scale. I have sat in many meetings with social entrepreneurs where they are challenging themselves to think about how do we grow hundred X in next three or four years. One program for example, I know one organisation that I am a big fan of is Dasra and Dasra has been preparing for this for the years. They have been running training programs in partnership with Harvard Business School where they are working with 30-40 entrepreneurs at a point of time to help them understand these kinds of issues which are really issues we only know of in the corporate world. We are beginning to see that happen.
This year Dasra sent seven social entrepreneurs to Harvard Business School for training to work with the world’s best social entrepreneurs and helping things through these kinds of issues. The other side is also getting prepared for this and of course the expectation that they will have to deliver great results against it.
Q: How are companies approaching this in terms of do they want to do the actual venture themselves? Are they saying if we are going to sort of put money towards let say primary education in the country, we want to build the schools, we want to run them, we want to equip them, we want to monitor their success and Shiv Nadar’s foundation is doing that or are they saying no we know of this great organisation that’s already doing some of this work lets put money and time and resource into scaling up this organisation itself. What are they preferring to do?
Chandra: Both things are happening. We are often seeing the same company do both. For example, Mittal Foundation is a great example; all the Bharti Schools that they have built in North India is a great example where they are actually working through their foundation. However, we are seeing a lot of other companies say that we will get together we other people and we will sponsor may be a school or try to contribute towards building a hospital. So, both things are happening.
The thing that I would love to see happen is what has happened in the west where Warren Buffett got up and said I am going to give my money to Bill Gates because he really knows how to do a great job. Maybe the next phase of this is some companies will say they might be my competitors but I think they have done a great job at building a school or running a hospital or feeding children mid-day meals and I am actually going to give to their foundation. So, that is probably the next step of it. However right now we are seeing a mix of both.
Q: We have covered a lot of that space that we already wanted to do. There are two further questions I want to put to all three of you. One is how do we get more people to join this revolution and the second is what are some of your experiences good, bad and ugly that you can leave us with in this whole process and journey of giving. So can you share with us what your experiences have been over the last four to five years?
Jhunjhunwala: My experience has been good but the only the bitter part has been that I can’t run anything. I can identify the cause, I can give the money but I am incapable of myself in administrating or running any organization; that has been the running and I accept that. When I am going to give Rs 5,000 crore, I am not going to be involved in running my trust; I am going to have people whom I trust completely in doing that. The only thing I want to say is give what your conscience allows you and what your pocket permits you whether it is Rs 1 or Rs 1,000 crore.
Q: When you do setup that foundation you said you won’t run it, explain to me why because a lot of the learning’s that we are talking about in this conversation are experiences that you are going to have to translate into reality when you setup that foundation and try to give away on scale, right?
Jhunjhunwala: I hope to do Rs 500 crore of charity every year in my organisation, actually disburse Rs 500 crore. I run an organisation of 10 employees; I have no administrative ability. The good thing in life is not to over estimate yourself and understand your own inabilities. So I can identify the cause that I want to support and I identify the people who can do it, who can build the organisation to support those causes. I cannot do it, I am not an organisation builder, I am not an administrator.
Q: Talk us through the experiences you have had, maybe great ones with donors, some nasty ones with donors. How to meet their expectations, what have the last five years brought?
Shetty: I have no bad experiences at all and no failures because I don’t expect anything in return. All I expect is just smile on the face of these kids I operate; that’s all I need. My advice or suggestion for everyone is that everyday if we can do something which is going to bring some smile on the face of people who are not related to us, who are not working for us or who are not know to us and we may spend just five minutes or ten minutes of our day just to bring smile on somebody else’s faces that makes a big difference to me.
I am not looking at some one writing a cheque for billions of dollars. I just want everyone to think that bringing smile on somebody else’s face on a daily basis is the best gift you can give it to this world. This world will be a fantastic place to live.
Q: Last word to you, experiences, failures and successes. You started this four-five years ago and Joy of Giving week started in 2009 and you were instrumental along with Venkat Krishnan of GiveIndia of putting this on to a platform. You have been giving away your money for the last five-six years. Experiences?
Chandra: Success and failure are inevitable in everything you do. If I had failures in my business and I have been cheated in business as well and if I took my failures and the times when I have been cheated and said I will not do business any more that would be worst thing for me. Just in the same way when you are doing social things as well success and failure is inevitable. Everything is not going to work.
You do things with the best intentions and as both Dr Shetty and Rakesh said you enjoy the joy of it. It’s great to see sometimes these institutions come up. I can’t tell you there is nothing else in my life other than my daughter which gives me the joy of seeing something grow up; it is unmatched.
When you see children in a school, you see patients coming out of hospitals, you see kids getting fed; its unmatched, there is no consumption that you can do which can give you that kind of joy for a enduring period of time. So you have to experience that joy and be always prepared that you will have some success and some failures as you do in any other walk of life.

Dreamliner lets down Air India againDreamliner lets down Air India again
Mail Today Bureau     New Delhi   Last Updated: October 4, 2014  | 20:15 IST
Air India ran into more problems on Friday with its snag-prone Boeing 787 Dreamliner fleet letting down the maharajah yet again.
The national carrier was forced to cancel its Melbourne-Delhi flight due to clogged toilets of the Dreamliner plane while its Singapore-Chennai flight was delayed by over six hours as another Dreamliner could not take off after engineers detected a technical problem. Many passengers of the Melbourne-Delhi flight AI-301 were given hotel accommodation, while some others were put on other flights after the cancellation.
The airline also had to arrange a team of alternative crew members as the flight duty time limitation (FDTL) for those already on board had come to an end. Flight AI-347 from Singapore reached Chennai around 6 pm on Friday instead of its scheduled arrival time of 10.50 am, an airline official confirmed. Friday's twin incidents involving Dreamliners came close on the heels of another incident involving a Dreamliner flying from Delhi to London on Thursday which had to return to the national capital due to problems with its airconditioning system after three hours.
Last week, another Dreamliner developed a crack in the windshield and had to be grounded. Air India has reported more than 370 glitches in its Dreamliner planes so far. Such glitches have meant it affects its on-time performance. Currently, a total of 134 Dreamliners are in service with 16 carriers worldwide.
The recurrent problems with the Dreamliners is understood to have figured during the meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi with Boeing CEO W. James McNerney on September 29 in Washington. Air India chairman Rohit Nandan was also in Washington during Modi's meeting, after which McNerney told reporters that Boeing wanted to step up its engagement with India. The national carrier and the plane maker are negotiating a formula for compensation for grounding of the Dreamliners for almost four months last year over battery fires.

Maha polls: I wanted to contest from my hometown  says Prithviraj Chavankarad
(Prithviraj Chavan is fighting…)
Prithviraj Chavan , who recently resigned as chief minister of Maharashtra, is clearly under a lot of pressure to deliver. He is the face of the Congress campaign in the assembly election. Moreover, he is fighting his first assembly poll from his hometown Karad (from Karad South), near Pune. It is not going to be easy, since he is taking on an immensely popular former colleague Vilasrao Patil Undalkar , who is fighting as an Independent. Chavan spoke to G Seetharaman in his car between campaign stops in rural Karad. Excerpts:
This has been a Congress constituency for a long time but this time your party MLA Vilas Patil Undalkar, who has won seven consecutive times, is fighting as an independent. Is it crucial you win to send out a signal to those who do not toe the party line?
I have to win this election but not from that point of view. The point is when the party asked me to lead the campaign in the 2014 assembly election, I was an elected member of the legislative council and not the assembly. When I came here [as CM], I was asked not to waste time in contesting an election, asking somebody to vacate the seat. So I got into the legislature through the council route which is not considered a great way. Everybody wants you to be elected directly. So I told my high command I should be elected directly so they started looking for a safe seat. I said I will have to run from my home seat, I can't run away from the challenge but there was an incumbent who had lost only one Lok Sabha election but won many many assembly elections. He is ageing and there are other issues with him so I requested him to vacate the seat but we couldn't reconcile. Our differences go a long way back, since when I contested for the Lok Sabha in 1991.
Some say the campaign has been acrimonious because of this.
No, I don't think there is any acrimony. In an election like this, there will always be charges and counter-charges.
What are your biggest challenges to winning this election?
I will have to run the state campaign so I won't be able to spend a lot of time here. But this is a constituency I know very well. I have won three Lok Sabha elections from here. The only problem is there has been a gap. The last time I contested an election here was in 1999. So people have aged and some of my colleagues have passed away and I may not know their children directly. I'm rebuilding those contacts.
Is your former partner — the NCP — a key target in your election campaign?
No, I'm not targeting them. They are targeting me. They couldn't find a good candidate, they put up somebody. Now they are trying to withdraw him. [A day after the interview, NCP opted out of the contest in support of Undalkar but its candidate Rajendra Yadav joined the Chavan camp.]
Do you think you could have done more in your crackdown on the corruption which people perceive plagued your government?
I have done a lot. But beyond a point, because it is a coalition government, if I start cracking the whip it's not taken well. The allegations that I did not work on files are motivated. RTI [Right to Information Act] can tell you how many files have been cleared by which chief minister every month since 1999 and it will be shown that I have cleared more files than any previous chief minister. But I didn't clear some files because I waited to change the policies which, like urban development policies, were totally wrong. I have shown how they are wrong.
Was there pressure from the NCP to clear some files?
I can't discuss about individual cases, they [NCP] are my friends. Whatever I did under pressure or otherwise, it's not fair to talk about it.
Can a post-poll alliance with the NCP be ruled out?
I'm appealing to the people to give us a clear mandate. People know the problems of a coalition government. No one expected a clear majority for the BJP government but they did it. So I wouldn't be surprised if people give a clear mandate and if at all they do, it will be to the Congress party.

Meet 8 unsusal MBA students from IIMs and ISBEight unusual MBA aspirants pursuing management studies, but not for cushy jobs

(These youth are not pursuing…)
Ten years ago, if you had chucked a stone in the campuses of India's premier Bschools, chances are it would have hit a student with a BTech degree. If you were to do the same experiment today, the likeliness of the stone finding a doctor, a former soldier, an aspiring politician, a fashion designer or even a journalist is pretty high.
Today, the buzzword in B-schools, like in Indian Inc, is diversity. "During the selection, aspirants are not only evaluated on the basis of their leadership potential, academic background and work experience but also on the value they add in terms of diversity," says Munish Sapra, senior director of admissions at the Indian School of Business (ISB).
As one-year management programmes for professionals with work experience have become popular, B-schools have begun to focus on increasing the diversity of the batches to maximize peer-to-peer learning. This has also meant that students are looking at different outcomes. In the past, an MBA was the stepping stone to a consulting job with a fat pay packet. But, that's not the case these days — not always. Registrations for CAT, the admission test for IIMs, have fallen to a seven-year low despite the number of seats (and IIMs) increasing. Whilst this could be a sign of the MBA degree losing its lustre, it perhaps could also indicate that the IIMs are keener these days to take in non-engineering students. After all, starting a new venture or pursuing a passion as a career is the flavour of the season.
ET Magazine met several students across India's top B-schools who are doing exactly that. They have unusual resumes or have switched tracks to do interesting things before they pursued an MBA. What made them do so? And where do they plan to go after they are done with their education?
A doctor from Pathankot who wants to set up his own hospital, a student who used to handle the social media campaign for Narendra Modi's prime ministerial campaign, a visually challenged student who wants to become a science evangelist are some of the people we spoke to. These youth are not pursuing an MBA as a means to bag a cushy corporate job but to add value to the interesting things they have already done. Read on:
BoP CRUSADER
Medha Dixit, 31
STUDYING AT: IIM-Ahmedabad
BEFORE THAT: A computer science engineering graduate; worked in IT before switching to the not-for-profit sector
WHAT NEXT: Return to the not-for-profit sector and serve bottom-of-the-pyramid customers
AAt first blush, she appears the conventional MBA aspirant - an engineer, from the Army Institute of Technology, Pune, who has worked for four and a half years across diverse functions like IT, business development and marketing in a number of big companies and banks, including ICICI.
It's after those four and a half years that the resume begins looking less predictable. In 2011, five years after pocketing the engineering degree, Dixit joined Teach for India, an education not-for-profit. For two years she worked full-time as a teacher in a low-income school in Dadar, in the heart of Mumbai. That was followed by a stint at Acumen, a non-profit venture fund that raises philanthropic capital to invest in social enterprises. "I managed the launch of Acumen's leadership development programme for outstanding social entrepreneurs and change-makers. This involved leading the recruitment strategy, administration, selection and candidate evaluation for over 450 entrepreneurs across India," says Dixit. It made for a great education, she recalls. "The biggest learning was that businesses serving customers at the base of the pyramid can be highly innovative in their approach, scalable, as well as financially sustainable."
Take the case of the Bihar-based Husk Power systems (HPS), which Acumen invested in. The company provides power to thousands of rural Indians by converting agricultural residue (rice husk, grass etc) into electricity. "It is a low-cost solution that offers customers savings of at least 30% and allows for usage of a cleaner energy source over diesel and kerosene," explains Dixit. Also, the bio-char left behind from the use of rice husk is used for the production of incense sticks, providing employment to hundreds of rural women.
An army brat hailing from Lucknow, Dixit sees herself being associated with the development sector after her course at IIM-A. "I find work in the development sector extremely meaningful and stimulating. I am keen to work in this sector and the knowledge and expertise gained during my MBA course at IIM-A will help sharpen my skills," says Dixit. "Working to serve customers at the bottom of the pyramid and enhancing growth opportunities in the development sector require a more innovative and professional management approach," she sums up.

PM Modi slams NCP-Congress  ignores ex-ally Shiv SenaModi said he had been to Aurangabad in the past, but by witnessing the response of people he could predict which direction the wind was blowing.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
AURANGABAD: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday flagged off the BJP's Maharashtra election campaign from Beed, assailing both the Congress and NCP for "corruption" and urging the people to give the BJP an absolute majority in the state. However, the PM avoided any mention of Shiv Sena , the party's estranged partner of 25 years, during his address in the home turf of late BJP leader Gopinath Munde.
Striking an emotional chord with the crowd, Modi recalled Gopinath Munde , saying he wouldn't have had to come to Maharashtra for campaigning had his ministerial colleague not died in a tragic car accident.
"If you want Munde's dreams to come true, ensure that the BJP comes to power in Maharashtra for the sake of development. If you elect a BJP government, it would be responsible for implementing the Central schemes while offering good governance and administration," Modi said.
Attacking the Congress, the PM said there is no difference between the NCP and Congress. "Though they have opened separate shops, they think alike, they work on the same pattern and their culture is one because they have emanated from a single source. They are not rashtrawadis (nationalist), they are 'Bhrashtacharwadi' (promoters of corruption)," he said.
"You have tolerated the Congress-led government in Maharashtra for 15 years while the same government chose to destroy the state. Now, the time has come for change and we are ready to serve you. I have come to Maharashtra to request people here to give the BJP and its smaller allies a clear mandate. I want to serve Maharashtra from Delhi. So, give a government that will help me serve the state,'' he said.
Modi urged the people in Beed to imagine Munde while casting votes for the BJP nominees. Munde's daughters Pankaja and Preetam are running for Parli assembly and Beed Lok Sabha seats.
In Aurangabad, Modi referred to the tourism potential of the district, home to the world heritage Ajanta and Ellora caves. "After the Taj Mahal, only Aurangabad has the potential to attract large number of tourists from across the world. Efforts are required for improving infrastructure and developing adequate facilities to boost tourism in Aurangabad,'' he said.
The BJP's 14 nominees from Aurangabad and Jalna districts attended the campaign meeting. The PM said Maharashtra was the No. 1 state in the country, but the 15-year Congress rule dragged it down to the 15th place in terms of development, 12th in terms of literacy and 6th in terms of employment opportunities.
Modi referred to the Jan Dhan Yojana, reduction in prices of diesel and petrol and his efforts to reduce the rate of inflation. The PM also said he had talked to the Chinese President during the opening of the road to Kailash Mansarovar. "The Chinese President has agreed, and now even elderly people will be able to visit Kailash Mansarovar by car," he said. He also referred to his recent US visit and said the world has now begun to recognize the strength of the country.

Deficit rainfall: Rural economy still uncertainAgriculture
(While the Modi government…)
Dinkar Patil, a farmer from Buldhana district in Vidarbha, Maharashtra, normally cultivates cotton on his 13-acre farm land. This year, however, he has skipped the cotton crop and opted for soyabean and tur dal. "The rainfall started late. I did not cultivate cotton because of the delayed rains and the huge increase in cost of cultivation of the crop," said Patil. He is expecting a fall of about 15% in soyabean yields as the grain size is likely to be smaller due to the absence of rainfall at the time when grains gain in size. He also fears a drop of more than 40% in tur production. The area on which cotton is being sowed is 40.29 lakh hectares, 20% higher than the average area of the last five years and higher by 6% over the area targeted by the agriculture department. Despite the increase, farmers expect a decline in profits due to a reduction in the per acre yield of the crop, an increase in input (fertilizer) and labour costs and a fall in prices. As sowing was delayed by about 20 days to a month, farmers had to use more seeds to make up for the loss in production, which led to an increase in cost of cultivation.
BR Patil, a cotton scientist formerly working with the Punjabrao Deshmukh Agricultural University in Akola, estimates that the cotton farmers in Vidarbha could see a drop of about 15-20% in yields. "Only if this region gets some rainfall in the next few days can cotton and soyabean crops hope to get some returns. Else, the farmers are going to bear big losses," he said. It's a similar story in other parts of the country. In Punjab and Haryana, which have seen rainfall deficits of well over 50%, farmers have been forced to rely on groundwater to irrigate crops, pushing up costs in those regions as well.
This is the other side of India's agricultural economy that has not come through in the big numbers. Officially at least, and much to
everyone's relief, this year's monsoon season ended with just a 12% deficit in rainfall, far short of the massive deficit of over 43% in June. Indeed, while private weather forecasters have described the monsoon season as a 'drought' (albeit a mild one), the government refuses to go that far. The first estimates of agricultural output for the kharif season indicate a fall of 7% in foodgrain production from a year earlier (see Falling Yield).
The final deficit in agricultural production is likely to be even lower than this, say experts. But while the Modi government talks up overall economic sentiment, the picture for the rural economy is far more uncertain.
Action Replay
The weak rainfall in June, and the expectation that the El Nino weather phenomenon would hurt the monsoon rains, prompted fears of another drought year like 2009 or 2002. But a better comparison could well be 2012. In 2012, the monsoon started off badly, with heavy deficits in rainfall in the early weeks; however, rainfall picked up in August and September, and the season ended with a shortfall of about 8%. Foodgrain production fell by 2.4%. Though 2012 was hardly a good year as far as the monsoon was concerned, it was far milder in its impact on agricultural production than 2002 and 2009.
What happened with prices, though, was dramatic. In January 2012, consumer prices of food items were growing at a tad under 4%. By August 2012, the consumer price index for food had soared to over 12%, pushing overall consumer price inflation to 10%. "What we saw that year was a big spike in food prices," says Abhijit Sen, professor of economics at JNU and former member of the Planning Commission.
Will we see such inflation again this year? Food price inflation is hovering above 9% currently and even the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), while noting earlier this week that overall inflation rates had fallen, was quick to point out that food prices still pose a risk. "Future food prices... impart some uncertainty to an otherwise improving inflation outlook..," it noted.
The Wild Card
The big difference between 2012 and 2014 though is arguably the international commodities market. In October 2012, the RBI, in an assessment of the economic environment then, noted that the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) forecast that global cereal production would decline by 2.6% that year: "The uptick in commodity prices in recent months has been driven by crude oil and food prices," the central bank noted.
Despite the weak agricultural production and high food price inflation at home, India actually became a big exporter of agri-commodities to an international market facing a foodgrain shortage. Rice exports in 2012-13 rose by 41% from a year earlier while wheat exports jumped from 740,000 tonnes to over 6.4 million tonnes (a whopping 773% jump). "In recent years, the government has attempted to bring down the economic costs of the food subsidy by resorting to heavy exports when international prices are high," says an agricultural expert with an international organization.

(In order to boost agri-exports,…)
NEW DELHI: Exports of several agriculture products including rice , spices and tobacco have registered negative growth in August mainly due to decline in prices in the global commodity market.
Tea, coffee, cereals, cashew and oil meals too recorded negative growth during the month.
In all, 8 out of 13 main agriculture products that are closely monitored by the Commerce Ministry, were in the negative zone.
"Prices of agri-produce in the global market is generally depressed due to over supply. But, on the other hand, prices here are much above the global prices making domestic market a better option than exports," said Ajay Sahai, DG & CEO of Federation of Indian Export Organisations .
"These twin factors are primarily responsible for decline in exports of many agri commodities," he added.
During the month, exports of rice, spices and tobacco declined by 3.15 per cent to $ 600 million, 2.18 per cent to $ 227 million and 14.7 per cent to $ 73 million respectively, according to the data of the Commerce Ministry.
Other products which have reported negative growth include tea (6.72 per cent), coffee (10.5 per cent), cereals (50.6 per cent), cashew (1.82 per cent) and oil meals (64.3 per cent).
Decline in these exports is a key factor for slow growth in India's overall merchandise exports. Growth rate of India's exports slipped to 5-month low of 2.35 per cent in August at $ 26.95 billion, pushing up the trade deficit to $ 10.83 billion.
Agri-products account for over 10 per cent of the country's total exports.
As per estimates, outbound shipments of agri-produce in 2010-11 amounted $ 17.35 billion; $ 27.43 billion in 2011-12; $ 31.86 billion in 2012-13 and about $ 45 billion in 2013-14.
In order to boost agri-exports, the Commerce Ministry is asking exporters to explore new markets and ship value-added products.
Sectors which grew at a healthy rate in August include oil seeds (37.2 per cent), fruits and vegetables (3.46 per cent), processed items (6.71 per cent), marine products (35.5 per cent) and meat, dairy and poultry items (37.2 per cent).

Bimaru Madhya Pradesh now fastest-growing state in IndiaHowever, MP’s industrial growth rate has been weak, just 4.9% and 2.8% in the last two years. Agricultural growth is bound to slow down.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
By SA Aiyar
For several years, Bihar has been India's fastest-growing state. In 2013-14 it has been overtaken by another backward state, Madhya Pradesh , which grew 11.08% against the national 4.7%. MP has averaged over 10% in the last three years, even as national rate has plummeted.
Till the 1990s, backward states in the Hindi belt grew slowly, dragging India down. But in the 2000s, new leaders like Nitish Kumar in Bihar and Shivraj Singh Chouhan in MP have converted once-backward states into growth leaders, pulling India up.
Agriculture has been MP's dynamo, averaging over 20% growth for three years. This is fabulous: rarely in history has any region consistently averaged even 10%. Chouhan's irrigation thrust has quadrupled the irrigated area to 28 lakh hectares, completing major Narmada projects. The old power shortages have been replaced by surplus power, facilitating tubewell irrigation.
However, MP's industrial growth rate has been weak, just 4.9% and 2.8% in the last two years. Agricultural growth is bound to slow down. A recent survey by Dreze and Khera placed MP last of 10 states in implementing welfare schemes. Chouhan knows he must diversify the economy, and improve governance. He plans a Global Investors Summit on October 9, to be inaugurated by Narendra Modi.
There are parallels between Nitish's ouster of Lalu Yadav in Bihar and Chouhan's ouster of Digvijay Singh in Madhya Pradesh. Lalu's caste and religious combinations helped him win three elections in a row, but lack of development ultimately proved his nemesis. Digvijay Singh also won two elections in a row, using the jod-tod approach, the making and breaking of coalitions of vote banks, but then lost because of economic stagnation. In his second term, MP's growth rate averaged a pathetic 1.9% annually. Then the BJP came to power, and growth soared to 6.9% in its first term and 9.1% annually in its second term. As in Bihar, fast growth repeatedly proved an election winner.
Digvijay Singh, like all Congress leaders, never viewed economic development as critical in winning elections. Far more important, he believed, was jod-tod, using patronage networks, subsidies and pay-offs to woo key vote banks and break others' vote banks. This was the Congress strategy for decades, since it traditionally had the deepest pockets and biggest patronage networks. As the party of Independence, the Congress aimed for a rainbow coalition of all votebanks. But in due course, various regional and caste vote banks developed parties of their own, and beat the Congress in jod-tod.
Lalu Yadav first united the backward castes and then used the Yadav-Muslim combination to win elections. He said dignity mattered, not economic development. This formula worked for some time, but ultimately proved electorally disastrous. Nitish Kumar came to power on the platform of good governance, not GDP growth. But good governance, by jailing thousands of gangsters, ended the fear that had stymied investment and trade in Lalu's time, so the economy soared. This was helped by economic liberalization in New Delhi that had created record GDP growth, record revenue growth, and hence record transfers of central cash to backward states. Nitish used this to invest massively in roads and other infrastructure, which further stimulated the economy. This made Bihar India's fastest growing state.
Digvijay Singh neglected infrastructure and growth for too long. When Chhattisgarh was hived off as a separate state, MP lost most of its mines and power stations, and plunged into a power crisis. The Pay Commission award of 1998 left many states bust, including MP. Digvijay, in his last two years, embarked on building nine major roads, but it was too little, too late. The BJP fought the 2003 election on a bijli-sadak-paani platform and thrashed him. The BJP got off to a bad start with two CMs (Uma Bharti and Babulal Gaur) in two years, but then Chouhan came to power and stayed. He started diffidently but, like Nitish, found conditions conducive. The reforms that had created record national growth also created record transfers of central cash to his state, enabling him to invest massively in infrastructure. In Bihar and MP, the resulting fast growth created an even faster growth of local revenue. Growth, revenue and infrastructure spiralled up in a virtuous cycle, and won elections too. Both states are still poor and corrupt, but less so, and now have a future.
When Bihar was partitioned, Jharkhand got most of the minerals, power plants, and revenue. MP faced an identical problem when Chhattisgarh was hived off. In both states, partition was viewed as an economic disaster. Yet Nitish and Chouhan both proved that development-oriented leadership could offset dire economic conditions and stoke record growth. That heartening lesson bodes well for India's future.

Jobs gallore in ecommerce space;1.5 lakh jobs likely in 2-3 yearsAmazon
(The current estimated size…)
NEW DELHI: Its raining jobs in the e-commerce space as this segment could grow at 20-25 per cent over the next 2-3 years in terms of jobs, salaries and growth, which in turn could create at least 1,50,000 jobs.
The current estimated size of the industry is about Rs 18,000 crore and is expected to reach Rs 50,000 crore by 2016 and as the industry grows, the demand for talent would grow proportionally.
"We are extremely bullish on the ecommerce sector in India. There are nearly 200 start-ups flush with PE/VC funds within this area and several hundred that are treading the same lines. We believe over the next 2-3 yrs, this sector will create at least 1,50,000 jobs," Antal International Network India Managing Director Joseph Devasia said.
Commenting on this trend, Mani Sankar Das Gupta, Chief, Placement Unit, BITS Pilani said "the industry is very bullish, the main players- Amazon , eBay, Flipkart, Myntra etc. are regular recruiters from BITS and are now generating huge revenues, and have increased the number of hiring this year."
Since the sector is fairly new, there is a severe dearth of talent at all levels and in order to attract and retain key talent some of the leading ecommerce players today are even shelling out "crore+" salaries.
On this, BITS Pilani's Gupta said "In India, most ecommerce players increased the salaries by 10-40 per cent between 2013 to 2014 and are now paying salaries ranging from Rs 10-23 lacs and are hiring large entry level employees.
At mid & senior level also salaries are swelling by 10-15 per cent every year, besides the priceless stock options that are offered, that makes employees millionaires," Gupta added.
Jayesh Pandey, Managing Director, Talent & Organisation at Accenture India believes, "salaries in this sector are likely to see a higher degree of ESOPs and performance based rewards as compared to other industries".
Rajiv Srivatsa COO & Co-founder Urban Ladder said: " We are at par with most other e-commerce companies in terms of salary. Along with the salary component, employee stock options attract a lot of talent since the industry is on a massive growth path".
Indian Staffing Federation executive director Suchita Dutta said "E-commerce hiring is extremely bullish with the sector alone ready to hire over 15,000 in the next 5 months. The upscale is largely driven by robust positive sentiment both amongst consumers as well as the industry."
The indicative salary outlook for junior employees is Rs 1.45 lakh-Rs 3 lakh per annum, while for mid-management it is between Rs 12 lakh-Rs 30 lakh per annum, Dutta added.

The work habits that will make you successfulThe Work Habits That Will Make You Successful
>
LinkedIn Influencer, James Caan , published this post originally on LinkedIn .
It doesn’t matter whether you are just starting out on your career or if you have years of experience behind you - making sure you have the right attitude and approach is vital.
And having the right attitude does not come about by accident; it comes from establishing the very best working practices and habits.
When I am looking to employ or promote people, one of the key qualities I always look for is a thirst for excellence. The very best people, in any walk of life, are those who are constantly challenging themselves and are setting themselves new targets.
And if you want to be one of those characters who is always looking to move forward and better themselves then you need to have the kind of working habits in place that will lead to success. Here are a few examples:
Self-motivation
There is an old saying that says if you’re standing still, you’re going backwards, and this is especially true in career terms. Are you somebody who is happy with your current skill set, or do you actively look to improve? If it is the latter, then you are exactly the sort of person most bosses look for. Put yourself forward for training courses, learn new skills - the more you push yourself and expand your skill set, the more valuable you become to your current and potential employers.
Commercially minded
This is basically about being proactive and removing yourself from your individual bubble. Think about the wider aims of the business you work for. Where could things improve, where could even more value be added? By having the overall vision of the business in your head, you will find new ways to generate revenue, brand awareness, or any other goals senior managers might have.
Ownership
There is nothing better for a manager than to see his or her employees actively taking ownership of projects. Equally, nobody wants to be seen as someone who passes the buck. If something falls under your remit, ensure you are the one who sees it through – even if you inevitably have to delegate certain aspects of it.
Focus
I have spoken before about having the ability to ignore what I call the ‘noise’. This means being able to prioritise between the essential and non-essential, and focusing your energies on things that add the most value. Too many employees tend to get caught up in the ‘nice to have’ activities rather than things which are more critical to the business. The other advantage of prioritising your workload is that the quality ends up being far better. If you have ten things you need to get done, I would much rather you produced outstanding results on the most important ones, rather than mediocre results on all ten.
Self-reflective
Throughout my career I have always been in the habit of regularly assessing my work and personal performance. At regular intervals I will analyse what I’ve done, how my businesses have performed and what I need to do differently. By having this ability to reflect – and sometimes criticise yourself - you are making sure lessons are learnt every step of the way.
 

Top performers benefit as India Inc goes all out to retain talentFirms like PepsiCo, Coca Cola ,others institute rewards and recognition programmes to retain talent

(Employers are realising that…)
NEW DELHI: Top performers at PepsiCo India can look forward to a cracker of a Diwali. Apart from the annual global rewards programme, vying for the chance to go to New York to meet PepsiCo's senior leadership team as well as colleagues from different regions for four-five days, top performers in the foods business could get free tickets for cricket World Cup 2015 in Australia this festive season.
In the war for talent in the resurgent job market, companies are thinking of big and frequent rewards for top talent. Employers are realising that compensation, company merchandise and annual bonuses may not be enough to retain key talent. Benefits now include perks such as those at PepsiCo, exotic vacations to locations like Greece and Monaco, and mid-year bonuses.
Since companies want to retain volumes, a large number of performers, especially millennials, are also being lured through rewards such as shopping vouchers for Flipkart and Snapdeal besides iPhones and tablets. Hemant Upadhyay, managing consultant and leader of executive rewards practice at Hay Group in India, has seen a sea change in rewards and benefits strategies of companies in the current job market.
"Employees, especially the millennials, at the junior to mid levels need much more than compensation to stay on, as they have lesser liabilities and immense opportunities. Technology is a hit with this pool of talent, so companies are doling out benefits like iPhones and the latest gadgets or online vouchers, and are making specific tailormade plans for senior employees to suit their individual needs. Rewards can't be taken for granted anymore," he said.
Upadhyay recalls one of the more special rewards this year — a client transferring the title of a company owned house to a senior executive. "It worked as a great retention tool, as the company thought that instead of stocks and compensation, the house which was provided by the company to the employee could be given to him provided he retires with them, as it would have tremendous emotional value for him. The location and architecture was such that he wouldn't have been able to buy it on his own," he said.
Given the optimism in the job market, stocks may come back into vogue and may be given to those just below the senior level who otherwise may not be entitled to them, said Shiv Agrawal, managing director of ABC Consultants.
"One clear trend is companies increasingly looking at providing benefits which give a sense of investing in self to employees. Executive education programmes are becoming increasingly popular too," he said. At Coca Cola India, a cross-functional team that conceptualized its Support My School programme, was sent to Russia and Turkey this year to learn of similar community development and sustainability projects there.
Over at Vodafone, Strike Force is the telecom company's premier programme for recognition of best performers across all circles. Top management executives accompany this select group on trips to locations such as Greece and Turkey and felicitate them at an awards ceremony. Platinum Club, the premier awards programme under Microsoft's Circle of Excellence platform, recognises top performers at a global level.
The grand prize is a stay of four nights at the Monte Carlo Bay Hotel in Monaco. "We have instituted such rewards and recognition programmes to thank employees for giving Microsoft their best every day, for believing in our brand, our culture and values, our passion for technology and innovation, our career development programmes and our social impact," said Rohit Thakur, head of HR for Microsoft in India.
PepsiCo even has a deferred bonus payout scheme to pep up employees. "This has been developed with an aim to motivate employees in the middle of the year and to increase the overall quantum of bonus payouts," said a spokesperson. Indian employers are moving away from kitchen appliances, dinner sets and dry fruits to fashion apparel and accessories besides gadgets such as iPhones, said Sagar Chaudhuri, CEO and co-founder of Bangalore-based HighFives.
 
Having worked in companies such as JP Morgan, Infosys, ICICI and Genpact, Chaudhuri and his cofounders felt there was a paucity of innovative rewards and recognition practices in companies. HighFives helps them manage reward processes with minimum administrative overheads. Chaudhuri said its reward programmes work on a point-based system. Employees can redeem points awarded for various assignments on HighFives.
Electronic gadgets such as microwaves and washing machines aside, iPhones, tablets and shopping vouchers from Jabong, Flipkart and Myntra are a hit with employees. At HCL Technologies, the share of incremental earnings to top-performing employees has increased, which means top performers are likely to get a higher proportion of rewards.

Pakistan Taliban switches side; vows to send jihadists to help Islamic StatePress Trust of India | Islamabad | Posted: October 5, 2014 2:14 pm
The Pakistani Taliban has switched allegiance to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, which has been vying for supremacy with the al-Qaeda in the region, and vowed to send jihadists to help the ruthless terror group. Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) headed by fugitive
Mullah Fazlullah issued a statement on Saturday ahead of Eid ul-Azha, expressing support for the ISIS or IS, which has captured swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria.
Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi declared himself as Caliph of the Islamic State. TTP spokesman Shahidullah Shahid sent Fazlullah’s Eid message to media which said that all Muslim fighters in the Middle East should unite for the greater good. “We consider the fighters in Iraq and Syria as our brothers and are proud of their victories. We are their part and parcel in times of joy and sadness,” the statement said.
“The Muslim nation has great expectations from the fighters in Iraq and Syria. We are with you in the hour of trial and will support you in all possible ways,” it added. IS is a splinter group of the al-Qaeda which has distanced itself from the outfit, chiding it for its aggressive and brutal expansion.
Al-Qaeda, which includes dozens of Pakistan-based terror groups and sectarian outfits, is facing challenges from IS which is trying to extend its influence into South Asia. Despite the rhetoric of militants, it is highly unlikely that Taliban at this stage are in a position to help the IS or other militant groups in Middle East.
Taliban command and control system has been destroyed by army in North Waziristan and they are constantly on the run. They have also suffered internal splits and some powerful militants like Omer Khalid Khurasani have parted ways with the group by creating Jamaat-ul-Ahrar outfit.
Similarly, TTP lost support of Taliban’s Punjabi faction whose leader Asmatullah Muawiya has announced not to fight the Pakistani security forces. There are several question marks whether the TTP can send its jihadists to fight on the side of IS due to geographical
and logistical problems. As far as support through money or weapons is concerned, the Taliban is not a rich organisation to give material support to others.
In the past, TTP could help other militant group by offering a handful of suicide bombers, but it seems that the outfit is running short of them as there is dramatic decline in such attacks since North Waziristan operation where their centers to train suicide bombers have been destroyed.

Aamir Khan talks about sports in the 1st episode of  Satyamev Jayate 3Print

The show with a cause ‘Satyamev Jayate’ is back with its third season. The first episode, that premiered today simultaneously on Star Plus and DD National, talked about Sports and how they can change one’s life.
To begin with, as the show’s format goes, there was an inspirational story of juvenile Akhilesh Kumar who was a drug addict, but was tempted into playing football instead of doing drugs. He went ahead to coach children in a red light area and even captaining his side in Homeless World Cup in Brazil in 2010.
Next guests were wrestler sisters Babita Kumari and Gita Kumari and how their father made wrestling change their future and brought them in pace with the male population.
Saina Nehwal made a special appearance in the episode and shared her story.
There was also a story of a nine-year-old pro golfer Shubham Jaglan. Sports lawyer Rahul Mehra also spoke of the need of a sports law to ensure the equal and fair promotion of every sport by the government, not just cricket. And thankfully, there was no mention of cricket in the whole episode.
Cricketing legend, Sachin Tendulkar, quite liked the whole concept and took to Twitter to express his appreciation.
Aamir’s @satyamevjayate episode was a déjà vu for me, sports4all will change country’s future #MumkinHai
— sachin tendulkar (@sachin_rt) October 5, 2014
Kiran Bedi also tweeted to show her support.
Felt very good watching prog of @aamir_khan on #MumkinHai on sports! He has spread out for sports what @PMOIndia did for #SwachhBharat
— Kiran Bedi (@thekiranbedi) October 5, 2014
Cricket commentator, Harsha Bhogle, was in disagreement with certain points mentioned in the show.
objective of sport though isn’t only to produce champions. it is to enrich yourself. one of the few great forces of our time #satyamevjayate
— Harsha Bhogle (@bhogleharsha) October 5, 2014
only point i disagree on is sportspersons running sports bodies. they might but not certain they can. need other qualities. #satyamevjayate
— Harsha Bhogle (@bhogleharsha) October 5, 2014
The first episode of season 3 looked good and the season, surely, looks promising. We can’t wait for Aamir Khan to grace our TV screens next Sunday and take on some other graver problems of/in the Indian society.

Post  Bang Bang   Hrithik Roshan keen on  mental break"Bang Bang" has been a special film for the actor.
Indo-Asian News Service | New Delhi | Posted: October 5, 2014 1:28 pm
A well-deserved break is all that’s on actor Hrithik Roshan’s mind following his latest Bollywood release “Bang Bang”. He feels a mental break would be just right before he begins work on the mega project “Mohenjo Daro”.
“I’m hoping I’ll make time for sometime away for a mental break,” Hrithik had told IANS in a telephonic interview before the release of “Bang Bang”, which hit the screens on October 2.
“Variety is very important in life. If you get monotonous in doing one thing, it will kill your enthusiasm. So it is very important to take that break and then I’ll come back with a bang with ‘Mohenjo Daro’, which is yet another very big challenge,” added the 40-year-old.

“Bang Bang” has been a special film for the actor. He has pushed his limits as far as the stunts and dance is concerned at a time when he himself was going through physical and emotional turmoil in his life.
Now after the glitzy and glamorous action in “Bang Bang”, he’s looking forward to the historical set up of “Mohenjo Daro”, which is a love story set in the Indus Valley civilisation. Gowariker has put together an ensemble of international technicians to work on the film — which will be perhaps his biggest offering to Hindi cinema.
“It’s going to be a very big film, a very big dream. I am working with Ashutosh for the second time. He’s the first director with whom I’m working with for the second time. This is going to be interesting,” he said.
Talking further about the project, which is scheduled to release ahead of Republic Day in 2016, the Bollywood hearthrob said: “The script is a beautiful love story with the backdrop of the Indus Valley civilisation. It’s something that’s never been done before. So, I am very excited about it.”

For now, Hrithik is happy and proud of the response that “Bang Bang” at the box office. The movie, directed by Siddharth Anand, is said to have recorded a collection of Rs. 51.62 crore within two days of its release.
The Fox Star Studios production, which also stars Katrina Kaif, minted Rs.27.54 crore on day one and one day two, it managed to get a business of Rs.24.08 crore.

Cameron orders spy chiefs to hunt down  Jihadi JohnBritish PM David Cameron orders spy chiefs to hunt down 'Jihadi John'

(The Prime Minister has stepped…)
LONDON: Prime Minister David Cameron has asked his spy chiefs to find Islamic State executioner 'Jihadi John' so that he could dispatch special forces to kill or capture the masked man who beheaded the latest British hostage.
The Prime Minister has stepped up the hunt for British aid worker Alan Henning's murderer, who appears in IS beheading videos and has a British accent.
He summoned the heads of MI5, MI6 and GCHQ -- the main British spy agencies -- to his Chequers country retreat yesterday and told them he wanted them to provide him with targets for a special forces raid on the IS kidnappers, The Sunday Times reported.
The meeting came 12 hours after the terrorists released a video showing the Britain-born terrorist beheading Henning, a 47-year-old former taxi driver from Salford.
Cameron stepped in as Henning's brother-in-law, Colin Livesey , and one of his friends accused the government of failing to do enough to save him.
Henning's widow Barbara said the family were "numb with grief" at his murder and thanked those who had campaigned for his release.
But Livesey, her brother, said he was "angry" with the government and criticised their handling of the case and that of David Haines, the Scottish aid worker who was beheaded last month.
"They could have done more when they knew about it months and months ago," he said.
"Just the same with David Haines as well --- I don't think they did enough for him either."
Branding the terrorists "scum," he said he prayed they "get what's coming to them."
Majid Freeman , a friend of Henning who was on the same aid convoy when he was kidnapped, said: "We have been pressuring the government into doing something to secure his release, but they abandoned him. The British government left him out there."
The newspaper said that intelligence chiefs have supplied Cameron with information about the terrorist cell holding the remaining hostages.
But the information on their whereabouts is not detailed or reliable enough for him to allow an SAS raid because the terrorist group is moving around the Syrian desert.
Henning was abducted minutes after his aid convoy entered Syria on December 26. He was the fourth Western hostage to be killed by Islamic State since mid-August, following two American journalists and another British aid worker.

Funds for 15 Air India Dreamliners unsureFunds for 15 Air India Dreamliners unsure
By Saurabh Sinha, TNN | 3 Oct, 2014, 10.29AM IST
While Delta has moved court to stop the $3.4-billion loan guarantee, Air India management has requested the Exim Bank not to stop funding the Dreamliner purchase.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
NEW DELHI: Air India's woes may have just compounded with uncertainty over funding of its purchase of Boeing's Dreamliners.
"America's Delta Airlines has challenged US Export-Import (Exim) Bank's decision to extend a soft loan to AI for buying the Dreamliners in the US Supreme Court. Their plea is that helping AI acquire these planes harms the commercial interests of US carriers," said a source.
While Delta has moved court to stop the $3.4-billion loan guarantee, Air India management has requested the Exim Bank not to stop funding the Dreamliner purchase. The Exim bank has so far funded purchase of 12 planes and now a decision has to be taken on the remaining 15 Dreamliners on AI's order book. AI is going to take delivery of the 17th Dreamliner this month.
A team of top AI officials met Exim Bank brass in the US earlier this week, requesting them to continue with the funding. "Exim Bank loan comes at a much lower rate than what we would have to pay for raising the funds from other commercial institutions. The promise of low-cost funding was among the main reasons for India's mega order to Boeing in 2005-end by UPA-I," said a source. India has given sovereign guarantee for this loan, thus justifying the reasonable rate of interest for this almost risk-free loan.
The erstwhile AI (international) had ordered 50 wide-body Boeings — 23 B-777s and 27 B-787s — for Rs 33,197 crore, along with an additional 18 narrow body B-737 for AI Express for Rs 4,952 crore.
The Dreamliners have been a source of constant troubles for all airlines. The glitches have meant its on-time performance remains below what is expected from a mint fresh aircraft. "AI is suffering from being a government organization where no decision can be taken. We bought these planes way back in 2005 at rates prevalent then. Had a private airline been in our place, it would have sold these planes at their much higher current price and made a killing. But we can't do that," said a senior pilot. The airline has started adopting the sale-and-lease-back model for Dreamliners.

Lewis Hamilton reigns after rain at SuzukaLewis Hamilton again edged out Nico Rosberg in an eventful race at Suzuka. (Source: Reuters)
Reuters | Suzuka | Posted: October 5, 2014 3:36 pm
Britain’s Lewis Hamilton won a wet Japanese Formula One Grand Prix on Sunday to complete a hat-trick of victories and extend his championship lead over Mercedes team mate Nico Rosberg to 10 points with four races remaining.
Rosberg finished second in a race that needed two starts behind the safety car and ended before the full distance due to a crash that saw Marussia’s French driver Jules Bianchi rushed to hospital.
“The driver is not conscious and has been sent to the hospital by the ambulance because the helicopter cannot fly in these conditions. Further updates will follow but for the moment we cannot say anything. I will keep you updated as fast as I can,” FIA head of communications Matteo Bonciani told reporters.
No champagne was sprayed on the podium and there were no celebrations.
Germany’s quadruple world champion Sebastian Vettel, who announced on Saturday he was leaving Red Bull at the end of the season, finished third.
The win was Hamilton’s eighth of the season and first at Suzuka, with his only other win in Japan coming at the Fuji circuit with McLaren in 2007.
The race was red-flagged with 46 of the scheduled 53 laps completed after an accident involving Sauber’s Adrian Sutil and  Bianchi brought the safety car out for the third time.
There was immediate concern in the aftermath of the accident over Bianchi’s well-being with the medical car and an ambulance being dispatched to the scene of the crash.

Falcao  De Gea save Manchester United from fallFalaco missed four chances but finally scored a poacher's goal as United claimed a deserved win. (Source: Reuters)
Associated Press | Manchester | Posted: October 5, 2014 8:47 pm | Updated: October 5, 2014 8:51 pm
Radamel Falcao scored his first goal for Manchester United in a 2-1 win over Everton on Sunday as the Red Devils won consecutive Premier League games for the first time under manager Louis Van Gaal.
Angel Di Maria opened the scoring for the hosts before United `keeper David de Gea saved a penalty from Leighton Baines.
The England international then picked out Steven Naismith, who put the teams level in the 55th minute.
Falcao, who joined United on loan from Monaco during the summer, sealed his team’s win seven minutes later, slotting home past Tim Howard after di Maria’s shot landed in the Colombian’s path.
“Everton got chances outside the box and they had good shots, but David De Gea was fantastic,” Van Gaal said. “Falcao was forcing himself last week against West Ham. I told him to be satisfied about his performances and that the goals are coming. The goals are coming. He will be even better after the international break.”
De Gea made a stunning save in stoppage time to tip over the bar Bryan Oviedo’s left-foot shot from 20 meters.
Falaco missed four chances but finally scored a poacher’s goal as United, which played without the suspended Wayne Rooney, claimed a deserved win after dominating from the start at Old Trafford.
Di Maria put the hosts in front with a curled effort past Howard from Juan Mata’s cross for his third goal of the season before Naismith got the better of Luke Shaw and headed home.
De Gea was decisive throughout, denying Leon Osman and Oviedo after stopping Baines’ penalty kick.
“What was my most important save? Maybe the penalty,” De Gea said. “Every save is important but the team played very well. I think the younger players in the team will learn from these types of games. The team and the manager need to look forward.”
Baines had scored 14 penalties from 14 attempts before his attempt at the bottom left was thwarted by De Gea.
“I think David is the guy the who deserves this reward rather than myself, he saved us throughout the game and particularly towards the end and the penalty as well so not only him but the rest of the side deserve this,” said Di Maria after being named man of the match.

Sharapova holds on to win China Open  Djokovic tames Berdychharapova hit 18 winners compared to Kvitova's 25 but committed 15 less unforced errors than her opponent's 44 to prevail in the three-setter. (Source: AP)
Reuters | Beijing | Posted: October 5, 2014 7:45 pm
World number one Novak Djokovic destroyed Tomas Berdych in a lop-sided contest to win his fifth China Open crown on Sunday while Maria Sharapova overcame Petra Kvitova 6-4 2-6 6-3 in the women’s final to move up to number two in the world rankings.
Top seed Djokovic took 66 minutes to seal a 6-0 6-2 win against Berdych, who raised his arms in celebration when he won a game to avoid the ignominy of a double bagel with the Serb leading 6-0 5-0 and serving for the match.
Berdych managed to win back-to-back games, but it was just a matter of time before Djokovic sealed an easy win to continue his love affair with the Beijing tournament where he now has a 24-0 record.
Earlier in the women’s final, Wimbledon champion Kvitova broke her opponent in the very first game but Sharapova showed greater intensity towards the end to prevail in a contest that lasted two hours and 28 minutes.
French Open champion Sharapova broke her Czech opponent twice to claim the first set, but Kvitova unleashed 15 winners in the second to force a decider.
Sharapova, having dropped her first set in the tournament, raised her game in the third, racing to a 3-0 lead but could not capitalise on her first match point at 5-2 with an inside out forehand into the net.
She eventually served out the match and raised her hands in celebration after Kvitova buried a return into the net.
“It was a bit of an up-and-down match I’d say — maybe not the best out of the tournament,” Sharapova told reporters.
“But it’s never easy playing against Petra. You don’t always quite get a good rhythm. She goes for a lot of shots, very deep, and she’s a very good, confident player.
“She became the more aggressive player in the second set. I think I took a few too many steps back and let her play that way. But I was able to lift my game again in the third and come out with a win,” she added.
Sharapova hit 18 winners compared to Kvitova’s 25 but committed 15 less unforced errors than her opponent’s 44 to prevail in the three-setter.
Kvitova, who won in Wuhan last week, conceded she had succumbed to fatigue towards the end of the contest.
“I was tired, but it was a final, and every time I’m playing a final, I’m giving everything I have inside,” the Czech said.
“What I did today was a great battle. It was small things and small points that make the difference in the end. I had some chances but Maria just didn’t let them go.

Jose Mourinho  Chelsea have the last laughWenger could face disciplinary action after shoving Mourinho in the chest midway through the first half after a heated exchange of views. (Source: Reuters)
Reuters | London | Posted: October 5, 2014 10:00 pm
Jose Mourinho maintained his hold over Arsene Wenger with leaders Chelsea enjoying a routine 2-0 win over Arsenal on Sunday after the two old adversaries became involved in an ugly touchline spat.
Wenger could face disciplinary action after shoving Mourinho in the chest midway through the first half after a heated exchange of views.
It was Mourinho, once again, who had the last laugh though with goals from Eden Hazard and Diego Costa securing a win to stretch Chelsea’s lead at the top to five points.
Mourinho is yet to taste defeat when up against Wenger, winning seven and drawing five of their clashes.
Chelsea were not at their best but for all Arsenal’s possession they rarely looked like replying once Hazard had earned and converted a 27th minute spot kick.
The hosts appeared content to sit back in the second half until former Arsenal skipper Cesc Fabregas, up against his old club for the first time since returning to the Premier League from Barcelona, sent Costa clear with 12 minutes remaining to wrap up the points.
Costa had been quiet throughout but took his tally to nine league goals in seven matches for the Blues.
The only worry for Chelsea was a first-half head injury to keeper Thibaut Courtois who soldiered on for a while before being replaced by Petr Cech.
After a 15-minute delay caused by an incident with a flare outside the stadium, the opening half proved a feisty affair.
Arsenal began in confident fashion with Alexis Sanchez having the first shot in anger.
The Chilean was in the thick of the action minutes later when stretching to reach a Jack Wilshere through ball he accidentally clattered into Courtois.
Sanchez was then on the receiving end of a hefty challenge from Gary Cahill that had Wenger incensed and storming into Mourinho’s technical area.
When Mourinho confronted the Frenchman, Wenger offered a two-handed shove into the chest of the Portuguese who last season described his rival as a “specialist in failure”.
Wenger was lucky to escape punishment from the referee but the incident raised the decibel level in the stadium and appeared to spark the hosts into life.
Shortly after a still groggy Courtois was helped off, Chelsea took the lead.
Hazard’s swerving run was ended abruptly by Laurent Koscielny for a penalty that the Belgian fired into the bottom left corner.
Arsenal playmaker Mesut Ozil flitted in and out of the game and ironic home cheers greeted one tackle on the German by Fabregas who displayed calm authority throughout an often tetchy afternoon.
Chelsea went close to extending their lead after the break when Hazard’s low cross was almost sliced into his own goal by Mathieu Flamini.
The fleet-footed Hazard became increasingly influential, giving young left back continued…

Won t criticise Shiv Sena as tribute to Bal Thackeray: ModiInto his second day of campaigning for the October 15 elections in Maharashtra, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Sunday that he would not criticise former ally Shiv Sena out of respect for its late leader, Bal Thackeray.

"Political pundits are saying why is Modi not criticising Shiv Sena in his speeches (during poll campaign). This is the first election in absence of late Bal Thackeray, for whom I have great respect. I have decided not to utter a single word against Shiv Sena. This is my tribute to Balasaheb Thackeray.
"There are some things which are above politics...There are feelings. Not everything should be linked to politics," the 64-year-old BJP leader said addressing a poll rally at Tasgaon in Sangli district of western Maharashtra.

The soft approach set off talk about the possibility of the BJP and Sena coming together after the polls, in case neither was able to form the government on its own. Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari had told HT last week the BJP may have a post-poll alliance with the Sena in such circumstances.
But Modi asked the media not to speculate. Pointing out that certain things were beyond politics, he told a rally in Tasgaon in Sangli district, “These are the first assembly elections to be held without Balasaheb... I have great respect for him.”
He also appealed to voters to give the BJP a clear majority, saying “alliances did you no good... No party takes responsibility in alliances. The BJP will take responsibility if you vote it to power”.   
Modi, who began his speech in Marathi, launched a scathing on Pawar for his comments about Shivaji "plundering" the treasury of Surat.
Read: Now, Pawar hits back at PM Modi
"Pawar's statement has hurt me deeply. You don't have knowledge of history. Gujarat was part of Maharashtra prior to its formation in 1960. We have considered Maharashtra as big brother," he said.
"I want to ask Pawar: you speak of Shivaji. It was the Vajpayee government which named Mumbai airport after Shivaji. You were CM but did not think of it. Even Victoria Terminus was named Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus by Vajpayee government," the PM said. "There is no chance of you (Pawar) getting Shivaji's qualities in your character. But as agriculture minister, had you implemented Shivaji's water management techniques, farmers of Maharashtra would not have committed suicide."
Modi added, "I am amazed. Pawar was the Union agriculture minister. But in his Maharashtra, around 3,700 farmers commit suicide every year. It does not befit Pawar to talk of Shivaji. The statue of Shivaji in Surat is much bigger than the one in your Baramati (Pawar's constituency in western Maharashtra).”
“Stop challenging our Shiv bhakti,” he said.
At a recent poll rally, Pawar had attacked the BJP, saying that the people who had termed Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj a 'looter' were invoking the warrior king to seek votes.
"They never even celebrated Shiv Jayanti and suddenly they have realised the importance of Shivaji Maharaj. All this is for votes only. BJP is well aware that it would not be able to reach out to the masses using its so-called icons and that's why is using Shivaji Maharaj's name and seeking people's blessings," Pawar had said.
Attacking the Congress and the NCP, Modi said both were of the same mould as far as corruption was concerned. "These are the people who robbed Kargil widows of their homes and jobs from youth. They have destroyed Maharashtra," he said. "Do you want to get Maharashtra out of the morass of corruption? I am willing to take responsibility, but elect a government with full majority."

He said had had the Congress-led UPA government completed work on Narmada project, Maharashtra would have got free electricity worth Rs. 400 crore per year. "Why are sugar mills in Maharashtra closed?" he asked. "The Amul success story of Gujarat is now globally famous but you made sugar mills hub of politics," he said.
Modi began his speech by hailing Chhatrapati Shivaji and paid tributes to Ganesh and Piroba deities. "Sangli, sarvat changli (Sangli is the best of all)," he said. "I am a kaamdar (worker) among all these amdars and khasdars (MLAs and MPs)," Modi said.
"India is shining in the US not because of Modi, but because of the 125 crore people. This is the power of full majority," he said.
Modi said he had asked officials to check how much percentage of natural fruit could be put in soft drinks. "This will ensure that fruits produced by farmers don't rot. I am going ahead with the 'Make In India' mantra so that youth get jobs.”
Modi concluded his speech with an appeal to the crowd to leave the rally venue only after making sure that the ground was free of litter. He also spoke of the Swachh Bharat campaign aimed at creating a clean India.

India has alerted Bangladesh that the bombs being assembled in a house in West Bengal were meant for terror strikes in that country, HT has learnt. A blast in a house in Burdwan on October 2 killed two alleged bomb-makers, both of them Bangladeshis.
The men and rest of the group were members of a module of Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB), a terror group with close links to the Jamaat-e-Islami, a banned fundamentalist outfit vehemently opposed to the Hasina regime, sources said.
Rumi Bibi, whose husband Shamim Shakil Ahmed died in the blast with Svopan Mondal, also told security agencies that in the last three months they had sent four consignments of bombs to Bangladesh through couriers, who she named as Kausar and Rasiq.  The bombs they were making were not meant for attacks in India, she said.
Top Indian intelligence officials passed on the information to Bangladesh’s top intelligence agency the National Security Intelligence and the country’s Director General of Forces Intelligence in Dhaka.
Rumi and Ameena Bibi, whose husband Abdul Hakim was injured in the blast, were detained on Thursday but were arrested on Sunday morning. Hakim is being treated at the Burdwan medical college hospital and had refused to cooperate, sources said.

Security agencies, with the help of local police, Sunday conducted raids at least three places in West Bengal to nab JMB cadres. They were also looking for a Murshidabad-based “religious motivator”, sources said. 
It is understood that Bangaldesh has given to India the names of three JMB members involved in anti-government activities and are said to be based in Bengal.
The police and security agencies also interrogated Mondal’s wife Akina, house-owner Hassan Choudhury and Ameena. Ameena’s father, who lives in Murshidabad, had fought the gram panchayat elections on the ruling Trinamool Congress ticket but lost to the CPM candidate.
Twenty-five hand grenades, some 10 ready-for-use improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and large quantities of ammonium nitrate, iron oxide, hydrogen peroxide and other chemicals used in making bombs were recovered from the spot, sources said.
The chemicals, Rumi said, were bought from Kolkata. Timer devices, too, were seized. A lathe machine, recovered from the house, was used for making pistols, she said.
The information was shared with Union home secretary Anil Goswami in a meeting with security agencies on Saturday. There were suggestions that the federal anti-terror body the National Investigative Agency be handed over the case as it had international repercussions. But, on account of “sensitivities” of the Mamata Banerjee government and the fact that law and order is a state subject, the suggestion was being looked into.

Staged riot is a bloody Dussehra custom at this Andhra templeComments
There is a temple in Andhra Pradesh where devotees go all equipped to kill or be killed. Every Dussehra night, the Devaragattu temple in Kurnool district of Andhra Pradesh witnesses frenzy where hundreds of men wielding long sticks (lathis) hit each other on heads.
The event, called Banni festival, at the temple located near the Andhra-Karnataka border, draws people from both states in huge numbers. The ritual takes place at midnight when the procession idols of the ruling deities Malamma (Parvati) and Malleshwara Swamy (Shiva) are brought down the hill temple at Neraneki.
Men, mostly farmers, do not budge even as their white shirts are drenched red with blood and the “victory parade” to commemorate the killing of a demon by Mala-Malleshwara continues till the break of dawn.

Medical teams are deployed and doctors ready to stitch heads but many just smear turmeric on the wound and go about the business.
Temple authorities refute any suggestion of violence in the whole episode.
“It is like dandiya only that we use large sticks. Devotees are charged at that time and in the swirling of the sticks some get hurt,” Ramkumar Shastri, a priest at the temple tells HT. “In olden days, it used to be axes, spears etc.”
The ritual in the region once under the Vijayanagara Empire is said to be centuries old and according to a local police official, has one hundred years of recorded history.

The records though do not show many deaths. According to the district police 113 were injured in 2012, 34 in 2013. On Friday night, 56 were injured. A man was killed in 2006 but police say it was a revenge killing committed with the ritual as a cover-up.
Kurnool SP Ake Ravikrishna says that they conduct awareness camps, clampdown on arrack sale and bind over the anti-social elements but on the Dussehra night, about 1,000 police personnel at the venue are mostly limited to the audience as the sentiments and tempers run high.
Here are some more pictures from the festival:

Crude oil price may stay low for some timeCrude oil price may stay low for some time
Ishan Bakshi & Sudheer Pal Singh | New Delhi Oct 06, 2014 12:57 AM IST
The slump in global crude oil prices is not a blip and rates are unlikely to touch $110 a barrel anytime soon. The European benchmark Brent recently tumbled to $90 a barrel, its lowest level in 27 months.
A range of factors is pointing to bearish global oil prices for months. This means lower losses on fuel sales by Indian oil companies and a shrinking oil subsidy bill for the government.
Three months ago, the new government's Budget had pencilled this year's fuel subsidy at Rs 63,000 crore, a 26 per cent decline from last year. It had assumed average crude oil prices of $105-110 a barrel. Now, this is turning into a gross overestimate, with most analysts writing down losses of oil companies for selling fuel cheaper than market prices.
ICRA Research had earlier projected underrecovery on fuel sales to decrease to Rs 1 lakh crore in 2014-15 from Rs 1.39 lakh crore the previous financial year. This was based on an average price of the Indian basket of crude oil at $108 a barrel. The research house now reckons the underrecovery will be Rs 90,000 crore if the crude oil price remains low for the rest of the year. "If crude oil prices decline further in the medium term because of structural factors, such as a sustained rise in North American oil production from shale oil and tar sands, and a gradual unwinding of quantitative easing programme by the US Federal Reserve paring speculative positions in petroleum exchanges, the underrecovery can potentially decline further," ICRA said in a recent note.
India imports 75 per cent of its crude oil requirements. According to the petroleum ministry, the country bought nearly 189 million tonnes of crude oil, for $142 billion, in 2013-14. Around two-thirds of this came from West Asia, including Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Iran. Another big chunk came from Venezuela and Libya.
Production and exports in many of these countries, which have experienced disruptions in recent years, are set to begin again. "One million more barrels of oil per day could enter the market when Iran's nuclear issue is resolved. Iraq's oil production recently hit a 30-year high, even as its oil industry rebuilds after a war and decades of underinvestment. Several hundred thousand more barrels of oil per day are expected to come online this year alone," Jesse Colombo, a contributor to Forbes magazine, wrote in an article earlier this year.
There are equally pressing factors at play on the demand side. Since the financial crisis of 2008, policies of central banks across the world led to a flood of money pouring into various asset classes. The situation is now expected to change. With unemployment in the US dropping to 5.9 per cent and with revised estimates showing the US economy growing at 4.6 per cent annualised rate, the likelihood of the US Fed raising interest rates early next year has risen. This could put an end to the era of cheap money.
Higher US interest rates, coupled with the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan embarking on their versions of quantitative easing, are likely to strengthen the dollar. Its impact is expected to be felt on commodity prices. "Typically, when the dollar strengthens, it exerts a downward pressure on commodity prices," said an industry expert.
"The impact of this on the trajectory of oil prices needs to be seen in conjunction with a weakening economic outlook in the euro zone and China, and the increasing dependence of the US on shale gas," said Shubhada Rao, chief economist at YES Bank.
Oil production in the US is expected to touch 9.2 million barrels a day in 2015. Additionally, there has also been a nearly 40 per cent increase in US natural gas production since 2007 which could further reduce the country's dependence on oil. Also, analysts expect China's economic growth to slow down to seven per cent in 2014, another factor that could keep oil prices low.
"If ever there were a geopolitical world that should be driving oil prices higher, it would seem to be right now," Foreign Policy magazine quotes Daniel Yergin, vice-chairman of energy consultancy IHS, as saying, in a recent article. "But what it tells you is how powerful the fundamentals of the market are, and right now the fundamentals are winning."
Analysts estimate if oil prices average $100 a barrel for the whole year, India's current account deficit is likely to be in the range of 1.6-1.7 per cent of gross domestic product. But if prices average around $90, the deficit could fall to 1.3-1.5 per cent.
According to CARE Ratings Chief Economist Madan Sabanavis, with every $10-a-barrel decline in crude oil prices, India's oil import bill will fall by $16-17 billion. This will substantially reduce the current account deficit.
The average of Brent crude oil price in 2011-12 was $114.5 a barrel. Since then, it had fallen around $3 a year until March this year. During this period, India was able to end its petrol subsidy. However, Brent has averaged $105.65 so far this year. As prices have started falling lately, the real impact will be felt in the import bill, inflation and the current account deficit in coming quarters.

What to watch for today
Hong Kong faces an ultimatum. The city’s chief executive gave protestors until this morning  to clear the streets, or he will “take all necessary actions to restore social order.” Tens of thousands of people gathered at the protest’s epicenter over the weekend but started pulling back on Sunday .
HP splits in two. The company will announce plans to separate its PC and printer businesses from its hardware and services operations next year,  according to the Wall Street Journal  (paywall). The move would come less than a week after eBay said it will  officially spin off PayPal  as a separate company.
Brazil’s new president, part one. The country awaits first-round results in its election battle between incumbent Dilma Rousseff and challenger Marina Silva, who would be the country’s first Afro-Brazilian president. With third candidate Aecio Neves in the mix, neither is likely to garner the majority of votes required for an outright win in this round.
Global number-crunching. Factory orders are due out from Germany; the US  Federal Reserve will begin publishing a new monthly index of US labor market conditions; and the Bank of Japan and the central banks of Portuguese-speaking countries will hold meetings.
ISIL airstrikes continue. The world awaits an official response to the apparent beheading of British taxi driver Alan Denny  by ISIL jihadists , an aid worker in Syria who was kidnapped in 2013. Australia has now given its military the go-ahead to  join the US-led coalition , but only in Iraq.
Over the weekend 
Womb transplants became possible. A woman in Sweden gave birth  using a transplanted womb for the first time. The 36-year-old mother, born without a uterus but with functioning ovaries, received one from a friend in her 60s. Until now, the only options for women without wombs were surrogacy or adoption.
“Baby Doc” died. The former dictator of Haiti, Jean-Claude Duvalier, died of a heart attack at age 63. After inheriting the title of “president for life” from his father in 1971 at age 19, his cruel reign was ended by an uprising in 1986.
Mexico discovered a mass grave. Authorities in Iguala, in Guerrero State, found several bodies near where students clashed with the police a week ago, which resulted in the death of several people and dozens of missing students. The New York Times reported that many were last seen being carried off by police officers.
Time changed down under. The beginning of daylight saving time in some—but not all—parts of the country means there are  five Australian time zones  for summer, instead of the usual three. Sydney is now “half an hour ahead of Adelaide, one hour ahead of Brisbane, one and a half hours ahead of Darwin, and three hours ahead of Perth.”

Jerry Seinfeld ripped apart the advertising industry on its biggest nightGlass
October 5, 2014
“I love advertising because I love lying,” comedian Jerry Seinfeld told a banquet hall full of advertising executives at the industry’s annual awards show on Oct. 1. He didn’t appear to be joking.
The deadpan acceptance speech for his honorary Clio award  drew cheers and applause from the crowd, apparently full of gluttons for punishment. “I think spending your life trying to dupe innocent people out of hard-won earnings to buy useless, low-quality, misrepresented items and services is an excellent use of your energy,” Seinfeld said.
Here’s the full transcript:
I am excited to win this. This is the award they give you when they don’t think you can actually win one, but they think you’ve done a pretty good job and seem to have been around for quite some time, and that’s how I got it.
I would like to thank Ogilvy and Mather and American Express for getting me into this business. That was the first time I did it. I’d like to thank my manager George Shapiro, my incredible wife Jessica, and Ammirati for keeping me going.
I love advertising because I love lying.
In advertising, everything is the way you wish it was. I don’t care that it won’t actually be like when I actually get the product being advertised because, in between seeing the commercial and owning the thing, I’m happy, and that’s all I want. Tell me how great the thing is going to be. I love it. I don’t need to be happy all the time. I just want to enjoy the commercial. I want to get the thing. We know the product is going to stink. We know that. Because we live in the world, and we know that everything stinks. We all believe, hey, maybe this one won’t stink. We are a hopeful species. Stupid but hopeful.
But we’re happy in that moment between the commercial and the purchase, and I think spending your life trying to dupe innocent people out of hard-won earnings to buy useless, low-quality, misrepresented items and services is an excellent use of your energy.
Because a brief moment of happiness is pretty good. I also think that just focusing on making money and buying stupid things is a good way of life. I believe materialism gets a bad rap. It’s not about the amount of money. Nothing’s better than a Bic pen, a VW Beetle, or a pair of regular Levi’s. If your things don’t make you happy, you’re not getting the right things. This will all be in my new book, Soulful Materialism, which is in the planning stages at this moment.
I have always wanted a Clio. I don’t know much about it, but I know it’s a good award because in 1991, they screwed up this whole presentation, and there were a bunch of awards left over, and all of these ad people here climbed up onto the stage and tried to grab them. So, to me, that says this means something. That really happened, and it’s my all-time favorite awards show occurrence because it was so honest. People just said, I want a damn Clio, and they went for it. And that is why I am happy right now. I got this. I didn’t really win it, but I got it. And tomorrow, I don’t know where this is going to be. It’s going to be somewhere. Eventually I’ll be dead. Someone will just take it or sell it or throw it out. That’s fine. I’m happy now. The same way those executives were in 1991 when they ran onto this stage and grabbed trophies that weren’t theirs. But it trumped up their phony careers and meaningless lives.
So thank you all for this great honor and all your great work. I hope it makes you happy as you have made me happy for this five minutes of my life, which will last until I get to the edge of this stage, and it hits me that this was all a bunch of nonsense. Thank you, and have a great evening.

5 reasons McDonald's is falling apart

Another month, another wave of customer defections at your local Mickey D's. McDonald's ( MCD )  posted another disappointing showing in terms of store-level sales for the month of August. U.S. comparable sales slipped 2.8% for the month, falling by an even harder 3.7% worldwide. McDonald's stock hit a new 52-week low on the news.
These are lean times for the world's largest burger flipper, especially closer to home, where comps have fallen in 9 of the past 10 months. Let's explore some of the reasons for the rut that the fast food giant finds itself in at the moment.
1. Quality is a problem
McDonald's has been trying to upgrade the quality of its food, realizing that fast casual chains that offer higher-end fare with the convenience of quick-service restaurants are growing at its expense. Unfortunately, its reputation for having crummy food even within its own category isn't going away.
A Consumer Reports survey of more than 32,000 fast food fans ranked McDonald's dead last among 21 leading burger chains based on taste. When's the last time an entrenched consumer brand dramatically reshaped consumer perception of the quality of its grub? It won't be easy for McDonald's.
2. The growing menu is causing delays and prep mistakes
McDonald's is no longer just about burgers and fries, but giving customers more choices also has its drawbacks. McDonald's hosted a webcast with its franchisees last year, alerting them on growing number of customer complaints about employee unfriendliness.
What's making customers so unhappy? Industry trade mag QSR puts out its Drive-Thru Performance Study every year, tracking transaction speeds. Last year, it found that the average McDonald's customer's wait increased to more than three minutes after placing an order to receive it. That's worse than the industry average, and a personal worst for McDonald's.
Connect the dots, and it's easy to see why the more complicated menu at McDonald's is doing more harm than good.
3. The world is no longer its oyster
It's been a rough go for McDonald's domestically, but it was holding up relatively better overseas until this summer. August has offered a double whammy of international setbacks as a supplier scare has decimated its traffic in China, while Russian regulators shut down several locations on food safety concerns that may ore may not have had political motivations.
In short, the same world that was once there for the taking is starting to turn on McDonald's.
4. McDonald's is being cast as "the bad guy"
It's been a year since the Service Employees International Union launched the Fight for 15 protests, trying to get fast food chains to boost their minimum wage to $15. As the country's largest burger chain, McDonald's has become the poster child for the campaign.
The end result is that a lot of people think it's not just the food that's cheap at McDonald's. It's not entirely fair. As big as McDonald's itself may be, 80% of the restaurants are owned by independent franchisees working on leaner markups. However, those siding with the union's push to roughly double wages at McDonald's may be avoiding the chain on principle, even as most of its burger peers are holding up better in terms of comps.
5. Going back to basics may not be on the table
A common argument is that McDonald's just needs to return to its simple roots and the Dollar Menu emphasis that served it so well in its heyday. The problem is that it isn't likely to work. If McDonald's scrapped the fancy coffee drinks, premium chicken sandwiches, and gourmet burgers off of its menu, do you really think sales would increase? Outside of a likely improvement in speed of service, it would lose more customers than it would gain by going back to basics.
Yes, a place like Five Guys can thrive without adding shakes, desserts, or fancy sandwiches. The challenge is being able to retain popularity once you start to scale back an expanded menu. This is where McDonald's finds itself today, seemingly in a winless situation.

AAP leader Adarsh Shastri to mediate between traders & handset makers to curb online discounts

(India’s 1.5 lakh small…)
KOLKATA/NEW DELHI: India's 1.5 lakh small to medium cell phone retailers have a new champion — the Aam Aadmi Party's Adarsh Shastri, grandson of former prime minister Lal Bahadur Shastri and a top executive with Apple and Samsung India before he entered politics.
The retailers have been fighting hard to defend themselves against online sellers such as Amazon, Flipkart and Snapdeal, which are winning over customers by being able to sell phones and tablets at a discount, thus undercutting the brick-and-mortar trade. The AAP leader is seeking to mediate between traders and top brands such as Samsung, Apple and Nokia to curb such discounting. Spokespersons for the top online retailers and the top brands could not be immediately reached for comment.
Shastri, 40, hit the headlines last December by quitting his job at Apple India where he was heading sales for the western region to join AAP ahead of the last general election. He's had meetings with dealers in the north India and market leader Samsung after the shopkeepers threatened to stop selling devices made by the company, Apple and others. ? Shastri is of the view that such threats are counterproductive for the traders and that a better solution can be found that's beneficial to both parties. "Boycotting products of a particular brand is not the right approach," Shastri told ET. "We feel it's not right because it doesn't help the retailer, the brand and the consumer. Brands and retail need to work together," he said, adding that they are waking up to the issue since almost 95% of their sales are still dependent on the offline trade.
It was at one such meeting mediated by Shastri last month that Samsung executives announced to the trade that it will go all out to limit or stop distribution to online sellers who are discounting products. More such meetings are lined up with other brands. To be sure, it's not easy to see how any such resolution won't end up with consumers having to pay more for devices.
Besides this, some brands, such as Motorola and Xiaomi, have decided not to bother with traditional networks at all and are only selling their devices online. Shastri told ETthat he decided to help the cause of the small retailers who approached him, both in his individual capacity and as someone who has been involved with the industry.
Besides this, he's also secretary of the Indian Cellular Association, a grouping that represents manufacturers, distributors and trade partners of the cell phone industry. He also added that AAP won't hesitate to step in and take a more active role since the retail business is the backbone of the Indian economy.
"Wherever the common retailer is being bullied by a large brand or by the large muscle of online retail, we (AAP) will step in. If it is required tomorrow to take up issues of small retailers, the party will absolutely do it," said Shastri. Before his Apple stint, Shastri was with Samsung where he was heading modern trade for the cell phone business.
He was a part of the core team at Samsung that was responsible for the company's rapid rise that saw it overtaking Nokia India to become the market leader, first in smartphones and then the overall mobile business. He also had a stint at Vodafone. These connections are now being put to good use.
"Nokia has been cooperating on this. Some brands are more disruptive than the others, like Samsung and even Apple, to an extent. But Nokia, Motorola and HTC have been reasonably open to the idea of price parity between online and retail channels," said Shastri.
As per estimates by Hong Kong-based market researcher Counterpoint Research, around 10% of smartphone sales comes from online in India, which is estimated to grow up to 15% this Diwali with the top three e-commerce marketplaces — Amazon, Flipkart and Snapdeal, lining up major discount sales and promotions.

Hewlett-Packard to split into 2 cosHewlett-Packard to split into two for sharper focus
Reuters
Reuters
New York, Oct 6:  
Hewlett and Packard are finally going their separate ways. Not literally, of course, as the founders of the Silicon Valley technology conglomerate that bears their names have long shuffled off this mortal coil. But the company now led by Meg Whitman is set to break in two.
HP, which has a market value of $66 billion, will announce as soon on October 6 plans to separate its business manufacturing laptops, computers and printers from the one that serves large corporate and government customers with hardware and services, the Wall Street Journal reports.
While a big move for a slow-moving company founded in 1939, it's actually a bit behind the curve as far as shareholders are concerned. They have been expecting just such a split for some time. Whitman's predecessor proposed a similar measure back before he was shown the door. And it was one of the options that Ralph Whitworth, the activist shareholder at Relational Investors who became HP's chairman until taking a leave in July, wanted HP to consider.
Reuters Breakingviews argued nearly two years ago that the company's assets would be worth almost double its then-market capitalization in a breakup. Investors appear to have agreed, sending HP shares up from about $13 in December 2012 to $35 today.
Whitman could have continued to argue that there were synergies in duct-taping a consumer hardware business endangered by the age of mobile computing with a potentially more stable operation focused on solving the complicated problems of large enterprises. The printing and personal systems unit saw sales slip some 7 per cent last year.
Using the recent revival in its stock-market fortunes to perform surgery, rather than go with the flow, is a smart move by HP's board. Better to perform the operation voluntarily than be forced into it by disappointing earnings or a crack in the market. It also allows Whitman to hedge her bets. She will be CEO of the corporate IT business and chair the hardware unit. In all other respects, however, Hewlett and Packard are set to finally part company.
Hewlett-Packard, which has struggled to adapt to the new era of mobile and online computing, plans to split into two companies as it looks to put more focus on the faster-growing corporate services market, the Wall Street Journal reported on Oct 5.
The move, which could be announced as early as October 6, would be a monumental reshaping of one of technology's most important pioneers, which still has more than 300,000 employees and is on track to book $112 billion in revenue in the year to October.
Under the reported plan, HP will separate its computer and printer businesses from its corporate hardware and services operations, and spin the unit off through a tax-free distribution of shares to stockholders next year. Meg Whitman, HP chief executive, will be chairman of the computer and printer business and CEO of the other business.
A company spokeswoman declined to comment on the report.
HP's printing and personal computing business accounts for about half its revenue and profit, according to results for the most recent financial quarter. It is not clear how many of HP's more than 300,000 staff work in each of the businesses.

JAMMU: Five villagers were killed and 29 injured in heavy mortar shelling and firing by Pakistani troops targeting hamlets and outposts along the International Border in Jammu district today in one of the worst ceasefire violations.
"Pakistani Rangers resorted to heavy and unprovoked firing and shelling of mortars on 10 corder outposts (BoPs) and civilian areas along international border (IB) in Arnia belt of Jammu district from 10 PM last night," a BSF spokesman said today.
They used small, automatic weapons and mortar bombs to target the border hamlets and BoPs along the borderline. BSF troops guarding the borderline retaliated effectively and gave a befitting reply, he said, adding that the intermittent firing exchanges are going on in the area.
In the shelling, five villagers were killed and 29 injured in several hamlets, Sub-Divisional Police Officer (SDPO), R S Pura Tehsil, Devender Shingh told PTI.
25 of the injured have been shifted to GMC hospital Jammu.
A large number of houses were damaged and livestock perished in the firing and shelling, said Singh, who was leading a team of police personnel who risked their lives to shift the injured people to hospital during the heavy shelling.
"People living in critical zones along the border will be evacuated," he said
A BSF spokesman said that the force did not suffer any casualty.
This was the 11th ceasefire violations along Indo-Pak border in Jammu and Kashmir during last four days. There have been seven ceasefire violations along Line of Control in Poonch and four along IB in Jammu.
On October 3, Pakistani troops and rangers violated ceasefire in Gulamarg sector of Kashmir Valley and in Poonch and Jammu sectors in which a girl was killed and six persons were injured.
Fear was writ large of the faces of kin of the injured, who were shifted to the hospital here. "We thought we will die any time, such was the firing of mortar bombs and their bursting sound," Karan Singh of Pindi village said.
"We have become sitting ducks for Pakistan to target us. Government should do something immediately. We cannot live on the border to die," Rano Devi said.
Yesterday, Pakistani troops violated ceasefire by resorting to unprovoked and heavy firing on Indian forward posts along LoC in Balnoie sub-sector of Poonch district around 0800 hours.
On October 4, Pakistani troops resorted heaviest firing and mortar shelling along LoC in in Poonch district of Jammu and Kashmir, drawing retaliation from Army.
On October 1 and 2, Pakistani troops violated ceasefire two times along LoC in Poonch district resulting in injuries to six people, including three women.
With assembly elections due in Jammu and Kashmir, the Pakistan-based militant leadership is desperate to push in a large number of militants into the Indian side in the cover of the heavy firing to carry out terrorism related activities, according to the Army.
"They want to disrupt the assembly elections in the state as they know that a large number of their cadre has already been eliminated. So to reinforce their numbers, they are desperately trying to infiltrate more people into the state and that is why there has been an increase in the number of ceasefire violations," Udhampur-based defense spokesman Col SD Goswami had said.
Before this, the heaviest ceasefire violation by the Pakistani troops was witnessed on August 26 night.
In a bid to defuse border tension, triggered by firing and shelling by Pakistani troops stretching to 45 days, the heaviest since 1971 war, India and Pakistan on August 29 held a crucial Sector Commander (DIG-Brigadier) level flag meeting on Octerio BoP in Jammu district's R S Pura sector.
On August 28, BSF troops held Commandant level flag-meeting with Rangers along IB at Ballard Post in Samba sector.
Pakistani troops also resorted to mortar shelling and firing in Jammu and Kashmir's Poonch district.
"Pakistan violated ceasefire today. They resorted to firing and mortar shelling on forward posts along LoC in Bhimber Gali (BG) belt of Poonch district around 0830 hours today," a Defence Spokesman said.
Indian troops effectively retaliated, he said adding that exchanges are going on in the area.

5 killed  29 injured in one of the worst ceasefire violations by Pakistani troops along IBPakistan continues to violate ceasefire, kills 5 civilians
Tarun Upadhyay , Hindustan Times  Jammu/New Delhi, October 06, 2014

The Indian government hardened its stance and asked the Border Security Force (BSF) to “retaliate with full force” after five civilians were killed and 29 wounded in firing by Pakistani forces along the border in Jammu on Monday, official sources said.
 
Tensions flared after four Pakistani civilians, including two children and a woman, were killed in retaliatory firing by India as home minister Rajnath Singh and defence minister Arun Jaitley warned Pakistan to stop such attacks if it wanted peace talks with India.
 
“Ceasefire violation must stop. Pakistan must realise that a decisive government has come to power, which will not take such instances lying down,” Singh told HT in an interview.

India and Pakistan exchanged fire in Arnia and RS Pura sectors late on Monday, the heaviest firing between the two countries since India called off bilateral talks last month. Jaitley said the repeated ceasefire violations would not help normalise relations between the two countries and Indian armed forces were responding to all provocations from across the border.
 
"This is resulting in a series of ceasefire violations as a result of which innocent civilians have lost their lives. Pakistan must realise that the kind of environment it is generating between the two countries is certainly not going to help in normalising relations. The onus of creating a positive environment is on Pakistan which is utterly failing to do so," Jaitley said.

A senior government official told HT on condition of anonymity that border agencies, mainly the BSF and the army, had received instructions to not just match mortar for mortar but “outnumber the number of mortars in retaliation”.
 
“There is no hesitation to our response now. If Pakistan fires five mortars, we can retaliate with 10,” he said.
 
The violence puts more strain on already-tense ties between India and Pakistan after New Delhi called off planned foreign secretary-level talks following the Pakistani ambassador’s meeting with Kashmiri separatist leaders last month.
 
Worst affected by the Pakistani firing in India was Mashain-de-kothe village, where four members of a family were killed. Mortars also landed at Arnia town, about three km from the International Border (IB), forcing thousands of people to flee their homes.
 
“When firing started we thought it would be another routine thing. But when heavy mortars started pounding our homes and heard cries, it was our worst nightmare,” said Soma Devi, a relative of the family that lost four members to the firing.
 
BSF sources said India will not have a flag meeting after the firing which began late last Thursday in a bid to disrupt Dussehra celebrations. Media reports said three militants were killed as the army foiled an infiltration bid along the Line of Control in Tangdhar sector.
 
The Pakistani ministry of foreign affairs issued a statement condemning what it described as India’s “unprovoked firing”.
 
“The government of Pakistan has lodged a strong protest with the government of India through diplomatic channels and called for restraining its forces from constant violation of the ceasefire," it said in the statement.
 
With tension prevailing on the border, the traditional exchange of sweets between Indian and Pakistani troops at the Attari border in Punjab on Eid was called off. However, sweets were exchanged at Chakan-da-bagh area in Poonch.

Interview With a Vampire one of my worst films: Brad PittPress Trust of India | London | Posted: October 6, 2014 11:09 am
Hollywood superstar Brad Pitt has revealed his 1994 horror film ‘Interview With a Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles’ was one of his worst movies ever.
The 50-year-old actor starred with Tom Cruise in the movie and says if the project had come along later in his career, he would have either had changes made or walked away from the film, reported Contactmusic.
“It was one of the worst experiences of my life. Six months in the dark, contact lenses, make-up… Now I would be able to say, ‘This is a problem, we fix this, or I’m out of here,” Pitt said.
The ‘Fury’ star says he lacked direction and focus in his early career, and did not concentrate on doing quality films.

Lamar Odom sends Khloe Kardashian flowers to get her backPress Trust of India | Los Angeles | Posted: October 6, 2014 11:07 am
Reality TV star Khloe Kardashian’s estranged husband Lamar Odom reportedly sends her flowers on a regular basis to win her back.
Kardashian, 30, filed for divorce from the 34-year-old basketball player last December but he still hopes to get her back and apologises for everything he put her through before they split, reported Ok! magazine.
“He sends her favourite flowers all the time just to make her smile. Kris (Kardashian’s mother) has always held a special place in her heart for Lamar, so when he reached out to apologise to her too, she was like putty in his hands.
“Lamar knows that even if he earns Khloe’s trust back, it’s her mom who makes all the family decisions. He’s thrilled they’re talking again,” a source said.
The former couple split following months of rumours Lamar was apparently addicted to cocaine and cheating on the reality TV star with multiple different women.
Odom, however, has reportedly changed a lot in recent months. “Lamar is clean and sober now. He’s been seeing a therapist and working out regularly, getting himself on the right track to win Khloe back,” the source added.
Kardashian recently ended her relationship with rapper French Montana, whom she started dating in April.

A short film looks at football as an empowering tool for Indian girlsIndrani Pal-Chaudhuri on the sets of Crescendo
Written by Debesh Banerjee | Posted: October 6, 2014 11:02 am
While growing up in Ranaghat, 74 kms north of Kolkata, the importance of a good education was never lost upon Indrani Pal-Chaudhuri’s father. It was only years later that Chaudhuri reaped the benefits of her education. “My parents always encouraged me to study. I went to Princeton University and graduated with a degree in Anthropology, so the importance of education was very much instilled in me,” says photographer-filmmaker Chaudhuri, who is known for shooting David Bowie music videos, cover shoots for fashion magazines like Vogue, including published work for The New York Times.
But despite her commercial recognition in the US, Chaudhuri was drawn to the cause of girl’s empowerment back home, in India. She has just completed her second short film, Crescendo, which looks at how football and vocational training are coming together in a beautiful way to empower girls in India. “I had heard about a group of girls in India who played football and were winning tournaments. I thought it was an interesting way to further education,” adds Chaudhuri, whose film is part of the Pepsi Beats of the Beautiful Game, a music series, with tracks that were created for the FIFA World Cup 2014.
A still from the short film
The four-minute 42 seconds film is set in the blue city of Jodhpur, where girls wearing T-shirts and shorts are running around in the lanes playing football, weaving past traffic and pedestrians. The film features girls from YUWA, a trust from Jharkhand, that trains girls from underprivileged families in football along with girls from the Sambhali Trust, Jodhpur, which imparts vocational training to girls. “The combination of the two sets of skills is unique and shows how education can also be made fun,” says the 40-year-old, who shot in Jodhpur. Moving to the States at the age of eight, Chaudhuri returned to Kolkata as an 18-year-old to set up the Shakti Empowerment Education, an education society at her ancestral home, to support lower-income families.
The concept of the film she says, was to “focus on the solutions (of education) and remind people that solutions can often be as simple as empowering girls”. Her earlier film, in 2012 titled The Girl Epidemic was a grim reminder of the practice of female infanticide and the stigma of the girl child in India. The film is set to music by British indie-pop singer Jetta, whose foot-tapping track Crescendo, which is produced by Pharell Williams, sets the mood of the film. An elephant which features in the film, “represents the forces of what is natural and beautiful.” Chaudhuri is currently developing a project for India, which she will unveil in November, with Bollywood actors.

Whos the Wagah An artwork near Wagah border blends stories of migration  identity and harmonyProfessor Nair with his students at the Wagah border mural
Written by Nikita Puri | Posted: October 6, 2014 10:57 am | Updated: October 6, 2014 10:58 am
When English comedian, writer and TV personality Michael Palin filmed the lowering of the flag ceremony at Wagah Border in 2007, he called the exercise a display of “carefully choreographed contempt.” In the hope of diffusing some of that resounding sentiment, comes a public art project spearheaded by Suresh K Nair, Assistant Professor with Banaras Hindu University (BHU)’s department of painting. In Attari, near the Wagah border, a 150ft x 10ft cement mural is underway, on the walls of Sarhad, a restaurant, which doubles up as a space for international arts run by former IAS officer DS Jaspal.
Called Who’s the Wagah?, the mural has five distinct modules. Elders from pre-Independence India — Muslims, Sikhs and Hindus — are shown sitting together under trees in the first panel as children fly kites. Etched in cement, the second panels takes the story forward as families are torn apart and forced to choose identities. Then comes the power and pomp show at Wagah on the third and fourth, as India and Pakistan try to outdo each other in the marching parade. In the mural, the gates at Wagah open, only to be closed again, much like what happens in reality. In the fifth, Nair paints a picture of a nation that appears unified as he shows the gates at Wagah open. A dove is shown gliding across the storyboard, its flight recorded in cement. Echoing issues of migration and identity, the mural pursues the idea of harmony; the dove of peace brings home the message.
“Along with my students who have been eager to be a part of public art projects, we’ve done a number of murals across schools, colleges and other public places in Varanasi. DS Jaspal saw the work when he was visiting the city and invited us to do something in Attari,” says Nair, a Fulbright scholar who has been working in the public space, specifically with contemporary murals, for close to 25 years. In order to better understand mural traditions of the world, Kerala-born Nair went to the Visva-Bharati University at Shantiniketan and USA’s Temple University in Philadelphia.
“The mural, which we started in June-July this year, is almost complete. We are just waiting for the monsoons to pass before we paint,” he says.
In 2013, at the behest of Kerala Lalithakala Akademi, Nair had co-curated the Mural City Project in Kottayam, which involved 350 artists from the world over. While the Wagah project awaits final touches, Nair has two other projects in waiting — one of a glass and mirror mural project in Varanasi; the other near Bodh Gaya. “The Varanasi project will show the evolution of man. There will also be a comparison of regional dialect,” says Nair. Research is on for the Bodh Gaya project, which will have historical incidents interspersed with Vedic references. “At about 750ft x 10ft, this will be the largest cement mural in the continued…

Real leaders cry  weep and wailThe Supreme Court had in July 2013 struck down Section 8(4) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, which protected convicted MPs and MLAs from disqualification if they appeal before a higher court within three months.

After Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa was convicted for amassing disproportionate wealth during her first term in office, 16 people committed suicide. One supporter jumped in front of a bus. A few hung themselves and some consumed poison. They never knew her personally. This appears to be a trend peculiar to south India — somehow, it seems unlikely any Delhiites would kill themselves if Sheila Dikshit went to jail. When MGR, a previous Tamil Nadu Chief Minister died after serving three consecutive terms 30 people committed suicide, several thousands had their heads tonsured and over a million followed his remains around till the funeral.
At least there was death to explain the manic grief of supporters in MGR’s case. But Jayalalithaa has merely gone to prison. And since politicians in India routinely make staggering comebacks, it’s a little early to write her off. Whatever one’s political opinions, Jayalalithaa’s cult status is weirdly fascinating, never more evident than at the swearing in of the next Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu. Mr Panneerselvam, 63, overcome by emotion, shed copious tears for his supreme leader while taking the oath. Social welfare minister B Valarmathi broke down soon after. One by one, the entire cabinet of 30-something ministers were weeping. Even more baffling, they didn’t seem to be in the least bit embarrassed at this bizarre display of sentiment. (His swearing-in ceremony has over two lakh hits on different clips on YouTube).
Can it possibly be that Mr Panneerselvam is absolutely devastated at becoming Chief Minister? I can only make sense of it by drawing a parallel with my own life. In the unlikely event the editor of this paper was suddenly hauled away, and miraculously, I should find myself in charge — I would be weeping too — with joy. My delirious happiness in such a situation (alas, one can always dream) would make it quite impossible for me to pretend otherwise. Even if I, somehow, managed to put up a convincing show of being distraught at my boss’s bad luck, I would be called out as a pathetic hypocrite by my merciless colleagues. Mr Panneerselvam, however, didn’t need to worry that his Cabinet might regard his unabashed sorrow with skepticism, since they were all so busy weeping themselves.
The visuals of the teary Tamil Nadu cabinet were strangely reminiscent of North Korean leader Kim Jong-il’s painstakingly choreographed funeral: where mourners lined the streets, wailing and doubling over in apparent pain. People who did not cry were sentenced to six months continued…

People try to typify me  but I think out of the box: Bharatanatyam exponent Leela SamsonLeela Samson's earlier performance
Written by Suanshu Khurana | Posted: October 6, 2014 10:47 am
The labyrinthine and controlled enclosures of a 75-year-old institute like Kalakshetra have not been easy to steer for many. This includes its former director and student, Bharatanatyam exponent Leela Samson, who resigned from the post in April 2012 amid much controversy surrounding her “forced” resignation, including the idea that she was “modernising” the institution and undermining tradition. Samson had spoken about being “dazed and beaten” then. But the last two years have seen a new Samson emerge, the one who is a narthaki first. The one whose compelling artistry on stage, that abstract style, which takes off from the core values and grammar of Bharatanatyam have elevated her to the stature of one of the finest Bharatanatyam dancers in the country. Other roles — being Director of the Central Board of Film Certification and Sangeet Natak Akademi — have just come as mandatory appointments.
“The last two years have been a return to who I am. I lost my parents around the same time, so it was a coming to terms with my situation in many different ways. Since then, I find time for what gives me the greatest pleasure and is the greatest teacher. I’m happy going back to what I love — dancing, dealing constantly with sahitya music and interacting with young dancers,” says Samson, who will open the 13th edition of Ananya dance festival on October 8, which is organised by Delhi-based, Seher.
Leela Samson
The compositions that will be presented at the festival have two new works, one done earlier for a larger production and two that have been adapted from a solo. These will be presented by her group Spanda. “We have been working on them for many months. This selection of compositions is about different themes — innocence and valour; passion and jealousy; the perennial nurturing of the Ganga and her descent on our land and the power of swaras, their potential to make us full in the ultimate nature of things,” says the 63-year-old, who has choreographed the piece and will also be perform with the group.
However, she says, that as a dancer the solo format is more satisfying. “There is an age for group work. I have crossed that age. I now revel in making others dance,” says Samson, a dancer seeped in the learnings of her guru, Rukmini Devi Arundale, one of the greatest dancers of the last century who revived Dasi Attam (dance of the devadasis) into its present form of Bharatanatyam and got a young Leela to learn the ropes of the art form.
“There is a group of senior Kalakshetrians who believe that only they know what Rukmini Devi was like and stood for. The last word will not be said on her. In many ways she defies description,” says Samson, who left Kalakshetra in the early ’70s. Her performances that followed thereafter garnered much continued…

Shoppers prepare to welcome festive season with fervourUpdated: October 6, 2014 11:21 IST
Shoppers prepare to welcome festive season with fervour

It is festival season and consumers are preparing for their seasonal shopping.
Commercial areas in the city – Big Bazaar Street, Oppanakara Street, N.H. Road, Raja Street, Sukhrawarpet, D.B. Road, T.V. Samy Road, 100 Feet Road and Cross Cut Road - saw shoppers compete for every inch of space on Saturday and Sunday.
Pre-deepavali sales are good this year. The season has started early this year and the retail sector, in general, is seeing good sales, says a textile retailer.
The Traffic Wing of the Coimbatore City Police has also begun the annual preparatory works for Deepavali at the Oppanakara Street and Cross Cut Road a little early this year. Traffic police personnel said that stringent regulation of traffic usually comes to effect only about a week or two before Deepavali.
 Arrangements have started earlier this year as people have started thronging the shopping zones due to the continuous holidays for education institutions and in work places over the last few days. The holidays combining with the salary period resulted in crowding of these areas at a much earlier date, police officials said.
 Police deployment has been strengthened at the Cross Cut Road and 100 Feet Road. Barricades have been put along side the footpaths to avoid unauthorised parking of vehicles on both sides of the road. “Rope connecting barricades will be tied in a day or two. Additional watchtowers will be erected about 10 days before Deepavali,” police sources added.
 At Oppanakara Street the police are focusing at removal of obstructions – such as vehicles parked in unauthorised parking places and road side shops – from Sunday. This measure is also carried out at Big Bazaar Street, Kadai Veethi, Vysial Street, Karuppanna Gounder Street and Raja Street.
 The police said that no special arrangement has been made for parking vehicles. A request has been made to the Coimbatore Corporation to permit using the ground of a corporation school behind Variety Hall Police Station as a temporary parking lot, the police said.
 They claimed that the space could simultaneously accommodate 500 cars and 3,000 two-wheelers. “It would be instrumental in reducing traffic congestion on Oppanakara Street and the nearby shopping areas. We have made making repeated representations to corporation officials in this connection. We are waiting for a positive response,” the police added.

Most of the computer users suffer from the symptoms of Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS) and an expert says that it is important to take breaks and blink regularly.
According to a recent study, prolonged sitting while at your desk can increase your risk of heart disease, diabetes and stroke, reports femalefirst.co.uk.
But that’s not the only thing at work that poses a risk to our health.
Around 70 percent of computer users regularly leave work suffering from the symptoms of Computer Vision Syndrome so it is important to follow a few easy steps to ensure sitting at a desk doesn’t take its toll on your health:
It is necessary to stay clear of CVS. It’s possible, nowadays, to spend most of our waking hours surrounded by screens, from checking your emails and texts first thing in the morning, to working nine to five in an office, and then catching up on some evening TV or computer games before, finally, checking your trusty mobile again as you drift off to sleep.
Although this technology has many positive effects on our professional and social lives, what is it doing to our health? One significant effect of constant screen use is CVS.
“When we use a computer for long periods, we only blink around 4 – 7 times per minute. Our usual rate of blinking is more like 18 – 20 times per minute, so this is a significant reduction – it can cause symptoms such as dry eyes and blurred vision,” said professor Dan Reinstein of the London Vision Clinic.“
Other common symptoms of CVS include red eyes, eye strain, double vision, headaches and difficulty refocusing the eyes.
Reinstein provides his top tips on how to prevent CVS, and keep our eyes healthy and comfortable.
* Take a short break from your computer screen at least once every hour; ensure that you move and look away from your computer.
* Keep your computer screen clean.
* Be conscious of blinking regularly.
* Optimise the angle, height and distance of your screen. Being the wrong distance away from your screen can increase muscle strain and visual discomfort.
* Be aware of environmental factors. Air-conditioning and fans can worsen the dry-eye symptoms of CVS.
* If contact lenses make your eyes feel dry, avoid wearing them when using a computer. CVS is particularly common in contact lens wearers; at the London Vision Clinic, we often see patients who are choosing to have laser eye surgery because they find they can no longer wear their contact lenses for long periods, especially while using computers.
* Drink plenty of water to keep yourself hydrated.
* Avoid ‘glare’ from windows and overhead lights.
* Ensure that your computer screen is not flickering.
* And, most importantly, have an eye examination.

brunch parties
(Aloft, upscale brand owned…)
MUMBAI: The lights went out at the Wink bar at Mumbai's Vivanta by Taj-President hotel on a bright afternoon last month. As night descended, the bar lounge transformed into a venue for the sort of downtown party brunch that is hosted in New York every Saturday, complete with sparklers, neon drinks, theme menu and bartenders dressed in unique outfits befitting the theme.
"We wanted Mumbai to enjoy a night out on a Saturday afternoon and so we started this brunch party. Every party will be timed with an event or festivity for which we create special menu and ambience is set accordingly," said Pankaj Sampat, general manager of the hotel. With food and beverages, or F&B, accounting for more than half of the revenues and standalone restaurants giving upscale hotels a run for their money, hot tels are trying to exploit the potential of this segment to the fullest and coming up with newer ways to offer more than just good food and heady drinks.
Such events ensure an uptick of 25-30% in food and beverages business for the hotel during the specific days. Hotels are, therefore, turning their restaurants into happening venues with musical events and contests, fashion shows and stand-up comedy shows combined with eclectic menus. Guests walking into Pondichery Cafe at Mumbai's luxury hotel Sofitel were surprised one weekend in May to see the all-day dining restaurant transform into a glitzy fashion-show venue. As the guests savoured fusion cuisine, models elegantly walked around the tables displaying designer Rocky S' latest collection.
"A five-star luxury hotel is not just about sleeping and eating; it's a living organism and a hub of culture," said Biswajit Chakraborty, general manager, Sofitel Hotel at Bandra-Kurla complex,one of Mumbai's big business districts where many big banks and multinational companies have offices. The hotel is now planning to revive supper theatre that will allow guests to watch a play over dinner, he said. Bangalore's Movenpick Hotel recently conducted a standup comedy event by internationally renowned playwright, screenwriter and stand-up comic Anuvab Pal which attracted expats and corporate clients.
"These events help increase footfalls, generate more business for restaurants and also bring new clients for the hotel," said Vinesh Gupta, general manager at Movenpick Hotel. He added that the event helped the hotel earn about Rs 2.5-3 lakh in additional F&B revenue. Hotels are promoting such events through social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter, thereby also increasing the brand's visibility. Some hotels are taking these events beyond their restaurants.
Aloft, the upscale brand owned by Starwood Group which is targeted at the young millennial traveller, conducts live musical events in the hotel lobby which is open to public and in-house guests alike. Aloft Bengaluru Cessna Business Park recently hosted a music talent competition called 'Project Aloft Star', which saw participation of over 200 music enthusiasts.
Courtesy the event, the hotel has been growing its network of business and corporate clients. Special events are fast becoming an integral part of business, said Sampat of Vivanta by Taj-President, adding that the number of such events has gone up to 10 annually from about four just three years ago.

Haryana polls: Sushma seeks mandate for  clean and good governance  in stateAssembly election
(Reaching out the people…)
KALKA: Seeking electors' mandate in the upcoming Haryana Assembly polls on development plank, Union Minister Sushma Swaraj today said BJP will provide a "clean and good governance" in the state.
"BJP is a party of good leaders and fielded good candidates and will provide clean and good governance in the state," Swaraj said while addressing her first public meeting in Haryana since the announcement of polls.
Mentioning the recently launched Jan Dhan Yojna, she said the BJP's policies and programmes are good.
Reaching out the people of the region that falls in foot of Shivalik hills, she said that its an important election for the BJP.
"Earlier the BJP use to fight polls in Haryana in alliance with other political outfits, but now the party is contesting the elections on its own," she said, seeking peoples' mandate for development of Haryana.
Swaraj said that in the Lok Sabha polls, BJP's mission was 272 plus seats and its 50 plus seats in Haryana elections now.
"We have made our mission possible in Lok Sabha by winning 282 seats of our own and will make it in Assembly elections in Haryana too," she said.
Haryana has 90 Assembly seats. Referring to BJP's performance in the Lok Sabha polls in Haryana where the party won seven out of eight seats it contested, she said Haryana had given not seven but 12 MPs to Parliament.
Besides seven MPs from Haryana, the other five MPs who belonged to the state include she herself, Gen V K Singh (retd) and Sumedha Singh.
Praising Prime Minister Narendra Modi for giving "due representation" to Haryana in his cabinet, she said "this kind of share to the state was never given earlier by any government."

Vijay Amritraj launches own fine wine collectionTennis star Vijay Amritraj launches own fine wine collection with Grover Zampa Vineyards
By Ishani Duttagupta , ET Bureau | 5 Oct, 2014, 05.58AM IST
Amritraj unveiled the Vijay Amritraj Reserve Collection — a white and a red wine from Grover Zampa vineyards — at a celebrity-packed Wimbledon themed party.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
As Vijay Amritraj, one of India's earliest international tennis stars, launched his own fine wine collection with Indian wine producer Grover Zampa Vineyards, it was only fitting that Wimbledon provided the background.
Amritraj unveiled the Vijay Amritraj Reserve Collection — a white and a red wine from Grover Zampa vineyards — at a celebrity-packed Wimbledon themed party at St James' Court, a Taj Hotel in London, during the Wimbledon fortnight in July.
"I am passionate about wine. During my travels around the world, I have tasted and collected different kinds of wine and when Kapil Grover, one of the owners of Grover Zampa, suggested that I launch my own label with his company, I really liked the idea," Amritraj told ET Magazine. While the Vijay Amritraj Reserve Collection, which was recently launched in India, is the first celebrity wine label in this country, the tennis ace joins famous golfers Ernie Els and Greg Norman, both of whom have their own wine collections and are passionate about wine. Els, a South African golfer, created the Ernie Els Wines label with its base in Stellenbosch, South Africa, in 1999.
Australian professional golfer Greg Norman has set up Greg Norman Estates, a collection of wines from regions in Australia, California and Argentina. But it's not just celebrities who are passionate about wines and launch their own labels. Brian Schmidt, an Australian astrophysicist and Nobel laureate, owns Maipenrai, a vineyard and winery in Yass River Valley in Canberra, Australia, dedicated to making fine Pinot Noir wine. For his part, India's first celebrity wine label owner, unlike the connoisseur golfers who have set up their own
winemaking outfits as well, so far is only a joint owner of the Vijay Amritraj Reserve brand with Grover Zampa on a royalty payment basis. But that doesn't reduce his commitment to his wine brand. "I have been involved with the label since the beginning when we started planning it a few years back. From choosing the grape varieties for both the white wine (a barrelfermented varietal Viognier) and the red (a blend of Shiraz, Cabernet Sauvignon and Viognier) to designing the label, I have been involved at every stage," he says. And he is proud about the final products, both of which, he says, were received well in London.
"While the product speaks for itself, such international recognition will also help showcase Indian wines globally," Amritraj added.
Priced at £14.99 a bottle in the UK and Rs 1,200 in India, Grover Zampa now plans to take it to South East Asia and finally launch in the US .
"Our products are already available in about 10 international markets and we are now upbeat about taking the VA label to markets across Europe and the US," says Sumedh Singh Mandla, chief executive officer of Grover Zampa.
Mandla adds that he is keen to prove that wines from Indian vineyards are comparable with those in the global markets.
Industry experts say the Amritraj and Grover Zampa tie-up could be the start of a global trend of celebrities associating with alcobeverage labels in India. "Vijay Amritraj could be a trendsetter in India, with cricketers and Bollywood stars soon looking at launching their own labels. However, wineries in India may not be able to afford tying up with topend endorsers unless the latter plan to invest in the winery they promote," says Magandeep Singh, sommelier and wine consultant. He feels that a celebrity launch such as the Vijay Amritraj Reserve helps to take the brand mainstream. "The company will have to use the celebrity prominently to reach the maximum number of people. Just one launch won't have far-reaching consequences," he adds.
In the long term, he sees serious players investing in the wineries rather than going in for just a branding tie-up. "I'd rather have celebrities invest in a new winery as opposed to merely launching a brand with an existing house. We need more players with a sense for quality rather than everybody getting behind the same 2-3 brands in India," adds Singh. Though India's top wine producer Sula Vineyards has not yet partnered with celebrities for any of their labels, founder and CEO Rajeev Samant believes that sometimes personalities could have a very positive rub-off on wines. "While the trend is yet to catch on in India, we have a collaboration with artist Jaideep Mehrotra — the label on our Satori Merlot Red Wine is an exclusive painting by him," says Samant.

Korea beyond Kimchi: Popularity of Korean food in India on the riseThis was kvass, a mildly fermented drink made from bread soaked in water that had all the appeal of mouldy smelling soda water.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
Metro cities with large expat communities and a few consulates sometimes have charity events where the foreigners present their foods to the locals. Chennai's was called International Night in '90s and was much attended then because of rumours of Russians selling alcohol. This was kvass, a mildly fermented drink made from bread soaked in water that had all the appeal of mouldy smelling soda water.
More interest was to be found with the Germans, who sold sausages and potato salad, the Japanese, who fried fresh tempura and, above all, the Koreans, whose grilled meats were accompanied by wonderfully spicy and sour shreds of cabbage. It was, of course, kimchi , the preserved cabbage (also made with other vegetables) that is the cornerstone of Korean cooking. The Koreans in Chennai at that time were a small community, mostly traders operating between Korea and India. But their numbers exploded when, in the mid '90s, Hyundai picked Chennai for its first Indian plant. It was a windfall for those pioneers, many of who set up services for their compatriots. Sunny Jun, an amiable gentleman who had come to India to manufacture soft toys, set up Korea House, the first Korean restaurant in the city.
Authentic Play
Like all the Korean restaurants that were to come up since, they always seemed surprised to see Indians, and a bit apprehensive. Koreans restaurants are big on beef, which they think Indians won't like, and there may be discreet supply of shoju, the clear spirit that Koreans drink so much of that Jinro Shoju is the largest liquor brand in the world. But if you persist you can get excellent bulgogi (grilled beef ), bibimbap (rice, vegetables, spicy sauce and other extras, mixed in a hot stone bowl), jjigae (stews), pajeon (green onion pancakes) and of course several kinds of kimchi, all served in the array of small starters called banchan that is automatically placed on your table at most Korean restaurants.
Korea House closed years back (Mr Jun now runs a Korean supermarket in the city), but others took its place. Their names and locations have changed over time, but Chennai usually has at least three Korean restaurants running, of which InSeoul is the most permanent. Other Korean restaurants have come up across India, in Delhi and Gurgaon, Bangalore and Pune. They follow Korean companies and students, which is why Mumbai, with no major Korean corporate presence, has no formal Korean restaurant. Korean food may now be the foreign cuisine with the most number of really authentic restaurants in India — meaning, no Punjabi-Chinese, Gujju-Italian, Mexican-Marwari, Japanese-Jain dishes, but food that you would get in Korea. (It is an interesting irony that Manchuria, which lent its name and nothing else to Chicken Manchurian, the defining dish of Indofusion, is relatively close to Korea, and parts of it were actually part of ancient Korean kingdoms.)
Yet Korean food gets overlooked when people talk about foreign food in India. Thai food, Vietnamese, regional varieties of Chinese, Japanese and, the latest fad, Burmese food all get talked about, along with Western cuisines and the occasional Brazilian, Ethiopian and Uzbeki restaurant. With the possible exception of Delhi's Gung The Palace, which recently got attention when word leaked that Rahul Gandhi went there, most Korean restaurants stay under the radar, and that seems to be how Koreans want it.

NEW DELHI: While much has been made of the US' decision to revoke PM Narendra Modi's visa in 2005, the issue did not figure at all in his discussions with President Barack Obama either over the dinner at White House or the bilateral meet between the two leaders next day. Official sources also said that the success of Modi's trip to the US had paved the way for investments worth $ 41 billion from the US into India in the next few years.
"PM has said he does not hold any grudge against the issue and President Obama too chose not to bring up the issue at the meetings he had with the PM,'' said a government source here, adding that Modi's visit to the country was a "game-changing'' one.
"That's because the visit has put bilateral ties now in an altogether higher trajectory,'' the source said. Asked to identify takeaways from the visit, sources cited the announcement by USIBC ( US-India Business Council ) about investments worth $ 41 billion into India in the next 3 years.
"This is actually only 20% of what is expected from the US. Because of the kind of majority he has in Parliament, and also his ability to get things done based on Gujarat model, the PM commanded a lot of respect among prospective US investors and this has done wonders for the global investor sentiment,'' said an official source, adding that the visit marked an intersection of foreign policy priorities and domestic issues.
USIBC told Modi during the visit that it had identified upwards of $41 billion for investment by its members in India within the next 3 years. Ficci has welcomed the development saying this was very encouraging given Modi's emphasis on making India a manufacturing hub. The development is being seen as a "harbinger'' of transformative projects that would be launched by the private sector from both sides and would contribute to realising Modi's vision for manufacturing excellence.
Sources said that Modi and Obama hit off really well when they first met for the dinner at White House with the two leaders even exchanging notes on issues related to technology and their election campaigns.
According to sources, both the leaders "reaffirmed'' their commitment to implement fully the US-India civil nuclear cooperation agreement despite serious differences over India's nuclear liability law. The two countries have established a Contact Group on advancing the implementation of civil nuclear energy cooperation in order to realize early "their shared goal of delivering electricity from US-built nuclear power plants in India''.
They said the two countries are looking forward to advancing the dialogue to discuss all implementation issues, including but not limited to administrative issues, liability, technical issues, and licensing to facilitate the establishment of nuclear parks, including power plants with Westinghouse and GE-Hitachi.

Modi has given detractors few opportunities to show him up as a desi bumpkin, totally out of his depth in the glitzy world of politics and diplomacy.

By Swapan Dasgupta
The person (or maybe the copywriter) who, in a bout of linguistic inspiration, first suggested that Narendra Modi kem cho and conquered America probably never had politics on his mind. Unfortunately, when it comes to India's Prime Minister, politics of a sharply partisan variety is never far away. From the innocuous "may the force be with you" aside to a rock concert in New York City to the severity of his Navratri fast, almost everything Modi does is minutely dissected by an army of pundits, in a constant state of readiness for the first major lapse — something more substantial than saying 'Mohanlal' for 'Mohandas'.
For the moment, Modi has given his detractors few opportunities to show him up as a desi bumpkin, totally out of his depth in the glitzy world of politics and diplomacy. Initially, when it was suggested that the Prime Minister would conduct his global diplomacy in Hindi, there were a few sniggers from those comfortable with Indian leaders speaking to the world in English, and that too in unaccented Received Pronunciation — what in Indian parlance is dubbed 'convent English'. Unfortunately for them, this unwillingness to flaunt the Commonwealth connection was widely appreciated in India. Indeed, the fact that Modi chose to emulate Atal Bihari Vajpayee and speak to the UN General Assembly in Hindi was internalised by India as a symbol of national pride, even by those who believe that the English language has an important role to play in India.
From purposeless mutterings about insisting on Hindi when he has an adequate grasp of English to misgivings over overdoing the Gujarati bit was a short step. Unlike HD Deve Gowda, the self-professed "humble farmer" who was ridiculed as the 'Prime Minister of Karnataka', Modi's regional identity hasn't yet been projected as a political liability. Yet, Modi is unquestionably a Gujarati in the same way as President Pranab Mukherjee leaves people in little doubt that he is a Bengali. More to the point, Modi makes no attempt to conceal his Gujarati-ness. In his speeches he draws freely from his experiences as chief minister of Gujarat for 13 years and it is also likely that at home he keeps a Gujarati table. On their part, Gujaratis, whether in Ahmedabad or New Jersey, see him as one of their own — a local lad from Vadnagar made good.
Does Modi's deep regional roots make him less of a pan-Indian leader? This certainly was the implicit suggestion of those who tried to brush off the spectacular reception he received at the Madison Square Garden rally as a made-in-Gujarat event that it clearly wasn't.

Air Passenger Association of India opposes DGCA directive to airlines on cleanliness drive

Air Passenger Association of India
(In a letter to Gajapathy, APAI suggested…)
MUMBAI: Slamming a DGCA directive to airlines to collect "donations" from passengers for cleanliness drive at airports and aircraft, the apex air travellers body today urged the aviation ministry to withdraw the decree at the earliest.
In a letter to Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathy Raju , Air Passenger Association of India (APAI) also suggested that such funds could be raised by adding a nominal amount of Rs 10-25 in the passenger service fee component, which is collected by the airport operators.
"We strongly believe that a small amount of Rs 10 or Rs 15 or Rs 25 may be asked to be collected by all the operational airports in the country as an additional surcharge in the passenger service fee component. This amount will run into several crore and can be collected without causing any pain or inconvenience to any of the passengers," APAI president D Sudhakar Reddy said in the letter.
Observing that all airlines were "bleeding except one or two and they have accumulated losses of $ 10.6 billion in the past 7 years", he questioned, "is it fair to direct airlines to get involved in this movement when they are struggling for their own existence."
Reddy said the best way to raise funds towards the campaign would be to ask the airports, which cater to a large number of volumes in terms of passenger traffic, to collect it.
Terming the directive as "misguided", he said it must be withdrawn forthwith.
Noting that the airlines have also been asked to spread awareness about cleanliness campaign by making announcements on domestic flights and highlighting it through ads in boarding passes and even videos, the APAI chief said, "The regulator also wants airlines to adopt villages and call them for construction of toilets."
"We believe that except making announcements, the airlines should not be asked to get involved in this campaign in any other manner," Reddy said but termed Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Swachh Bharat campaign as a "noble cause".

US says PM Narendra Modis visit extraordinarily successfulBarack Obama
(“I would say that the assessment…)
NEW DELHI: The US has described the PM Narendra Modi's visit as extraordinarily successful and asserted that his meeting with President Barack Obama has re-energised the strategic relationship between the world's two largest democracies.
"I would say that the assessment on our part is that the PMs visit was extraordinarily successful. It has provided a boost in terms of the vision and focus that we have for our bilateral relations," Phil Reiner , senior director for India at the National Security Council at the White House said on Thursday. The briefing was organized less than 48 hours after Modi's departure from the US and this itself signifies outcome of the trip.
"We are excited to be moving forward with a re-energised strategic partnership. The US continues to strongly support a prosperous India that plays an important role in the global stage, and I think the PM's visit really provided the opportunity for the two leaders to discuss that vision that's necessary in order to set the framework," Reiner claimed.
"I think the two leaders had a very positive conversation not only about our own bilateral relationship but the relationship that PM Modi is interested in developing with Pakistan," Reiner informed.
Hailing the efforts made by the Modi government to improve ties with Pakistan, Reiner said, "I think that everyone saw with the invitation that was extended to Pakistan's leader to come to New Delhi for the inauguration, I think there's a great interest on the Indian side to see that relationship grow and move in the right direction. That was the gist of the conversation."

World's first solar battery developed; recharges itself using air and light

Washington: US scientists have developed the world's first solar battery which recharges itself using air and light.
Ohio State University reserachers developed the solar battery by combining a battery and a solar cell into one hybrid device.
Researchers said the key to the innovation is a mesh solar panel, which allows air to enter the battery, and a special process for transferring electrons between the solar panel and the battery electrode.
The key to the innovation is a mesh solar panel, which allows air to enter the battery, and a special process for transferring electrons between the solar panel and the battery electrode.
#solar battery #battery #solar cell
Inside the device, light and oxygen enable different parts of the chemical reactions that charge the battery.
The solar battery will be licensed to industry, where it will help tame the costs of renewable energy.
"The state of the art is to use a solar panel to capture the light, and then use a cheap battery to store the energy.
We've integrated both functions into one device. Any time you can do that, you reduce cost," said Yiying Wu, professor of chemistry and biochemistry at Ohio State.
The invention also solves a longstanding problem in solar energy efficiency, by eliminating the loss of electricity that normally occurs when electrons have to travel between a solar cell and an external battery.
Typically, only 80 per cent of electrons emerging from a solar cell make it into a battery.
With this new design, light is converted to electrons inside the battery, so nearly 100 per cent of the electrons are saved.
For the study, doctoral student Mingzhe Yu designed a permeable mesh solar panel from titanium gauze, a flexible fabric upon which he grew vertical rods of titanium dioxide like blades of grass. Air passes freely through the gauze while the rods capture sunlight.
Normally, connecting a solar cell to a battery would require the use of four electrodes, the researchers explained.
Their hybrid design uses only three.
The mesh solar panel forms the first electrode. Beneath, the researchers placed a thin sheet of porous carbon (the second electrode) and a lithium plate (the third electrode).
Between the electrodes, they sandwiched layers of electrolyte to carry electrons back and forth.
During charging, light hits the mesh solar panel and creates electrons. Inside the battery, electrons are involved in the chemical decomposition of lithium peroxide into lithium ions and oxygen.
The oxygen is released into the air, and the lithium ions are stored in the battery as lithium metal after capturing the electrons.
When the battery discharges, it chemically consumes oxygen from the air to re-form the lithium peroxide.
An iodide additive in the electrolyte acts as a "shuttle" that carries electrons, and transports them between the battery electrode and the mesh solar panel.
The research is published in the journal Nature Communications.

Traders bullish on Infosys on expectations of Vishal Sikka unveiling a growth map

(Analysts said many traders…)
MUMBAI: Savvy traders have placed bullish bets on Infosys ahead of its second quarter earnings due on Friday, October 10. Brokers and analysts said the long positions in Infosys futures and options contracts have been created on hopes that the software exporter's new chief executive officer Vishal Sikka may announce a road map for its future growth.
"Traders can expect 3-4% upside in Infosys stock price on the results day. Most of the positions in the futures segment are long in nature. Bears have gone into hiding from the stock," said Amit Gupta, head of derivatives at ICICI Direct. Infy futures open interest, or outstanding positions, at the beginning of the October series is currently around 33 lakh shares, compared to about 25 lakh shares at the beginning of the September series.
Analysts said many traders have squared off their short positions ahead of the results. Infosys saw a strong open interest build-up on the long side last week. The stock has also given a major breakout on the weekly charts above Rs 3,680, said Ashish Chaturmohta, head of technical and derivatives desk at Fortune Equity Broking. Infosys shares closed at Rs 3,847.20 on Wednesday.
Chaturmohta expects the stock to rise another 7-8% in the near term. In Infy call options, the highest open interest is at 4,000 strike in the October series. Analysts said the build-up suggests traders expect stock to rise to Rs 4,000.
"We expect the Infosys stock to move substantially higher in the October series. The open interest in out-of-the-money (OTM) call option (the strike price that is higher than the market price) has been increasing, which is a strong bullish indicator," said Alex Mathews, head of research at Geojit BNP Paribas.
Recently, CLSA has upgraded Infosys rating to 'Buy' from 'Outperform', and has increased its price target to Rs 4,500 from Rs 3,750. Infosys shares have rallied nearly 20% in the last three months, and have outperformed the BSE IT Index, which has gained 17.5%.
The broader benchmark Sensex has gained 4% during the same period. Amar Ambani, head of research at IIFL, said, "IT companies are expected to report strong quarterly performance driven by seasonal project ramp-ups, and currency tailwinds. There is also a high likelihood of incrementally encouraging commentary by most companies on revenue visibility given US growth acceleration."

More power: 90% of coal bearing forests to b...90% of coal-bearing forests could be mined, says Forest Survey of India
Urmi Goswami, ET Bureau Oct 6, 2014, 04.00AM IST
(The FSI has, at the request…)
NEW DELHI: Nearly 90% of coal bearing forest areas could be opened up for mining, with the Forest Survey of India (FSI), the government's top body for assessing and monitoring forests, recommending that mining be barred in just 11% of forest areas with proven reserves of the dry fuel.
The recommendation, if accepted, would increase domestic coal production, and could bring down imports. Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar is expected to make a decision soon. The FSI has, at the request of the environment ministry, conducted an assessment to determine how much of the forests should be kept out of bounds of mining activities.
Indications are that only those forests that are extremely rich in biodiversity and cannot be regenerated by human efforts will be classified as inviolate or out of bounds for mining. "Mining will not be allowed in national sanctuaries and parks and wildlife reserves," an official explained. This is a significant reduction from the 29% forest area that had been demarcated as out of bounds for coal mining.
Activists critical of committee's recommendations
This was done as part of the "no-go/go" exercise undertaken jointly by the Central Mine Planning & Design Institute, a subsidiary of Coal India, and the environment ministry in 2010. That classification of coal-bearing forest areas had been undertaken across the coal fields of Talcher, Ib Valley, Singrauli, Mandiraigarh, Wardha, Sohagpur, North Karanpura, West Bokaro and Hasdeo Arand. That analysis used forest density and cover as parameters for determining areas to be kept out of bounds, and adjusting the results by adopting a cluster approach for coal blocks, and reworking coal block boundaries.
Mining was to be permitted in 4,62,939 hectares of the 6,48,750 hectares of coal-bearing forests that were assessed. "India can't afford to keep 30% of its coal-bearing forests out of bounds. We need to increase power generation, don't forget that there are as many as 400 million people who have no access to electricity and power is crucial for industrial growth. As of now coal is the mainstay of the country's energy basket," a senior official said, explaining the need to open larger areas for coal mining.
The ministry, which is still considering the FSI's assessment, argues that it is not an indiscriminate exercise to open up more areas for coal mining. "The no-go/go exercise mapped forest areas and coal blocks, evaluating the areas in terms of density of forest cover, area of the coal block under forest cover or gross forest cover and weighted forest cover (classifying the forests as very dense, moderately dense and open forests).
The current assessment takes into considerations parameters such as wildlife, forest cover, forest type, and landscape," a senior official argued. The most recent exercise by the FSI is a dilution of the recommendations of the 2012 committee headed by then environment secretary Tishyarakshit Chatterjee, which was asked to formulate objective parameters for identification of inviolate forest areas. The committee had used six indicators - forest type, biological richness, wildlife value, density of forest cover, integrity of landscape and hydrological value — to decide on forest areas where mining will not be permitted. Its report, submitted in July 2012, didn't find favour with ministries like coal, which feared that large swathes of forests would be kept out of bounds for mining.
The new NDA government, which reviewed the committee's recommendation, decided to revisit the assessments after objections were raised by the coal ministry. It decided to reduce the number of parameters for determining "inviolate" forests from six to four — wildlife value, forest cover, forest type, and integrity of landscape. Officials argued that biological richness is accounted for under wildlife value, and hydrological value under forest cover.
Activists have been critical of the Chatterjee committee's recommendations arguing that its parameters were narrow as it didn't take into account the loss of livelihoods and homes for large populations who are dependent on forests. They argue that the FSI assessment is flawed as well.
"The environment ministry is looking at the big picture, now we hope that the coal ministry will also address issues like their poor reforestation record, adhering to conditions laid out in the environmental and forest clearances, use better technology to disrupt smaller patches of forest," a government official said. Some experts argue that increasing the forest area where mining could be allowed is unlikely to make a major dent in India's coal imports.
According to the International Energy Agency, in 2013 India was a net importer of 178 million tonnes of coal. Domestic output accounted for 613 million tonnes, or 7.8% of global coal production. An increase in domestic coal production is unlikely to do away with imports. A crucial reason for this is that domestic coal is high in ash content, and is often not favoured by power plants using supercritical technologies.

The Khaps of Haryana: Social or political6
0
Kaithal: Khap Panchayats have existed for hundreds of years and their writ still runs large, especially in Haryana. Ahead of the Assembly elections, CNN-IBN caught up with a Khap in Kaithal to see if things are changing.
Some of Haryana's Khap Panchayats have supported honour killings in the past. Not recognised by the Constitution, but Khaps do control opinions in Haryana and every political party wants their support. CNN-IBN met a group of Khap leaders in Kaithal who have chosen to keep away from election politics.
Khap spokesperson Dharampal Dhariwal said that they will issue no orders, edicts, directives for the assembly elections and that people are free to make their choices as they deem fit.
#haryana assembly elections 2014 #haryana polls #khap panchayat #kaithal
These Khap leaders also accept that they have to adapt their views if they want to remain socially relevant especially amongst the next generation.
"If the khaps continue social work and act inspirational, then the youth can remain connected. If instead of inspiring the khaps try to become directorial and issue all kinds of social control orders, then their role will go on diminishing," said Khap leader Mange Ram Pai.
Khaps are supposed to be apolitical but what is being noticed in Haryana elections this time around is that there seems to be a division within the khaps themselves. Some khaps are showing political leanings, their leaders are wanting to get tickets on behalf of parties and that is bothering the rest of the khaps.
"Khap is not involved in any kind of politics. Some people try to take advantage from political parties in the name of Khap. Khap is there to solve social issues. They have no role in politics," said Khap leader Raghveer Sarpanch.
Even as Haryana's Khaps try to stay apolitical, it is a matter of time before they get drawn into politics, not just as drivers of opinion but even as real participants.

Here s why brokerages are bullish on KPIT Tech; Target price set at Rs 245You are here: Home > Collections
Why KPIT Tech is poised for growth
Narendra Nathan, ET Bureau Oct 6, 2014, 09.28AM IST
Tags:
Analyst
(KPIT Tech’s recent poor…)
KPIT Technologies could not match up to its peers in the recent IT stocks rally because the company missed the guidance for 2013-14. The low earnings growth of 5 per cent expected in 2014-15 is yet another reason for its poor show. KPIT also fell below the broader market and its under-performance against the Sensex stands at 31 per cent on a year-to-date basis.
However, analysts are getting bullish on the counter now for various reasons. First, the recent show has brought the company's valuation down to very low levels and is, therefore, at attractive levels with a PE of close to 13. There is also a possibility of the counter being re-rated in the coming quarters.
Second, its earnings growth is expected to pick up to 19 per cent in 2015-16. The management's increased focus on its top 50 clients and the restructuring efforts is also expected to drive revenue growth. KPIT's asset-light model should also allow higher EBITDA margin expansion. Like other IT companies, KPIT Technologies should benefit from the recent dollar appreciation.
However, the company's main growth is going to come from the overall change in the macro environment. Revival in growth in the US is good news for the IT sector, including KPIT. With the improvement in macro environment, companies across the manufacturing verticals are showing signs of increasing their discretionary IT spending.
Increased discretionary spending is good for KPIT's SAP and IES ( Oracle ) units that have been struggling for the last several quarters. It missed the guidance for 2013-14 due to a fall in its SAP revenues (SAP unit that contributes around 25 per cent of its revenues declined by 11 per cent during 2013-14) because of delayed deal closures. However, the SAP unit has already witnessed a turnaround in the April-June quarter with a low single-digit margin. Its EBITDA margin is expected to go up to high single digits by the fourth quarter of 2014-15.
The disappointing first quarter result was primarily because of the low order intake from its automotive vertical and the expected revival in the auto sector due to the fall in global crude prices is another factor that will help KPIT. Due to KPIT's technological superiority, it should be able to retain its dominant share in the automotive vertical.
Realisation should also increase because the demand mix will be shifting to high-end functionalities, i.e., more and more OEMs have begun to adopt electronic systems and have integrated semiconductor circuits in vehicles.
Selection methodology We choose the stock that has shown the maximum increase in consensus analyst rating during the past one month. Consensus rating is arrived at by averaging the recommendations of all analyst and after attributing weights to each (5 for strong buy, 4 for buy, 3 for hold, 2 for sell and 1 for strong sell).
Any improvement in consensus analyst rating indicates that analysts are becoming more and more bullish on the stock. To make sure that we pick only companies with decent analyst coverage, this search will be restricted to stocks that have been covered by at least 10 analysts.

Road accident deaths in India: Timely help to victims can be a saviour22
0
New Delhi: Road safety is one issue that needs special attention as there's one death reported every 4 minutes on the streets of India. India holds the highest number of deaths due to road accidents.
Nearly 5 lakh road accidents were reported in 2013 in which more than 1 lakh people lost their lives. A large chunk of the victims were aged between 30 and 44 years.
The crucial time between the accident and getting the victim medical attention can often be the difference between life and death. Unfortunately not many value that precious time.
#road accidents #road safety campaign #helmets #first aid
"If the patients are not arriving at the hospital in time, then it becomes complicated. A simple thing like bringing a patient in time can result in a question of life and death," said AIIMS doctor Dr Amit Gupta.
Aditi Bhat from Save Life Foundation says that bystanders also play a vital role in saving lives. But most are afraid of legal hassles and police harassment. That's why her foundation filed a PIL in 2011 for a law to protect those who help accident victims. "We are asking for a good samaritan law which will protect and insulate good samaritan only for the act of helping injured on road," Aditi says.
In January, a Supreme Court appointed committee submitted a report on the Good Samaritan Law. The final verdict will be out by the end of October. But apart from helping others, one can help oneself too.
According to a WHO report, wearing a helmet reduces chances of death by 40 per cent and that of severe injury by 70 per cent. The report says that using child restraints reduces likelihood of a fatal crash by 70 per cent among infants and up to 80 per cent in young children. Wearing a seatbelt can reduce fatal injuries by 50 per cent for front seat occupants and up to 75 per cent for those sitting in rear seats.
With one death reported every 4 minutes, India records the highest number of road accident related deaths in the whole world. But the law commission of India says 50 per cent of these victims can be saved if they get medical assistance on time.

Ceasefire violation: 5 killed in heavy shelling by Pak troopsCeasefire violation: 5 killed in heavy shelling by Pak troops
PTI
Tweet
Jammu, Oct 6:  
Five villagers were killed and 29 injured in heavy mortar shelling and firing by Pakistani troops targeting hamlets and outposts along the international border in Jammu district today in one of the worst ceasefire violations.
“Pakistani Rangers resorted to heavy and unprovoked firing and shelling of mortars on 10 border outposts (BoPs) and civilian areas along international border (IB) in Arnia belt of Jammu district from 10 pm last night,” a BSF spokesman said today.
They used small, automatic weapons and mortar bombs to target the border hamlets and BoPs along the borderline. BSF troops guarding the borderline retaliated effectively and gave a befitting reply, he said, adding that the intermittent firing exchanges are going on in the area.
In the shelling, five villagers were killed and 29 injured in several hamlets, Sub—Divisional Police Officer (SDPO), R S Pura Tehsil, Devender Shingh told PTI.
25 of the injured have been shifted to GMC hospital Jammu.
A large number of houses were damaged and livestock perished in the firing and shelling, said Singh, who was leading a team of police personnel who risked their lives to shift the injured people to hospital during the heavy shelling.
“People living in critical zones along the border will be evacuated,” he said
A BSF spokesman said that the force did not suffer any casualty.
This was the 11th ceasefire violations along Indo-Pak border in Jammu and Kashmir during last four days. There have been seven ceasefire violations along Line of Control in Poonch and four along IB in Jammu.
On October 3, Pakistani troops and rangers violated ceasefire in Gulamarg sector of Kashmir Valley and in Poonch and Jammu sectors in which a girl was killed and six persons were injured.

Farmers to suffer losses as onion prices set to fall further

(Onion farmers are staring…)
PUNE: Onion farmers are staring at the prospect of losses this year as the already low prices could drop even further with the arrival of kharif crop in the market. The wholesale price of onion has fallen 40% in the past three months to Rs 12 per kg at Lasalgaon in Nashik, the country's onion hub.
This followed the government's decision to bring the commodity under the Essential Commodity Act to check soaring prices. Prices had begun to rise towards the end of June amid speculation that hailstorms, which hit Maharashtra in March and April, would adversely affect the crop.
But this proved wrong as the country had an all-time high onion harvest in the following months. Experts say such speculative movement of price could be checked to a large extent if authorities maintain correct data of the area under the crop cultivation. "No government agency could correctly estimate the huge increase in area under onion. Despite the heavy loss caused by hailstorm, we have so much of onion still coming to the market," said Nanasaheb Patil,chairman, Lasalgaon APMC and director National Agricultural Co-operative Marketing Federation (Nafed).
Onion arrival in Lasalgaon jumped 581% year-on-year to 3.75 lakh quintal in September this year. The market had seen only 55,000 quintal of onion in September 2013. The trend is continuing even this month.
Lasalgaon saw arrival of 13,000 quintal of onion on the first day of October, against 12,500 quintal in the entire October month last year. In addition, erratic weather pushed up the input costs of farmers. In normal course, onion prices increase between June and November as the stored stock dwindles.
With a higher price in later months, farmers are able to make up for the losses in storage. But it may not be the case this year as there is no shortage of the commodity. The 'Pol' variety (early kharif) of onion is expected to flood the markets by the first week of November. Traders expect prices to rise to about Rs 15/kg after Diwali. But no one now is now talking about a jump in onion prices.

Post your opinion here
 
Telecom operators have raised mobile internet rates up to 100 percent in June-September period across country.
Airtel  is latest to increase mobile rates by up to 33 percent while Vodafone and Idea have started gradually implementing the increased mobile internet rates from June.
The three companies jointly hold around 57 percent mobile services market share.
While no comments were received from Airtel and Idea Cellular , Vodafone India spokesperson said "Around 2 months ago, we changed the base tariff of 2G for 1GB pack from Rs 155 to Rs 175. This has been carried out in a phased manner across circles."
Airtel and Idea too have increased the rate of 1GB 2G mobile internet pack to around Rs 175 from about Rs 155 GB.
Also read: Airtel may have to pay Rs 436cr for merging Qualcomm 4G arm
Telecom operators generally don't make public announcement about increase in mobile tariff. The change is noticed on their website after the new rates are implemented.
They generally inform their post paid customer through SMS about change in rates of services before their next billing cycle starts.
Pre-paid customers, which constitutes over 90 per cent of market, get to know about rate revision when they go to recharge their mobile phone or through website of companies.
Telecom operators are required to report change in tariff to telecom regulator TRAI.
Vodafone and Idea Cellular increased rack rate, charged without any offer or scheme, by up to 100 per cent from 2 paise per 10 kb of data usage to 4 paise per 10 kb.
This means on Vodafone and Idea network 1 GB of 2G or 3G mobile internet will cost over Rs 4,000 (from Rs 2,000) which these companies under scheme are selling for around Rs 175.
Airtel started increasing mobile internet rates around first week of September. The company is now at par with Vodafone and Idea in terms of rack rate which is 4 paise per 10 kb. However, the increase is only of 33 percent because the company was already charging 3 paise per 10 kb earlier.
The 2G data pack rate of Airtel is highest among the three at 10 paise per 10 kb which means cost of 1GB mobile internet usage without any scheme or offer for a subscriber is over Rs 10,000 which company is now selling for Rs 176.
Bharti Airtel stock price
On November 24, 2014, Bharti Airtel closed at Rs 398.65, down Rs 2.1, or 0.52 percent. The 52-week high of the share was Rs 419.90 and the 52-week low was Rs 282.10.
The company's trailing 12-month (TTM) EPS was at Rs 27.40 per share as per the quarter ended September 2014. The stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio was 14.55. The latest book value of the company is Rs 166.93 per share. At current value, the price-to-book value of the company is 2.39.

Oil prices slip on increased supply  strong dollarOil prices slip on increased supply, strong dollar
PTI
Tweet
Hong Kong, Oct 6:  
Crude prices slipped today to multi-year lows owing to a build-up in supplies while the dollar rallied in response to a strong US jobs report, as analysts warned of further losses.
US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for November delivery was down five cents at US $ 89.69. On Friday it closed below US $ 90 for the first time since April 2013. Brent North Sea crude eased 36 cents to US $ 91.95, a two-year low.
While output surges in the United States owing to oil shale extraction, exports are on the rise in Russia, Libya and Kurdistan. Also, Saudi Arabia cut prices for the fourth straight month last week to defend its market share, suggesting it is unlikely to cut production any time soon.
Both Brent and New York contracts have shed about 15 per cent in the past three months.
“Oil prices are likely to keep falling for the rest of the year as global supply is outstripping demand,” said Tony Nunan, oil risk manager at Mitsubishi Corp. in Tokyo.
“Supply of U.S. shale gas alone can cover global demand this year, and unless OPEC countries reduce their production, or unless a fresh geopolitical concern occurs, the best estimate now is a bearish market,” he added.
Also depressing prices is the stronger dollar, which surged Friday after the Labour Department said the U.S. economy created 248,000 jobs in September and the jobless rate dipped to a six-year low of 5.9 per cent.
The news increased the likelihood the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates sooner than later. The greenback is sitting at six-year highs against the yen and two-year highs against the euro.
A stronger greenback makes dollar-priced commodities more expensive for buyers using weaker currencies, which tends to dent demand and push prices lower.

Gold has also failed to capitalise on geopolitical tensions caused by military conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the rise of Islamic State, which has declared a cross-border caliphate in Iraq and Syria.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
SINGAPORE: Gold tumbled to its lowest level in around 15 months on Monday after better-than-expected US jobs data boosted the dollar, dampening safe-haven appetite for bullion and pushing silver and platinum to multi-year lows.
Gold, which often influences other precious metals, has also failed to capitalise on geopolitical tensions caused by military conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the rise of Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.
By 0641 GMT, cash gold was little changed at $1,191.30 an ounce after earlier falling to $1,183.46 an ounce, its weakest since June 2013.
Platinum touched its lowest since 2009, silver fell to its weakest since 2010, and palladium hit an 8-month low.
"A strong dollar is a major problem for gold. Sentiment is very bearish but I think we expect some kind of rebound," said Ronald Leung, chief dealer at Lee Cheong Gold Dealers in Hong Kong, who pegged support at $1,180 an ounce.
"There's a little bit of physical buying, but premiums haven't changed. We have to see what happens later in the day. If demand is coming, of course, it will push up the premiums."
Premiums for gold were quoted at $1.20 to $1.60 an ounce to the spot London prices, unchanged from last week, despite a sharp drop in cash gold prices.
The absence of main gold consumer China is weighing on the physical market, which usually sees a pick up in demand from jewellers and retail investors when prices fall.
Chinese markets have been shut for national holidays and will reopen on Wednesday.
US gold was $1,191.70 an ounce, down 0.10 per cent.
The dollar held on Monday near a more than four-year high, touched after last week's upbeat US nonfarm payrolls report increased speculation that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates in mid-2015 or earlier.
Data from the Labor Department on Friday showed US non-farm payrolls rose 248,000 last month and the jobless rate fell to 5.9 per cent, the lowest since July 2008, underscoring that the US economy continues to improve.
In Tokyo, sellers pushed up premiums for gold bars to 25 cents to spot London prices from zero last week to offset the decline in global prices.
"At this moment, demand is not good. But maybe when the holiday in China is over, the premiums may go up further," said a dealer in Tokyo.
Markets in Singapore, a key bullion trading centre in Southeast Asia, were also closed for a public holiday.

Stop violating ceasefire agreement: Rajnath Singh toPakistanPrint
Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: October 6, 2014 11:35 am | Updated: October 6, 2014 11:41 am
India on Monday asked Pakistan to stop violating the ceasefire agreement after heavy shelling and firing from across the border left five villagers dead and at least 50 injured.
“Pakistan should stop ceasefire violations now and understand the reality that times have changed in India,” Home Minister Rajnath Singh said.
He said the Centre is monitoring the situation and Jammu and Kashmir government is taking steps to provide relief to the residents of border areas affected by Pakistani firing.
Congress said the ceasefire violations by Pakistan were a “serious issue” and it should desist from such activities.
“Whatever Pakistan is doing is certainly a serious matter. And we want to tell Pakistan that indulging in such activities is not good for that country,” Congress leader Rashid Alvi said.
Condemning Pakistan’s actions, former External Affairs Minister Salman Khurshid said it is despicable that such incidents have occurred on Eid. “There cannot be anything worse than this,” the Congress leader said.
Five villagers were killed and at least 50 injured in heavy mortar shelling and firing by Pakistani troops targeting hamlets and outposts along the International Border in Jammu district since last night in one of the worst ceasefire violations.
This was the 11th ceasefire violations along Indo-Pak border in Jammu and Kashmir during last four days. On October 3, Pakistani troops and Rangers violated
ceasefire in Gulmarg sector of Kashmir Valley and in Poonch and Jammu sectors in which a girl was killed and six persons were injured.

Interacting with media here after the airing of the first episode of the new season of ‘Satyamev Jayate’, the 49-year-old actor said, “Our children have the right to be taught sports as they are taught Maths or English.
“There is a strong need to reach out to children of weaker sections of society for teaching them sports. Sports should be made integral part of curriculum of main education.” On the habit of new age children interested in indoor games, Aamir said, “It frightens me that children play alone and are cut off from the rest of the world. Outdoor games help
in connecting with people.”
The ‘Dhoom 3 ‘ star said that intake of drugs by the youth is also a matter of concern. “We will come out with an episode in future to keep children away from drugs,” he said.

Talking about ‘Satyamev Jayate’, the actor said, “I am not the hero of the show. I get you introduced to the hero, the people who have been doing good things in their life.” Aamir said that the issue-based show has had an impact on the society and government in different states, including Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra which have taken decisions like distribution of generic medicines free to poor and raising the sex ratio.
He admitted that there is a need to highlight certain issues concerning Bollywood as well.
Aamir said that each individual had a capacity to do something and must contribute towards bringing change in the country. “If I can’t solve any problem that does not mean I sit idle, keep quiet and become a fence sitter. This country belongs to all…contribution from everybody is needed for bringing a change,” he said.
Aamir ruled out any plan to join politics, saying, “I enjoy my work.”

Shiv Sena questions Modis new-found respect for BalThackerayComments
The Shiv Sena on Monday launched a blistering attack on the BJP, blaming it for the end of their 25-year-old alliance and questioned Narendra Modi’s ‘new-found’ respect for Bal Thackeray after the PM refrained from criticising the former ally at a poll rally in Maharashtra as a tribute to the late patriarch.
“Modi says that he will not attack the Sena in his speeches as he has respect for Balasaheb Thackeray. We too respect the PM.
“But when you back-stabbed us merely on the issue of seat sharing, where did that respect disappear then? Did you not think of Balasaheb before breaking the alliance forged on the principles of Hindutva,” the Sena said in its editorial mouthpiece ‘Saamana’.
The Prime Minister while campaigning at Tasgaon in Sangli district on Sunday had said that he would “not utter a single word” against the Sena out of respect for Bal Thackeray.
“Political pundits are saying why is Modi not criticising Shiv Sena in his speeches (during poll campaign). This is the first election in absence of late Bal Thackeray, for whom I have great respect. I have decided not to utter a single word against Shiv Sena. This is my tribute to Balasaheb Thackeray,” Modi had said.
Equating the BJP with the “corrupt” Congress and the NCP, the Sena said that people in Maharashtra have now realized who are the “real and hidden” thieves of the state.
“It is a known fact that the Congress and the NCP have looted Maharashtra. But for what purpose did the CM of Gujarat Anandiben Patel visit Maharashtra? If she asks all the industrialists to set base in Gujarat, leaving Maharashtra behind, this too amounts to looting Maharashtra,” the editorial said.
“How do you define keeping an eye on the coffers of the state and making a deal of Mumbai (for the benefit of Gujarat)? Is this not looting Maharashtra ? And then talking
about the blessings of Shivaji Maharaj is nothing but a farce,” it said.
“Never before has anyone opened a market of Shivaji Maharaj’s blessings,” the Sena added.

Mexico mass murder: Hitmen admit killing 17 of 43 missing MexicanstudentsState police guard the road leading to the site where an alleged clandestine grave was found near the town of Pueblo Viejo, Mexico, Saturday, Oct. 4, 2014. (Source: AP)
Associated Press | Iguala | Posted: October 6, 2014 11:26 am | Updated: October 6, 2014 4:12 pm
Two gang hitmen linked to police admitted to killing 17 of 43 students missing in southern Mexico, prosecutors have said, amid fears the victims were among bodies found in a mass grave. Inaky Blanco, the chief prosecutor of violence-plagued Guerrero state, said on Sunday it would take at least 15 days to identify the 28 bodies in the clandestine grave, some of which were badly burned and in pieces.

The site was found Saturday in Pueblo Viejo, an impoverished district of the city of Iguala, where the missing students were last seen on the night of September 26, some 200 kilometres south of Mexico City. “A bed of branches and tree trunks was made, on which the bodies of the victims were laid and a flammable substance was used,” Blanco said.

The students disappeared after Iguala municipal police officers shot at buses transporting them, and Blanco said the Guerreros Unidos gang participated in a night of violence that left six people dead, 25 wounded and 43 missing. While the students are accused of having hijacked the buses, Blanco said the motive for the attack remains under investigation.
The case could become one of the worst slaughters that Mexico has witnessed since the drug war intensified in 2006, leaving 80,000 people dead to date, and by far the most horrific since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012.
Earlier yesterday, some parents and hundreds of fellow students from the missing group’s teacher training college blocked the highway between Guerrero’s capital Chilpancingo and Acapulco, voicing anger at the authorities. Survivors said the students had gone to Iguala to conduct fundraising activities and came under attack by police after they boarded three buses.

Interview With a Vampire one of my worst films: BradPittPress Trust of India | London | Posted: October 6, 2014 11:09 am
Hollywood superstar Brad Pitt has revealed his 1994 horror film ‘Interview With a Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles’ was one of his worst movies ever.
The 50-year-old actor starred with Tom Cruise in the movie and says if the project had come along later in his career, he would have either had changes made or walked away from the film, reported Contactmusic.
“It was one of the worst experiences of my life. Six months in the dark, contact lenses, make-up… Now I would be able to say, ‘This is a problem, we fix this, or I’m out of here,” Pitt said.
The ‘Fury’ star says he lacked direction and focus in his early career, and did not concentrate on doing quality films.

What’s stopping you from getting rich? Not bad luck, but faulty investing strategies

(If you really want to get…)
You are a diligent saver, a careful investor and a meticulous planner. Yet, you have not been able to build wealth even as everyone around you seems to be wallowing in money. What's stopping you from getting rich? If it's bad luck, you can buy one of those good fortune charms hawked on late night TV shows. But if you really want to get to the root of the problem, you need to assess where you are going wrong in your investments.
Our cover story this week is about the money myths and investing flaws that prevent you from getting rich. It could be the lure of penny stocks or the tantalising potential of the futures and options segment. Small investors often lose their shirts (and nearly everything else) when they enter these high-risk arenas without adequate knowledge.
But mistakes can happen even if you play ultra safe. If a fixed deposit offers 9%, the post-tax returns for someone in the 30% tax bracket will be barely 6.3%. That's not too bad until you factor in 8% inflation. So even though the investor does not feel it, his money is losing value. This is one of the biggest investing mistakes Indians make when they pour money into fixed deposits. In the following pages, we have listed the common hurdles that prevent investors from getting rich.
Many of these hurdles are really self made. They can be done away with by changing your approach to investing. Gold, for instance, should not occupy more than 5-10% allocation in your portfolio. This can happen if you treat the yellow metal less as an investment and more as a hedging tool.
There's no point in dwelling on mistakes unless we can offer a solution. So, each financial mistake has been followed by advice on how to avoid it. This stress on utility has been ET Wealth's hallmark since the time it was launched. In this 200th issue of the newspaper, we hope to live up to the expectations of our readers.
You might be losing your money in the following ways:

it can move in range of 20-36. If it goes towards 20, it can be excellent opportunity to make a quick buck in this stock. It can given more than 50% returns in just 15 days. I am expecting level of 36-38 by end of this expiry unless any further negative news breaks out for the group. It cannot be said that there is no downside from current level but more probability is of upside from here and on any downside. I have already plan to buy it near 20 level. Hope that it comes next week. If do not come over there, I will not hesitate to enter at level of 25 also. But will do it looking at the overall situation  and trend in the group stocks. Risk reward ratio will be in favour of bulls in this stock. It will be 70-30 in favour of bulls. But this stock is for bravehearts only as the must also be able to cough up upto 20% slide also, if it comes and should not frighten from such downmove as it will make that downside in quick time also.

RBI tweaking definition of wilful defaulters: GovernorAnand Adhikari      Follow @anandadhikari    Last Updated: October 1, 2014  | 11:40 IST
RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan (Photo: Reuters)
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is in the process of modifying the definition of wilful defaulters to restrict the penalty only against the directors (apart from promoters) who are actually seen as culpable or actively participating in wilful default.
This is based on a recent Gujarat High Court order that struck down a part of the RBI's master circular on wilful default, which gives freedom to banks to declare all directors of a defaulting company as wilful defaulters , especially in case of diversion of funds.
"We are in the process of modifying it to include directors who are seen as culpable or actively participating or being grossly negligent in the wilful default," said RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan during a media interaction after reviewing the central bank's monetary policy where he kept interest rates on hold.
A wilful default occurs when a defaulting borrower doesn't honour an obligation despite having the capacity to pay, or siphoning of funds and disposing off assets without the knowledge of the bank.
A month ago, the RBI introduced another clause to the guidelines by banks to initiate action against the guarantors of a loan (mostly group companies) in case of a wilful default.
The wilful default guidelines have come under close scrutiny after Kolkata-based United Bank of India declared liquor baron Vijay Mallya and three other directors of the ailing Kingfisher Airlines as "wilful defaulters" in early September. The current guidelines have enough grey areas. For instance, the number of directors declared as defaulter in a single company varies among banks. In view of the rising bad loan cases, the finance ministry is also working on bringing about a law for wilful default.
As a prudential measure, the RBI is introducing a new category of non-cooperative defaulters. These are borrowers who resist paying, thereby holding up the process by approaching courts or through other means.
"This is not a legal definition but a regulatory definition, which will mean that higher capital and provisioning will be required for lending to these borrowers," said Rajan.

Convenience  a core area for Orios investmentUpdated: October 4, 2014 22:13 IST
Convenience, a core area for Orios’ investment
Ramnath Subbu
company information
A new generation of IT entrepreneurs in India is offering new and cutting-edge software products and this, with the increased consumption of software could see India increase its presence in the global industry going forward.
Rehan Yar Khan, founder and general partner, Orios Venture Partners, is an early stage investor in software product and e-commerce companies, whose fund recently raised Rs.300 crore in the domestic market. According to him, `Convenience’ is the core area Orios will be investing in going forward.
“Our reading as a fund is that people are becoming richer but they have less time. We are continuously looking out for winners and the new economy rewards innovation — whether it is Amazon in the U.S., Alibaba in China or Flipkart in India — all have become leaders through innovation.’’
Mr. Khan said the Indian software industry had finally found the confidence to venture into software products “which is seeing an explosion and is in itself a $ 2 trillion industry globally. The story is now moving from software services to products — a welcome move up the value chain, and we are seeing some amasing new products.’’
Secondly, there is a large emerging consumer market online. “India has 30 million online shoppers, and this is expected to reach 120 million by 2020 as phone shopping is moving to online shopping. In essence, the driver going forward is ‘convenience’. Online shopping, thanks to logistics reaches 90 per cent of the pin codes in the country.’’

Russia s Rosneft offers OVL stake in Vankor oilfieldRussia's Rosneft offers OVL stake in Vankor oilfield
Press Trust of India | New Delhi Oct 06, 2014 12:46 AM IST
On the heels of selling 10 per cent stake in its Vankor oilfield to China for $1 billion, Russia's biggest oil company, Rosneft, has offered a similar stake to India's Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC).
Rosneft has made a formal offer to sell 10 per cent stake in the oilfield in Siberia to ONGC Videsh Ltd, the foreign arm of the state-owned explorer, sources privy to the development said.
Last month, Rosneft sold a 10 per cent stake in the Vankor cluster fields in northern Siberia to China's CNPC for about $1 billion. Vankor is the largest field to have been discovered and brought into production in Russia in the past 25 years. As of January 1, the initial recoverable reserves in the Vankor field are estimated at 500 million tonnes of oil and condensate, and 182 billion cubic metres of gas.
MIGHTY FIELD
As on January 1, the initial recoverable reserves in the Vankor field are estimated at 500 mn tonnes of oil and condensate, and 182 bn cubic metres of gas
The oilfield will reach peak output of 500,000 barrels a day in 2019
Sources said OVL was examinig the proposal and would make an offer after that.
Vankor will reach peak output of 500,000 barrels a day or 25 million tonnes a year in 2019. The field has driven recent Russian output growth and pumped 435,000 bpd in September.
Russia is the world's top oil producer with current output of 10.5 million bpd but its key producing region — West Siberia — is maturing.
Russia and Rosneft are courting China and India after the European Union  and US slapped sanctions on them for Moscow's involvement in Ukraine. The sanctions would further restrict Rosneft's access to foreign loans, prohibiting the company from receiving any loans with more than 30 days maturity. Rosneft's finances have been strained by the sanctions. Prior to offering stake in Vankor, Rosneft had on August 5, sent a formal proposal to OVL for joint development of Yurubcheno-Tokhomskoye oilfield in eastern Siberia.
The field is estimated to hold 991 million barrels of oil equivalent reserves and is planned to start production in 2017. Yurubcheno-Tokhomskoye will reach a production plateau of up to five million tonnes a year (100,000 barrels per day) in 2019.
Rosneft, Russia's biggest oil company and the world's largest listed producer by output, offered to make a management presentation along with Physical Data Room access to OVL in Moscow, sources said.
OVL is interested in expanding its presence in Russia as it looks to source one million barrels per day of oil and oil-equivalent gas from Russia.
OVL already has 20 per cent stake in the Sakhalin-1 oil and gas field in Far East Russia and in 2009 acquired Imperial Energy, which has fields in Siberia, for $2.1 billion.

(Yahoo recently acquired…)
By Michael J De La Merced and Mike Isaac
Yahoo, flush with cash from selling a portion of its stake in the Alibaba Group of China, appears ready to bet on what it believes will be the next big Internet phenomenon.
The company has held talks to invest in Snapchat, the extremely popular app that allows photos and messages to self-destruct, people briefed on the matter said Friday. The deal has not yet closed, some of these people added.
Should Yahoo make the investment, it will join a bevy of other prominent investors, including the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, that have valued the disappearing-photo service at about $10 billion.
While Yahoo is not expected to invest a huge amount of money in Snapchat, the investment could give it access to the messaging phenomenon and help Yahoo become more relevant to young consumer audiences once more. It would also give the company a more strategic stake in mobile technology, an area in which Yahoo has long been seen as a laggard compared with competitors like Facebook and Google.
Yahoo has been bolstered by a roughly $6 billion haul from selling a significant portion of its holdings in Alibaba, the fast-growing Chinese shopping behemoth that went public last month. At least half of the proceeds from the sale will go toward buying back stock, but some of the money could go toward strategic acquisitions and investments.
Talks between Yahoo and Snapchat gained steam late this summer, some of the people briefed on the matter said.
  In that vein, Yahoo recently acquired MessageMe, a small photo and text messaging startup in San Francisco, according to a person close to the company. It is yet another in a string of small mobile startup acquisitions for Yahoo, which began soon after Marissa Mayer, Yahoo's chief executive, took the top position in 2012.
Yet that strategy could expose Yahoo to criticism from shareholders leery that the Alibaba windfall will lead to another spending spree. The activist hedge fund Starboard Value emerged as an investor in the company last week and pointedly demanded that Yahoo not pursue takeovers of debatable value like the $1.1 billion acquisition of the blogging site Tumblr.
Though Snapchat has garnered millions of regular users who send hundreds of millions of photos and videos every day, it has yet to generate any revenue.
The young company is celebrated in Silicon Valley circles, particularly for its popularity among the much-coveted millennial demographic. Snapchat, which is based in Venice, California, has raised upward of $160 million in venture capital; last fall, the company spurned a $3 billion acquisition offer from Facebook.
Snapchat has been experimenting with ways to distribute content on its popular network. It has worked with musicians, large brands and popular users on its network to figure out different ways to distribute "snaps" - the company's name for its disappearing messages - that will keep its member base coming back regularly.
This could be where the two companies see eye to eye. Mayer has repeatedly said that Yahoo is a "digital content company at its core" and has worked to bolster its content offerings. The company has commissioned two television-length comedy series that will air exclusively on Yahoo's mobile apps and website. Last fall, Mayer hired Katie Couric, the seasoned journalist who has been the anchor of news programs for NBC, CBS and ABC, to be Yahoo's global news anchor.
Couric recently attended a small private party thrown by Snapchat's founders during Advertising Week, an annual media industry event held in New York, according to a person familiar with the guest list.
Representatives for Yahoo and Snapchat declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment on the fundraising talks, which were reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal.

Cardback: App that helps you decide which card to useWe now have an app that can do this for us. It’s called Cardback, a predictive Android app that alerts users about which of their credit, debit or loyalty cards will give them the best deal
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
By Jyoti Pande Lavakare
Some weeks ago, I overheard two of my girlfriends discussing the merits and challenges of credit card points. One of them had recently been able to buy a return ticket from Delhi to Doha on one of her privilege credit cards without paying a single rupee. "How did you manage that?
I've been using my card for everything, including payment of all bills for utilities, but I won't even be able to get a ticket from Delhi to Faridabad anytime soon," my other friend complained, as they tried to compare payments, spending and other deals on the multiple credit, debit and loyalty cards they owned between the two of them.
Play the Cards Right
For those of us who aren't savvy enough to unlock the hidden value our cards hold — like free lounge access, upgrades to business class, access to emerald golf courses, free iPods — we now have an app that can do this for us. It's called Cardback, a predictive Android app that alerts users about which of their credit, debit or loyalty cards will give them the best deal, the maximum bang for the buck for a specific payment, based on their card options and current location. The app, a location-aware mobile platform that helps people save money and spend wisely, has been downloaded 30,000 times. And this when it is available only in the Android version. "Our iOS and Windows versions, upgraded with improved functionalities, will be available for download before Diwali," says Nikhil Wason, co-founder of Orangut Labs, whose flagship product is Cardback. His company currently has six employees, including the other cofounder Nidhi Gurnani.
Most people who use cards to pay for goods and services carry multiple credit, debit, prepaid and loyalty cards but rarely use them "smartly". So, they end up spending more than they should have or lose out on earning money in the form of cashback, reward points, interest rates or other deals, says Wason. "Cardback helps people decide on which card to use before making a payment so that they get the maximum benefit out of a transaction."
Here's how it works: the user has to enter basic card details, like name of the issuing bank, type of card. The app then fetches the best deals available on cards at standard outlet chains located close by. But here's the best part: The app doesn't take any card numbers or sensitive information, and doesn't enable any money flow through its system, which makes it very secure.
Cardback is currently supported in Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore — urban centres with maximum card penetration — but the team plans to launch in Hyderabad, Chennai and Pune in the next quarter, following which it will expand to Chandigarh, Ahmedabad and Kolkata.
The developers have added a comparative dimension to the app. "If you let the app know how much you need to pay and where, it will take less than five seconds to let you know which of your existing cards you should use to complete that transaction. It is like giving Google maps your start and end-point destination and the app finding you the best route," says Wason. Cardback can also help users optimize their credit cycle, so that their interest payout is minimized.

Anand Mahindra
(Mahindra says his central…)
Nestled among South Mumbai's elite residences on Warden Road beside Breach Candy Hospital is probably the best children's park of the city. It has a nature trail with life-size animal replicas, age-appropriate play zones and a lovely view of the Arabian Sea.
The park opened in 2009 and the development, of what was a construction dumpyard earlier, was sponsored by Mahindra & Mahindra's (M&M's) then vice-chairman (now chairman) Anand Mahindra. He named the park after his late father Harish, who passed away in 1999. Naming a children's play zone after him is probably apt, as the senior Mahindra was deeply committed to education.
Not just Harish Mahindra, the entire Mahindra group has worked on education on the side, while making jeeps, cars, steel components and holiday homes over the years. In Mumbai itself, the group supports 28 English-medium public schools.
Anand Mahindra recollects that in the early '80s, his father had initiated talks with Britain's Prince Charles to bring a campus of the United World College (UWC) to India (the UWC movement to bring together students from different parts of the world started in 1962 and Prince Charles is one of the past presidents.
The UWC has 14 campuses today). The first UWC campus was set up in Wales and in the '80s Harish Mahindra headed the Indian committee that selected students from India for UWC. In 1992, Harish put Bharat Doshi, who has been with the group for four decades, in charge of the project after the Central government approved it.
"The UWC was the first major initiative. It took us Rs 32 crore to set up the Mahindra United World College in Pune, which started in 1997," says Doshi. That was barely two years before Harish Mahindra's death.
A Scattergun Approach
Even earlier, from back in the 60s, the Mahindras have been funding education as philanthropy through the KC Mahindra Education Trust, named after one of the founders.
But it was Anand Mahindra, who became managing director of flagship M&M in 1997, who brought in focus. As he went on to become vice-chairman in 2003 and ultimately took over as group chairman replacing uncle Keshub last year, Anand also inherited a very haphazard philanthropic legacy.
  "It was a scattergun approach. If you looked at our philanthropy footprint when I joined M&M in 1991, it was even wider than now," Mahindra told ET Magazine in an interview. His first goal was to focus the group's philanthropy on education and then pick up a few themes within that.
In education, the Mahindra footprint stretches from schools in India to the best among foreign universities. The Mahindras fund school-going girls through a programme called Nanhi Kali. They also provide scholarships, run schools and skill development centres.
At the higher end, Anand Mahindra personally funded the Mahindra Humanities Centre in Harvard University in 2010. "You will find significant narrowing towards education. And within that the biggest theme is providing education for the girl child; the other is providing scholarships to people seeking education," Mahindra adds.
The UWC movement does not have more than one school or college per country, although it may have a second campus in some, so another UWC in India is ruled out. However, India head of UWC Pelham Lindfield Roberts says: "Through the UWC in Pune we can reach out across India and we select our students from across the country."
Liberalising Education
Mahindra himself, like his father, went to Harvard University. Yet, he confesses, at some level he feels "deprived" — perhaps because he had to abandon filmmaking to steer the family business. "After I finished school I went to JJ College of Architecture and then to Harvard. I did my BA with a major in filmmaking," Mahindra says. After his BA, he went on to do an MBA "...to atone for my sins", adds Mahindra with a smirk.
"In India we are forced to choose our specialisation very early, whereas in some other countries this can be done much later in life," Mahindra says, adding that bringing the liberal approach to Indian education is his motto right now. "While the British have abandoned this approach, we in India seem to be struggling with the old British system of education," says Mahindra.
The Mahindra United World College in Pune offers such liberties in their curriculum. Half of the students are Indian and the other half come from across the world. Indian students applying to the UWC for their IB course (typically the plus-two in India) can be placed either in India or any of the other 13 campuses of UWC.
To strengthen it further, Mahindra has just announced a new set of scholarships in partnership with Shelby Davis, founder of investment management firm Davis Selected Advisers and a long-time partner of UWC. Mahindra and Davis will be giving around `3 crore every year towards scholarships. The Mahindra part of the scholarships will be available to Indian students as well as foreign students who study in UWC India.

Spiritual e-tailers like OnlinePrasad chant profit mantra this festive seasonSpiritual e-tailers like OnlinePrasad chant profit mantra this festive season
Anshul Dhamija, TNN Oct 5, 2014, 08.32AM IST
(During the just concluded Dasara celebrations,…)
BANGALORE: The past 45 days, beginning from Janmashtami, have seen brisk online sales of spiritual products. Spurred by the ongoing festive season, there is hectic shopping online. And purchase of items such as idols, yantras (a mystical diagram that brings good luck) and prayer accessories are the highest ever.
Sales of prasad (a religious offering from temples) online is at a frenzied peak, with Bangalore-based niche e-tailer OnlinePrasad set to triple its revenues by the end of Diwali as compared to its mid-August figures.
Shopclues, an online marketplace of 25,000 merchants, is currently selling around 400 yantras a day — the most popular one being the Mahalakshmi yantra, which is supposed to bring wealth and happiness.
Radhika Ghai Aggarwal, co-founder and CMO of shopclues.com, claims the startup's spiritual and religion category is at present clocking a 700% sales growth over last year.
OnlinePrasad, which is networked with 50 temples across the country, has seen the average ticket spend for prasad double to Rs 2,000, led by a consumer group above the age of 35.
"Consumers are opting for combo offers (with a minimum of three prasad offerings), which is four times the ticket value of a single prasad order," says Goonjan Mall, CEO and founder of onlineprasad.com.
During the just concluded Dasara celebrations, a majority of prasad orders were from the temples of Vaishno Devi, Shirdi Sai Baba and the Mahalakshmi temples in Kolhapur and Mumbai.
The whole effect of tripling of revenues, says Mall, is also because of incremental growth in new customers who are shopping online this festive season.
NCR-based furniture and home decor e-tailer FabFurnish has actually seen a quantifiable 3% to 4% increase in new customers, purely driven by its religion and spirituality category, which went live a month ago.
"Last year we were caught unawares by the demand for products related to spirituality, which is why we took a conscious decision to establish a dedicated category this year. The results have been good, with average per person spend in the category having doubled to around Rs 1,800," says Vikram Chopra, founder and CEO, fabfurnish.com. The top selling products include idols and prayer accessories like puja thalis.
Besides buying spiritual products for one's house, Chopra sees a trend where consumers are shopping for the same products for gifting purposes.
And the spiritual trend seems to cut across the e-commerce spectrum, with lifestyle e-tailer Fashionandyou reporting a 50% spike in sales of spiritual products, which is part of its home and living category.
While the months leading up to Diwali typically see a spike in demand for spiritual products, e-tailers say there is enough scope for the category to sustain the growth momentum throughout the year.
"India is a country of festivals. There are at least two to three festivals per month," says 26-year-old Mall of OnlinePrasad, who estimates the spiritual category to be around $4 billion in size. Chopra of FabFurnish adds that the purchase of Ganesha and Buddha related spiritual products happens all through the year.

Google chairman Eric Schmidt says Steve Jobs is my heroGoogle chairman Eric Schmidt says Steve Jobs is my hero
By Business Insider | 5 Oct, 2014, 10.29AM IST
Despite  rivalries, especially over patents, Schmidt held deep admiration for Jobs. In 2008, Schmidt called him "the best CEO in the world today."
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
Google chairman Eric Schmidt isn't afraid of being critical of Apple — last week, he even told Bloomberg competition between the two tech giants is as "brutal" as ever — but when asked about his heroes on Thursday night, he gave a simple answer: "For me, it's easy. Steve Jobs ."
"We could all aspire to be a small percentage of Steve," Schmidt told a packed room at the Commonwealth Club of Silicon Valley , according to CNET. He was there to promote his new book he wrote with Google's products VP Jonathan Rosenberg , "How Google Works."
Schmidt and Jobs first met each other in 1993; Jobs had already been canned by his former company and was working at NeXT, while Schmidt was at Sun Microsystems , where he started as the company's first software manager and eventually climbed the latter to become director of software engineering and president of Sun Technology Enterprises, among other titles.
The two met when Jobs invited a few members of Sun's team, including Schmidt, to learn about the new computer language that served as the foundation for the latest NeXT computer, called Objective-C.
Schmidt questioned some of the technical aspects of Jobs's presentation, but he was absolutely smitten with his persuasiveness. And as Schmidt and his team tried dissecting Jobs' new technologies in the parking lot of NeXT, Jobs noticed the group still chatting and ran out to continue the conversation — for another full hour, according to Schmidt's new book.
Schmidt and Jobs became friends over the years. And in 2006, Jobs invited Schmidt to join Apple's board.
Google was a big part of Apple's first iPhone event in 2007, since Google search and Maps would be a major part of the early iOS ecosystem — Schmidt even appeared on stage to introduce those products and talk up the iPhone. But when Google finally announced Android later that same year, the rivalry between Google and Apple began heating up.
Jobs felt betrayed; in August, months prior to Android's unveiling, Jobs got wind of Google's open source competitor to iOS, and reportedly "railed" at him, "furious about his smartphone plans and duplicity," according to Gawker.
Jobs later told his biographer Walter Isaacson that "I'm going to destroy Android, because it's a stolen product. I'm willing to go thermonuclear war on this."
Schmidt ultimately stepped down from Apple's board in August 2009.
But still, despite the rivalries in mobile and in the courtroom, especially over patents, Schmidt held deep admiration for Jobs and his "reality distortion field." In 2008, Schmidt called Jobs "the best CEO in the world today."
"Exceptional people are worth hanging out with," Schmidt said Thursday. "Because there is a good chance they are going to change the world."

West Bengal under Mamata a Jihadi safe haven for Jihadis: BJPPrint
Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: October 5, 2014 4:37 pm | Updated: October 5, 2014 5:34 pm
The BJP Sunday accused the Mamata Banerjee government in West Bengal of turning the state into a safe haven for anti-national and Jihadi activities.
Citing the October 2 blast in Burdwan in West Bengal and alleged recovery of IEDs, mobile devices and Jihadi literature from the house of a TMC worker, the party charged the state government with destroying the evidence and not handing it over to the National Investigation Agency (NIA) for probe.
BJP Secretary Siddharth Nath Singh alleged that the Burdwan police instead of handing over to the NIA the materials recovered, took away the entire evidence and destroyed it.
“Why was the NIA informed almost a day late?” he asked.
Posing questions to Banerjee, he sought clarifications on whether or not the house from where the recoveries were made belonged to a TMC cadre.
“Did it not have a TMC office on the ground floor?” he asked.
Attacking Banerjee, the BJP leader charged her with protecting those who stood accused of laundering money.
“We can safely conclude that West Bengal under Mamata Banerjee’s rule has become a safe haven for anti-national elements and Jihadi activities,” Singh said.
Two suspected militants were killed and another was injured in the explosion in the house where they were living on October 2 in Burdwan town. The CID of West Bengal police is looking into possible involvement of terror outfits like LeT and HuJI in the incident.

Massive landslide blocks Guwahati-Shillong highwayPrint
Written by Samudra Gupta Kashyap | Guwahati | Posted: October 5, 2014 9:43 pm
A massive landslide that occurred today evening at Umling, about 43 kms from Guwahati on National Highway 40 that connects the Assam capital with Shillong, has brought traffic to a standstill, leaving hundreds of vehicles stranded on both sides for several kilometres.
Ri Bhoi district deputy SP (Traffic) Rymphang Pde said the landslide occurred at around 5:45 PM today, with passengers of several vehicles including a couple of small cars having a providential escape from the jaws of death. “It will hopefully take another three to four hours to clear the debris,” the dy SP said, indicating it will be not before midnight that the road would be cleared.
Hafl-a-dozen bulldozers have been pressed into service to clear the landslide on NH40, which is not only the only link between the capital cities of Assam and Meghalaya located 100 kms apart, but also vial lifeline for Tripura, Mizoram and the Barak Valley of southern Assam.
With earth-cutting taking place in a big way owing to widening of the original highway into a four-lane road in the last few years, the Guwahati-Shillong Road, as it is known, has experienced several smaller landslides in the past two weeks. Landslides had killed at least 18 people in Meghalaya in the past fortnight, eight of them including a pregnant woman in the heart of Shillong.

Locally produced gas likely to cost 60 cents moreLocally produced gas likely to cost 60 cents more

Price to be set on gross heat value basis
New Delhi, October 5:  
The new price for domestically-produced gas is likely to be based on the gross heat value, which will automatically raise the rate by about 10 per cent or 60 cents.
The thinking in the Government has been to keep the base price of gas between $6 and $6.5 per million British thermal units. If it is based on the gross calorific value (GCV), the prices would go up automatically by 10 per cent, which would be advantageous for the producers. The heat produced from natural gas is measured in calorific value.
“This is part of the proposals before us. The Government wants to ensure that the final pricing mechanism is fair to all — the buyers and the sellers — while not affecting the Government’s share of profit,” an official privy to the development told BusinessLine.
Since liquefied natural gas (LNG) is imported on GCV basis, sellers prefer this benchmark, industry sources said. The issue cropped up when the Reliance Industries-BP-Niko combine based its proposed price, applicable from April 1, on GCV. But this was not acceptable to the buyers, as it would mean gas costing more.
Clarity sought
Domestic gas producers, under the aegis of the Association of Oil & Gas Operators, want the Government to be clear on the method of price calculation — whether it will be on the basis of gross or net calorific value (NCV), and if it should be rupee denominated.
Another official said the Government is working on two issues simultaneously — price for domestically-produced gas and pool pricing (mix of indigenous and imported gas) for power and fertiliser sectors. It will also need to clarify how the gas produced from fields given to contractors before the licensing rounds, like that of Cairn India’s Rajasthan block, will be priced. At present, the contracts for such fields allow market price to the producers.
Opinions have also been divided on whether domestic gas rates should be linked to the crude oil price. But with no other immediate benchmark available, linking it to crude oil was the best option before the policy-makers, an industry person said.
Currently, the base price of gas sold under administered price regime is $4.2/mmBtu, same as the rate for the Reliance Industries Ltd-operated NELP block in the East Coast.
Domestic gas is also being sold at a base price of $5.7/mmBtu. The August average rate of imported gas on long-term basis is about $15/mmBtu, while the spot rate is $16/mmBtu.
“We are ready with views and proposals on gas pricing whenever the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs wants to take up the issue. By then we also hope that some clarity on RIL’s gas price will be available,” a senior Petroleum Ministry official said.
For the second time, on September 24, the Modi Government shied away from taking a decision on the new price of domestically produced natural gas. The decision has been deferred to November 15.

Cairn expects to double Rajasthan gas output from Jan
Richa Mishra
Tweet
New Delhi, October 5:  
Cairn India has approached the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas for higher allocation of gas from its Rajasthan fields as it gears up to almost double its output to 0.42 mmscmd (million standard cubic metre a day).
The Rajasthan joint venture of Cairn India and ONGC has requested the Ministry for increasing the allocation to 0.42 mmscmd on firm basis and up to 0.6 mmscmd on fallback basis. The venture commenced sales from the RJ-ON-90/1 Block in April 2013. Currently, gas is being sold to one customer (Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertilizers & Chemicals Ltd) as allocated by the Government at close to $8 mmBtu. Cairn India’s Rajasthan oil block is now focussing on gas prospecting. The company in its annual results had informed the market that development of Raageshwari Deep Gas field is underway.

We need to rethink our 21st century idea of Indiaprint
Many American commentators who have written about Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the US have noted how each of his public appearances was greeted with rapturous support from people of Indian origin who now live in the States.
In many ways, this phalanx of NRI supporters was Modi’s secret weapon. He came across not as an outsider visiting America but as a man who already commanded a considerable measure of powerful support within the US. And because NRIs are among the richest and best-educated ethnic groups in the US, their influence could not be easily ignored by American politicians.
In India however, the reaction to Modi’s Indian-American supporters was more ambivalent. You only had to look at social media during the PM’s visit to see how sneering some of the responses of resident Indians could be. When NRIs sang “Sare Jahan Se Achha Hindustan”, one cynic tweeted, “Then, come back, na!”
When they screened a short film before Modi’s Madison Square Garden speech about the sacrifices made by Indian-Americans, many resident Indians were annoyed by the notion that these ‘sacrifices’ basically consisted of how they scraped together enough money to get out of India.
Nor was this indignation restricted to trolls or Modi baiters. Sociologist and TV don Dipankar Gupta tweeted: “Very cute; Migrated willingly to USA, won’t  come back & yet chiming “I love my India.” Is their India Real or Imagined? Ancient or Modern?” That one tweet was retweeted an astonishing 1,200 times because it so perfectly captured the mood of many indignant resident Indians.
India’s relationship with its diaspora has always been complex. We are proud of the prominence of large Indian-origin communities in Mauritius, South Africa, Fiji, the West Indies and East Africa. But few members of those communities hold Indian passports or claim any connection to India other than cultural (which usually means Bollywood). When Idi Amin expelled thousands of Indians from Uganda in the early 1970s only a small number opted to come to India. Most went first to the UK, and then on to North America and other places.
We are more willing to regard Indians who live in West Asia as full-fledged Indians. We believe that they are migrant workers or professionals who do not identify (or are not allowed to identify) with the countries they live in. Most intend to return to India someday and in the meantime, their remittances back home add to our foreign exchange reserves.
The only area where ambiguity exists is in our attitude to Indians (or people of Indian origin) who live in Western Europe and the US. Many of them have surrendered their  Indian passports (which is why Modi told a cheering New York crowd that he would give them long-term visas), want their children to settle in their adopted countries and do not necessarily dream of returning to India.
India came to terms with this phenomenon only in the 1980s (when the term “NRI’’ came into vogue) because ethnic Indians in the US and UK began growing in affluence and influence. Since then, NRIs have become a part of our cultural and economic landscape. The government launched schemes to encourage NRIs to invest in India and Bollywood discovered that it had a natural audience across the oceans. Thirty years before Modi got there, Amitabh Bachchan had already packed out Madison Square Garden with his NRI fans and there is a whole sub-genre of Hindi cinema dedicated to the NRI market.
We now think of political NRIs as BJP-supporters. But in the 1980s, it was overseas branches of the Congress that welcomed Rajiv Gandhi to the US. And successive  governments of all parties have used NRIs to lobby for India. For instance, it was NRI tycoons who persuaded Tony Blair to meet AB Vajpayee’s principal secretary Brajesh Mishra to break the chill that followed India’s  nuclear tests. And American NRIs routinely lobby senators and Congressmen on India’s behalf.
So, why the sudden ambivalence and hostility? Well, it is not new. Whenever NRIs are seen as a threat, they begin to be perceived more cynically. In 1983 when Swraj Paul tried to take over Escorts and DCM, Indian industry banded together to defeat him. Later that decade, when the likes of Manu Chhabria used the NRI scheme to gain control of such large companies as Shaw Wallace, they were treated as criminals.
One reason why NRIs are being seen as a threat again is because so many of them have become active (and frequently, abusive) on social media, usually in support of the Sangh parivar and often against India’s  minorities. Many resident Indians are annoyed enough to ask, as Dipankar Gupta did on Twitter, how US citizens can have any stake in the future of India. Do they even understand today’s India? Or are they fantasising  about some imaginary ancient India? And besides, if they care so much about this country, then why don’t they just come back home?
These are not unreasonable questions. And the short answer has to be that yes, many NRIs demand the luxury of broadcasting reactionary views from the safety of their New Jersey homes.
But there is also an important counter question to be asked: why not? If we want them to watch our movies and support our interests abroad, then can we really complain when they use new media to air views that some of us may find primitive and ugly?
The answer, I suspect, is that we need to rethink our idea of India. As the diaspora spreads and grows in influence, it will become a more important contributor to Indian political discourse (and abuse). Technology knows no borders. And as social media helps the voices of the diaspora to be heard louder and louder here, we’ll just have to accept that the 21st century avatar of the idea of India also knows no territorial boundaries.

RBI eases rules for opening bank accountsDipak Mondal      Follow @dipdown80    Edition: October 2014
The Reserve Bank of India, it seems, has finally lent ear to millions of such prospective account holders.(Photo: Reuters)
Most of us have faced a problem in opening a bank account in the absence of valid know-your-customer, or KYC, documents, and wished for a simpler documentation process.
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), it seems, has finally lent ear to millions of such prospective account holders. It has simplified the KYC documentation to make account opening less onerous.
SINGLE DOCUMENT FOR PROOF OF IDENTITY AND ADDRESS
Earlier, as part of the KYC process, one had to submit separate proofs for address and identity. The RBI has done away with this. Now, a single document with photograph and address of the applicant will suffice. Among the documents approved for KYC include passport, driving licence, voter ID card, PAN card, Aadhaar and job card.
NO SEPARATE PROOF FOR CURRENT ADDRESS
If you were new to a place and did not have a valid address proof, opening a bank account was nearly impossible. This problem has been taken care of. Now, customers have to furnish only one address proof (current or permanent) for opening a bank account. All that he is required to do is to make a simple declaration about his/her current address.
'SMALL ACCOUNTS' FOR THOSE WITH NO KYC DOCUMENT
This is probably the best piece of news for students who live away from home and migrant workers. They can now open a 'small account' instead of a full-service account.
A small account can be opened by self-attesting a photograph and giving thumb impression on the application in the presence of a bank employee. Small accounts, as the name suggests, will have restrictions in terms of loan (a maximum of Rs 1 lakh a year), withdrawals (not more than Rs 10,000 a month) and maximum balance (Rs 50,000 at any point of time).
These accounts will be operational only for a year. However, if the account holder provides proof that he/she has applied for a valid KYC document , the account can be extended for another 12 months.
RELAXATION FOR LOW-RISK CUSTOMERS
A person without valid KYC documents but categorised as 'low-risk' can open an account by submitting any of the following-identity card with applicant's photograph issued by a central/state government department, statutory/regulatory authority, public sector undertaking, scheduled commercial bank or public financial institution; or, a letter issued by a gazetted officer with an attested photograph.
Further, if low-risk customers are not able to submit the KYC documents due to genuine reasons, they can do so within six months from the date of opening the account.

My daughters far more intelligent than me  says MaheshBhattMahesh Bhatt has three daughters - Alia, Shaleen and Pooja.
Indo-Asian News Service | Mumbai | Posted: October 6, 2014 11:45 am
Mahesh Bhatt has been one of the best filmmakers of his time and inspired generations with his movie-making skills, but the director, who now produces films with new talent, says his three daughters – Pooja, Shaheen and Alia – are far more intelligent and practical than him.
“I have got three daughters and all three of them make me very proud. I have no problem in telling them that they are far more intelligent than I am and I also take instructions from them,” Bhatt told IANS.
The filmmaker, known for crafting meaningful cinemas such as “Arth”, “Saraansh”, “Naam”, “Kaash” and “Daddy”, has daughter Pooja with his first wife Kiran Bhatt (original name Lorraine Bright). Later he married actress Soni Razdan and they have two daughters – Shaheen and Alia – together.
Sharing his joy of being a proud father of three successful girl children, he says that all of them have achieved something in their lives and that too without any help.
“Pooja is an example of how a girl child can sparkle and be completely self sufficient. Shaheen is a brilliant writer and unique child,” he said.
“Alia is a star and she has added to my ageing stardom. I have been a star and man of public figure of a kind, but India is a young country and most of the Indians, who consume entertainment products, are under 25. Alia is undoubtedly one of the tallest icon in that space,” added Bhatt who also has son Rahul.
If he is a proud father, he is a doting dad too.
“We belong to that strata of the society where attack from unknown people won’t happen. But yes, my eldest daughter Pooja had a relationship with a person who under the influence of alcohol did abuse her and that became a very painful chapter of our family.
“So, if a strong self-sufficient woman like her can be subjected to domestic violence, then it makes me shiver when I visualise about all those vulnerable girls who do not have the economic clout or do not have the shield of stardom,” he said.
Having contributed to Bollywood for around four decades, the moviemaker co-owns Vishesh Films with his brother Mukesh and they have together churned out bold and successful films like “Murder”, “Jism” and “Raaz”.
These films raised eyebrows for their sensual portrayal of women.
Tell him that films objectify women; Bhatt dismisses it saying that “objectification of women is also there in our culture and patriarchal mindset governs our society”.
“Women are born slaves to a traditions, which compels them to be submissive, weak, docile, put up with the injustice and sufferings to achieve great virtue.
“To say that all the movies are responsible for the objectification of women is an exaggeration. I feel that women have the right to dress up in a particular way and if you call it objectification then continued…

NCP leader R R Patil is contesting from Tasgaon and faces a stiff challenge with the BJP training its eyes on the constituency; Prime Minister Narendra Modi has held an election rally there for party nominee Ajit Ghorpade.
BJP has got PM Narendra Modi to campaign in Tasgaon assembly seat. Do you think it will have any impact?
I have been working for development in Tasgaon for the last 25 years. I don’t think these rallies will amount to anything. The BJP will not succeed even if Modi holds 288 election rallies in the state… The voters have stood by me whenever I have faced trouble during elections. I don’t come from a family of political leaders. The common people brought me into politics. This time too they will see me through, with a higher margin than before.
Who is the NCP’s main political rival in the multi-cornered contest? Are you wary of the BJP?
The BJP has done well in the Lok Sabha elections and is the main rival.The NCP will be the only party that will stop the BJP from coming to power in the state. The Shiv Sena is strong only in specific belts but that too has reduced after its split with the BJP, and the MNS is not as strong as it used to be. The Congress chose to go it alone and will find out its strength in the election results. As of now, the contest is between the NCP and the BJP.
The RSS has supported Narendra Modi over the opposition’s criticism that he has failed to fulfill promises in first 100 days of government. The RSS chief said Modi does not have a magic wand. How do you see that?
If they knew that they wouldn’t be able to fulfil promises immediately, why were people given those false assurances? Everyone knows that the government does not have a magic wand. The BJP has been associating its work with the principles of Mahatma Gandhi.
Everyone has the right to associate oneself with Mahatma Gandhi but I dare the Prime Minister to condemn Nathuram Godse from the RSS platform before associating itself with Gandhi’s values.
You were the home minister but Congress is taking credit for a safe Maharashtra in its election advertisements. Has the NCP failed to market your achievements?
That the former chief minister is talking about achievements of the home department in the Congress’s election advertisement gives me pleasure. Congress leaders headed various departments in the state government but it says a lot that it was the achievements of the home department that found first place in the advertisements. The NCP has been falling short of funds for marketing. We don’t know where the Congress is getting so much money from. Business houses have been funding continued…

Plan your itineraries well in advance for best deals: ExpertsAgent
(These days your best fare…)
MUMBAI: Avid travellers are in a foul mood. Many of them complain that it is no longer possible to get "the cheapest" air ticket. It really doesn't matter when you book; it all boils down to your luck, they say. The old theory of getting the best rate if a ticket is booked well in advance doesn't hold true anymore, most of them swear. These days your best fare remains the best only till you run into a fellow traveller at the airport, who managed to get tickets much cheaper, despite booking much later.
However, travel experts dismiss this claim. They say that booking well in advance is still the best option available to individuals. This is what a typical traveller had to say about her experience trying to book tickets this year for Diwali holidays: "When I first checked the tickets two months ago, they were really cheap.
By the time I sat down to make the reservation the next day, the prices were exorbitant. I waited for two weeks, and booked my tickets at what I thought were an okay rate, only to find out two days later that tickets were available much cheaper suddenly. When it happens to you once, it is called an accident. But, when it happens often, you are either accident prone or you are wasting too much time looking for a ticket at best price."
Rajesh Rateria , managing director, Cirrus Travels , says that travellers don't have an option, but to plan their travels and book much in advance, especially, if their travel dates coincide with a long weekend or any traditional festivals. "The airlines anticipate great demand on such occasions and chances of you getting a cheap ticket are almost nil," he says. "Airlines would stop selling low-bucket fares and shift to selling high-bucket fares as the date nears closer. This might happen even if there are low fare vacant seats. So, it won't be a great idea to wait till the last moment," adds Rateria.
Pradip Lulla , managing director, Cupid Travels, says that dynamic pricing almost rules out a cheaper fare at the last moment. "The airlines would add the discount it has already given to advance bookers into the last minute fares. If they don't do it, they will suffer losses," says Lulla, who is also the national general secretary of Travel Agent Federation of India . Mystery of Low Fares If the old rule still works, how is it that some of your fellow travellers always manage to get better fares?
Travel experts say that the mystery could be explained with the so-called promotional offers airlines come out every now and then. Remember, the Rs 1 fares offered by various airlines just a few months ago? Or the introductory fares offered by the new entrant AirAsia? Well, seasoned travel agents say that due to these fares, some people might have landed cheaper rates, but they warn against waiting for such fares. "It is true that such offers keep coming every now than then. But, it is not necessary that the fares would be available for the dates you are planning to travel. Even if the dates match, it is not necessary that you would get the tickets, as only some limited seats are available on such offers," says Lulla. Experts say that individuals should be doubly sure of the dates before they make reservations as most of these offers are non-refundable.
In fact, several people tend to cancel their tour when they plan a journey on the basis of great fare offer from an airline. "If you have to cancel the tickets for some reason, you would lose the entire money. Airlines don't usually entertain requests for refunds," says Lulla. According to experts, this is why travellers should focus more on their travel plans than such discount offers. Rateria still advises his clients to plan their itinerary carefully and book well in advance to rule out any unpleasant surprises, as a holiday is more than just airfare.

India attractive despite fears over Fed rate hike: PreussnerChristian Preussner
(Our expectations are certainly…)
The Federal Reserve is more likely to increate interest rates in the second half of 2015, said Christian Preussner, executive director and head of international client portfolio management at JPMorgan Asset Management. In an interview with Biswajit Baruah, Preussner spoke about the impact of the US rate hike on India and slowing foreign portfolio flows among other matters. Edited excerpts:
We have seen bouts of volatility in emerging markets, including India, in the recent past as investors are getting increasingly worried about US interest rate hike. What are your expectations?
Our expectations are certainly a bit more conservative. Hence, our forecast is that rate hikes in the US will probably happen in the second half of next year. Then there will be more gradual increase in short-term interest rates there. The reason for saying this is that the inflation rate is still quite low at around 1.9-2%, and from that perspective, the Fed is not overly pressured in taking immediate action. At the same time, the Federal Reserve Bank wants to see a broader continuation of the unemployment rate going down. We would be seeing around 100-basis point rate hike by the end of 2015, and then gradual continuation of hikes into 2016.
How do you see emerging markets like India getting impacted from the Fed rate hike?
If the US is increasing rates, then from net investment perspective, it's more attractive to invest in the US markets. We expect the US GDP growth to be anywhere between 2.5% and 3%. It's definitely an environment where we see high single-digit to low double-digit total returns from US equities going forward. I don't think we are currently getting positive in emerging markets at this point in time. The Indian market has been doing already quite well and still continues to see upside potential.
Foreign portfolio inflows have hit a 7-month low in the last two months. Is this a cause for serious concern for Indian stocks?
The funds coming to India are essentially regional funds and within that India's weightage is 6%, and people are allocating 9-10% weightage to India and that's where most of the flows have to come to India. At this point of time, what is happening is incrementally people are not supporting country-dedicated funds, and within that India-dedicated funds. They are putting more in emerging markets as a theme and so India being overweight is getting the money flow from those types of funds. India is not getting pure India-dedicated money at this point of time. That's where you will see some aberration. But, if you look at the appetite for FIIs to invest, they are waiting for the issuances to come in, and then the flows will automatically happen. I would see it more as an aberration, rather than a worry.
In your global stocks portfolio, how is India positioned?
India is certainly coming out to be 'Overweight' among all the markets. If you look at asset classes which essentially tend to do well during rising US interest rates, it is the higher dividend emerging market equities then pure emerging market equities. If you see India, China, or the Asean region, they all tend to benefit when growth stabilises in the developed markets. The ECB has given a big boost to liquidity by pushing rates to near zero. The US is showing strong strength on the growth side. Japan has been reasonably steady. All this augers well for the emerging market equities because the rise in US interest rates is essentially a response to the growth, and it's not negative. It's essentially in response to the growth being normalised, so you don't require that excess easy monitoring conditions any more.
What kind of returns do you expect from Indian stocks, going forward?
We are talking about the next four years' earnings growth of around 22%. That's a substantial jump from the current 12% or 13%. So, if that is true, we are talking about doubling of markets over the next four years because markets are ultimately a slave of earnings growth. In the interim, there will be news flows, which could keep on impacting the markets, but we are not looking at anything in the short term. We are very confident that the economy is looking to reverse from here and continuously advocating for looking at the markets from three to five-year perspective, because the government itself is now talking about 5-year and 10-year objectives.
 
Which are the sectors you are bullish on?
The sectors we are pondering over are cyclicals; the good companies which are in a position to construct good roads at reasonable cost are going to benefit from the new government policies. Cement is something of a very clean sector which will be a direct beneficiary of the infrastructure development. In the auto segment, the four-wheeler segment is seeing revival, so that is something we are positive on. Within financials, we are concentrating on the private banking side. So these are the things we are positive on.
Pharma and technology stocks have staged a strong comeback in the September quarter. Would you like to advise investors to accumulate these ?
Pharma and IT stocks' valuations are stressed; we are more 'Neutral' on them and have cut our exposure.

Where was your respect for Balasaheb when you split with us: Shiv Sena asks ModiSena questions Modi's respect for Bal Thackeray
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  Mumbai, October 06, 2014

A day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi refused to criticise the Shiv Sena out of respect for the late Bal Thackeray, the former saffron ally hit back saying he should have remembered it when the BJP broke off the alliance.
An editorial in the Sena mouthpiece Saamna on Monday said, " Modi said he won't say a word against Sena as a tribute to Bal Thackeray. We appreciate that. But what happened to that  respect while you were breaking off the alliance?
If the BJP had shown some understanding in seat sharing  and kept the alliance intact, that would have been a true tribute to Bal Thackeray, the editorial further said.
Read: Won't criticise Shiv Sena as tribute to Bal Thackeray: Modi
Modi had said on Sunday at a campaign rally in Maharashtra that he would not criticise former ally Shiv Sena out of respect for its late leader, Bal Thackeray.
"Political pundits are saying why is Modi not criticising Shiv Sena in his campaign speeches. This is the first election in absence of late Bal Thackeray, for whom I have great respect. I have decided not to utter a single word against Shiv Sena. This is my tribute to Balasaheb Thackeray," he had said.
The Sena editorial was also scathing on Modi's attempt to use Shivaji  Maharaj's name during his campaign.
"The new head of Delhi shouldn't forget that Shivaji Maharaj was the embodiment of Purusharth (manliness). Where will you get that from?", the Sena asked Modi.
Questioning Modi's statements on his love for Maharashtra, the Sena asked, "PM Modi came all the way from Delhi to say that Congress-NCP alliance looted Maharashtra. But what was Gujarat CM Anandiben's intention of coming to Mumbai. She said all Mumbai-based industrialists should shift to Gujarat. Isn't that a way of looting Maharashtra."
Referring to BJP's stand on the Vidarbha row, the Sena accused the party of trying to split Maharashtra.
Modi in all his campaign speeches in the state  had been trying to highlight the BJP's respect for Maharashtra and warrior king Chhattrapati Shivaji.
" It was the Vajpayee government which named Mumbai airport after Shivaji. You were CM , but you didn't think of it. Even Victoria Terminus was named Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus by Vajpayee government," Modi had said in an attack on the ruling Congress-NCP government.

Hong Kong protests thin  civil servants back at workHong Kong protests thin, civil servants back at work

Hong Kong's civil servants returned to work and schools were reopened Monday as a massive pro-democracy protest that has occupied much of the city center for the week dwindled.
Student demonstrators say they have taken early steps to begin talks with the government on their demands for wider political reforms, but actual negotiations have not started and many disagreements remain.

At the government headquarters, where some protesters agreed to remove barriers blocking roads Sunday ahead of the government's deadline to scale back their protests, the scene was orderly as government officials arrived for work as a few dozen remaining protesters looked on.
The crowds had thinned markedly after a week that saw tens of thousands of people fill the streets in peaceful protest. In Mong Kok, another protest site across the harbor where protesters had clashed violently with their opponents, a few hundred activists were staying put at the sit-in site.
Some activists disagree with the partial withdrawal at government headquarters, and an alliance of students say they will keep up their protests until details of the talks are worked out.
"If the government uses force to clear away protesters, there will be no room for dialogue," Lester Shum, one of the group's leaders, told reporters.
Alex Chow, another student leader, said he was not worried about the crowd dwindling.
"Because people need rest, but they will come out again. It doesn't mean the movement is diminishing. Many people still support it," Chow said.
Students occupying an area just outside city government headquarters agreed to remove some barricades that were blocking the building's entrance, after the government said it would do whatever was necessary to ensure 3,000 civil servants would have full access to their offices on Monday.
The partial withdrawal appeared to be part of a strategy to regroup in another part of town, as protesters were urged to shift from other areas to Hong Kong's Admiralty shopping and business district, a central location near the government's main offices that has served as an informal headquarters for the protests.
Protesters had feared that officials may clear the streets by force, but by Monday it's clear the government was settling for a partial victory in clearing some roads. The government indicated some disruptions were likely to continue.
"To restore order, we are determined, and we are confident we have the capability to take any necessary action," police spokesman Steve Hui said. "There should not be any unreasonable, unnecessary obstruction by any members of the public."
Television footage showed a man shaking hands with a police officer outside government headquarters and the two sides removing some barricades together.
About 300 demonstrators stood by outside the government building's main entrance, but then many sat back down and refused to leave.
"I'm against any kind of withdrawal or tendency to surrender," said Do Chan, a protester in his 30s. "I think withdrawing, I mean shaking hands with the police, is a very ugly gesture of surrender."
The situation remained volatile across the harbor in Hong Kong's Mong Kok district, a shopping area where ugly confrontations broke out Friday and Saturday after opponents of the protesters tried to force them out.
Many demonstrators heeded calls to head home or shift to the Admiralty area. A few hundred, however, remained.
"I don't know what the next step is, but I will not retreat. The people you see here will not retreat," said Burnett Tung, an 18-year-old student who has served as a volunteer at a food-supply station outside government headquarters all week.
Tens of thousands of people, many of them students, have poured into the streets of the semi-autonomous city since Sept. 28 to peacefully protest China's restrictions on the first-ever direct election for Hong Kong's leader, promised by Beijing for 2017.
The protests are the strongest challenge to authorities in Hong Kong - and in Beijing - since the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
China has promised that Hong Kong can have universal suffrage by 2017, but it says a committee of mostly pro-Beijing figures must screen candidates for the top job.
The protesters also are demanding the resignation of Hong Kong chief executive Leung Chun-ying, the city's current leader. He has refused to step down.
With the standoff stretching into a second week, tempers have flared and patience was waning among residents who oppose the occupation of the streets and the disruption it has brought.
Police said they had arrested 30 people since the start of the protests. Protesters, meanwhile, complained the police were failing to protect them from attacks by mobs intent on driving them away.

WIFW: A look at top designers upcomingcollectionsWritten by Jagmeeta Thind Joy , Somya Lakhani | Posted: October 6, 2014 12:09 pm
The fashion juggernaut is set to roll starting October 8 with the 24th edition of Wills Lifestyle India Fashion Week (WIFW). The Spring-Summer 2015 edition will see 55 runway shows by the country’s leading fashion designers, who are already hard at work giving finishing touches to their new seasonal line-up. Be it their travels to exotic locales or the world of art, designers have found inspiration brewing at home and in different parts of the globe. Here is a look at some collections that caught our attention:
Flower Power
Rohit Bal
The splendour of Mughal gardens of Kashmir will come alive in couturier Rohit Bal’s collection “Gulbagh”. A six-garment preview held in Delhi last week gave a glimpse of the range that will close WIFW this season. Peonies, lotuses, roses and chrysanthemums rule the garments (for both men and women) as the gardens come alive. Bal has used fabrics such as chanderi, mulmul, matka silk, voile, brocade and velvet; there’s also enough hand-blocked printing, gold leaf embossing and tilla hand embroidery. It’s always a delight to watch him do what he does best; and looks like this season will be no different.

Food for thought
Nida Mahmood
Old parsi eating joints that dot Mumbai have an inviting old world charm, one that reels you in and takes you to a different time zone. Delhi designer Nida Mahmood is attempting the same with her latest spring-summer line called “Good Luck Irani Café”. Quirky prints and old school silhouettes will take over the ramp; as will an elaborate set with all Parsi essentials in place. Mahmood reveals little except that it will be a nostalgic trip with obvious over-the-top elements that have become the designer’s hallmark now. It’s after several meals at Irani cafes across Mumbai that Mahmood has created a line that aims at portraying the many interesting people and stories she has encountered.

Art and Soul
Tarun Tahiliani
When Tarun Tahiliani first saw the works of the Singh Twins, contemporary artistes based in the UK, he says he went into a “hypnotic trance”. “It was a novel and intellectual take on patterns, layering and with such wit and finesse that I could not wait to put a collection of ready-to-wear easy pieces together,” Tahiliani says in his collection note. Using artworks by the sisters — Amrit and Rabindra — the designer has created prints on fabrics that will be presented in his signature style of drapes and cuts. The vibrancy of art is matched up with continued…

PM Modi clear about forging ties with neig...Australia
('Even before taking oath, Modi's priorities…)
WASHINGTON: External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj has said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has "very clear" priorities to forge good relations with neighbouring countries as part of his "fast track" diplomacy.
"Even before taking oath, Modi's priorities of good relations with all neighbours were very clear with all the SAARC heads being invited to the swearing-in ceremony," Swaraj said.
"His visits to Bhutan, Nepal, and Japan and now to US all have been judged as great success," she said.
Swaraj, who met leaders of 100 countries during the annual session of the UN General Assembly, said this was part of the "fast track" diplomacy of Prime Minister Modi.
During her address to the Indian diaspora at an event organised by the Overseas Friends of BJP (OFBJP)-USA in New Jersey last week, Swaraj said she faced challenges during Iraq crisis wherein Indian nurses were kidnapped by the Islamic State militants, said a media release.
Swaraj, who visited 11 countries in 100 days as part of the "fast-track" diplomacy, said the new government however was able to secure their release in less than 48 hours.
Swaraj promised to the members of the Sikh community present at the event that India will do everything possible to secure the release of Sikhs kidnapped in Iraq.
She narrated eloquently her experiences during her visits to Nepal, Japan, and other countries and explained the enthusiastic support from China and Australia in India's growth and development.
Swaraj is considered one of the prime movers of Modi government's much-praised "fast-track diplomacy".
She said the Modi government will take care of the Indian diaspora's needs and redress their complaints and concerns.
Vijay Jolly , Global convener of BJP Overseas Affairs, said OFBJP is actively engaged in working on the diaspora-related issues in the US.
During the programme, Swaraj inaugurated a book titled "The Idea of One Religion" with a foreword by Modi.
Additionally, Punjabi Commerce Chamber donated USD15,000 towards Prime Minister Relief Fund for J&K disaster relief.

Abhijeet Gupta in five-way lead at Poker MastersThe Hindu Abhijeet Gupta had to rely on his end-game skills to turn the tide in his favour when the game looked decidedly headed for a draw. File Photo

chess
Grandmaster Abhijeet Gupta fought hard to beat Israel’s Radoslaw Jedynak for his second successive victory in to be tied for a five-way lead in the Poker Masters Isle of Man International chess tournament now in progress at the Isle of Man.
On what turned out to be a tough day for the former world junior champion from India, Jedynak simply did not give up and tried hard to make it a tough game for Gupta. The Indian had to rely on his end-game skills to turn the tide in his favour when the game looked decidedly headed for a draw.
With two points from as many games, Gupta shares the lead with world number 13 Maxime Vachier Lagrave of France, Sergei Tiviakov of Holland, Daniel Gormally of England and Elisabeth Paehtz of Germany.
The other Indian in fray, D. Harika was held to a draw by Jonathan Bakalchuk of Israel leaving her tied sixth with seven rounds still remaining in the £18,000 prize money tournament.
After a first round lull, it was a tough day for the fancied players. At the top of the tables, world number 12 and highest rated English Michael Adams was held to a draw by Israeli Danny Raznikov while Popilski got the same result against Sargissian.
Paehtz registered one of the biggest upsets of the tournament so far defeating a wayward Gawain Jones of England and Daniel Gormally of England punished Peruvian Grandmaster Julio Granda Zuniga for some lacklustre play in the opening.
Gupta played the white side of a Queen pawn game and Jedynak gave little away in the opening or in the middle game.
The players reached a level endgame wherein Gupta continued to push and sacrificed a pawn just to gain some space.
It was still an impregnable position even as Gupta’s king took a long walk to the queen side and seeing no way out, Gupta parted with another pawn with his Bishops holding the fort together.
With just two pawns against four, the game should have been a draw but the Israeli lost his way right here and lost a piece. Gupta wrapped the issue in 67 moves.
Harika was up against a King’s Indian defence by Bakalchuk and enjoyed excellent advantage before letting it slip away. The game was drawn when the Indian could make no headway.
Important results round 2: Danny Raznikov (Isr, 1.5) drew with Michael Adams (Eng, 1.5); Maxime Vachier-Lagrave Fra, 2) beat James Tarjan (Usa, 1); Gabriel Sargissian (Arm, 1.5) drew with Gil Popilski (Isr, 1.5); Daniel Gormally (Eng, 2) beat Julio Granda Zuniga (Per, 1); Sergei Tiviakov (2) beat Bryan Smith (Usa, 1); Elisabeth Paehtz (Ger, 2) beat Gawain Jones (Eng, 1); David Howell (Eng, 1.5) drew with Simon Williams (Eng, 1.5); Jorden Van Foreest (Ned, 1.5) drew with Nigel Short (Eng, 1.5); Abhijeet Gupta (Ind, 2) beat Radoslaw Jedynak (Pol, 1); D. Harika (Ind, 1.5) drew with Jonathan Bakalchuk (Isr, 1.5).

Pakistan should stop ceasefire violations: Rajnath Singhsecurity measures
India on Monday asked Pakistan to stop ceasefire violations after heavy shelling and firing from across the border left five villagers dead and 29 injured.
“Pakistan should stop ceasefire violations now and understand the reality that times have changed in India,” Home Minister Rajnath Singh said.
He said the Centre is monitoring the situation and Jammu and Kashmir government is taking steps to provide relief to the residents of border areas affected by Pakistani firing.
Congress said the ceasefire violations by Pakistan were a “serious issue” and it should desist from such activities.
“Whatever Pakistan is doing is certainly a serious matter. And we want to tell Pakistan that indulging in such activities is not good for that country,” Congress leader Rashid Alvi said.
Condemning Pakistan’s actions, former External Affairs Minister Salman Khurshid said it is despicable that such incidents have occurred on Eid. “There cannot be anything worse than this,” the Congress leader said.
Five villagers were killed and 29 injured in heavy mortar shelling and firing by Pakistani troops targeting hamlets and outposts along the International Border in Jammu district since last night in one of the worst ceasefire violations.
This was the 11th ceasefire violations along Indo-Pak border in Jammu and Kashmir during last four days.
On October 3, Pakistani troops and Rangers violated ceasefire in Gulmarg sector of Kashmir Valley and in Poonch and Jammu sectors in which a girl was killed and six persons were injured.

Challenge awaits bond star Gross at team-spirited Janus
While investors are certainly excited about the move - Janus shares are up 30 percent since the announcement - some wonder just how much easily the outspoken, 70-year-old Gross will fit in at the firm led by Pimco veteran Richard Weil.

Challenge awaits bond star Gross at team-spirited Janus
While investors are certainly excited about the move - Janus shares are up 30 percent since the announcement - some wonder just how much easily the outspoken, 70-year-old Gross will fit in at the firm led by Pimco veteran Richard Weil.
Post your opinion here
 
Investors hope the Bond King can remake himself as a team player.
Bill Gross last week abruptly left Newport Beach, California-based Pimco, the firm he built into a bond giant, to join Janus Capital Group , a small Denver firm that touts on its website how its friendly, team-oriented culture creates "strong collaborators."
While investors are certainly excited about the move - Janus shares are up 30 percent since the announcement - some wonder just how much easily the outspoken, 70-year-old Gross will fit in at the firm led by Pimco veteran Richard Weil. Weil hired Gross at the urging of former Pimco chief executive officer Bill Thompson, according to two people familiar with the matter.
But Janus already has a bond leader in Gibson Smith, who has less star power than Gross but has quietly delivered better performance in recent years. He is said to work well with Janus CEO Weil, and has emphasized a team approach, which could be a contrast with the autocratic style that Gross showed at Pimco.
Kevin Mahn, who helps manage USD 2 billion as chief investment officer at Hennion & Walsh, a Parsippany, New Jersey-based wealth management firm, questions if Gross can co-exist with Smith and how much oversight Gross may face.
"It's setting the stage for a culture clash," Mahn said. "Here's a guy who was at rock-star status, and Pimco was synonymous with his name. Now he's moving to a different firm and he's not necessarily going to be the same person as he was," Mahn said.
Michael Cuggino, president of the USD 7.5 billion Permanent Portfolio Family of Funds in San Francisco, which owns Janus shares, said Weil and the rest of Janus' management will be judged in part on how smoothly Gross transitions to their firm. Key will be for Gross to show he can work well with others and for Janus to avoid the bad publicity that marred Gross's last months at Pimco, including his falling-out with his one-time successor Mohamed El-Erian, who left earlier this year.
"If they bring in Gross and it's a disaster and all over the front pages because they didn't get along, like with El-Erian, that's not good," Cuggino said.
Gross has been famously short-tempered at work, slamming desk drawers and discouraging socializing. He once fumed at an employee for attending an industry conference: "I don't want you to attend the conference, I want you to be a speaker at the conference."
Janus will report third-quarter results on Oct. 23.
Weil had been Pimco's chief operating officer for ten years before joining Janus in 2010. Weil and Gross "were never soul mates the way he was with Mohamed," said John Brynjolfsson, chief investment officer of hedge fund Armored Wolf in Irvine, California, and a former managing director at Pimco from 1989 to 2008.
"There was never that chemistry. It's not like they would form a coalition after their time at Pimco or see them going on vacations together," Brynjolfsson said.
Gross has not been available for interviews, nor has Thompson. Smith has declined interview requests as have other Janus executives including Weil. A Janus spokesman said on Friday that Gross will report directly to Weil.
In press statements issued on Sept 26, the day Gross's move was announced, Janus said he will remain in Newport Beach and will take over the $13 million Janus Unconstrained Bond Fund, which will change its name to the Janus Global Unconstrained Bond Fund . Gross also will work up some related business that "will be separate and complementary" to Smith's, Janus said.
Gross isn't wasting time in jumping in: he will release his first outlook with Janus, titled "Stayin' Alive," on Oct. 9, after a webcast for institutional investors with Weil on the global unconstrained bond strategy, according to an invitation to the event seen by Reuters on Friday.
 
SMALL BUT NIMBLE
Smith, who is keeping his title as Janus' fixed income chief investment officer, will focus on corporate bonds while Gross will stick with the "macro" role he played at Pimco making big-picture bets on interest rates and the global economy.
A half-dozen people who have worked with Smith or know him well say he collaborates closely with a group of analysts and traders, many of whom he recruited since he became Janus' bond chief in 2006. These people said Weil and Smith work well together.
Smith runs a smaller bond operation at Janus, with $31.4 billion in assets at June 30, compared with the $222 billion that Gross oversaw at Pimco Total Return Fund alone. Yet Smith’s steady returns compare favorably to Gross' recent uneven performance.
The Janus Flexible Bond Fund, the firm's biggest bond fund at $7.1 billion, has earned a 3.85 percent return this year through Sept. 30. This compared with the Pimco Total Return Fund's 3.33 percent return over the same period. The Janus fund has also outperformed by a similar level over a five-year period, according to data from Lipper, a Thomson Reuters unit.       
Janus shares initially shot up 43 percent on Sept 26, hitting a 52-week high of $15.95 after the Gross announcement. They closed at USD 14.49 on Friday, up 30 percent from before Gross joined the firm.
In a report issued Oct. 2 Morningstar analyst Sumit Desai wrote that Janus will need to provide enough support such as traders, research analysts portfolio managers for Gross to handle an influx of investor cash. Janus will never likely provide as much support as Pimco, Desai wrote, "raising the question of how successful Gross can be with fewer resources."

Pietersen s book set to hog the limelightMore
Pietersen's upcoming book set to dominate this week's agenda
Material from the book, which has been ghosted by acclaimed journalist David Walsh, will start to become public on Monday.

Kevin Pietersen is set to dominate the cricket agenda this week, at least in the UK, with the release of his much-hyped autobiography. The book is expected to detail his version of his sacking by England earlier this year along with various other incidents from his life and career which has never failed to provide thrills, intrigue, drama and controversy.
Material from the book, which has been ghosted by acclaimed journalist David Walsh, will start to become public on Monday. Pietersen is set to hold a ticket-only event in Manchester on Tuesday along with various media commitments before the book is fully available in the shops on Thursday.
Most will first turn to find out Pietersen's version of what happened as the Ashes tour unravelled last year and into January, leading up to his central contract being cancelled in February. What was said in that meeting organised by the players before the Melbourne Test to speak openly and honestly about what had gone wrong? Was there too much honesty for some players to take? Did it turn into disrespect? Or was this just the final straw in a situation that had become irreparable?
Then onto Sydney and the judgement by Paul Downton, the new managing director of England cricket, after a two-and-a-half day Test that he had never seen anyone so "disengaged" from a team. And, of course, was there whistling?
Through everything that is read, re-hashed and spoken about in the coming days it is worth remembering the book is just another side to a story that has the increasing feel of never coming to a satisfactory conclusion.
The way his England career ended is only one area that Pietersen has the chance to fill in some blanks. Will he finally reveal the exact content of the text messages he sent to some of the South Africans in 2012 about Andrew Strauss and the motivation behind sending them? And what really went on to get him back in the team?
Going further back, to 2008 and early 2009, there was his first sacking by England - from the captaincy. What was he trying to achieve in those days? Was it all an effort to get Graham Ford installed as England coach? Pietersen could well have had valid concerns to raise about how the team was developing under Peter Moores, but does he regret how he went about trying to make them? It will be fascinating to see how often regret, or even remorse, from Pietersen's side emerges.
If this is to be the definitive account of Pietersen's England career it would be nice to think there will be ample words given to the the good times - there were plenty in an era where the team enjoyed considerable success.
These tales will clearly not be the ones to grab the headlines this week, but the recollections of The Oval, Adelaide, Barbados, Colombo and Mumbai will be intriguing, and how much Pietersen talks about them in the context of the team as well as his individual brilliance. To play those stunning innings he needed players at the other end, even if just to block.
As much as there appears to be a thirst to find out which players take the full force of Pietersen's anger, it will also be interesting to see which ones emerge on his good side.
And will those scorned feel the need to respond, or will they take a deep breath and allow the natural cycle to die down of its own accord? Will the ECB want to counter or bite their lip? There will be further demands that the board make public their full reasons for his sacking. In April, Alastair Cook promised to give his side of the story although it would seem unlikely that he will emerge from his pre-Sri Lanka break to comment any time soon.
"There will be a time in the not too distant future," Cook said, "when I can give you the whole side of my story but I hope you can bear with that a little longer."
Few other sports books in recent times have come with this amount of pre-publication hype. Last year Alex Ferguson's autobiography, released in a similar way without serialisation to build up the anticipation and ensuing coverage, was met with a somewhat lukewarm response when it did not quite provide what had been expected - or hoped. Over the next few days we will see whether Pietersen has said enough to appease the demand.

Govt keen to put Chennai and Kolkata airports on blockGovt keen to put Chennai and Kolkata airports on block
Sanjay Singh     New Delhi   Last Updated: October 4, 2014  | 20:26 IST
Civil aviation minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju Pusapati. Picture: Kasif
Civil aviation minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju Pusapati is keen to push through the privatisation of airports starting with Chennai and Kolkata, but the opposition from state governments and the strong unions of Airports Authority of India (AAI) have emerged as a hurdle.
The minister told MAIL TODAY: "We are not against privatisation… We are looking at functional efficiency. If the public sector can assure efficiency and do it then it is good. Why not ? If they can't. Definitely there is an option open. Nothing will be done secretively".
Coming out in favour of privatisation of airports, he said "Everybody is accountable, be it the public sector or a private developer. A private party does not take away an airport in his pocket and run away. The infrastructure is still within the country and is governed under an Indian law. We are not in a hurry. It has to be done and it will be done. However, there is a procedure which is to be followed".
The minister said that the ministry of civil aviation would like to be involved in policy making. "We will set performance parameters," he added. The government is also keeping on hold the new civil aviation policy. It is understood that once the government comes out with some clarity on privatisation of airports, it would then release the new civil aviation policy.
"We have not fixed any timeline for the new civil aviation policy. We would like it to come out with a new policy in a reasonable time-frame so that it becomes effective. We have asked them (AAI and the ministry officials involved) to formulate a fresh model concession agreement. Now we have experience with the privatisation of airports." "What were the agreements with these private developers. All these issues and shortcomings will form part of the model concession agreement which will set rules for new takeovers of airports by private developers," he added.
Pusapati's predecessor Ajit Singh had identified six airports including Chennai and Kolkata which were to become the first such airports where private developers would have been able to acquire 100 per cent equity on a 30-year lease basis.

Seven militants killed in PakistanPress Trust of India | Karachi | Posted: October 5, 2014 5:18 pm
Pakistan police Sunday shot dead at least seven Taliban militants and arrested five others who were allegedly involved in a fatal bomb attack on a senior police officer here.
They were killed in a gunbattle with the police in the notorious Lasi and Ayub Goth areas of Malir, on the outskirts of the city.
“On getting information we carried out a full scale operation and were met with strong resistance from this group of militants who used heavy ammo against us,” Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Malir, Rao Anwar said.
“In the operation seven militants were killed and five others captured in injured condition while at least two of them managed to escape,” he said.
The militants were allegedly involved in the attack on Chaudhry Aslam who led a strong campaign against the terrorists in Pakistan’s biggest city.
Having survived several assassination attempts in the past, he along with two other officers died when a bomb-laden vehicle targeted his convoy on the Lyari expressway on January 10.
Militant group Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) had claimed responsibility for the attack.
Anwar said three of those killed were involved in preparing the bomb-laden vehicle that killed Aslam and two other officers.
“Hazrat Hussain, Lal Dada and Amin were those involved in planning the attack on Aslam,” he said.
He said the police had recovered large quantity of explosives, arms and ammunition and suicide jackets from the safe houses.
For sometime now some of the Katchi Abadis and Goths have become no go areas with militants having taken refuge there in safe houses.

India Inc s cash flows back in positive zoneIndia Inc's cash flows back in positive zone
Krishna Kant | Mumbai Oct 06, 2014 12:58 AM IST
Indian companies' cash situation saw a marked improvement in 2013-14: These firms generated free cash flows (net pf capital expenditure) from their operations for the first time since the Lehman crisis of 2008.
BSE 500 companies together generated a little over Rs 4 lakh crore of cash from operations, higher than the Rs 3.32 lakh used for capital expenditure during the year. This reduced the need for fresh borrowing to fund expansion. This was unlike earlier years, when cash flows from operations fell short of cash outgo on account of capex and dividend payouts to shareholders, and companies were forced to scale up borrowings for plugging the cash shortfall.
A Business Standard analysis of the combined consolidated finances of 394 of the BSE-500 companies (excluding banking & financial and oil & gas ones) for the year ended March 2014 shows the cash flow from operations in 2013-14 rose 22.7 per cent over a year earlier. The rate of growth during the year was the fastest in four years, driven mainly by higher profitability and a decline in working capital requirements.
The cash outgo on account of capex and investment declined 16.4 per cent in 2013-14, as companies lowered their capacity expansion in view of an economic slowdown. This left them with free cash flows of nearly Rs 70,000 crore, against a similar amount of net cash outgo in 2012-13.
At its peak in 2010-11, companies' cash burn rate exceeded their internal cash generation by Rs 1.27 lakh crore, due to a mix of low internal cash generation and faster rise in capital expenditure.
Analysts attribute this change in trend to the impact of cash-rich companies in the information technology, pharma, fast-moving consumer goods and automobile sectors, besides a cutdown on incremental capex by companies. "Export-driven companies like Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys, Sun Pharma, Dr Reddys Lab and Tata Motors now account for a bigger pie of India Inc's revenues and profits than a few years earlier. A strong show by these companies has more than made up for the laggards in sectors like construction & infra, real estate, power and metals. Some help has also come from a sequential decline in incremental capex allowing companies to cut down on cash expenses," says G Chhokalingam, founder and chief executive of Equinomics Research & Advisory.
The sectoral trend in cash flows validates this point. The bulk of the incremental improvement in internal cash generation was accounted for by IT exporters like TCS, Infosys and Wipro; pharma majors (Sun Pharma, Lupin and Dr Reddy's Lab), FMCG companies (ITC, Hindustan Unilever and Dabur) and automobile manufacturers (Tata Motors and Maruti Suzuki). Other major contributors were government-owned mining companies - Coal India and National Mineral Development Corporation (NMDC).
The companies in these five sectors accounted for nearly half the internal cash generation by the entire universe of companies and most of the free cash flows from operations, in 2013-14. If it was not for these companies' contribution, there would have been a cash hole in India Inc's balance sheet last year as well.
Among individual companies, Tata Motors topped the chart with internal cash generation of Rs 36,151 crore in 2013-14. It was followed by Bharti Airtel (Rs 26,025 crore), NTPC (Rs 16,469 crore), Power Grid Corporation (Rs 15,259 crore) and TCS (Rs 14,751 crore).
The bad news, though, is that companies in sectors that are capex- and working capital-intensive - such as construction & infrastructure, power, metals, real estate and gems & jewellery - continue to burn more cash than they generate from their operations. In 2013-14, therefore, their indebtedness rose further, as they had to borrow to meet their cash shortfall. In the sample taken for this analysis, 18 construction & infrastructure firms together generated Rs 5,406 crore of cash from their operations last year. This was only a small fraction of their capex and investment outgo of nearly Rs 29,000 crore and led to a further rise in their leverage ratio to 2.8 (net of cash & equivalents) from 2.4 in 2012-13 and 1.1 in 2008-09.
Among companies with the worst cash flows in 2013-14, Larsen & Toubro topped the chart with negative internal cash generation of Rs 6,963 crore. It was followed by MTNL (negative Rs 4,186 crore), Ranbaxy Labs (negative Rs 3,562 crore), Gitanjali Gems (negative Rs 2,966 crore) and Rajesh Exports (negative Rs 2,629 crore).
Metal and power companies, on the other hand, faced the problem of internal cash generation falling short of incremental capex and investment. Companies like Tata Steel, Hindalco, JSW Steel, SAIL, Jindal Saw and Bhushan Steel reported negative free cash flows, as internal cash generation fell short of capex and investment last year.
Power companies like NTPC, PowerGrid, Reliance Power, Adani Power, JP Power and CESC also reported strong cash flows from their operations but those proved inadequate to fund their incremental capex and equity dividend. They were, therefore, forced to raise additional loans. Companies like Tata Power, JSW Energy, NHPC, Neyveli Lignite, SJVN and Torrent Power, though, bucked the trend by generating free cash flows, with a sharp fall in their incremental capex.

Gandhi  Modi & the politics in London celebrating the  unwelcomeGandhi, Modi & the politics in London celebrating the 'unwelcome'
Aditi Phadnis | New Delhi Oct 06, 2014 12:56 AM IST
Two Indian men, derided, despised and generally made to feel unwelcome in Britain, will be feted and celebrated in London next year.
The British are falling over themselves to secure approval of the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to the UK. The date they are looking for is January 30, the day Mahatma Gandhi was martyred 66 years ago. The occasion is the unveiling of a statue of the Mahatma - whom former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill had once mockingly described as a half-naked fakir - at prestigious Parliament Square, outside the Palace of Westminster.
Though the plans to put up Gandhi's statue were announced by UK chancellor George Osborne and foreign secretary William Hague some time ago, the date is crucial. The UK is to have elections in May 2015 and the statue will come in handy to move persons of Indian origin to vote for the party trying hard to get it installed. And, if the man to unveil the statue is Modi, politicians reckon, the party will be a shoo-in for victory.
Osborne, when he announced the plan to put up a statue, the second in London - there is already a bust of Gandhi's at London's Tavistock Square - said: "As the father of the largest democracy in the world, it is time Gandhi took his place in front of the mother of Parliaments. He is a figure of inspiration, not just in Britain and India but around the world."
Gandhi will be sharing the space with Jan Smuts and Nelson Mandela, the South African leaders who were on two sides of the segregation fence, as well as Churchill and many others. There are only a handful of foreigners whose statues have been erected at Parliament Square, one of the most prized parks in London. The statue has been designed and executed by Philip Jackson, a British sculptor.
For Modi, too, the unveiling will be important. Riding on the back of the offer are the votes of 400,000 British Gujaratis, who live in and around London. Gujaratis are the second-largest section of the Indian immigrant population in Britain.
It was the Labour Party that froze relations with Modi in the wake of the Gujarat riots in 2002, in which several British Gujaratis died, including former Indian MP Ehsan Jafri (who became a British citizen and whose wife, Zakia, led a relentless battle against the state government, charging it and the chief minister with having reneged on responsibility in controlling the riots). Although Britain resumed relations with Modi later, with High Commissioner James Bevan meeting him in 2013, there continues to be a degree of awkwardness in dealing with him. Members of Parliament there believe that feeling will be washed away by the single act of inviting him to unveil Gandhi's statue.
The Indian government is still turning the offer over in its mind. The reason: The January 26 Republic Day festivities will barely have ended when it would be time for Modi to travel to London. But, whatever the timing, there is no denying that inauguration of Gandhi's statue by Modi will be a moment of quiet satisfaction for much of India.

Japanese Stocks  Dollar Shine on Upbeat US JobsYou are here: Home Market
Japanese Stocks, Dollar Shine on Upbeat US Jobs
Reuters | Updated On: October 06, 2014 08:39 (IST)
World Stocks Grind Higher After Central Bank Stimulus Signals
Tokyo:
Japanese stocks bounced on Monday and the US dollar held near four-year highs against a basket of currencies, as upbeat US jobs data boosted sentiment after a week of worries about global growth and geopolitical tensions frayed investor nerves.
Tokyo's Nikkei jumped 0.9 per cent in early trade while South Korean shares rose 0.3 per cent after a market holiday on Friday.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.2 per cent. Some signs of calm in the region was seen towards the end of last week after the civil unrest in Hong Kong had spooked investors.
The US Labor Department reported nonfarm payrolls rose 248,000 in September, 33,000 more than median forecast while the jobless rate fell two-tenths of a point to a six-year low of 5.9 per cent.
Stocks on Wall Street jumped more than 1.0 per cent on Friday, with the S&P 500 posting its best day in almost two months to end at $1,967.90.
The US dollar was another clear winner, as the data highlighted the relative strength of the US economy as many other major economies remain sluggish.
The dollar index stood at 86.679, little changed so far on Monday but having risen 1.3 per cent on Friday to hit a high of 86.746 , its strongest since June 2010.
The euro traded at $1.2515, having fallen to $1.2505 on Friday, its lowest level in more than two years.
The dollar fetched 109.82 yen, near last week's six-year high of 110.09 yen.
"The theme in the currency market at the moment is the divergence of economic growth... But the pace of the dollar's rally may slow down a bit from now. The 110 yen level seems to be heavy," said Shusuke Yamada, chief Japan FX strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
In early thin Asian trade, sterling hit a 11-month low $1.5943 while the New Zealand dollar fell 0.7 per cent to $0.7719, threatening to fall below one-year low of 0.7708 marked last week.
As the dollar rose, gold came under pressure, falling 0.5 per cent to hit a 15-month low of $1,183.51 per ounce.
The US Treasuries bond prices fell on the jobs data, but they quickly recovered most of the lost ground. The 10-year notes yielded 2.4412 per cent on Monday, little changed from just before the data release.
While job growth was solid, some investors also focused on the small growth in wages. Average hourly earnings rose just 2.0 per cent from a year earlier, well below above three percent before the Great recession in 2008-09.
As limited wage growth suggests low inflationary pressure, affording the Federal Reserve room to wait before raising interest rates, interest rate futures markets showed limited reaction, moving only a few ticks.
Federal fund rate futures are pricing in full chance of a rate hike in July.
Asia has little data to trade on, but one focus later in the day is on Brazil, where leftist President Dilma Rousseff placed first in Sunday's election but did not get enough votes to avoid a runoff on Oct. 26.
She will face pro-business rival Aecio Neves, who made a dramatic late surge into second place.
Over the past month, the Brazilian real and shares tended to weaken when polls show Rousseff gaining as many investors believe a more market-friendly administration could help boost demand for Brazilian assets.
The real hit six-year low of 2.5070 reals per dollar on Friday, hitting the 2.50 mark, a level seen by some as fuelling inflation and increasing the chances of additional central bank market intervention.

What’s stopping you from getting rich? Not bad luck, but faulty investing strategies

(If you really want to get…)
You are a diligent saver, a careful investor and a meticulous planner. Yet, you have not been able to build wealth even as everyone around you seems to be wallowing in money. What's stopping you from getting rich? If it's bad luck, you can buy one of those good fortune charms hawked on late night TV shows. But if you really want to get to the root of the problem, you need to assess where you are going wrong in your investments.
Our cover story this week is about the money myths and investing flaws that prevent you from getting rich. It could be the lure of penny stocks or the tantalising potential of the futures and options segment. Small investors often lose their shirts (and nearly everything else) when they enter these high-risk arenas without adequate knowledge.
But mistakes can happen even if you play ultra safe. If a fixed deposit offers 9%, the post-tax returns for someone in the 30% tax bracket will be barely 6.3%. That's not too bad until you factor in 8% inflation. So even though the investor does not feel it, his money is losing value. This is one of the biggest investing mistakes Indians make when they pour money into fixed deposits. In the following pages, we have listed the common hurdles that prevent investors from getting rich.
Many of these hurdles are really self made. They can be done away with by changing your approach to investing. Gold, for instance, should not occupy more than 5-10% allocation in your portfolio. This can happen if you treat the yellow metal less as an investment and more as a hedging tool.
There's no point in dwelling on mistakes unless we can offer a solution. So, each financial mistake has been followed by advice on how to avoid it. This stress on utility has been ET Wealth's hallmark since the time it was launched. In this 200th issue of the newspaper, we hope to live up to the expectations of our readers.

Maharashtra elections: Sena hits out at PM Modi  questions his respect for Bal Thackeray27
0
Mumbai: As Prime Minister Narendra Modi campaigns in poll-bound Maharashtra, the Shiv Sena on Monday hit out at him and questioned his respect for late Sena founder Bal Thackeray.
Sena through its mouthpiece 'Saamna' questioned the recent break up of the 25-year-old alliance between Shiv Sena and BJP. The editorial said where did all the respect go when the alliance broke because of seat-sharing.
The remarks came after Modi said he won't speak on Shiv Sena out of respect for the late Balasaheb Thackeray. "There are a few things which are above politics. I have immense respect for Balasahab Thackeray. These are the first polls in the state after he passed away. As a mark of respect for him, I will not speak a word against Shiv Sena," Modi had said while addressing a rally on Sunday.
#maharashtra assembly elections 2014 #maharashtra #shiv sena #narendra modi
The editorial said that if there was some respect for Balasaheb, there would have been some maturity while dealing with seat sharing. As both the parties were adamant on their demand for seats, they failed to reach a consensus on the issue.
It added that it doesn't suit such people to come Maharashtra and seek votes in the name of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.
Modi is scheduled to address over 20 rallies in Maharashtra in 10 days time and appealing to people to give mandate to BJP this time. The party is contesting polls alone after 25 years.

Global banks join hands to set up one-stop bond shopGlobal banks join hands to set up one-stop bond shop
Reuters
Tweet
Oct 6:  
A group of 12 global banks are working together to set up a one-stop bond shop for buyers and sellers of corporate bonds, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.
The initiative, called "Neptune," will not be for executing trades, rather it will link up banks and investors in the market and potentially some of the existing trading platforms they use, the newspaper reported.
The banks, which include BNP Paribas SA, Credit Suisse Group AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, HSBC Holdings and JP Morgan Chase & Co, are set to pay 30,000 pounds ($47,934) each for the first phase of consultancy work, the WSJ said.
AXA Investment Managers and Schroders Plc also are involved in the discussions, the report said citing executives at those firms, alongside a dozen or so other money managers.
Bond liquidity has all but dried up for corporate issues after new regulations and capital requirements forced Wall Street banks to slash their inventories of fixed-income products following the financial crisis.
The lack of liquidity also means funds may have trouble selling bonds in the event interest rates rise and the investors who have sunk about $1.2 trillion in net deposits into long-term bond funds since the end of 2004 head for the exits.
Neptune is the latest in a string of attempts to make corporate-bond trading more efficient. Investors have complained about a growing disparity between trading volumes in new and old bonds, the report said.
JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Credit Suisse, BNP Paribas and HSBC did not immediately respond to emails seeking comments on the report.

Indigenous Meghalaya beverages a hit among touristsIndigenous Meghalaya beverages a hit among tourists

Shillong, Oct 6:  
The picturesque hill state of Meghalaya, boasting of forests and meadows, also takes pride in its indigenous culture running for centuries with cuisine being an integral part.
Two typical Meghalaya beverages — Cha khoo and Sha shiahkrot — are a big hit among visitors and their acceptance level has risen many fold since they were re-discovered by women self-help groups and marketed.
Cha khoo (cha is tea and khoo is rice in the Jaintia dialect) is traditional rice concoction that yields a beverage similar to tea but leaves a bland coffee taste.
Sha shiahkrot, on the other hand, is an unconventional tea that is derived when a root of Shiahkrot (a creeper) is boiled.
Cha khoo is a refreshing hot drink that tastes partly like tea and partly like coffee while Sha shiahkrot is believed to have some medicinal properties.
Available in a small pocket in the state’s Jaintia Hills district, the preparation of Cha khoo challenge the conventional tea as there is no tea leave or coffee bean in it but roasted rice only.
The popularity of this beverages was because of an all women self—help group (SHG) in the village and the erstwhile Meghalaya Rural Development Society—LIFCOM which re—discovered and relaunched it and made it a rage among tourists.
Abundant in Mynksan village under Laskein block, the beverage has lately been on a very high demand in local market and there are visitors who have developed a taste bud for this.
In fact, Cha Khoo had been the only hot drink available and popular among a group of villagers in Laskein block, about 90 km from here, until the British introduced tea, N Lapasam who is the secretary of Chirupdeilang SHG in the village told

Hong Kong shares rise as political tensions easeHong Kong shares rise as political tensions ease
Reuters
Tweet
Hong Kong, Oct 6:  
Hong Kong shares started the week stronger, as a scaling down in pro-democracy protests let some disrupted sectors resume work while upbeat US jobs data boosted sentiment.
Civil servants, allowed to pass through protesters' barricades unimpeded, were able to arrive for work at the main government offices. Some banks that had closed branches during the mass protests of the past week also reopened their doors for business.
Stocks on Wall Street posted solid gains on Friday, following a stronger-than-expected September jobs report that bolstered the outlook for the US economy.
At midday, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was up 0.5 per cent to 23,184.24 points. The China Enterprises Index of the top Chinese listings in Hong Kong was 0.3 per cent ahead.
Mainland Chinese bourses, closed for holidays, will resume trading on Wednesday.
"The Hong Kong market is having a rebound again because the Occupy Central activities seem to have some signs of easing," said Ben Kwong, director at KGI Asia.
However, Kwong said "we don't expect the rebound will be very strong" as investors are still concerned about what comes next following the Chinese territory's worst civil unrest in decades.
Macau casinos lead gains
Macau casinos mounted a comeback on Monday. Sands China soared 6.5 per cent from Friday's more than 14-month low, while Galaxy Entertainment Group jumped 5.0 per cent from its lowest since August 2013.
For casinos, the fundamentals "are not that attractive but the point is that they were already heavily oversold, so we just pick on a bet of technical rebound," Kwong said.
Carmaker BYD Co advanced 2.6 per cent after mainland media reported over the weekend that its S7 model will be launched by the end of October.
Chinese property extends gains
Chinese property developers rose for a second day following China's move to cut mortgage rates and down payment levels for some home buyers. It was the first such move since the 2008 global financial crisis.
China Resources Land and China Vanke both added 3.2 per cent.
Local retailers also recouped some of last week's losses. Cosmetics chain Sa Sa International gained 3.3 per cent and Chow Tai Fook Jewellery 2.6 per cent.

Hewlett-Packard to split in 2 companies: Report30
2
Washington: Hewlett-Packard Co., the iconic maker of personal computers and printers, reportedly plans to split itself into two separate companies by spinning off its technology services business.
The Wall Street Journal reported the pending split Sunday citing people familiar with the matter, who said an official announcement could come as soon as Monday. A spokeswoman for HP declined to comment on the report.
The breakup would create one company that sells HP's computers and printers and a second that focuses on technology services, including data storage, servers and software.

#hewlett packard #hp #computers #pcs
The Palo Alto, California-based company has laid off tens of thousands of employees in recent years due to flagging sales as consumers turn to mobile devices to perform basic computing chores. The shift has curbed demand for HP's desktop and laptop computers, as well as its printers.
In its most recent quarter, HP posted revenue of $27.6 billion, up 1 percent at the same time last year. Although only a slight uptick, it marked HP's first year-over-year gain in quarterly revenue since its fiscal third quarter in 2011.
Printers and computers contributed 51 percent of the company's quarterly revenue, with the rest coming from four businesses that offer various technology services, including consulting, software and financial programs.
HP previously announced plans to wrap up between 11,000 to 16,000 layoffs by October, expanding upon the 34,000 employees that it had already jettisoned from its payroll.
Investors often reward technology companies for slimming down and focusing on core business offerings.
Last Tuesday, eBay said it would spin off its mobile payment service PayPal into a separate and publicly traded company next year. Investors sent eBay shares up more than 7 per cent in trading on the day of the announcement.

5 killed  29 injured as Pak fires at Indian posts | Stop ceasefire violations: RajnathFive killed, 29 injured in heavy shelling by Pakistani troops
PTI Oct 6, 2014, 09.25AM IST
("The number of civilians…)
JAMMU: Five villagers were killed and 29 injured in heavy mortar shelling and firing by Pakistani troops targeting hamlets and outposts along the International Border in Jammu district today in one of the worst ceasefire violations.
"Pakistani Rangers resorted to heavy and unprovoked firing and shelling of mortars on 10 corder outposts (BoPs) and civilian areas along international border (IB) in Arnia belt of Jammu district from 10 PM last night," a BSF spokesman said today.
They used small, automatic weapons and mortar bombs to target the border hamlets and BoPs along the borderline. BSF troops guarding the borderline retaliated effectively and gave a befitting reply, he said, adding that the intermittent firing exchanges are going on in the area.
In the shelling, five villagers were killed and 29 injured in several hamlets, Sub-Divisional Police Officer (SDPO), R S Pura Tehsil, Devender Shingh told PTI.
25 of the injured have been shifted to GMC hospital Jammu.
A large number of houses were damaged and livestock perished in the firing and shelling, said Singh, who was leading a team of police personnel who risked their lives to shift the injured people to hospital during the heavy shelling.
"People living in critical zones along the border will be evacuated," he said
A BSF spokesman said that the force did not suffer any casualty.
This was the 11th ceasefire violations along Indo-Pak border in Jammu and Kashmir during last four days. There have been seven ceasefire violations along Line of Control in Poonch and four along IB in Jammu.
On October 3, Pakistani troops and rangers violated ceasefire in Gulamarg sector of Kashmir Valley and in Poonch and Jammu sectors in which a girl was killed and six persons were injured.
Fear was writ large of the faces of kin of the injured, who were shifted to the hospital here. "We thought we will die any time, such was the firing of mortar bombs and their bursting sound," Karan Singh of Pindi village said.
"We have become sitting ducks for Pakistan to target us. Government should do something immediately. We cannot live on the border to die," Rano Devi said.
Yesterday, Pakistani troops violated ceasefire by resorting to unprovoked and heavy firing on Indian forward posts along LoC in Balnoie sub-sector of Poonch district around 0800 hours.
On October 4, Pakistani troops resorted heaviest firing and mortar shelling along LoC in in Poonch district of Jammu and Kashmir, drawing retaliation from Army.
On October 1 and 2, Pakistani troops violated ceasefire two times along LoC in Poonch district resulting in injuries to six people, including three women.
With assembly elections due in Jammu and Kashmir, the Pakistan-based militant leadership is desperate to push in a large number of militants into the Indian side in the cover of the heavy firing to carry out terrorism related activities, according to the Army.
"They want to disrupt the assembly elections in the state as they know that a large number of their cadre has already been eliminated. So to reinforce their numbers, they are desperately trying to infiltrate more people into the state and that is why there has been an increase in the number of ceasefire violations," Udhampur-based defense spokesman Col SD Goswami had said.
Before this, the heaviest ceasefire violation by the Pakistani troops was witnessed on August 26 night.
In a bid to defuse border tension, triggered by firing and shelling by Pakistani troops stretching to 45 days, the heaviest since 1971 war, India and Pakistan on August 29 held a crucial Sector Commander (DIG-Brigadier) level flag meeting on Octerio BoP in Jammu district's R S Pura sector.
On August 28, BSF troops held Commandant level flag-meeting with Rangers along IB at Ballard Post in Samba sector.
Pakistani troops also resorted to mortar shelling and firing in Jammu and Kashmir's Poonch district.
"Pakistan violated ceasefire today. They resorted to firing and mortar shelling on forward posts along LoC in Bhimber Gali (BG) belt of Poonch district around 0830 hours today," a Defence Spokesman said.
Indian troops effectively retaliated, he said adding that exchanges are going on in the area.

How startups like Hyperverge cash in on hi-t...Aindra Systems
(An early entrant like seven-year-old Tonbo Imaging…)
BANGALORE: When a teacher at a government school in Tumkur—a town about 75 km northeast of Bangalore—would use her mobile to take a photograph of her class every morning, it seemed like an unusual habit. What she was actually doing was using 'computer vision,' a technology that helps machines interpret images and videos as humans do.
The app on the teacher's phone put a name to a student's face, eliminating any attempt to falsify attendance records. And scoring attendance accurately and quickly was important because government funding for the school depended on how many children were present each day. Aindra Systems , the Bangalore-based startup that built the technology, is one of several companies developing commercial applications in an area that until recently was confined to research labs in universities.
"As wearables such as smartwatches become ubiquitous, you will need people who can process and make sense of this data," said Kedar Kulkarni, founder of Chennai-based Hyperverge which is preparing for the commercial launch of its image-recognition product. Hyperverge, which is just 10 months old, has raised $550,000 (Rs 3.5 crore) from a clutch of USbased investors, including New Enterprise Associates which has backed companies such as enterprise software maker Salesforce and deals site Groupon.
So far, text has been the predominant form of content on the worldwide web. But with videos and images being stored and shared in ever larger numbers, identifying and searching for such content has become a challenge and a commercial opportunity.
While searching for visual content is one element, being able to understand and analyse such images is adding a new level of sophistication to the technology. Google's Project Tango, for example, helps mobile devices to perceive concepts of space and motion. With Amazon's Firefly feature, users can click a picture of an object anywhere and search for its equivalent on the online store.
At a recent hackathon in Bangalore, data analytics company MuSigma said solutions that can identify who in a casino is cheating, or who is not working on their systems in a closed environment, are its areas of interest. As proof that the technology is not merely limited within the walls of colleges in India, IIT Madras' professor Anurag Mittal said students from other branches were increasingly enrolling in his computer vision group, helping startups with projects.
He cited Kulkarni of Hyperverge, who was a student of industrial automation, as an example. An early entrant like seven-year-old Tonbo Imaging has evolved to the extent that it now sells intelligent cameras to the militaries of Singapore, India and the United Kingdom.
Tonbo's cameras capture images, identify targets, and even help fire missiles based on the information it interprets. The company became profitable last year and is looking at $20 million (Rs 120 crore) in revenue this year. The market is growing fast--shipments of embedded vision devices across various industries are forecast to exceed 14 million units in 2018, up from almost four million units this year, according to research firm IHS.
Bangalore-based Ice Cream Labs is eyeing large retail brands and hopes to use the technology to develop and target contextual ads. "The biggest challenge is in deciphering attributes of an image. We've done that and hope to become an alternate to Google Display Networks," said Madhu Konety, founder of the year-old company that has at least eight customers including Levi's, Reliance Footprint and Louis Philippe.
What Ice Cream Labs does is use existing visuals on the web, like photos of a celebrity, beaches or cars, and intersperse the advertiser's message with the content in photos.
Pradeep Tagare, director for Intel Capital's Indian arm, is of the view that which the technology cannot be ignored, more progress is important before investors become seriously interested. "This is an absolute focus area for us. But we have not seen many companies go beyond a proof of concept stage," he said.

Sequel to Super TroopersannouncedPress Trust of India | London | Posted: October 6, 2014 12:12 pm
Sequel to 2001 comedy ‘Super Troopers’ has been announced. Actor Steve Lemme, who starred in the original, said the makers were waiting for some legal disputes to be resolved before announcing the sequel, reported Us magazine.
“You know, it was a combination of having to settle some of the legal disputes about making a sequel, while also negotiating terms for it. “The fans have been asking for it for a while, but we were finally able to package everything together. Fox is going to distribute the film, but we needed to raise the money for it, with a minimum budget of USD 27 million, which we’ve just about raised.
“There may be a ‘Kickstarter’ launched to raise the last little bit,” the 45-year-old actor said. Lemme, without divulging details of the movie, said it is one of the most unique films he has done in recent times.
“I think it’s one of the more unique and interesting stories I’ve seen in awhile. But the movie picks up pretty much where we left off in the first one. It’s a few years later. The biggest difficulty was trying to top that opening scene, which so many people have complimented us on. I think we’ve done it,” he said.
The first movie, which starred Lemme, Jay Chandrasekhar, Kevin Heffernan, Erik Stolhanske, and Paul Soter, followed the hilarious antics of five Vermont state troopers, patrolling near the border of Canada. Lemme also said the filming is likely to start at the beginning of 2015, with pre-production taking place in November.

Govt mulls IPR courts to fast-trackcasesPrint
New Delhi | Posted: October 6, 2014 12:10 pm
The government is working on a new, comprehensive policy on intellectual property rights (IPR), which would pave the way for setting up special IPR courts comprising experts to fast-track adjudication on infringement cases concerning all forms of IPRs, official sources told FE.
It also proposes to “mainstream” ‘jugaad’ — or an indigenous version of incremental invention with meagre resources — in the IPR landscape as a “utility patent”.
A separate legal regime for ‘utility patents’, which would be in compliance with the World Trade Organisation’s Trade Related aspects of IPRs Agreement (TRIPS), has also been proposed. The regime would have a less stringent criteria — where the registration process is simpler and the grant of the ‘utility patent’ faster — as well as lesser costs to the applicant, both when compared to a normal patent.
However, since ‘utility patents’ will be for incremental innovations, the exclusive rights of the inventor holding such a patent will be only for 5-7 years from the date of filing a patent, unlike the 20 year-protection for a normal patent. A committee of IPR chairs of 20 leading universities including the National Law Schools and IITs is meeting on Monday.
The aim is to discuss with the government the way forward on ‘utility patents’, including an effective system for enforcement and dispute resolution.
A commerce and industry ministry discussion paper on ‘utility models’ in 2011 pointed out that several international pacts such as the Patent Cooperation Treaty, TRIPS and the Paris Convention for protection of IPRs have given recognition to the ‘utility model’. About 55 countries, including Brazil, China, Japan and Indonesia and two inter-governmental organisations have protection for ‘utility models’ though pharmaceutical products are mostly excluded from this framework, it said, adding that as per some independent studies, about 130 countries have adopted the utility model system.
There is broad support within the government and the industry for the concept of ‘utility patents’ in India and a separate law for it. This is because of a finding that most of India’s merchandise imports can be manufactured in the country. Therefore, giving legal recognition to ‘jugaad’ could not only incentivise incremental innovation in the country but also lead to more innovative manufacturing and creation of IPRs in the country.
‘Utility patents’ are mainly aimed helping micro and small enterprises, grass-root-level innovators, artisans, non-government organisations, organisations like the National Innovation Foundation, as well as universities and schools. This will, in turn, aid in starting an ‘innovation movement’ and establishing a databank of innovations and technology. All this will lead to the entire manufacturing-related sectors going through a learning process and then graduating to the normal patent system.
However, the concerns include the difficulties that the severely short-staffed patent offices will face if there is a flood of ‘utility patent’ applications and later disputes. The government, therefore, is considering a separate administrative and adjudicative structure for ‘utility patents’. Soon, there will be consultations with the judiciary and the law ministry on the issue.

Gold has also failed to capitalise on geopolitical tensions caused by military conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the rise of Islamic State, which has declared a cross-border caliphate in Iraq and Syria.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
SINGAPORE: Gold tumbled to its lowest level in around 15 months on Monday after better-than-expected US jobs data boosted the dollar, dampening safe-haven appetite for bullion and pushing silver and platinum to multi-year lows.
Gold, which often influences other precious metals, has also failed to capitalise on geopolitical tensions caused by military conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the rise of Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.
By 0641 GMT, cash gold was little changed at $1,191.30 an ounce after earlier falling to $1,183.46 an ounce, its weakest since June 2013.
Platinum touched its lowest since 2009, silver fell to its weakest since 2010, and palladium hit an 8-month low.
"A strong dollar is a major problem for gold. Sentiment is very bearish but I think we expect some kind of rebound," said Ronald Leung, chief dealer at Lee Cheong Gold Dealers in Hong Kong, who pegged support at $1,180 an ounce.
"There's a little bit of physical buying, but premiums haven't changed. We have to see what happens later in the day. If demand is coming, of course, it will push up the premiums."
Premiums for gold were quoted at $1.20 to $1.60 an ounce to the spot London prices, unchanged from last week, despite a sharp drop in cash gold prices.
The absence of main gold consumer China is weighing on the physical market, which usually sees a pick up in demand from jewellers and retail investors when prices fall.
Chinese markets have been shut for national holidays and will reopen on Wednesday.
US gold was $1,191.70 an ounce, down 0.10 per cent.
The dollar held on Monday near a more than four-year high, touched after last week's upbeat US nonfarm payrolls report increased speculation that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates in mid-2015 or earlier.
Data from the Labor Department on Friday showed US non-farm payrolls rose 248,000 last month and the jobless rate fell to 5.9 per cent, the lowest since July 2008, underscoring that the US economy continues to improve.
In Tokyo, sellers pushed up premiums for gold bars to 25 cents to spot London prices from zero last week to offset the decline in global prices.
"At this moment, demand is not good. But maybe when the holiday in China is over, the premiums may go up further," said a dealer in Tokyo.
Markets in Singapore, a key bullion trading centre in Southeast Asia, were also closed for a public holiday.

Red Herring: Turn on  tune in the radioOctober 6, 2014, 12:01 am IST Indrajit Hazra in Red Herring | India | ET

Once or twice a month, always on a Sunday, I pretend to be a media baron. (Funny how, old-fashioned as it may sound, the term still survives when applied to two businesses: media and liquor.) Yesterday, in my media baron avatar, I came to the conclusion that the future of information and entertainment lies in radio.
On Friday, the Great Communicator went on AIR. We have all seen him hold forth in public platforms and even his staunchest critics can’t deny that he has a gift of the gab. But watching good speakers (e.g., the late Ramakrishna Mission monk Swami Lokeswarananda), or even great speakers (e.g., the early comedian Ricky Gervais), do their thing has a different effect on you from when you only hear them, with your eyes ‘on mute’.
Which is where radio comes in. This isn’t the first time an Indian prime minister, in recent times, has cut through the chase of journalists and spoken directly to his audience. In his address to the nation on Doordarshan in December 2012, asking people to maintain peace after the violent protests against the rape of a student in the Capital, then-Prime Minister Manmohan Singh magnified his curse of the gab. His query to Doordarshan technicians, “Theek hai?”, at the end of his address was predictably aired and underlined the fact that a post-prime ministerial job in the performative arts, politics included, did not await him. In his farewell address on TV in May this year, he was better. But let’s just say he wasn’t Nach Baliyematerial.
Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s ‘Musings from Kumarakom’ in Goa in December 2002, was closer to the Great Communicator’s musings last week. Vajpayee spoke in a statesmanlike fashion about, among other things, Hindutva and secularism, Kashmir and Ayodhya. The problem was he had chosen the wrong medium: the written text that would interest only editorial writers. In any case, it was a one-off. The Great Communicator preferred to heed Marshall Mc-Luhan’s tip about the medium being the message. He wasn’t his usual Kalki avatar. On radio, he was Dadaji in the living room.
Avoiding the vomit-clutter of television, the Great Communicator took a leaf out of, and upgraded, American President Franklin D Roosevelt’s successful ‘fireside chats’, a series of 30 evening radio addresses between 1933 and 1944 (radio being the television of those times). He chatted about the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, speciallyabled children and made an unobtrusive pitch for khadi. He also peppered things up by including two aphoristic tales: one, told by his hero Swami Vivekananda, about a tiger who lived with goats and needed to rediscover his ‘tigerness’; the other about a man sitting on a pavement asking for directions.
The Great Communicator’s first radio show got me remembering the thrills of listening to radio shows in the 1980s: supernatural, detective and fairy-tale radio plays and dramatic readings. These weren’t Press Information Bureau drones. These were full-on sophisticated entertainment programmes that remain much more ‘believable’ than any series or show (news included) on Indian television today.
We still think of radio as something archaic, a medium that appeals only in villages where people huddle around a radio set while having a smoke. But radio has had a hardware revolution — in the car on FM and on mobile phones everywhere else. What it needs now is a software Golden Age.
The Great Communicator has said he’ll have his ‘Man ki baat’ show once or twice a month, on Sundays at 11:00 am. (It would be worth tracking the numbers of those tuning in to listen to him and those tuning in to watch Aamir Khan on TV for his Satyamev Jayatewhen the timings clash.) Actors can also ‘perform’ audio books and radio plays.
Nothing matches the drama and sound effects — of a door creaking open before a murder, of seagulls crying as Sinbad takes to the sea again, of the sound of a tight slap in a comedy sketch — of radio. Imagine if someone with the Great Communicator’s USP comes on radio for a weekly science show in Hindi.
Before the Great Communicator, there was Fyodor Dostoyevsky’s Grand Inquisitor from his novel The Brothers Karamozov. “There are three powers, three powers alone, able to overcome and capture once and for all the conscience of these impotent undisciplined creatures so as to give them happiness. These forces are miracle, mystery and authority,” he tells us. All three are there for the giving and the taking in this medium. So put the radio on.

Delay in spectrum grant irks Bharti Airtel  VodafoneIndiaBharti & Vodafone warn of disruptive services and huge call drops in three metros from next month. PTI
New Delhi | Posted: October 6, 2014 12:43 pm
A major tiff is brewing between the country’s top two telecom operators – Bharti Airtel and Vodafone India – and the department of telecommunications (DoT) over more than a six-month delay in allocation of spectrum which they won in February auctions.
Apart from writing letters to the DoT seeking compensation by way of interest burden on the amount they paid to the government after the auctions, sources say that the two operators are now contemplating moving court seeking a one-year extension of their renewed 20-year licence contract. Their argument is that since it takes 6-12 months to set up a network, a delay by DoT in allocating spectrum should see extension of their licence period by a year.

Further, both the operators have warned that since in circles like Delhi, Kolkata and Mumbai where their licences is up for renewal next month, the delay in spectrum allocation could lead to major disruption of services by way of call drops. The issue assumes significance since in these circles the two operators have around 60% subscriber market share.
The issue threatens to snowball into a major spat between the mobile operators and the DoT with the other operators, who won spectrum in the auctions also seeking extension of the licence period. Already the Cellular Operators Association of India – the apex body of GSM operators – has written to the DoT to expedite the process of allocating spectrum. The operators are peeved because the allocation was delayed by around six months after the November 2012 auctions also.
The story is simple. For Bharti Airtel, the 20-year licence agreement expires in the circles of Delhi and Kolkata and for Vodafone in Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata, next month. The two operators have their networks in these circles, built primarily on the 900-Mhz spectrum band. However, in the auctions held in February, they got a mixed spectrum in the bands of 1,800 and 900 Mhz. Therefore, the two operators would need to reconfigure their networks, which would take another 6-12 months. Further, Bharti Airtel, which earlier did not have spectrum in 900 Mhz in Mumbai, has won airwaves in the circle in this band and now needs to set up a new network in this band.
Since the DoT has not allocated spectrum so far, apart from incurring financial losses owing to the interest burden on money paid to acquire the airwaves, the two operators have not been able to order equipments, etc.
“The inordinate delay in allocation of spectrum has impacted business plans, whereby the expansion of existing networks as well as the roll-out of new networks has been delayed. We are incurring an interest burden on the upfront amount paid to DoT without being able continued…

Style Essentials: Designer Arjun Saluja launches his diffusionlineSome of the designs from Essentials by Rishta
Written by Kimi Dangor | Posted: October 6, 2014 12:24 pm
Since his ramp debut at Lakme Fashion Week in 2006, designer Arjun Saluja’s label Rishta has been known for embracing the unconventional and sidestepping stereotypes. With its exaggerated shapes, artful symmetry of structure and drape, and its gender-blurring silhouettes, Rishta’s non-conformist and unapologetic style stance has found a staunch following, much like its reticent maker. So, when Saluja decided to launch his diffusion line called Essentials, which he calls “a derivative of the Rishta label”, it came as a pleasant surprise to fashion watchers.
Launched at Atosa in Mumbai in August, Saluja unveiled the line for his Delhi clientele at Ensemble, DLF Emporio, last Wednesday. Essentials offers stylised renditions of some of Saluja’s trademark silhouettes — dhoti pants, pathani tunics, salwar pants, lehenga pants and bushirts. “We wanted to take our cutting techniques, tailoring and design aesthetics, simplify them and offer a more muted look — something that can be worn anytime, anywhere. It’s a simpler version of a Rishta garment,” explains Saluja. “The idea is to take the essence of something that’s everyday and mundane, from the streets, and make it infinitely interesting. Here, we’ve used the concept of overcoats and outer wear to create basics,” he adds. Subdued shades of brown, blue, rust and green bathe Saluja’s signature non-fussy and eclectic fusion of western and Indian shapes that comprises Essentials.

While Rishta is often branded as being conceptual and androgynous, Saluja shrugs off all labels with an emphatic: “Androgyny is a state of mind. It’s not just about a shirt or a pair of pants.” But he doesn’t deny that Essentials has a more approachable aesthetic that buyers will identify with.
With more and more designers toying with the idea of affordable and lucrative lines, Saluja also admits to being prompted by this “newer, younger market”.
“Initially, we pushed boundaries to make people understand the essence of the brand. Now, it’s time for us to see what we can offer in terms of diffusion or pret, and how we, as a design label, can also be part of this growing market,” he says. Free of seasonal restrictions, the Essentials line will be developed year-round, informs Saluja.

Ive questioned Grant Flower and the way he ran the team: KevinPietersenKevin Pietersen was dropped acrimoniously after England's 0-5 thrashing to Australia, earlier this year. (Source: AP)
Reuters | Posted: October 6, 2014 12:20 pm | Updated: October 6, 2014 6:40 pm
Dumped England batsman Kevin Pietersen has slammed his former team managers for allegedly allowing a culture of ‘bullying’ to develop and said coach Andy Flower and wicketkeeper Matt Prior were behind an orchestrated campaign to oust him.
In an interview with Britain’s Daily Telegraph newspaper on the launch of his autobiography, Pietersen also opened up about the ‘text-gate’ controversy over which he was dropped for exchanging disparaging messages with South Africa cricketers about former England captain Andrew Strauss.
Pietersen, 34, was sacked following the 5-0 Ashes defeat by Australia, with the governing body saying captain Alastair Cook needed to be able to trust and rely on the backing of all his players.
Pietersen, who was England’s highest run-scorer in the series and remains the fifth highest of all-time, alleged Prior and England’s bowlers “ran the dressing room” by intimidation and little was done to discourage it.
“Horrendous. Hugely disturbing,” the Telegraph quoted Pietersen on the paper’s website (www.telegraph.co.uk) late on Sunday, in reference to the alleged bullying.
“I brought it up … I brought it up on numerous occasions. I told Strauss about it, I told Cook about it. It was a huge thing.
“It was allowed to develop…. The bowlers were given so much power. They were doing really well. Swanny (former England spinner Graeme Swann) was winning game after game for us. Broady (England paceman Stuart Broad) was contributing. Jimmy (Anderson) was contributing.”
The England and Wales Cricket Board said it was “impossible” to comment.
“We have not had an opportunity to see the book yet as the publishers have declined to provide us with a copy before the official release date,” the ruling body said.
Pietersen also cited bowlers’ demands for apologies if players dropped catches or made fielding errors, and Prior shouting aggressively at fielders for mistakes.
“The thing that horrified me the most was when Andy Flower and Andrew Strauss in Bangalore before the one-day internationals said: ‘Guys we’ve got to stop this, it’s not right for the team, there are guys that have come to (us) that are intimidated to field the ball.’
“And they (the bowlers) had the audacity to stand there and say: ‘No, if they’ve (messed) up we deserve an apology.’ It’s the most angry I ever got in that dressing room. I thought, I reckon I could hit these guys.”
PERSONAL CLASHES
Pietersen detailed personal clashes with Flower, ranging from dressing room harmony to the presence of family on tour, and said the former Zimbabwe captain had long held a grudge against him.
On his exclusion from the team, Pietersen described it as a political power play between he and Prior which the batsman had lost when Flower sided with the wicketkeeper.
“(Prior’s) one bloke that quite a few (senior players) — I could count on more than one hand — have continued…
I told Strauss about it, I told Cook about it. It was a huge thing

Telugu actor Aadi Pudipeddi, who got engaged to software professional Aruna last week, will marry her here Dec 13. The match was fixed by their families.
“My engagement was a low-key affair. I didn’t even invite my friends from the industry. The marriage is set to take place Dec 13 in Hyderabad. It will be a big ceremony and I plan to invite everybody,” Aadi told IANS.
Talking about his fiancee, he said: “Aruna is from Rajahmundry and her parents work as lawyers. It was through my sister’s father-in-law this alliance was fixed.”
Aadi is currently awaiting the release of Telugu actioner ‘Rough’.

No Kidding: Monisha Jaising launches kidswear line  MJKidMumbai-based designer Monisha Jaising's label is synonymous with making the humble polo T-shirt a certified fashion statement and for giving the ubiquitous kurti an ultra glamourous makeover
Written by Kimi Dangor | Posted: October 6, 2014 12:19 pm
Her label is synonymous with making the humble polo T-shirt a certified fashion statement and for giving the ubiquitous kurti an ultra glamourous makeover. Mumbai-based designer Monisha Jaising now brings these trademark offering in teeny sizes, for luxury shoppers aged between two to seven years, in the form of her new kidswear line, MJ Kids.
Luxe polo tees and T-shirt dresses with crystal and stone motifs in the form of ballet slippers, cupcakes and puppies are currently on offer at her flagship store in Mumbai’s Bandra. Joining the line-up will be an array of silk Lucknowi kurtis, right in time for the festive season. “Luxury children’s wear is the fastest growing segment of the children’s wear and clothing market in developed/ developing nations,” says Jaising, who perceived the immense growth potential in the sector thanks to “rising income levels, trend towards nuclear families and parental desire to offer the best to their children”.
With the kidswear market exploding internationally, Jaising hopes to take it to the next level in India too. “Today, kids are treated as adults, exposed to branded apparel, fashion media, they travel internationally and there’s an enhanced awareness among peers — all factors that contribute to a growing fashion-consciousness,” she says.
And while the designer of uber-sexy resortwear and contemporary couture for adults is happy dealing with miniscule sizes and cheery colours, she hopes to keep the essence of the brand intact. “We do have a whole bunch of fashion-forward moms who want to dress up their children exactly the way they dress themselves. They are a reflection of who you are, so if you are someone highly stylised, then you want to make sure your kids are the best-dressed kids out there. It’s a ‘mini-me’ phenomenon,” says Jaising, who hopes to capitalise on this “feel-good factor”.

A taste of Telangana culture
Special Correspondent

Organised at Necklace Road, the Alai-Balai cultural festival showcased the region’s varied culture
It provided a window to Telangana traditions. The sprawling Jal Vihar on Necklace Road presented the typical rural ambience of Telangana as the ‘Alai-Balai’ cultural fete was organised on Sunday. On display were both the culture and cuisine of Telangana.
The picturesque spot turned cultural arena from early morning as artistes showcased a variety of tribal dances. Colourfully attired Banjara women cast a spell with their rhythmic movements. Yellow-turbaned youth belted out foot-tapping music, sweat rolling down their bodies as they played the drums. Yonder a group presented the tribal dance, sporting the head gear of wild buffalo horns.
Bare-bodied men had everyone awe-struck as they flagellated themselves with whips, even as a Muslim boy atop a camel kept waiving a green flag. Secunderabad MP Bandaru Dattatreya, the man behind the festival, also joined the dancers and tried to match their steps. Golatalu, sannai vaidam, gondola nrityam, dhimsa were some of the typical Telangana dances which regaled everyone.
The Telangana cuisine was a lip-smacking affair: there were 40 odd varieties of dishes. Nearly 100 cooks were busy preparing Telangana dishes right from Saturday evening. About 50 huge containers and as many bowls were used to cook the fare. All those who turned up were first treated to ragi ambali served in earthen pots.
The non-vegetarian items included thala kura, natu kodi, veda mamsam, mokka jonna garalu, chapala pulusu, egg pulusu, jawar roti, sarva pindi. This apart there was the usual, sambar, white rice, dal and bagara khana.

Thank you raj.please do give me your recos as and when you buy into so...975 Followers
Dear all Friends,
Firstl y I`mvery thankful to you all for having faith in me.Greatful to almighty to make me able to help others.When I see life around myself my eyes fills with tear.An emotion which is unexplained and unimaginely mixed.
At one hand I feel greatful to all mighty that I`m human being not anything else, I`m physically able, not anything else and I`m capable of looking after myself and in certain extent people around myself.Just thought of such philosophy makes me humble.Keeps me grounded.
On the other hand when I feel tired, exhausted, lack certain knowledge, lack certain capability , lack certain achievement or say lack certain physical,personal or materialistic thing which at times I am not able to achieve or fulfil despite my best effort I ask my lordship why???
Such a situation of helplessness and acknowledgement of limit of human capacity again keeps me grounded and humble.Hereby although I learn from books and various method but coming close to God has changed the way I live, the way my thought process is evolved.More than persistence of life now it has become a meaning of my existence.
In my though process it`s always there that I can`t guarantee what will happen next millisecond.Example just take it from MMB I donot know who I`l interact next day or minute on MMB.Such is the thing in life as well.Therefore I wonder HOW MUCH WE ARE LOST and keep on doing irrelevant thing.I think basic philosophy of path of god is to be dutiful, honest and become a GIVER, To be always innovative.Because if you don`t, god will take it back by one or other meaning.
ONE WHO GIVES ARE BLESSED.A BLESSED ONE IS AT PEACE.ONE CAN BE AT PEACE ONLY WHEN HE HAS ATTAINED SUPREME TRANQUILITY OF MIND,A STATE OF MEANINGFUL SELFLESSNESS.Only such life is happy and above all dear to god as well.
I`m at reasonable level peace as I am progressing towards and striving for full PEACE.This why I say to people that I don`t have competition with any one.I compete with myself to follow the path of almighty.
As per our own ancient teaching KARMA is PRADHAN.A GREAT KARMA is even GREATER than DHARMA.Our beloved god has said that if you donot know even ABC of life or spirituality JUST KEEP DOING YOUR KARMA and fullfill your OBLIGATIONS you will attain MOKSHA.Today I am trying to balance it.I`m sorry I`m away from the board a liitle bit but again I`ve a bit of obligation to complete my education and feed my family and look after my company affairs.So I`m trying to be there.Alhough I apologise not to be here all the time but I will try my best to help you all and guide.By doing so actually I favour myself.Because you all bless.NO ACHIEVEMENT IS GREATER THAN BEING BLESSED BY YOU ALL.It`s DIRECTKY PROPORTIONAL TO MY HAPPINESS.So I`m here for you all.
I FOLLOW YOU ALL WHO FOLLOWS ME.I think god has created us all equall.Now it is our KARMA where we are in relation to ther people or things.So mere mortal like me why discriminate.So I`m equally humble and respectful to you all and at least as reciprocal manner I follow you all.
I`m truly humbled by your love and respect.But in line with my policy I appeal to you all that no need for saying SIR.You love is enough.If you will simply say me "Raj" I will still be there for you with equal zeal.Respect dil se hoti hai.I`m much humbled and thankful to all again.
Now I am sorry I`m not with you due to prior commitment.Market is over heated.As I wrote earlier that prices have gone over the board it had jumped at least 200 to 600%.in some cases even 1000%.I do my analysis, I can say with full confidence that what has changed on ground NOTHING!!!
I`m a faint hearted person, grew up from middleclass boing a window shopping.Today I am capable of shop inside if not all but almost all shop.By being IRRESPONSIBLE and doing ERRATIC behaviour or by being AN ADDICT OF A,B or C things I donot want to lose privlage which almighty have provided to me albeit coupled with my hard work.So I am slow and only investing in reasonable stock which has not rallied yet.Doing a trading on other if I feel confident backed by own research.All you need is A COUPLE OF GOOD STOCK and WHOLE BUNCH OF PATIENCE.Yahan logoon ke paas paisa hai but patience nahee so they lose.I can`t afford to lose so I stay at "P for Patience side"
While I was writing this P I could recall my principle of 7P`s just thought I will share again with you all.
I say RAJ is not there where following 7P`s are not:
P................Peace of Mind

Sony Xperia Z3 review: The flagship upgradePrint
The Sony Xperia Z3 looks different from the Z2
Written by Nandagopal Rajan | New Delhi | Posted: September 25, 2014 2:55 pm | Updated: September 28, 2014 9:51 am
Sony has been really fast in refreshing its flagship this year, with the Xperia Z3 being announced within months of the Xperia Z2. I had spent a rather long time reviewing the Z2 and was really excited to try out the successor. The Z2 was really a top notch phone when it came to specs and it would be really hard to better that. Also, were we going to see big ticket improvements?
Specs: 5.2-inch (1920×1080 pixels) Full HD TRILUMINOS display | Snapdragon 2.5 GHz Qualcomm Quad-core processor with 3GB RAM | 16 GB storage with 128 GB external | 20.7MP rear camera, 2.1MP front | 3G, Bluetooth 4.0, DLNA, NFC, GLONASS | Nano sim
 
Design: The Z3 has Xperia written all over it as far as the design goes. But it is still very different from the earlier phones in the Z series. For one, it has curved edges and corners that are very unique and also very functional. The phone is easy to grip and feels good in your hand. Even the flaps on the phase curved, merging well with the design. The hinge that holds them in place look stronger than before. They are crucial for the Z3, for this phone too is water and dust proof. Everything else is pretty much, what you saw in the Z2.
Display: This is one of the better features of the phone, though almost the same as in the last version. The Full HD Triluminous does full justice to the 4K video you will shoot on this phone. Also, it works pretty well in sunlight and has good viewing angles. For anyone who has seen a new Sony TV, the display might feel like a smaller version. Afterall it is using the same technologies.
Performance: It is hard to find faults in the performance of this phone. It is among the most powerful phones you can buy at the moment and the performance reminds you of that almost every moment. You will not encounter any lag while using the phone and Sony sees to have fixed the heating issues. 4K video is a very resource intensive process and the Z3 seems to be able to do it well and without glitches. The camera all keeps showing that it might need to shut down if the camera heats up, but it does not need to take this drastic step like with the Z2. I can’t help but give maximum marks in performance.
Software: There is hardly any difference in software in comparison to the Z2, though there are some welcome tweaks. For instance, along with a screen shot you can also record the screen. Issues with the contacts app on the Z2 seems to have been solved. Like with its predecessor, the home continued…

Japan volcano victims leave photos of last momentsJapan volcano victims leave photos of last moments
AP
Mount Ontake, October 05, 2014
First Published: 19:13 IST(5/10/2014)

The victims include hiking enthusiasts from a major insurance company. Members of a group of nature lovers studying wild plants. A construction manager who snapped about 100 photos - found on his scratched and dented camera - to show his wife what she was missing because she had to work that day.
More than 50 people died when Mount Ontake, a popular hiking destination in central Japan, erupted without warning on Sept. 27 in the country's deadliest volcanic eruption since World War II.
Together, they paint a typical picture of weekend recreational hikers in Japan. A few children and senior citizens, but mostly middle-aged working people enjoying the first Saturday of the fall foliage season.
In this Saturday, Sept. 27, 2014 file photo taken by 59-year-old hiker Izumi Noguchi who fell victim to the eruption of Mount Ontake, and was offered to Kyodo News by his wife, Hiromi, AP photo 
Most were between 30 and 59 years old, and lived within a few hours' drive or train ride from the mountain. Three were children, and only five were 60 or older.
"The best season for the leaves just started, the weather was beautiful, it was the weekend, and it was lunchtime," said Masahito Ono, a Nagano prefecture tourism official.

Hiking has become one of Japan's most popular outdoor activities. The core fans are middle-aged climbers with some experience, but there are a growing number of beginners: health-conscious senior citizens and fashionable women who sport a casual "mountain girl" look. The number of hikers in Nagano surged to 730,000 last year, a 30 percent increase from five years ago.
With modest slopes and a ropeway that takes visitors part way up, 3,067-meter (10,062-foot) Mount Ontake is one of the easier climbs in the region, recommended as a day-trip for beginners. Several hundred people are believed to have been on the mountain when it erupted at 11:52 a.m.

Rescuers have found 51 bodies, and at least a dozen other people are still missing. Most of the bodies were found at the summit, with others on a trail a short way down.
Hideomi Takahashi, 41, was among nine climbers from a major Japanese insurance company, Sompo Japan Nipponkoa Holdings Inc. They worked at two branches near Tokyo. Only three survived.
At Takahashi's funeral on Thursday, his family showed a close friend an iPhone with at least six photos from what would be the last few minutes of his life: a cotton candy-like cloud floating next to the mountain in a clear blue sky, a sacred gate to a mountaintop shrine, some of his colleagues making their way up. The last photo, apparently shot by a colleague, shows Takahashi standing next to the "Mount Ontake summit" sign, giving a thumbs-up.
"When I saw the iPhone still worked, I thought it's like a miracle," said the friend Hiroyuki, who asked that only his first name be used after he was criticized online for posting some of the photos on Twitter. He has since taken the tweets down.
Takahashi seems happy in the final photo, but he's not quite smiling. "Maybe he saw signs of the eruption," Hiroyuki said, adding he has trouble accepting that his best friend died, leaving behind his wife and two children.
Construction company employee Izumi Noguchi, 59, was climbing alone, as his usual hiking companion, his wife, Hiromi, had to work, she told Japanese broadcaster NHK and other TV stations. His compact camera was banged up, but the memory chip inside was undamaged. She printed all 100 shots. The last one is of an enormous plume billowing from the crater behind a mountaintop lodge.

"This is an amazing photo. But I wish he had fled instead of taking pictures. I'd rather have him back," Hiromi said. "I hope to hike up there someday, perhaps 10 years later. I want to see what my husband saw."
Yasuo Ito, 54, didn't even have time to eat the lunch he packed.
His wife, also named Hiromi, told NHK that Ito, a prefecture-funded housing agency employee, was among six members from a nature conservation volunteer group. Only three survived.
She identified his body Thursday and received his ash-coated knapsack. She pulled out a lunchbox, which survived despite cracks on a side, then opened the top. His handmade egg salad sandwiches were untouched.
"Poor thing, he should have eaten this," she said. "He must be getting hungry by now."

We may be at the start of a commodity uptrendTweet
Jodie Gunzberg
When companies do well, they buy natural resources, says the Global Head of Commodities at S&P Dow Jones Indices
Jodie Gunzberg is responsible for managing S&P’s commodity indices, including the bellwether S&P GSCI, regarded as the leading measure of commodity price movements globally. In an interaction with The Hindu BusinessLine, she talks about why, after a six year lull, commodities may be back in action.
What has been the trend in global commodity markets in the last few years?
In the past few years, supply has outweighed demand, especially from 2008. When the global financial crisis hit, demand dropped off, so supply slowed to let the excess inventories draw down.
During this time, commodity performance was relatively weak. Finally, in 2013, commodities started to see shortages again. That continued through the second quarter of 2014 and performance made a comeback. However, since July, a combination of perfect weather for grains and fewer oil supply disruptions have built up inventories in several major commodities.
Precious metals have been down on decent retail sales in the US, but may strengthen, depending on Russia-Ukraine tensions. Also, gold, after having dropped significantly in the last one month, seems attractive to China for the mid-autumn festival and to India ahead of the Dhanteras and Diwali festivals in addition to the wedding season. Industrial metals is the only sector that has held strong, mainly from supply constraints and strategic stockpiles. Overall, the strengthening dollar has been a headwind for commodities, though much will depend on weather and supply disruptions, especially for commodities with sensitive inventories.
Do you think commodities will under-perform stock markets in the next one year?
This depends on a number of influences. If inflation materialises, interest rates rise and shortages persist, it is likely commodities will do relatively well. It also depends on where the commodity/equity cycle is and when the turning point may happen.
We have now seen six years straight of equity out-performance. As companies have raised capital, they may buy more natural resources to make their output grow further. This may increase demand for commodities and may be the beginning of the mid-cycle. Equities have historically led the cycle.
The economic revival in the US and Europe should help commodity prices revive, isn’t that so?
Stronger demand may help commodity prices, but again, there are other factors such as the strength of the dollar. Supply shocks also matter and when inventories are low, that may not only spike commodity prices but also drive down correlations down between commodities and other asset classes.
Will oil prices continue to fall?
Many factors may determine the future price of oil. Currently, oil is sensitive to slowing Chinese demand growth and euro zone manufacturing growth that may be further diminished by sanctions against Russia. Also, concerns have eased over supply disruptions from Libya and Iraq.
After rallying in the first few months of 2014, gold is now moving down. Where will prices go from here?
Gold historically acts like a combination of a commodity and a currency. Gold has suffered from the economic revival, strong stock market and stronger dollar.
Last time gold dropped as much in a year (in 1981) as it did in 2013, it took 25 years to recover.
What should a commodity investor watch out for?
There are two major opportunities to capture returns in commodities — cyclical opportunities and systematic opportunities. Trend-following systems can capture cyclical opportunities because only price can respond to supply and demand balance.
This is because commodities, in the short run, cannot be drilled and mined, causing relatively slow cycles of inventory building.
So when there is a supply/usage imbalance in a commodity market, its price trend may be persistent, which may be captured by trend-following programmes.
However, currently commodities are hovering at near equilibrium. Short-term disruptions can swing the pendulum quickly, leading to opportunities to bet on mean-reversion.
It is debatable whether the shortages that appeared in 2013 and the first half of 2014 are gone for good.  The inventory build-up may be temporary based on weather and geopolitics.
However, one must keep focus on longer-term factors such as the strength of the dollar, which is historically inverse to commodity prices, rising inflation, rising interest rates and demand forces coming from China and other parts of the world.

Cricket icon Sachin Tendulkar on Sunday accepted Prime Minister Narendra Modi's nomintaion as one of the 'ambassadors' of 'Swachh Bharat' campaign by sweeping a road in Mumbai with a broom in hand.
Tendulkar was one of the nine celebrities nominated by the Prime Minister to spread awareness on cleanliness when he kicked off his ambitious campaign on October 2 on the 145th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
"I have been entrusted the leadership role of 'Swachh Bharat' campaign by Shri Narendra Modi. So, I am here along with my team and will clean this area," Tendulkar said, while taking part in cleaning up the road with some youngsters.
"When all of us, including my friends got the information that I have received the leadership role, all my friends came together and said we will also lend our hand towards cleanliness and will try and keep India as clean as possible," said Tendulkar, who is also a Rajya Sabha member.
Post by Sachin Tendulkar .
Tendulkar, who retired from international cricket last year with a pile of records in his name, said it was just the start and the campaign can move forward with more participation.
"This is the start and we can move forward from here by doing better work. So, we are a team and we will try to work with all our heart to our part well," he said.

TOPICS
disaster and accident
Crews will use sonar, video cameras and jet fuel sensors to scour the seabed for the Boeing 777
The hunt for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 resumed Monday in a desolate stretch of the Indian Ocean, more than six months after the jet vanished.
The GO Phoenix, the first of three ships that will spend up to a year hunting for the wreckage far off Australia’s west coast, is expected to spend 12 days hunting for the jet before heading to shore to refuel.
Crews will use sonar, video cameras and jet fuel sensors to scour the seabed for the Boeing 777, which vanished for reasons unknown on March 8 during a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people on board.
The search has been on hold for four months so crews could map the seabed in the search zone, about 1,800 km west of Australia. The 60,000-square km search site lies along what is known as the “seventh arc” a stretch of ocean where investigators believe the aircraft ran out of fuel and crashed. Officials analyzed transmissions between the plane and a satellite to estimate where it entered the water.
Two other ships being provided by Dutch contractor Fugro are expected to join the Malaysian-contracted GO Phoenix later this month.
The ships will be dragging sonar devices called towfish through the water about 100 meters (330 feet) above the seabed to hunt for the wreckage. The towfish are also equipped with sensors that can detect the presence of jet fuel, and are expected to be able to cope with the dizzying depths of the search zone, which is 6.5 km deep in places.
If anything of interest is spotted on the sonar, crews will attach a video camera to the towfish to film the seabed.
Australian Transport Safety Bureau Chief Commissioner Martin Dolan, whose agency is leading the search, has expressed cautious optimism that the plane will eventually be found.
“We’re confident in the analysis and we’re confident that the aircraft is close to the seventh arc,” he said.

Richard Verma most qualified to be US Ambassador to India‘Richard Verma most qualified to be US Ambassador to India’
PTI
PTI File photo of Richard Rahul Verma, an Indian-American, with his wife Pinki Verma. President Barack Obama in September nominated Verma as the next US Ambassador to India.
Washington, Oct 6:  
(PTI) The nomination of Richard Rahul Verma as next US ambassador to India could be the catalyst to transform the Indo—US ties as he is the “most capable and qualified candidate” to head America’s diplomatic mission in New Delhi, former Obama administration officials have said.
Highly appreciative of Verma’s diplomatic skills, the officials including former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton believe that he brings to the table “a deep reservoir of experience” in every dimension of US national security policy.
In exclusive interviews to PTI, these top former Obama administration officials said Verma, who quietly played an important role in the Congressional passage of Civil Nuclear Deal while being at the Hill, has a vision for the Indo-US relationship.
Verma had advocated for strong Indo-US ties when in the Administration and recently had started a “India 2020” project at a top American-think tank — Center for American Progress.
Verma has been nominated by Obama purely on his capabilities and diplomatic skills and not has been rewarded for any political or fund raising activities, they said.
They hoped he would easily sail through the Senate confirmation process.
“Rich (Verma) is an inspired choice to be President Obama’s next ambassador to India. He knows, like the President knows, that our two nations are destined to be great partners,” ex-Deputy Secretary of Defence Ash Carter told PTI.
“But he also knows that destiny can and must be hastened by the hard work of gifted people like him on both sides. At a key moment in the (India-US) relationship, Rich Verma’s proven skill and dedication are just what is needed,” said Carter.
Carter as the Deputy Secretary of Defence was instrumental in the path breaking Defence Trade and Technology Initiative (DTTI), resulting in the two governments deciding on co-production and co-development of hi-tech military hardware.
“She (Hillary Clinton) is thrilled that he (Verma) has been nominated to be our next Ambassador to India,” said Nick Merrill, spokesperson of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
“The American and Indian people are fortunate to have such a skilled diplomat working to further deepen the partnership between our two countries,” Merrill said.
“Rich was an indispensable colleague of Secretary Clinton’s and of the entire Department of State,” he said.
Verma was the Assistant Secretary of State for Legislative Affairs at the US Department of State until March 2011.
“He has a deep understanding of foreign policy, a rich respect for the culture and history of countries, the trust of America’s highest leaders in both the Executive and Congressional Branches, and he knows how to get things done,” Merrill said.

Quartz Daily BriefEurope editionHong Kong protests persist  Brazils presidential run-off  HP plans split  GermanyGood morning, Quartz readers!
What to watch for today
Typhoon Phanfone disrupts Japan. Winds of up to 180 kmh (112 mph) are heading towards Tokyo , and have caused flight cancellations and the loss of power to thousands of homes. One US airman was killed after being washed out to sea from his post, and two others are missing.
Global number-crunching. Factory orders are due out from Germany, the US  Federal Reserve will begin publishing a new monthly index of US labor market conditions, and the Bank of Japan and the central banks of Portuguese-speaking countries will hold meetings.
Airstrikes against the Islamic State continue. The world awaits a response to the apparent beheading of Britain’s Alan Denny , a kidnapped aid worker in Syria, by IS jihadists. Among the targets of the US-led bombing campaign is a former French intelligence officer who has defected to Al Qaeda , and who reportedly survived a cruise missile attack against the Qaeda-allied Nusra Front.
Over the weekend
Hong Kong protests limped into their second week. The Hong Kong government let a dwindling number of protesters  remain in place  on Monday morning, after a small path was cleared to allow government workers to return to work. Officials and student protest leaders met for the first time on Sunday night, but the talks have not yielded any concrete results.
HP is splitting in two. The company plans to separate its PC and printer businesses from its hardware and services operations next year,  according to the Wall Street Journal  (paywall). The split could unleash another round of deal-making by tech companies, including the combination of the HP hardware business with data storage giant EMC.
Brazil got a step closer to its next president. Incumbent Dilma Rousseff won the most votes  in Sunday’s first-round election , and pro-business candidate Aécio Neves surged ahead of environmentalist challenger Marina Silva to finish second. A runoff between Rousseff and Neves will take place on October 26.
The World Bank was downbeat on China, cutting its 2014 growth forecast to 7.4% due to Beijing’s attempts to tackle local government debt, shadow banking, and pollution. The World Bank also projects China will only grow by 7.2% in 2015.
“Baby Doc” died. The brutal former dictator of Haiti, Jean-Claude Duvalier, died of a heart attack at age 63. He inherited the title of “president for life” from his father, “Papa Doc,” in 1971 at age 19, but his cruel reign was ended by an uprising in 1986.
Mexico discovered a mass grave. Authorities in Iguala, in Guerrero State, found several bodies near where students clashed with the police a week ago, which resulted in several deaths and dozens of missing students. The New York Times reported that many students were last seen being carried off by police officers.
Quartz obsession interlude
Kabir Chibber on some of the all-time best rants about doing business in France. “The history of French-bashing goes way back. The French writer and journalist Jules Huret visited Germany and wrote up his account in 1908. ‘There’s too much talking in your offices, large and small. We are always surprised when we go to Paris for work for all the time lost to ‘chatting.’” Read more here .

What’s stopping you from getting rich? Not bad luck, but faulty investing strategies

(If you really want to get…)
You are a diligent saver, a careful investor and a meticulous planner. Yet, you have not been able to build wealth even as everyone around you seems to be wallowing in money. What's stopping you from getting rich? If it's bad luck, you can buy one of those good fortune charms hawked on late night TV shows. But if you really want to get to the root of the problem, you need to assess where you are going wrong in your investments.
Our cover story this week is about the money myths and investing flaws that prevent you from getting rich. It could be the lure of penny stocks or the tantalising potential of the futures and options segment. Small investors often lose their shirts (and nearly everything else) when they enter these high-risk arenas without adequate knowledge.
But mistakes can happen even if you play ultra safe. If a fixed deposit offers 9%, the post-tax returns for someone in the 30% tax bracket will be barely 6.3%. That's not too bad until you factor in 8% inflation. So even though the investor does not feel it, his money is losing value. This is one of the biggest investing mistakes Indians make when they pour money into fixed deposits. In the following pages, we have listed the common hurdles that prevent investors from getting rich.
Many of these hurdles are really self made. They can be done away with by changing your approach to investing. Gold, for instance, should not occupy more than 5-10% allocation in your portfolio. This can happen if you treat the yellow metal less as an investment and more as a hedging tool.
There's no point in dwelling on mistakes unless we can offer a solution. So, each financial mistake has been followed by advice on how to avoid it. This stress on utility has been ET Wealth's hallmark since the time it was launched. In this 200th issue of the newspaper, we hope to live up to the expectations of our readers.
You might be losing your money in the following ways:

Prime Minister Narendra Modi Monday urged the Election Commission to look into Haryana government's approval of a land deal involving Sonia Gandhi's son-in-law Robert Vadra.
Addressing an election rally in Hisar Modi said, "They (Hooda government) know that after the elections,
the son-in-law (Vadra) will not get any clearances for illegal deals. So, in between the election process, they have dared to take such a decision,"
"I think Hooda was pressurised from the top (Congress leadership) to take such a decision," he added.

The Election Commission, the prime minister hoped, would take "serious note" of the state government's decision.  "I hope they will take appropriate action for any violation of the Model Code of Conduct," he said.
"Despite the model code being imposed for the state elections, chief minister Bhupinder Hooda cleared land deal for the 'damaad' ( Robert Vadra) yesterday. The EC should take serious note of this."
"They knew they cannot do anything after the polls, so that is why they approved the land sale deal in a hurry," he added.
Modi's attack on Vadra came on a day The Indian Express  reported that Hooda government officially legitimised the land deal between Vadra and real estate major DLF.
The land deal in Shikhopur village of Gurgaon had been cancelled by Haryana's former director general, Consolidation, Ashok Khemka.
"It is clear from this decision of the shameless Hooda government that both he and the Congress party have already accepted defeat in Haryana," Modi said in his speech.
The prime minister also launched a scathing attack on dynastic politics, saying Haryana had not seen a government in which political families had looked beyond themselves and their family members.
"We want to make Haryana free from this 'parivaar-vaad' (dynastic politics). In the last 25 years, have you seen a government in Haryana which worked for the welfare of people," he asked.
"In Haryana, the government works only for the chief minister and his family members. All political leaders have been running their shops in Haryana for themselves and their families," Modi said.
Modi also took a dig at jailed former chief minister Om Prakash Chautala's Indian National Lok Dal saying that he "did not need the support of people in jail" to succeed.
Referring to Chautala's statement at a recent rally that he  would take oath as the state chief minister from jail, Modi said, "Some people are spreading lies. Some are dreaming of taking oath from jail, showing old photos with them taken in a certain program."

Sonali Bendre goes for real look onTVSonali Bendre has donned kurtis with jeans and scarf.
Indo-Asian News Service | New Delhi | Posted: October 6, 2014 1:02 pm
Film actress Sonali Bendre, who is entering fiction space on television with ‘Ajeeb Daastaan Hain Ye’, has donned kurtis with jeans and scarf, instead of the quintessential over-the-top ethnic wear sported by most small screen stars. The actress says the choice of attire is to make her character look as real as possible.
In the Balaji Telefilms’s forthcoming show, which will go on air on Life OK, Sonali essays the role of Shobha, who is shown as a housewife first. She is later forced to work after her husband is put behind bars.
“She starts with saris, but Ekta had a clear vision. When she (my character) starts working, we wanted a shift of look. Wearing churidars (with kurtas) was again limiting. We wanted the character to look more practical,” said Sonali.
“She is a working woman and a single mom (after her husband is put behind bars). So, wearing those (heavy) saris would have been difficult. We wanted to give her something that’s quick to wear. We are trying to make it as real as we can, and wearing jeans with kurtis and scarf worked out,” she added.
The look is designed by a new talent named Anamika.
The ‘Sarfarosh’ star says western wear wouldn’t have gone with the character, and so they settled for fusion wear.
“I don’t think western wear would’ve gone with it. I wanted it to be believable. What my character wears is something that even I have seen on the road. This is probably more co-ordinated, but believable,” she said.
The show, which also features Apurva Agnihotri, will go on air Tuesday.

Typhoon carrying strong winds hits the MarianaIslandsPrint

A typhoon carrying strong winds and heavy rains passed over the Mariana Islands on Monday, with the eye of the storm skirting the small island of Rota.
Power outages and minor flooding were reported in some areas, but there were no immediate reports injuries or major damage.
The storm began moving through Guam and the other islands stretched across a swath of the Pacific before dawn Monday and left the region several hours later.

Tanya King, who was in Sinapalo, one of the population centers on Rota, said via Facebook messenger that she was without electricity and conditions remained very windy — sustained at about 75 mph — hours after the eye wall passed by. There also was minor flooding, she said. A friend of King’s, who lives near the ocean, had broken windows, “but all is well,” said King, 60.
It appeared the eye of Typhoon Vongfong had passed about 5 miles north of Rota, National Weather Service meteorologist Michael Ziobro said. The eye wall, which packs the strongest winds, probably passed over the island, he said.
Rota, which is about 10.5 miles long and 3 miles wide, has about 2,500 residents, according to the last census. Guam Gov. Eddie Calvo asked for prayers for residents there.
The weather service canceled a flash-flood watch for the islands around 8:30 a.m. Monday, as the storm shifted farther west. Light to moderate rain was expected to continue for several hours, with occasional downpours, but flooding wasn’t expected. But the agency warned that poor drainage could lead to some flooding.

Residents on Guam heeded warnings about high winds and flooding by taking shelter at designated public schools.
Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Jenna Gaminde said there were no reports from Guam of injuries from the storm.
As conditions improved in the early afternoon, Guam officials shut down continued…

Zest sedan adds punch to Tata Motors carsalesTata Motors has been pinning a lot of hope on new launches like the entry-level sedan Zest to turn around its dwindling fortunes in the domestic passenger vehicles market.
Mumbai | Posted: October 6, 2014 12:54 pm
Tata Motors has been pinning a lot of hope on new launches like the entry-level sedan Zest to turn around its dwindling fortunes in the domestic passenger vehicles market. And if the Zest’s August sales numbers are anything to go by, it seems to be on the right track.
Zest sold 2,671 units in August, according to data sourced exclusively from Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM). SIAM had not given out the first month sales numbers for the Zest publicly. To be sure, the Zest was launched on August 12 and therefore the sales numbers for that month are for only around 20 days.
The traction that Tata Motors’ passenger vehicles sales has gained from the Zest is evident from the fact that Zest sales constituted nearly a quarter of the 10,975 vehicles that the carmaker sold in August. The new launch helped the company improve its sales numbers over July, in which month it sold 9,167 vehicles.
Tata Motors’ dealers and analysts who track the company are witnessing significant demand for Zest and expect its sales to strengthen during the ongoing festive season. “The interest in Zest is picking up and we expect sales to pick up and reach 4,000-5,000 a month after Diwali,” said a dealer who owns Tata Motors showrooms in major Indian cities.
While Tata Motors will formally reveal the booking numbers for Zest in October, the company had tweeted in September that it had received over 10,000 orders from dealers across India for August and September.
Yashesh Mukhi, an auto sector analyst with Morgan Stanley, says the petrol variant of Zest has a waiting period of two to four months for delivery.
In the past too, new launches have worked in Tata Motors’ favour, at least in the early days. Within the first month of its launch in July 2009, Tata Motors’ hugely anticipated compact car Nano made a mark by contributing around 14.4% of the company’s monthly passenger vehicle sales. Tata Motors’ July 2009 sales went up 32% year-on-year to 17,191 vehicles. However, the success of Nano proved to be short-lived with customer interest failing to sustain after a while.
Analysts state that despite the slowdown in the economy that has adversely impacted demand for cars, new launches have helped certain carmakers do well. “New car models help customers come back to showrooms amid a slowdown,” says Puneet Gupta, associate director at IHS Automotive. “Usually, new models reach their peak volume in 6-12 months. If Tata Motors can sell 10,000 units of Zest in two months, it could be a decent start, but they can certainly deliver more.”
Besides Tata Motors, continued…

Election Commission should probe Congress govts clearance to Robert Vadra land deal: NarendraModiLet EC probe nod to Robert Vadra deal, says Narendra Modi

Narendra Modi addressing a rally.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday asked the Election Commission to take “serious note” of the Haryana government’s decision to clear a   land deal between Robert Vadra, son-in-law of Congress president Sonia Gandhi, and real estate firm DLF, saying it was done “during the election process.”
Addressing a poll rally in Hisar, Modi said, “They know that after the elections, the son-in-law (Vadra) will not get any clearances for illegal deals. So, in between the election process, they have dared to take such a decision.”

The Indian Express reported on Monday that the Congress government in Haryana, led by Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, has officially legitimised the land deal between Vadra and DLF. Earlier, Haryana’s former director general, Consolidation, Ashok Khemka, had cancelled the mutation of the land in Shikhopur village in Gurgaon.
“I think pressure was put on Hooda from the top (Congress leadership) to take such a decision… It is clear from this decision that both he and the Congress have already accepted defeat in Haryana,” said Modi. Stating that the EC must take note of the issue, he said, “I hope they will take appropriate action for any violation of the Model Code of Conduct.”
Responding to the attack, Hooda said: “The Haryana government has nothing to do with it (land deals). Whoever is saying this is misleading. If anybody can prove that even an inch of government land (was used) then I am ready to leave my post today. They can even appeal to the Lokayukta.”
Meanwhile, addressing another rally in Kurukshetra, Modi targeted INLD chief Om Prakash Chautala. “He doesn’t even trust his own sons. Despite being in jail, he is seeking votes, telling people that he will take oath from inside jail. He could have said that he has become old and people should give his sons a chance,” said Modi.
“I was thinking that somebody who is in Tihar jail should say that if given a chance, he will come out of jail and again work for the welfare of people. But instead, he says that he will take oath inside jail. This is absolutely shocking,” he said.
Criticising the INLD for claiming that it gave “unconditional support” to the BJP in the Lok Sabha elections because of Modi, he said: “I do not need support of people who are sitting in Tihar. I do not need such governance. I need the love of the people of Haryana. I request such politicians (INLD leaders) that they should not go to people showing my pictures and seeking votes.”
Targeting dynasty politics, while not taking any names, Modi said, “Whoever was in power in Haryana, his family dominated and occupied the entire state. Dynasties went forward, and Haryana got left behind… I am surprised that politicians dare to tell lies and mislead people in a land which belongs to Lord Krishna.”
Urging people to vote for the BJP, he said, “You need to decide if you want to get divided on the basis of caste or get united and change the fate of Haryana… If people of Haryana can form a stable government in Delhi, why not in Haryana?”
Targeting Congress leaders on the issue of corruption, Modi said: “We all watch Amitabh Bachchan host the show Kaun Banega Crorepati on television. But in Haryana, leaders are playing the game Kaun Banega Arabpati”.
Taking note of the poor sex ratio in Haryana, Modi said the issue would top the BJP’s agenda if voted to power. “Girls are being killed in the wombs of their mothers even before they are born. This is a matter of shame. Is this a civilised society? I can assure you all today that after coming to power, it shall be our top priority to ensure safety and security and utmost respect to all the women and girls.”

Sofia Vergara cares aboutex-fiancePress Trust of India | Los Angeles | Posted: October 6, 2014 12:52 pm

‘In for extreme temperature, sudden rain and droughts’

It is mainly because of the wind pressure that heavy rains lash particular areas, despite being in drought areas – B. N. Goswami, former director of Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology
Unlike last year’s monsoon, Telangana this year was witness to deficit rainfall. Sudden sporadic showers at different places were a common feature rather than uniform rainfall across the region. This pattern could well continue into the next year, says B. N. Goswami, former director of the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune.
Prof. Goswami spoke to YUNUS Y. LASANIA about the monsoon’s patterns over the last decade, and the trajectory it might take in the coming years.
What has been the monsoon’s trend in India over the last decade?
For the last 10-12 years, it is on a decreasing trend, as there have been more droughts during this period.
Telangana has received deficit rainfall this year. However, there have been sudden and heavy showers that resulted in all reservoirs filling up.
This is happening in certain pockets only. It is mainly because of the wind pressure that heavy rains lash particular areas, in spite of being in drought areas.
Is that the reason behind last year’s Uttarakhand floods and the recent one in Kashmir?
Yes. Extreme rainfall is happening in many places, but it is randomly distributed. And they can be further intensified due to interaction of the middle latitude and tropical areas. Jammu and Kashmir had a big wave (air) going north, so both the northern and southern air caused instability in the atmosphere, resulting in extreme rain.
What do you foresee in the coming 10 years? What effects do you see global warming having on the monsoon and temperature in India?
Due to global warming, extreme temperatures will go up and night temperatures may not come down. Similarly, day temperatures may rise. About the monsoons, we are going to see more extreme rainfall in many places and it is likely we will see more droughts. But I have a feeling the increasing monsoon trend may also return.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi today asked the Election Commission to take serious note of Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda clearing the land deal between Robert Vadra and DLF , alleging that it was done hastily as the Congress faced "certain defeat" in the October 15 Haryana Assembly polls.
"They (Hooda government) know that after the elections, the son-in-law (Vadra) will not get any clearances for illegal deals. So, in between the election process, they have dared to take such a decision," Modi said at an election rally.
"I think Hooda was pressurised from the top (Congress leadership) to take such a decision," he said. The Election Commission, the Prime Minister hoped, would take "serious note" of the state government's decision.
"I hope they will take appropriate action for any violation of the Model Code of Conduct," he said raking up the alleged land deal involving Sonia Gandhi's son-in-law.
The Hooda Government had reportedly legitimised the land deal while holding as illegal the order of the state's former Director General (Consolidation) Ashok Khemka who had cancelled the mutation of the land in Gurgaon.
"It is clear from this decision of the shameless Hooda government that both he and the Congress party have already accepted defeat in Haryana," Modi said.

PM Modi s magic still an expectation for marketsStory
The Lust-Love Conundrum
Any government with such high expectations from its capital market and business backers should have already been crucified for having done nothing in the past four months to make the bankers and industrial families happy.
(Photo: Reuters)
Ajit Dayal, Director, Quantum Advisors.
In August 2013, the Indian rupee was the worst currency to have owned in the Emerging Market universe and the Indian stock market was one of the worst places to be invested. Today, India is a darling destination of foreign money and for local punters, who are back in the game. Discussions on market movements are the "hot topic" at social gatherings and in office canteens.
The 50 per cent surge in the broader market and the 100 per cent surge in the highly risky mid-cap and small-cap indices can be attributed to two emotional factors. Firstly, there is a belief that the theft under the Congress regime is over. Secondly, there is a celebration of the historical mandate won by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on promises that he will usher in a new India.
Today, the Congress loss is a reality but the Modi magic is still an expectation. The movement of the BSE-30 Index [Sensex] from 17,500 to 22,000 should be characterised as a "thank god the Congress lost" celebration of the ouster of one of India's most dishonest and incompetent governments. But the surge of the market by a further 25 per cent is not due to any Modi Magic.
Any government with such high expectations from its capital market and business backers should have already been crucified for having done nothing in the past four months to make the bankers and industrial families happy. The budget gave no windfall tax breaks to companies or owners of capital, there seems to be no letting up of the pressure on the courts scrutiny of the coal blocks, the spectrum allocations-and even the gas price wars have not been resolved. The assorted crony capitalists that dot the legislative processes across the compromised Indian economic landscape seem perplexed on why there is no moolah coming their way.
The economy will go through a natural recovery but that natural recovery cannot justify an index above 22,000
Global events have helped propel share prices. The price of oil has tumbled, gold is still in a rut and even the smuggled price of gold has reportedly slipped. This has reduced India's import bill and the current account deficit.
Meanwhile, Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan has diligently built a war chest of US dollars to offset any sudden claims that may arise from NRI depositors or foreign portfolio investors booking profits from stock market or bond gains. India's fledgling capital markets may be rattled if the US Federal Reserve begins to raise interest rates and foreign investors stop buying (or, god forbid, start selling) Indian equities and bonds in their desire to own "safer" assets.
To move further - or even to maintain the levels it is at now - stock markets need to see growth in earnings to be closer to 20 per cent. This translates into an increase of over 40 per cent from the current rate of growth in earnings. Or it requires the crony capitalists to get their pound of flesh and extract the supra-normal profits they are so used to and boost the share prices of these large index-influencing companies.
So far, Prime Minister Modi has (rightfully!) been working on pleasing the 250 million Indians who have put their faith in him and not been working for the few industrial families seeking hand outs. Yes, the economy will go through a natural recovery but that natural recovery cannot justify an index above 22,000. In August, retail investors have - for the fifth time since 2005 - pumped in more than $1 billion into domestic equity mutual funds. On two occasions (March 2006 and May 2006) that was a good call from a one- and two-year investing perspective. On the more recent two occasions (August 2007, January 2008), that was a disastrous call.
Investors need to be more discerning. Hoping for a Modi miracle may be a reliable bet but banking on the cheerleaders of the financial services industry to give you honest and truthful advice is a risk akin to hoping that lust will turn into love.

BJP back-stabbed Balasaheb by snapping ties with Shiv Sena: Aditya ThackerayShiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray and Yuva Sena leader Aditya Thackeray during a rally in Mumbai on Saturday. (Source: PTI)
Press Trust of India | Nashik | Posted: October 5, 2014 3:26 pm | Updated: October 5, 2014 5:58 pm
Sharpening attack on erstwhile ally BJP, Shiv Sena on Sunday accused it of backstabbing late Sena supremo Bal Thackeray by snapping ties with his party over seat sharing in Maharashtra Assembly polls.
“BJP grew in Maharashtra by holding the hand of Shiv Sena. However, as soon as the party came to power at the Centre, it snapped ties with the Sena. By doing this, the BJP has back-stabbed late Balasaheb Thackeray,” Shiv Sena’s youth wing president Aditya Thackeray said here last night.
However, hours later, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he will not a utter a word against Shiv Sena during the campaign for the October 15 Maharashtra polls as a mark of respect to Bal Thackeray.
“This is the first election in absence of late Bal Thackeray, for whom I have great respect. I have decided not to utter a single word against Shiv Sena. This is my tribute to Balasaheb Thackeray,” Modi said at a rally in Tasgaon on the second day of his campaigning.
Balasaheb always considered Sena’s alliance partner BJP as a family, Aditya Thackeray said adding, “Nonetheless, the BJP parted ways with us over seat sharing.”
Aditya was speaking at an election rally held here for Shiv Sena candidates Ajay Boraste (Nashik-Central) and Chandrakant Lavate (Nashik-East).
Accusing the Congress and NCP of indulging in corruption and holding them responsible for the problems like load shedding in the state, Aditya asked people to defeat these parties.

Zubin Sharma Zubin Sharma is the founder of Project Potential
October 6, 2014
There’s a village called Dom Tola in Kishanganj district, Bihar, where Project Potential, the NGO I founded, is working. The Dom caste is responsible for cleaning up trash, dealing with dead humans and animals, and cleaning human waste. Meanwhile, while walking, I always encounter black, hairy pigs rolling in their own feces. The area is a flood zone, so children cannot reach their school.
Or at least that is one way of telling the story. But is there another story to be told?
There’s a village called Dom Tola in Kishanganj District, Bihar, where Project Potential, the NGO I founded, is working. The first person I meet whenever I go to Dom Tola is Tuntun Malik, whose firm handshake and white, toothy smile always gives me hope. Meanwhile, at Tuntun’s house, his mother and some of the neighbours are shaving slivers of bamboo stalks that they then weave into dust pans, fans, and other products. No matter what their economic struggles, they always insist that I take tea and snacks.
Both stories are true, and yet, the story we choose to tell has profound implications on how we understand and therefore interact with Dom Tola. The first seeks only to diagnose problems, and looks at a place at a moment in time. The second acknowledges challenges, but also seeks to tell the narrative with respect to the strengths of people in the village.
If we choose to tell only the first story, then the solutions we carve out will exclude the people in Dom Tola, since they will be seen as victims in need of saving. If we tell the second story, then it will be acknowledged while an outside catalyst may spur more development, our biggest resource in the process of creating change is the people themselves.
In the longer-term, the method we choose affects the community’s self-identity and understanding of their own capacities. If we choose the first story and method, then the community will internalize its helplessness; on the other hand, if we choose the second, then the community will become more resilient and growth itself will become more sustainable.
In Project Potential’s eyes, the second story is more valid. Everyone, no matter what age, religion, or caste, has some strength of head, heart, or hand that can be leveraged to reach shared goals. Our core competency is in identifying the right local people—we call them Village Visionaries—who can mobilize their communities to look beyond differences to work together for a better future.
In Dom Tola, we chose to tell the second story. Village Visionary Razia Sultana used Tuntun as an entry point into the village to start building relationships and trust. Spending time at each house, she began mapping physical assets and individual strengths of people in the village. Based on these assets and the goals professed by people in the village, Razia founded a women’s association.
The main goals that the women mentioned were to increase their own education, to educate their children, and to increase their income. From her asset mapping, Razia knew exactly who the literate people in the community were, so she trained a local girl with an 8th grade education to teach the women basic literacy.
The local school was inaccessible due to rain. So Razia used the village’s biggest strength—its numbers—to organize a meeting with local government. The result? A school was opened in a local community member’s house in the short-term and a commitment was made by the district magistrate to create a proper drainage system there once the rains stop.
Finally, in terms of economic empowerment, Razia has helped the women connect to larger markets so that they can use their skill to earn more money from their bamboo products. She also taught and helped them get job cards so that they are now guaranteed up to 100 days of work via the Indian government’s MNREGA scheme.
Why did these developments not happen organically? One reason is that community members may lack the right relationships, connections, and knowledge. They may not have connections to these larger markets, and they may also not know about how to avail government schemes. Not having this knowledge, they may have tried and failed in the past, which may prevent people from trying again.
Yet, I’d argue that a reason that is just as important, if not more so, is the story that is told about a place. People in Dom Tola have been told the first story mentioned above by government, other NGOs, and the community at large: “You are poor Dom caste people, and therefore you need help.” As a result, the community begins suffering from what psychologists call “ learned helplessness ,” where they may not even take advantage of available opportunities, feeling that nothing will be able to change their situation.
On the other hand, when an organization or catalyst fundamentally believes that everyone, even those who are currently suffering, brings something to the table, then the outcome is completely different. People begin using their strengths in concert with one another to bring about a better shared future.
The result? People working together to achieve their goals using existing resources. When the resources within the community are insufficient, then they have the bargaining power and the right relationships needed to work with service providers who can meet their needs.
The next time you engage in a community development project, do not start by asking the community what’s wrong with their lives. Instead, start by asking what’s right and how that can be leveraged for change.

Sena takes a jibe on Modis tribute to Bal ThackeraySena takes a jibe on Modi’s tribute to Bal Thackeray
PTI
Tweet
Mumbai, Oct 6:  
The Shiv Sena today launched a blistering attack on the BJP, blaming it for the end of their 25-year-old alliance and questioned Narendra Modi’s ’new-found’ respect for Bal Thackeray after the PM refrained from criticising the former ally at a poll rally in Maharashtra as a tribute to the late patriarch.
“Modi says that he will not attack the Sena in his speeches as he has respect for Balasaheb Thackeray. We too respect the PM.
“But when you back-stabbed us merely on the issue of seat sharing, where did that respect disappear then? Did you not think of Balasaheb before breaking the alliance forged on the principles of Hindutva,” the Sena said in its editorial mouthpiece ‘Saamana’
The Prime Minister while campaigning at Tasgaon in Sangli district yesterday had said that he would “not utter a single word” against the Sena out of his respect for Bal Thackeray.
“Political pundits are saying why is Modi not criticising Shiv Sena in his speeches (during poll campaign). This is the first election in absence of late Bal Thackeray, for whom I have great respect. I have decided not to utter a single word against Shiv Sena. This is my tribute to Balasaheb Thackeray,” Modi had said.
Equating the BJP with the “corrupt” Congress and the NCP, the Sena said that people in Maharashtra have now realized who are the “real and hidden” thieves of the state.
“It is a known fact that the Congress and the NCP have looted Maharashtra. But for what purpose did the CM of Gujarat Anandiben Patel visit Maharashtra? If she asks all the industrialists to set base in Gujarat, leaving Maharashtra behind, this too amounts to looting Maharashtra,” the editorial said.
“How do you define keeping an eye on the coffers of the state and making a deal of Mumbai (for the benefit of Gujarat)? Is this not looting Maharashtra? And then talking about the blessings of Shivaji Maharaj is nothing but a farce,” it said.
“Never before has anyone opened a market of Shivaji Maharaj’s blessings,” the Sena added.

Maharashtra polls: Prithviraj Chavan faces formidable party rebel in Karad11
0
Karad South (Maharashtra): An embattled former Maharashtra chief minister Prithviraj Chavan, who is contesting his maiden Assembly election in what appears to be a fight for political survival, is facing a formidable party rebel as an adversary in this traditional Congress bastion in Satara district.
Chavan's rival, 79-year-old Vilasrao Undalkar, has won this seat as Congress candidate for seven consecutive terms, holding his sway over voters for 35 years.
He raised a banner of revolt against the party and filed nomination as an independent when Chavan, who too hails from Karad, decided to enter the fray to fight his first Assembly election as he has been an MP and central minister before taking over reins of the state in 2011.
Chavan's rival, 79-year-old Vilasrao Undalkar, has won this seat as Congress candidate for seven consecutive terms.
#maharashtra assembly elections 2014 #maharashtra #prithviraj chavan #congress
Interestingly, the two have contrasting personalities. Undalkar, fondly called "Kaka" in the region, is a far cry from the high profile Prithviraj Chavan who is considered a meticulous technocrat and an academician who has studied in the US.
A simple dhoti-kurta clad man, Kaka does not even carry a pen or a mobile but knows people and party workers by their first names, say his supporters who also cite a perceived lack of connectivity of Chavan as his handicap.
However, Chavan, Congress sources point out, has carefully cultivated this constituency during his tenure as Chief Minister, pumping in funds to the tune of Rs 1800 crore to undertake developmental work which includes airport for Karad, a four-lane road network and creation of a police housing colony.
"The clean image of Chavan and the thrust on development of Karad---represented in the Lok Sabha by his father Anandrao, mother Premalatai and himself for four decades----are the factors that put former chief minister ahead of his seasoned rival in the race," they claim.
Just around the time of filing of nominations, the BJP managed to bring to its fold Atul Bhosale of Congress who too comes from a family which has a political heritage in the region along with a network of cooperatives and educational institutions.

Glad to see character actors getting lead roles: BomanIraniBoman Irani: I am so glad that 'Finding Fanny' found a great audience. I am very proud.
Indo-Asian News Service | New Delhi | Posted: October 6, 2014 1:12 pm | Updated: October 6, 2014 1:15 pm
At an age when most Bollywood actors end up with “itsy bitsy” roles, Boman Irani is getting to play strong and sensible characters and pitches for Indian cinema exploring such films where such actors get equal prominence – as in the recently-released ‘Finding Fanny’.
“I think there are many situations where character actors are getting equal prominence like main leads, but eventually it is the kind of cinema that has to be explored. ‘Finding Fanny’ is a great example of the same,” the 54-year-old told IANS in an interview.
Directed by Homi Adajania, the English language Bollywood entertainer ‘Finding Fanny’ had Arjun Kapoor and Deepika Padukone as the lead pair, but the film’s USP was veteran actors – Dimple Kapadia, Naseeruddin Shah, and Pankaj Kapur – in key roles.

“I am so glad that ‘Finding Fanny’ found a great audience. I am very proud,” said Boman, who began his acting career pretty late, but he was lucky to get meaty and memorable roles soon enough.
He started his film career in 2001 with ‘Everybody Says I’m Fine!’, but proved his mettle as J.C. Asthana in Rajkumar Hirani’s 2003 hit comedy ‘Munnabhai M.B.B.S’. There was no looking back for him after that.
He followed it up with ‘Being Cyrus’, ‘Lage Raho Munna Bhai’, ‘Khosla Ka Ghosla’, ‘Don – The Chase Begins Again’ and ’3 Idiots’.
The actor admits that in the past, there were films that had put the spotlight on senior actors and proved to do well.

“I think ‘Khosla Ka Ghosla’ was a good example where the title role was played by Anupam Kher. There have been many examples in the past too,” he said, stressing that an artiste’s age is of little significance.
“I feel it is not about characters, but more about the story. It is eventually the story that we are telling and then everything comes under play. We have to come up with a great story,” added the actor who is geared up for his next release ‘Happy New Year’.
Directed by Farah Khan and produced by Shah Rukh Khan’s Red Chillies Entertainment, the film is centred on six losers who set out to change their destiny.
Other actors who will be seen in the film include Deepika, Abhishek Bachchan, Sonu Sood, and Vivaan Shah along with Shah Rukh himself.
‘Happy New Year’ is set for a Diwali release.

Bangalore CCB arrest three smugglers  recover idols worth Rs 32croreWritten by Santosh Kumar R B | Posted: October 6, 2014 1:11 pm
The Central Crime Branch (CCB) sleuths have bust an international idol smuggling racket on Saturday by arresting three persons and recovered three idols belonging to the Chola period. It is estimated that the idols are worth Rs. 32 crore in the international market and police have approached archeological experts for valuing the price of the idols.
The arrested have been identified as Ravi Sharma, 50, a native of Chandrapur in Maharashtra, Pundalik Yellappa Kalbant, 28, and Sudhir Sham Shetty, 38, both native of Belgaum.
According to the police, they had received a tip off that the three had come to the city to meet a potential foreign customer. Based on this information, a police team went near Dhanvantri Ayurvedic Hospital near Majestic, where the accused were meeting their customer. After talks, the trio were set to leave in their car. Meanwhile, the police team surrounded them and arrested them. Three ancient Panchaloha idols were found in their possession.
“The recovered idols belong to the Chola period. Panchaloha idols of two temple dancers and one dancing Shiva have been seized from them. It is estimated that these idols are worth Rs. 32 crore in the international market. We are questioning the accused about how they managed to get the idols and with whom they are dealing,” Joint Commissioner of Police (Crime) Hemant Nimbalkar said, adding that the Archaeological Survey of India will determine the exact age and lineage, he added.
A case is registered in Upparpet police station in this connection. Further investigations are on.

Moneycontrol Bureau
The CII Business Confidence Index (CIIBCI) for July- September 2014 quarter climbed to a three-year high of 57.4, on the back of political stability and improving macro-economic environment.
The reading is based on a survey of more than 150 firm of varying sizes, the CII release said. Majority of the respondents (43.7 per cent) belonged to large-scale firms, while 12.6 per cent were from medium-scale firms and 37.8 per cent and 5.9 per cent each were from small-scale and micro firms, respectively.
"The continued uptrend in BCI sends out green signals in terms of economic recovery," said the CII release, adding, "however, it should also be approached with a bit of cautious optimism as the downside risks to growth persist, given that the new government is still in its formative years and significant policy reforms are yet to be taken to ensure sustained pick-up in domestic economic activity"
Following are the findings of the survey:
* GDP expected in a range of 5.0-5.5 per cent in 2014-15; WPI inflation expected to moderate in 5.5-6.5 per cent in the current fiscal.
* Current Account Deficit seen less than 2.5 per cent of GDP in the current fiscal.
* Exchange rate seen around Rs 59-61 per US dollar in 2014-15.
* Capacity utilization expected to improve in 2QFY15 as compared to the previous quarter.
 
* Investment plans expected to decline or remain same in 2QFY15 due to surplus capacity available in the economy.
* Majority of the respondents expect increase in profit before tax led by increase in new order / sales and moderation in expenditure.
* Majority of the respondents expect increase in exports.
* Slow pick up in global demand and high inflation emerge as major threats

JSW Steel in talks to buy London Mining: Sources

JSW Steel in talks to buy London Mining: Sources
London Mining, which has been hit by a falling iron ore price and the Ebola crisis that has gripped the region, would come "cheap" given its market value of USD 10 million, one of the sources said, adding the deal would help JSW meet some of its demand for steelmaking ingredient iron ore.
Post your opinion here
 
JSW Steel Ltd , India's third-largest steelmaker, is in talks to buy Sierra Leone-focused iron ore miner London Mining Plc, two people with knowledge of the matter said.
The news, confirming a weekend report in Britain's Sunday Times newspaper, sent shares in AIM-listed London Mining up almost 18 percent in early trading on Monday.
London Mining, which has been hit by a falling iron ore price and the Ebola crisis that has gripped the region, would come "cheap" given its market value of USD 10 million, one of the sources said, adding the deal would help JSW meet some of its demand for steelmaking ingredient iron ore.
Action against illegal mining in India has led to a sharp fall in domestic iron ore output, forcing JSW to import heavily. It plans to ship in 10 million tonnes of iron ore this fiscal year ending March 31.
"Talks (with London Mining) have been going on for many months. JSW people have visited them also," said the source, who declined to be named as the information is not yet public.
Debt-laden London Mining said last week it was in talks with a potential investor for funds, but the funding would take a number of weeks to implement.
Like other junior iron ore miners, London Mining is battling record low prices for the steelmaking raw material in the face of stagnant demand from the world's top consumer, China, and oversupply from the biggest players in the industry.
A JSW spokesman did not immediately reply to a request for comment. London Mining was not immediately available for comment. JSW is controlled by billionaire Sajjan Jindal.
JSW Steel stock price
On November 24, 2014, JSW Steel closed at Rs 1221.70, up Rs 32.60, or 2.74 percent. The 52-week high of the share was Rs 1365.35 and the 52-week low was Rs 805.00.
The company's trailing 12-month (TTM) EPS was at Rs 124.82 per share as per the quarter ended September 2014. The stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio was 9.79. The latest book value of the company is Rs 970.48 per share. At current value, the price-to-book value of the company is 1.26.

It is the same group which would lick wounds when it goes down even 50% from their avg price and still wouldn`t sell thinking the share would up in next quarter.

Greetings  balance sheet has two sides %u2013one liability and another...Dear Suheelan
Namaste!
Thank you for your reply to my query. I observed the following in annual report of Sakthi Finance:
1. Sales turnover increased only by a margin of 8% from Previous Year (PY). You said that stock in hire has increased to 75,035 which actually constitute life of such business. But here I noticed that stock in hire which falls due within 1 year is 34,655 Lakhs and stock which falls due after 1 year is only 40,379. The turnover might increase during next year, but what about years after that? The rate of increase in sales turnover is just 10% to 15% in preceeding 5 years.
2. Long term debt has increased by 11,639 and short term debts have decreased by 9,152 Lakhs. Here, even if we assume that Long term debt was used for Long term stock in hire, then where has the remaining long term debt been used? Obviously remaining 5,880 lakhs was used to repay short term debt which is actually wrong. Also we must notice that new Fixed assets of substantial amount are not purchased. But windmill accounting to 10% of total fixed assets are sold. There are chances that the sale proceeds from this are used to repay short term debt. Income generated from windmill constitutes a substantial amount for the company. If they had really used long term debt to pay short term debt, then the company might face a severe financial crisis at the time when long term debts become due. Also we must keep in mind that Reserves and surplus increased by mere 5%.
3. Legal and professional charges have increased by 53%. They have not provided for any contingent liability. The question which arises in my mind is, whether the company is facing any law suits?
These were my viewpoint. Let me know if I am wrong.
Thanks

Taxpayers  millions lure conventions to McCormick Place  RosemontOver the past three years, $26.5 million from Illinois taxpayers has been spent to lure shows to McCormick Place.  |  Sun-Times file photo
The Watchdogs: Millions in taxpayer subsidies to lure conventions
Tue, 08/12/2014 - 12:01am
@tnovaksuntimes | Email
When conventions and trade shows threaten to leave McCormick Place or Rosemont for Orlando, Las Vegas or elsewhere, officials at the lakefront and suburban convention centers have a carrot to offer to keep those shows here:
A pot of taxpayer money they guard so tightly they’ve tried to keep secret how it’s spent, the Chicago Sun-Times has found.
Over the past three years, $26.5 million from Illinois taxpayers has been spent to lure the International Housewares Association’s trade show, the Radiological Society of North America convention and 79 other shows to McCormick Place under an obscure provision of a 2010 law passed to save Chicago’s convention industry by lowering the cost of union labor, records show.
Another $10 million has gone to Rosemont, which uses the money to subsidize dozens of events at its village-owned convention center — including several editions of the International Gem & Jewelry Show — as well as to repair its parking garage and pay off debt.
Despite the financial crisis Illinois government faces, the law calls for the convention centers to get as much as $20 million a year in subsidies — $15 million to McCormick Place and $5 million to Rosemont — in perpetuity.
The Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority — the government agency known as McPier that oversees McCormick Place and Navy Pier — and Rosemont both denied requests made under the Illinois Freedom of Information Act seeking lists of the subsidies individual conventions got. They said revealing that information might anger the organizers of conventions that didn’t get any money and might help other cities lure away conventions that now come here.
The Sun-Times obtained the information from Illinois Comptroller Judy Baar Topinka, whose office handles payments of the convention incentive funds.
Shows don’t directly get that money. Instead, McCormick Place and Rosemont tap the state money to reduce the rent they charge to show organizers.
That’s “standard pricing practice among all of our competitors when they are negotiating with customers or potential customers,” according to McPier officials, who also use the money to offset the costs of busing conventioneers between hotels and McCormick Place.
The subsidies amount to only a fraction of more than $230 million the taxpayer-underwritten shows have generated in hotel, sales and other taxes, according to McPier and Rosemont officials — in addition to the money conventioneers spend at restaurants and tourist attractions.
“An empty convention center does no good to the people of Rosemont, the people of Chicago or the people of the state of Illinois,” says Christopher Stephens, executive director of Rosemont’s Donald E. Stephens Convention Center, named for his late grandfather, the suburb’s first mayor. “The ability to have these funds available to attract conventions and trade shows is a big deal.”
McPier and Rosemont officials say the subsidies have helped thwart other cities’ efforts to poach events, among them the National Restaurant Association convention, which has gotten a total of $2.5 million in subsidies for shows at McCormick Place in the past three years.
McPier also has awarded a total of $3.8 million in subsidies for three International Housewares Association shows. The largest of those — nearly $2 million — came in March 2012, when the housewares group had threatened to move its show to Orlando, according to records McPier gave the state. About 60,000 people attended that convention, providing an $84 million boost to the economy, including $5.8 million in taxes, McPier reported.
 
 
“This is a far more generous — and far more outrageous — use of general revenue funds than I have seen in other places, but everybody does it,” says Heywood T. Sanders, a University of Texas at San Antonio professor and author of the book "Convention Center Follies." "Everyone is competing themselves into the ground."
McPier officials won’t say what percentage of conventions held at McCormick Place get subsidies. They say they don’t spend the money on shows that draw local crowds, such as the Chicago Auto Show and the Chicago Boat Show, or on events that draw fewer than 5,000 people.
In Rosemont, the International Gem & Jewelry Show has gotten eight of the 23 subsidies handed out between January 2011 and December 2013 — a total of $460,000 — to keep the show. 
The subsidies were written into the 2010 law crafted to reduce labor costs at McCormick Place, which had been losing convention business to cities with cheaper labor. The law also paved the way for McCormick Place to be run by a private contractor, SMG Worldwide, and for Navy Pier’s entire operation to be turned over to a not-for-profit organization, Navy Pier Inc., which refuses to disclose how it spends public money at the government-owned tourist attraction.
Rosemont Mayor Bradley Stephens, whose nephew runs the suburb’s convention center, persuaded state legislators to cut Rosemont in on the subsidies.
“There was $20 million all going to McPier,” Stephens says. “I said, ‘Wait a minute, why can’t we be included in that?’ ”
Last year, Stephens convinced lawmakers to amend the law to also allow Rosemont to use the state money to finance convention center-related construction projects and pay off debt. Of the $10 million Rosemont has gotten so far, it has spent $3.7 million to subsidize shows, $2.6 million to repair the convention center’s parking garage and $872,168 to pay off bonds.

Draghi gives Europe 1 trillion eurosDraghi gives Europe 1 trillion euros
By Mark Thompson   @MarkThompsonCNN October 2, 2014: 11:16 AM ET
Anti-austerity protesters clashed with riot police outside the European Central Bank meeting in Naples, Italy.
LONDON (CNNMoney)
Mario Draghi threw one trillion euros at Europe's faltering economy Thursday and told people to stop blaming the central bank for the hardship they feel.
The president of the European Central Bank was unveiling details of a program that is aimed at stimulating the economy by getting banks to lend more to European companies and consumers.
Loans and mortgages worth as much as one trillion euros ($1.3 trillion) -- including some junk-rated assets from Greece and Cyprus -- qualify as assets that will be purchased by the ECB over two years. There are conditions attached and no guarantee that the central bank will buy them all.
The stimulus measures were announced in early September, alongside the bank's second interest rate cut this year. The ECB will start buying some of the assets later this month.
The ECB has taken a series of bold policy steps into uncharted territory this year, driven by concern that current very low inflation may turn into a vicious circle of falling prices and economic stagnation similar to the fate Japan suffered in the 1990s.
But the outlook has worsened still further in recent weeks, with inflation across the eurozone falling to just 0.3% in September.
Related: Risk of third German recession pressures Europe
Unemployment has been stuck at 11.5% for the past three months, and survey data suggests Germany, Europe's biggest economy, may slip into a third recession since the financial crisis. Italy's economy is shrinking again, and France has managed just three quarters of growth in the last nine.
That has prompted more calls for the ECB to go all in with a U.S. Federal Reserve-style program to buy government bonds, or full-blown quantitative easing (QE).
Thousands of people protested against austerity outside the ECB meeting, held Thursday in the Italian city of Naples.
Draghi said he understood why people were angry, given years of recession and high unemployment. But he said their criticism of the ECB was misdirected.
"I find the description of the ECB as the guilty actor here needs to be corrected," Draghi told reporters, listing the "unprecedented" measures the bank has taken.
He repeated a pledge that the bank would use further "unconventional instruments" if necessary -- seen as code for QE -- to get the economy moving again.
He also took a thinly veiled swipe at some European governments for failing to step up. He said monetary policy needed to be accompanied by greater commitment to reform their economies, a remark analysts said was aimed particularly at Italy and France.
"We know that our measures are going to be more effective, or may be effective only if other policies are in place," Draghi said. "Each actor has its role to perform."

This is why Hong Kong protests matterThis is why Hong Kong matters
By Charles Riley   @CRrileyCNN October 3, 2014: 8:20 AM ET
 
Protests spread to Hong Kong's luxury district
HONG KONG (CNNMoney)
It's an extraordinary scene: Tens of thousands of people pouring into the streets of a Chinese city, demanding the right to elect a leader of their choosing.
Yet that's what happened this week in Hong Kong -- a former British colony that rose to prominence as a trade hub and gateway to China.
Since it was returned to Beijing in 1997, the territory has been ruled under the principle of "one country, two systems," transforming itself along the way into a global financial hub.
Many Hong Kongers hope Beijing will drop a proposal to screen all candidates for the city's top office. Protesters and Hong Kong officials are due to meet for talks soon.
But what's so special about this city that is often ranked as one of the best places to do business? And why does the standoff matter to the world economy?
Massive market
The city's stock exchange is the second biggest in Asia after Tokyo. The companies listed on its main board are worth a whopping $3.1 trillion.
While that's a lot of money, even more important is the role the market plays in allowing companies from mainland China to raise cash, matching them up with foreign investors who want to profit from the world's second biggest economy.
Last year, those companies raised $45.3 billion in Hong Kong, including 45 separate IPOs. And despite the trail blazed by Alibaba ( BABA , Tech30 ) to New York last month, Hong Kong remains the only place where that exchange happens regularly on a large scale.
A trading titan
Hong Kong has only 7 million residents, but is ranked 10th in the world in terms of exports. That's 2.7% of the world's total export trade -- not shabby for a territory that covers an area slightly larger than New York's five boroughs.
The city's massive container port is always humming, and countries with half the world's population are within five hours' flying time.
Investment gateway
As the chart above shows, Hong Kong's star has dimmed over the past two decades when compared to the rapid growth that turned China into a global power.
Hong Kong's real significance these days is in the services and stability it offers multinational companies and China itself.
China is the world's second largest recipient of foreign direct investment, and nearly two-thirds of that flows through Hong Kong.
Related: Hong Kong teacher travels 3,000 miles to fight for democracy
One major selling point is Hong Kong's ironclad rule of law and its independent judiciary. Businesses place an enormous amount of faith in the city's ability to resolve disputes fairly. They have no such faith in China's courts.
Hong Kong also plays a valuable role in China's efforts to promote the yuan as a trusted -- and traded -- currency. The city has a thriving market, for example, for bonds denominated in yuan.
Mistrust of Beijing
Despite the close ties between the kissing cousins, more than 56% of Hong Kong residents have lost confidence in the "one country, two systems" arrangement that provides the basis for Beijing rule. As recently as 2007, nearly 80% of residents said they were confident in the deal struck between China and the U.K.
The issue drawing most attention at present is the procedure for selecting Hong Kong's chief executive. But there are other signs of fissure: Many Hong Kong residents are upset over rising property prices fueled by mainland buyers, and their consumption of social services.
If relations were to become even more strained, Hong Kong and China will pay a high price.

Narendra Modi delivers first radio addressPM Narendra Modi delivers first radio address
Rupam Jain Nair     New Delhi   Last Updated: October 3, 2014  | 18:02 IST
Prime Minister Narendra Modi (Reuters)
Prime Minister Narendra Modi delivered on Friday the first of many radio addresses he plans to make to mobilise support among ordinary people for his agenda of change.
Modi used his maiden address to urge hundreds of millions of countrymen, many of whom have no access to television, to do their part to help get India's economy moving.
A day earlier, Modi launched a campaign to clean up India's towns and villages that he has said were an embarrassment and an impediment to tourism.
 
"A lot of us think that it is the government's responsibility to do everything if we want to develop, then 1.2 billion will have to work towards it," he said in the radio show titled "Mann ki Baat", or "Talking from the Heart".
Modi, who came to power in May, plans to make his radio speeches at least every month on Sunday mornings to get his message across to two thirds of India's 1.2 billion people who listen regularly to the radio.
His speeches will be translated in 24 local languages.
Blessed with charisma and able to speak in the language of the common man, Modi has adopted a more personalised style of leadership role to bring focus to uncomfortable issues that past governments have often avoided.
He has spoken about the lack of toilets in a country where half the population defecates in the open, putting people at risk of cholera, diarrhoea, dysentery, hepatitis A and typhoid.
During Friday's 14 minute address, Modi narrated two short stories with the aim of encouraging people to keep the country clean, buy locally produced handspun khadi fabric popularised by independence leader Mahatma Gandhi, and help children with special needs.
"We have to recognise our internal strength. We all have to march ahead with self-confidence, create our own identity and attain success for oneself and the nation," he said.
Modi has used Facebook and Twitter, where he has about 6.4 million followers, to bypass traditional news media and communicate his thoughts.

Daimler  Renault-Nissan Extend Manufacturing AllianceEssar Steel Raises $1 Billion to Dollarise Balance Sheet
Paris: Daimler and Renault-Nissan said on Friday they would extend a manufacturing alliance to include engines and gearboxes.
Daimler and Renault said in a joint press release that the partnership would include an agreement for Renault to supply Daimler with a 1.5 litre four cylinder diesel engine for use in its Mercedes-Benz C-Class.
Mercedes in turn will supply its 2 litre four cylinder gasoline engine for use by Nissan's premium brand Infiniti.
Nissan has been granted a licence to make Daimler's 9-speed automatic transmission for use in Infiniti vehicles.
"This relationship is in its fifth year. Progress has gone well beyond our initial expectations," Renault-Nissan chief executive Carlos Ghosn said at a joint press conference.

HTC Q3 Profit Beats Estimates as Cost Cuts Offset Weak Sales
Reuters | Updated On: October 03, 2014 23:26 (IST)
Essar Steel Raises $1 Billion to Dollarise Balance Sheet
Taipei: Taiwanese smartphone maker HTC Corp swung to better-than-expected profit in the third quarter from a heavy loss a year earlier as cost cuts helped it offset the impact of still-sluggish sales.
HTC said on Friday it earned 640 million Taiwanese dollars ($21 million) in unaudited net profit during the July-September quarter, well above a 216.23 million Taiwanese dollars mean estimate of 13 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. In the same period a year earlier, it turned in a loss of 3 billion Taiwanese dollars.
The company makes devices, such as its flagship One M8, that consistently garner accolades from critics but fail to lure customers. The former contract manufacturer has struggled to maintain a distinctive brand image in an increasingly crowded marketplace.
HTC said during its last quarterly earnings briefing that improved efficiency in its sales and marketing operations would help the company maintain profitability in July-September after booking losses in third quarter 2013 and the first quarter of this year.
Sales in July dropped 33 per cent from the same month a year earlier, but recovered to rise by 10 per cent in August compared with the year-earlier month, the company has said.
HTC's sales in September fell 7.9 per cent on year to T$16.7 billion, the company said in a separate release on Friday, adding year-to-date revenue through September was down 13 per cent to 140 billion Taiwanese dollars.
While HTC's sales slip, the overall smartphone market is buoyant. Researcher IDC predicts worldwide smartphone shipments will expand by 24 per cent this year, while Silicon Valley powerhouse Apple Inc moved a record number of new iPhones during the models' first weekend of sales.
Brisk business for the iPhone 6, which many view as the main competitor to HTC's One M8, likely cut into HTC's sales in September, SinoPac Securities analyst Calvin Huang wrote in a recent research note.
Shares in HTC closed up 2.3 per cent before the earnings release, compared with a 1.5 per cent gain in the benchmark TAIEX index.

Where the Billionaires Live: Top 20 PlacesRegulators Fine Global Banks $3.4 Billion in Forex Probe
A new study of the super-rich finds that New York more billionaires than any other city. A study done by the wealth research and consulting firm Wealth-X and UBS says New York had 103 billionaires.
It is followed by Moscow, at 85; Hong Kong at 82; London at 72; and Beijing at 37.
Mumbai, with 28, occupies that 11th spot in the list of top 20 billionaire cities. In total, the study said there are 100 billionaires in India with their combined wealth pegged at $175 billion.
Eight of the top 20 global billionaire cities are located in Asia, "a further indication that Asia is at the beginning of a new cycle in wealth creation," the study said. "And only two of the top 20 cities are located in the United States, despite it being the single largest billionaire country. "
Billionaires choose their residences and business holdings not just because of government regulations, but also because of the unique benefits that a specific location can offer, the study said.
The study cited New York's role as the financial capital of the world as helping the city attract new billionaire financiers. "In addition, certain cities are particularly attractive because of the lifestyle they offer, from cultural attractions to a desirable environment in which to raise a family," the study added.

Expect YouTube Tie-Up to Boost Revenue: ShemarooEssar Steel Raises $1 Billion to Dollarise Balance Sheet
Mumbai: Shemaroo Entertainment, a film content and entertainment business provider that went public recently, is expecting its five-year-old tie-up with YouTube to contribute to its business growth.
"We had tied up with YouTube five years ago. Whenever an ad is displayed on any of the 32 YouTube channels, we do get our pie of revenue as per the agreement with Google," Shemaroo director Jai Maroo told PTI, without disclosing the percentage of ad revenue from share from Google.
He further said the company is witnessing 15-20 lakh views per day or 4.5-6 crore views a month, on an average.
"Digital ad spend is likely to grow at 32 per cent per annum over the next five years. More interestingly, 10 per cent of overall media and entertainment ad spend is on digital platform," Mr Maroo noted.
The company cannot make any forward-looking statement as it is currently in a silent mode.
Internet subscriber base is constantly growing. By 2017 we will reach 49.6 crore from the current 10 crore, he said.
The company's operational flow has been negative for the past couple of years.
"Currently we are in an investment mode for past couple of years and hence our operation flow has been negative (for past couple of years). Once our investment mode is completed, we will be in a much better position. It is for the same reason we raising money through an IPO," he said.
Mid last month, Shemaroo went public with an IPO that got subscribed 7.37 times for Rs 100-crore issue. Following the issue, the company got listed on the BSE and NSE on October 1.

Shipping Corporation  Gail in Talks for $3-Billion LNG Ships DealEssar Steel Raises $1 Billion to Dollarise Balance Sheet
Krishnapatnam, Andhra Pradesh: Shipping Corporation of India (SCI) and GAIL (India) Limited are in discussions to forge a tie-up under which Gail will acquire nine LNG ships with almost $3 billion and SCI will run them.
SCI director (liner and passenger services) Sarveen Narula said the shipper will have an option to pick up an up to 25 per cent stake once a joint venture company is formed for the purpose and talks are held through respective ministries.
"We are trying to buy nine LNG ships, not through SCI but through GAIL. SCI will run those ships in partnership with GAIL. We are actively working with GAIL in selection of (other) partners. We may have the right to take up to 25 per cent of the stake in that (venture)."
"The Memorandum of Understanding is being finalised. We are already been in talks with them. Very soon it will be done. It is brokered through the Government," Mr Narula told PTI.
SCI is currently running four LNG ships through joint venture companies with Japanese partners among others, in which the Indian PSU holds a 26 per cent stake.
"That is why we are tying up with GAIL. We will have the technical expertise. The funding will be though GAIL. So this becomes a new business for us. Each ship would cost around $300 to 350 million," Mr Narula said when asked about the capital requirement for buying the vessels.
He spoke on the sidelines of the flagging off ceremony of SCI's direct container services to Yangon from Krishnapatnam port container terminal on October 3.
The shipping company has already approached the Central government seeking permission to start an overseas subsidiary in Singapore for LNG shipping to India, he said.
According to the latest annual report of Gail, total Indian LNG imports required to meet the demand-domestic supply gap were 10.79 BCM (29.56 MMSCMD) in 2008, which further rose to 17.8 BCM (48.8 MMSCMD) in 2013.
GAIL has imported 25 LNG cargoes (equivalent to approximately 1.50 MMTPA of LNG) during the last financial year from various international sources on short term as well as spot basis to meet immediate domestic gas requirement.
SCI currently has an MoU with GAIL for transporting LNG from USA to India in 2016-17 wherein it has step-in right up to 26 per cent and also providing technical consultancy.
According to the 2013-14 annual report of SCI, India was the fifth largest importer of LNG in 2013 accounting for 5.5 per cent of the total trade. Domestic natural gas supply is expected to grow at 5.6 per cent over FY13-15, while gas demand is expected to grow at 18 per cent thereby causing a demand-supply mismatch.
Mr Narula further said another focused area for the company would be providing services to oil and gas companies in offshore activities.

Hong Kong: Women protesters allege sexual assaultThousands of pro-democracy activists attend a rally on the streets near the government headquarters on Saturday. (Source: AP)
Press Trust of India | Beijing | Posted: October 5, 2014 3:18 pm | Updated: October 5, 2014 3:29 pm
The pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong took an ugly turn with women protesters alleging sexual assault by men opposing the Occupy Central movement, which entered eight day on Sunday.
A woman protester has alleged that she and other male pro-democracy activists were sexually assaulted by a man opposing the Occupy movement in Causeway Bay on Friday and police did nothing about it.
A video uploaded on the website of the Hong Kong based South China Morning Post showed an older man in a white polo shirt violently groping a young woman while arguing with her.
A woman was quoted by the Post as saying that she was standing as part of a human chain when the man lying on the ground sexually assaulted the girl.
“I felt very, very scared, insulted and threatened,” she was quoted as saying by the Post.
“I yelled, That guy has assaulted me. The police were there but they didn’t really do anything,” she said.
Other people at the scene had shouted at the man to move, but he refused to leave the women alone, she added.
“I wasn’t scared of the tear gas but I was scared of this. It was non-violent but it was more violent,” she said.
The incidents occurred as anti-Occupy groups attempted to remove barriers and destroy tents.
Similar incidents were reported in Mong Kok. Human rights group Amnesty International condemned the police for failing to act.
“Women and girls were among those targeted, including incidents of sexual assault, harassment and intimidation,” Amnesty said in a statement.
“Hong Kong’s police failed in their duty to protect hundreds of peaceful pro-democracy protesters from attacks by counter demonstrators on Friday evening,” they said.
“The Occupy Central movement by thousands of people demanding the free and fair the election of Chief Executive of Hong Kong due in 2017,” they added.
The protesters oppose China’s insistence on tight rules including the vetting the candidates wanting to stand for election in 2017.
The pro-democracy agitators assert that the restrictions scuttle fair elections.
As per the resolution of the National People’s Congress, (NPC), China’s main legislature in August, the selection of the chief executive of Hong Kong will be conducted on the basis of nomination by a “broad representative” committee.
Also in another development a police officer who made the controversial call to use tear gas on thousands of demonstrators in Admiralty one week ago fuelling unprecedented civil disobedience in Hong Kong, said he has no regrets and would make the same decision again.
The senior superintendent was the commander in charge of the area where tear gas was fired last Sunday into crowds of pro-democracy supporters that had taken over a major street near government offices.

The government has also instituted an inquiry into the tragedy and it is being conducted by Home Secretary Amir Subhani and Additional Director General of Police, Headquarters, Gupteshwar Pandey.
"The state government is not going to spare anyone responsible for 'lapses' that led to the stampede outside the Gandhi Maidan," Water Resources Department Minister Vijay Chaudhary said.
He said that the probe team would jointly hold a public inquiry at the district collectorate on October 7 to hear accounts of eyewitnesses and other people willing to depose.
The state government would also publish advertisements in newspapers appealing to the people to share information about the incident, he said.
On the lack of lighting arrangement at the venue on the day of the Dusshera festivity, Chaudhary said that the state government was aware of the matter, but would await the probe report to act.
He said that the injured were getting "proper treatment" in the Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH).
PMCH Superintendent Dr Lekhindra Prasad said that seven of the injured had been admitted to the Intensive Care Unit of the facility.
The ADG (Headquarters) Gupteshwar Pandey said that the probe team had taken statements of the injured persons at the PMCH, magistrates and police officers deputed on duty for the Dusshera festival at Gandhi Maidan.
Pandey said that the probe would be completed within a week and a report would be submitted to the state government.

Q2 results preview for Sensex firms: Double-digit earnings growth expectedQ2 results preview for Sensex firms: Double-digit earnings growth expected
Malini Bhupta & Joydeep Ghosh | Mumbai Oct 06, 2014 12:59 AM IST
For India's leading companies, earnings growth is expected to remain stable in the July-September quarter of the current financial year.
According to analysts polled by Bloomberg, the earnings of the 30 companies on BSE's Sensex (excluding financial ones) are expected to grow at a double-digit rate - at around 11 per cent on a year-on-year basis - in the July-September period of this year.
Over the past four quarters, the Sensex companies' earnings trajectory has improved sharply because of a weak rupee. Though the Indian currency has recovered from the lows it hit in August last year, the Sensex companies' earnings growth momentum has not been affected, say analysts.
On revenue growth, the majority view is largely optimistic. While the Bloomberg poll shows the Sensex firms' revenue might grow only three per cent from the same period a year ago, Kotak Institutional Equities expects 7.5 per cent increase.
If oil & gas companies are excluded, the rate of revenue growth might be even higher - at 10.9 per cent. That is because analysts are assuming zero compensation to oil marketing companies in the September quarter, besides subdued refining margins, forex fluctuations and inventory losses.
For the entire universe of companies, Antique Stock Broking is even more bullish. It says revenue growth during the September quarter will be led by pharmaceuticals (19 per cent, year-on-year), mid-caps (17 per cent), FMCG (16 per cent), financial firms (13 per cent), automobiles (13 per cent), and information technology (11 per cent).
However, like in the April-June quarter, earnings growth might remain depressed for industrials and utilities.
Dalton Capital Advisors Managing Director U R Bhat says the numbers for the three-month period are likely to be a repeat of the previous quarter, with improvements for companies in segments like information technology and automobile. The leading firms are on course for overall growth of 10-12 per cent this year, he says.
Good news is that a lot more sectors are expected to show recovery in sales and earnings this year than the previous year, when only export-oriented companies fared well on the back of a weak rupee.
A robust performance by fast-moving consumer goods, pharmaceutical, information technology and automobile companies is expected to drive growth. The automobile sector, with a revival in volumes since May this year, is expected to see a sharp improvement in margins on better operating leverage and lower input costs. So far this financial year, in volume terms, passenger cars have seen seven per cent annual sales growth. Analysts expect the sector to report an improvement of 130-150 basis points in operating margins, as raw material costs have declined.
Reliance Mutual Fund Chief Investment Officer Sunil Singhania expects the coming result season to be better, with profit margins beginning to inch upwards. IT, pharma, auto, consumer durables and cement companies could lead, he says.
PSU banks, according to Singhania, might disappoint, given their slow credit growth and exposure to some large companies in trouble.
Banks, analysts say, might report strong earnings growth of 28 per cent over the September quarter of last year. A large part of this would be driven by factors that affected their earnings between the September and March quarters of 2013-14. Higher provisions and lower treasury income had hit banks' earnings last year. The net interest income of public-sector banks might slow down on weak loan growth but it is expected to be stable for private banks.
Even if all sectors are not showing a uniform recovery in earnings, the long-term outlook on corporate India's earnings trajectory remains robust. Bank of America Merrill Lynch says: "We are at the trough of the earnings cycle, with both sales growth and Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) margins at close to trough levels. Sales growth, as well as margins, in 2013-14 was the fourth-lowest in 20 years. If these revert to mean over the next four years, we will see a doubling of earnings growth." The five-year period to 2012-13 has seen earnings growth of eight per cent; this is likely to return to the double-digit level seen between 2000-01 and 2007-08.
There, however, are some who have a contrarian view. Dhananjay Sinha of Emkay Global says "the year-on-year impact of the rupee's depreciation will wear off in the (July-September) quarter, lowering revenue and profit growth across manufacturing sectors. The impact will be felt the most in export-driven ones like IT, pharma and automobile. A weaker rupee had raised pricing power (in rupee terms) for companies across many sectors, raising profit margins. This benefit will not be there, unless the rupee falls further from its current level".
Domestic demand and capital expenditure-related sectors, such as capital goods, construction and commercial vehicles, are likely to again be laggards, given a weak demand in the domestic economy, Sinha adds.

Investing in stocks Avoid penny stocks and value trapsInvesting in stocks? Avoid penny stocks and value traps
ET Bureau Oct 6, 2014, 02.38PM IST
Tags:
blue chip stocks
(Small investors should…)
Buy low and sell high is the ultimate winning strategy in the stock market. But some investors take this literally and buy very low-priced stocks. Also known as penny stocks, these scrips are not necessarily good investments. Since the market cap is low, they are easily manipulated by operators who lure unsuspecting investors and dump worthless shares on them. They first create a buzz around a stock, indulge in circular trading to push up the price, and then nudge investors to buy at high prices. As the tables show, a few penny stocks have given phenomenal returns in the past six months. Equally, some others have destroyed wealth during the same period.
The other problem is that penny stocks are thinly traded and even if the price zooms in the next few days, you may not be able to off-load all the shares. Any attempt to sell in large quantities only brings the price down.
What you should do: A penny stock is never a good investment, because you are buying it only in the hope of 'finding a bigger fool' who will buy it at a higher price. If a share is priced low, it is because the market does not see value. Study the fundamentals of the company. That will give you enough reasons to avoid pouring money into the junk shares.
BUYING OVERVALUED STOCKS
One can go wrong even with the blue chips. Small investors often get carried away by the market euphoria ignoring the 'value' of the stock. A good stock at a very high price is not a good investment. This overvaluation can happen even at the broader market levels. We studied the Sensex PE and its returns over the past 20 years and found that when the market was overvalued, the one-year average returns were very poor (see graphic).
What you should do: Pay attention to valuation when you buy a stock. Even if the company is growing very fast, avoid investing in it if the stock—or the market—is overvalued.
FALLING INTO VALUE TRAPS
Buying a stock just because the price has fallen 50 per cent from its peak is not always a good proposition. You may end up in a value trap. Investors who go hunting for bargains in the initial phase of a bear market also get into the value trap. They compare the current price and PE multiples with the earlier peak and start buying because the stock is available 'at a discount'. However, the price may continue to fall and losses could mount.
What you should do: Most all-time peaks are scaled during extreme euphoria in the market and, therefore, do not represent the real value of that stock. Similarly, it is not fair to judge the current valuation of a stock by comparing it with its all-time high valuations.
Instead, compare the current valuation with average valuations for the past 5-10 years. You also need to know why the valuations came down. Avoid buying if the fall is due to a decline in growth rates or if the industry is in trouble. Stocks with corporate governance issues usually quote at cheap valuations, buying them is not great idea. Besides, technical analysis says that a stock which has come down to a 52-week low after a long rally indicates that the tide is turning against the counter. This should be treated as a sell signal and not a buy 'at a discount' signal.
BUYING FUTURES & OPTIONS
Be greedy when they are fearful is what stock gurus advise. But some investors are greedier than they can afford to be. They get into the high-risk arena of futures and options (F&O) even though they don't have the financial muscle or the acumen. People who missed the initial phase of the market rally may now want to catch up by taking high-risk bets. The F&O segment allows an individual to buy up to five times the margin kept with the brokers. This means that with a margin of Rs 50,000, one can take a position in shares worth Rs 2.5 lakh. But while your gains can be five times greater, so can your losses.
What you should do: Whether it is the F&O market or the cash segment, don't bite off more than you can chew. F&Os are meant for hedging and retail investors should get in there only for hedging their existing portfolio. They can get into the speculative part later, but only after learning enough about the F&O market and the risks involved there.

How eating with parents prevents kids from obesityIndo-Asian News Service | Posted: October 6, 2014 10:24 am
Even having as few as one or two family meals a week during adolescence may protect your kids from being obese when they turn into adults, says a study.
Researchers believe that coming together for meals may provide opportunities for emotional connections among family members, the food is more likely to be healthy and adolescents may be exposed to the parental model of healthy eating behaviour.
“Informing parents that even having one or two family meals per week may protect their child from being overweight or obese in young adulthood would be important,” said co-researcher Jerica Berge from the University of Minnesota in the US.
For Project EAT (Eating and Activity among Teens), the researchers used data from a 10-year longitudinal study (2,287 participants), to examine weight-related variables (dietary intake, physical activity and weight control behaviour) among adolescents.
Among adolescents who reported that they never ate family meals together, 60 percent were overweight and 29 percent were obese at the 10-year follow-up.
Overall, even having as few as one or two family meals a week during adolescence were significantly associated with reduced odds of being overweight or obese at the 10-year follow-up compared with those reporting never having had family meals during adolescence.
The study is forthcoming in the Journal of Pediatrics.

(Markets seemed to be in a…)
NEW DELHI: The Indian markets closed on a muted note during the truncated last week as traders preferred to stay on the sidelines after the Reserve Bank kept key interest rates unchanged.
The markets seemed to be in a consolidation mode after a strong rally, as the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex and CNX Nifty declined 58.33 points and 23.30 points, respectively.
For this week, the markets will closely track data for India's services sector, IIP number and quarterly earnings from Infosys in a holiday-shortened week ahead, which is likely to dictate trend for the markets.
Macro-economic data - Index of Industrial Production for August will be declared on Friday, 10th October. Stock-specific movement can be observed in the coming trading session as major companies will announce their July- September 2014 corporate earnings.
IT major Infosys will announce results on 10th October 2014. Most analysts expect steady growth from Indian IT vendors in Q2FY15, with US$ revenues growing in the range of 2-7 per cent QoQ for large players.
Brokerage firm Sharekhan expects a 3.5 per cent quarter-on-quarter (Q-o-Q) growth in the revenues and a negative cross-currency impact of 70 BPS.
"The net profit is expected to deliver a 6.3 per cent Q-o-Q and a 16.8 per cent year-on-year (Y-o-Y) growth," added the brokerage firm.
Last week the Nifty ended the day with a loss of 19 points at 7945 after a range-bound session. The BSE Sensex closed 62 points lower at 26567.99 on Wednesday.
Immediate support for the Nifty continues to remain at 7920 and if the index manages to respect 7920 as a support and clear the resistance of 8040 as well, then we may see further upside till 8090, say analysts.
We have collated a list of ten stocks (swing calls) which can give up to 13 per cent return in the next 4-5 trading sessions:

NEW DELHI: Indian stock market will remain shut on Monday, 6th October on account of public holiday. The BSE, NSE will remain closed for " Bakri Id ".
However, Asian markets were trading higher tracking gains on Wall Street which rose following a stronger-than-expected September U.S. jobs report that bolstered the outlook for the U.S. economy.
"The U.S. Labor Department reported nonfarm payrolls rose 248,000 in September, 33,000 more than median forecast while the jobless rate fell two-tenths of a point to a six-year low of 5.9 percent," Reuters reported.
Tokyo's Nikkei jumped nearly 1 per cent in early trade while South Korean shares rose 0.3 percent after a market holiday on Friday. Hang Seng was trading 0.4 per cent higher.
Back home, Nifty ended the day with a loss of 19 points at 7945 after a range bound session. The BSE Sensex closed 62 points lower at 26567.99 on Wednesday.
Immediate support for Nifty continues to remain at 7920 and if the index manages to respect 7920 as a support and clear the resistance of 8040 as well then we may see further upside till 8090, say analysts.
Markets will closely track data for India's services sector, IIP number and quarterly earnings from IT major Infosys in a holiday-shortened week ahead, say experts.
Important set of data and events are lined in the coming week. To begin with, HSBC Services PMI for August 2014 is due on Tuesday, 7 October 2014. Going ahead, the government will unveil industrial production data for August 2014 on Friday, 10 October 2014.
And lastly, the earning season will also begin from Friday, 10 October 2014 with IT major, Infosys ltd, announcing its Q2 numbers.
"Broadly, the CNX Nifty index has been trading within 7850-8050 for last six trading sessions and either side decisive break will trigger the next directional move," said Jayant Manglik, President-retail distribution, Religare Securities Limited.
"Meanwhile, traders should maintain extra caution and prefer defensive sectors like Pharma, FMCG for short term positions," he added.
Manglik is of the view that investors', on the other hand, should now focus more on stock specific approach before the beginning of earning season and adjust their portfolios accordingly.

India can be the hub for Europe  Africa: Tony FernandesIndia can be the hub for Europe, Africa: Tony Fernandes
BS Reporter | Chennai Oct 07, 2014 12:46 AM IST
Low-cost airline AirAsia has said India can be its hub for Europe and Africa.
“I see India in a different way than most people…there’s no reason why India cannot be a hub for Europe and Africa,” group chief executive Tony Fernandes said in an interview to Gulf News.
He went to say that the airline would first focus on building a domestic network. AirAsia India has a domestic operator’s licence and it is not allowed to fly abroad. Fernandes said the airline would feed traffic into India from the airline’s hubs in Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand.
AirAsia India is a joint venture, partnering AirAsia, Tata Sons Ltd and Arun Bhatia of Telestra Tradeplace. While Tata Sons has a 30 per cent stake in the venture, AirAsia owns 49 per cent and Telestra Tradeplace holds the rest. The $30-million venture was the first after foreign direct investment norms in the aviation segment were changed. Subsequently, the Tata Group had announced a tie-up with Singapore Airlines for a full-service airline.
In June this year, AirAsia India launched its first domestic flight from Bangalore’s Kempegowda International Airport. The airline said Bangalore would be a hub for expanding to more cities.
 
On the domestic market, Fernandes said the focus would be being a big player on big routes like those to Mumbai ( airline said it will start flying to the city from early 2015 ) and Delhi. The airline is also looking at cities in the northeast. AirAsia India currently operates flights from Bangalore to Chennai, Kochi, Goa, Jaipur, Chandigarh and vice versa.
“It is more about frequency on less routes,” he said.
On the number of aircraft the Indian venture would have, he said, “I hope to have 20 planes in the not too distant future.” By the end of 2014, the airline would have six A320s.
Commenting on competition, he said, “The entire [Indian] airline industry has kind of ganged up on us…It means they know we can do something.”

Verma most capable  qualified to be US amba...Ash Carter
(File photo of former US state…)
WASHINGTON: The nomination of Richard Rahul Verma as next US ambassador to India could be the catalyst to transform the Indo-US ties as he is the "most capable and qualified candidate" to head America's diplomatic mission in New Delhi, former Obama administration officials have said.
Highly appreciative of Verma's diplomatic skills, the officials including former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton believe that he brings to the table "a deep reservoir of experience" in every dimension of US national security policy.
In exclusive interviews to PTI, these top former Obama administration officials said Verma, who quietly played an important role in the Congressional passage of Civil Nuclear Deal while being at the Hill, has a vision for the Indo-US relationship.
Verma had advocated for strong Indo-US ties when in the Administration and recently had started a "India 2020" project at a top American-think tank -- Center for American Progress.
Verma has been nominated by Obama purely on his capabilities and diplomatic skills and not has been rewarded for any political or fund raising activities, they said.
They hoped he would easily sail through the Senate confirmation process.
"Rich (Verma) is an inspired choice to be President Obama's next ambassador to India. He knows, like the President knows, that our two nations are destined to be great partners," ex-Deputy Secretary of Defence Ash Carter told PTI.
"But he also knows that destiny can and must be hastened by the hard work of gifted people like him on both sides. At a key moment in the (India-US) relationship, Rich Verma's proven skill and dedication are just what is needed," said Carter.
Carter as the Deputy Secretary of Defence was instrumental in the path breaking Defence Trade and Technology Initiative (DTTI), resulting in the two governments deciding on co-production and co-development of hi-tech military hardware.
"She (Hillary Clinton) is thrilled that he (Verma) has been nominated to be our next Ambassador to India," said Nick Merrill, spokesperson of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"The American and Indian people are fortunate to have such a skilled diplomat working to further deepen the partnership between our two countries," Merrill said.
"Rich was an indispensable colleague of Secretary Clinton's and of the entire Department of State," he said.
Verma was the Assistant Secretary of State for Legislative Affairs at the US Department of State until March 2011.
"He has a deep understanding of foreign policy, a rich respect for the culture and history of countries, the trust of America's highest leaders in both the Executive and Congressional Branches, and he knows how to get things done," Merrill said.

Traders bullish on Infosys on expectations of Vishal Sikka unveiling a growth map

(Analysts said many traders…)
MUMBAI: Savvy traders have placed bullish bets on Infosys ahead of its second quarter earnings due on Friday, October 10. Brokers and analysts said the long positions in Infosys futures and options contracts have been created on hopes that the software exporter's new chief executive officer Vishal Sikka may announce a road map for its future growth.
"Traders can expect 3-4% upside in Infosys stock price on the results day. Most of the positions in the futures segment are long in nature. Bears have gone into hiding from the stock," said Amit Gupta, head of derivatives at ICICI Direct. Infy futures open interest, or outstanding positions, at the beginning of the October series is currently around 33 lakh shares, compared to about 25 lakh shares at the beginning of the September series.
Analysts said many traders have squared off their short positions ahead of the results. Infosys saw a strong open interest build-up on the long side last week. The stock has also given a major breakout on the weekly charts above Rs 3,680, said Ashish Chaturmohta, head of technical and derivatives desk at Fortune Equity Broking. Infosys shares closed at Rs 3,847.20 on Wednesday.
Chaturmohta expects the stock to rise another 7-8% in the near term. In Infy call options, the highest open interest is at 4,000 strike in the October series. Analysts said the build-up suggests traders expect stock to rise to Rs 4,000.
"We expect the Infosys stock to move substantially higher in the October series. The open interest in out-of-the-money (OTM) call option (the strike price that is higher than the market price) has been increasing, which is a strong bullish indicator," said Alex Mathews, head of research at Geojit BNP Paribas.
Recently, CLSA has upgraded Infosys rating to 'Buy' from 'Outperform', and has increased its price target to Rs 4,500 from Rs 3,750. Infosys shares have rallied nearly 20% in the last three months, and have outperformed the BSE IT Index, which has gained 17.5%.
The broader benchmark Sensex has gained 4% during the same period. Amar Ambani, head of research at IIFL, said, "IT companies are expected to report strong quarterly performance driven by seasonal project ramp-ups, and currency tailwinds. There is also a high likelihood of incrementally encouraging commentary by most companies on revenue visibility given US growth acceleration."

Why KPIT Tech is poised for growth
Narendra Nathan, ET Bureau Oct 6, 2014, 09.28AM IST
Tags:
Analyst
(KPIT Tech’s recent poor…)
KPIT Technologies could not match up to its peers in the recent IT stocks rally because the company missed the guidance for 2013-14. The low earnings growth of 5 per cent expected in 2014-15 is yet another reason for its poor show. KPIT also fell below the broader market and its under-performance against the Sensex stands at 31 per cent on a year-to-date basis.
However, analysts are getting bullish on the counter now for various reasons. First, the recent show has brought the company's valuation down to very low levels and is, therefore, at attractive levels with a PE of close to 13. There is also a possibility of the counter being re-rated in the coming quarters.
Second, its earnings growth is expected to pick up to 19 per cent in 2015-16. The management's increased focus on its top 50 clients and the restructuring efforts is also expected to drive revenue growth. KPIT's asset-light model should also allow higher EBITDA margin expansion. Like other IT companies, KPIT Technologies should benefit from the recent dollar appreciation.
However, the company's main growth is going to come from the overall change in the macro environment. Revival in growth in the US is good news for the IT sector, including KPIT. With the improvement in macro environment, companies across the manufacturing verticals are showing signs of increasing their discretionary IT spending.
Increased discretionary spending is good for KPIT's SAP and IES ( Oracle ) units that have been struggling for the last several quarters. It missed the guidance for 2013-14 due to a fall in its SAP revenues (SAP unit that contributes around 25 per cent of its revenues declined by 11 per cent during 2013-14) because of delayed deal closures. However, the SAP unit has already witnessed a turnaround in the April-June quarter with a low single-digit margin. Its EBITDA margin is expected to go up to high single digits by the fourth quarter of 2014-15.
The disappointing first quarter result was primarily because of the low order intake from its automotive vertical and the expected revival in the auto sector due to the fall in global crude prices is another factor that will help KPIT. Due to KPIT's technological superiority, it should be able to retain its dominant share in the automotive vertical.
Realisation should also increase because the demand mix will be shifting to high-end functionalities, i.e., more and more OEMs have begun to adopt electronic systems and have integrated semiconductor circuits in vehicles.
Selection methodology We choose the stock that has shown the maximum increase in consensus analyst rating during the past one month. Consensus rating is arrived at by averaging the recommendations of all analyst and after attributing weights to each (5 for strong buy, 4 for buy, 3 for hold, 2 for sell and 1 for strong sell).
Any improvement in consensus analyst rating indicates that analysts are becoming more and more bullish on the stock. To make sure that we pick only companies with decent analyst coverage, this search will be restricted to stocks that have been covered by at least 10 analysts.

Sena slams Modi  questions his  respect  for Bal ThackeraySena questions Modi's respect for Bal Thackeray
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  Mumbai, October 06, 2014

Comments
A day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi refused to criticise the Shiv Sena out of respect for the late Bal Thackeray, the former saffron ally hit back saying he should have remembered it when the BJP broke off the alliance.
An editorial in the Sena mouthpiece Saamna on Monday said, " Modi said he won't say a word against Sena as a tribute to Bal Thackeray. We appreciate that. But what happened to that  respect while you were breaking off the alliance?
If the BJP had shown some understanding in seat sharing  and kept the alliance intact, that would have been a true tribute to Bal Thackeray, the editorial further said.
Read: Won't criticise Shiv Sena as tribute to Bal Thackeray: Modi
Modi had said on Sunday at a campaign rally in Maharashtra that he would not criticise former ally Shiv Sena out of respect for its late leader, Bal Thackeray.
"Political pundits are saying why is Modi not criticising Shiv Sena in his campaign speeches. This is the first election in absence of late Bal Thackeray, for whom I have great respect. I have decided not to utter a single word against Shiv Sena. This is my tribute to Balasaheb Thackeray," he had said.
The Sena editorial was also scathing on Modi's attempt to use Shivaji  Maharaj's name during his campaign.
"The new head of Delhi shouldn't forget that Shivaji Maharaj was the embodiment of Purusharth (manliness). Where will you get that from?", the Sena asked Modi.
Questioning Modi's statements on his love for Maharashtra, the Sena asked, "PM Modi came all the way from Delhi to say that Congress-NCP alliance looted Maharashtra. But what was Gujarat CM Anandiben's intention of coming to Mumbai. She said all Mumbai-based industrialists should shift to Gujarat. Isn't that a way of looting Maharashtra."
Referring to BJP's stand on the Vidarbha row, the Sena accused the party of trying to split Maharashtra.
Modi in all his campaign speeches in the state  had been trying to highlight the BJP's respect for Maharashtra and warrior king Chhattrapati Shivaji.
" It was the Vajpayee government which named Mumbai airport after Shivaji. You were CM , but you didn't think of it. Even Victoria Terminus was named Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus by Vajpayee government," Modi had said in an attack on the ruling Congress-NCP government.

Gold sinks to lowest in 15 mths | Brent belo...Bullion sinks to lowest in 15 months on robust US data

Gold has also failed to capitalise on geopolitical tensions caused by military conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the rise of Islamic State, which has declared a cross-border caliphate in Iraq and Syria.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
SINGAPORE: Gold tumbled to its lowest level in around 15 months on Monday after better-than-expected US jobs data boosted the dollar, dampening safe-haven appetite for bullion and pushing silver and platinum to multi-year lows.
Gold, which often influences other precious metals, has also failed to capitalise on geopolitical tensions caused by military conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the rise of Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.
By 0641 GMT, cash gold was little changed at $1,191.30 an ounce after earlier falling to $1,183.46 an ounce, its weakest since June 2013.
Platinum touched its lowest since 2009, silver fell to its weakest since 2010, and palladium hit an 8-month low.
"A strong dollar is a major problem for gold. Sentiment is very bearish but I think we expect some kind of rebound," said Ronald Leung, chief dealer at Lee Cheong Gold Dealers in Hong Kong, who pegged support at $1,180 an ounce.
"There's a little bit of physical buying, but premiums haven't changed. We have to see what happens later in the day. If demand is coming, of course, it will push up the premiums."
Premiums for gold were quoted at $1.20 to $1.60 an ounce to the spot London prices, unchanged from last week, despite a sharp drop in cash gold prices.
The absence of main gold consumer China is weighing on the physical market, which usually sees a pick up in demand from jewellers and retail investors when prices fall.
Chinese markets have been shut for national holidays and will reopen on Wednesday.
US gold was $1,191.70 an ounce, down 0.10 per cent.
The dollar held on Monday near a more than four-year high, touched after last week's upbeat US nonfarm payrolls report increased speculation that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates in mid-2015 or earlier.
Data from the Labor Department on Friday showed US non-farm payrolls rose 248,000 last month and the jobless rate fell to 5.9 per cent, the lowest since July 2008, underscoring that the US economy continues to improve.
In Tokyo, sellers pushed up premiums for gold bars to 25 cents to spot London prices from zero last week to offset the decline in global prices.
"At this moment, demand is not good. But maybe when the holiday in China is over, the premiums may go up further," said a dealer in Tokyo.
Markets in Singapore, a key bullion trading centre in Southeast Asia, were also closed for a public holiday.

United colours of PM Narendra Modi in USUS chants NaMo mantra post PM Modi's visit
Arun Kumar     Washington   Last Updated: October 10, 2014  | 13:36 IST
Prime Minister Narendra Modi (Photo: Reuters)
Prime Minister Narendra Modi was dressed for the occasion wherever he went, but the diverse colours that he donned on his recent visit to the United States had one unifying theme - to win America. And this is being talked about even a week after his visit.
And win America Modi did even before he reached Washington for a much awaited summit with US President Barack Obama after wowing the Indian diaspora, sharing the stage with top American music stars to reach out to America's liberal youth and wooing the big business in the Big Apple.
FULL COVERAGE: PM Narendra Modi in US
It was a surprise performance from a once provincial leader with little foreign policy experience who came to power just four months ago though with a historic win in the elections giving his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) a clear mandate for the first time in 30 years.
Landing in the financial capital of the US in a smart casual maroon bandhgala and black pants, he got out of his car in front of his hotel to shake hands with delighted members of the Indian-American community chanting "Modi Modi" as anxious security guys scrambled to keep their charge safe.
Then he switched to a more formal bandhgala suit for meetings with the city's mayor and a Nobel Laureate cancer researcher. That was to be the pattern of the Prime Minister's 100-hour action-packed whirlwind tour laced with symbolism.
Next day wearing his trade mark half sleeve Modi kurta and churidars with a grey shawl thrown on his left shoulder, he paid homage at Ground Zero where the twin towers of the World Trade Centre stood before the 9/11 attack, to show the country's resolve to fight terrorism and solidarity with Americans.
Switching to a formal blue bandhgala suit, Modi then took to the world stage with an address to the UN General Assembly choosing to speak in Hindi, the country's official language (the other being English).
And instead of mouthing clichÃ© ridden paeans to non-alignment he gave a call to form a 'G-all' in today's interdependent world. Yet he also chided Pakistan for raking up Kashmir at the UN and offered to engage in a "serious bilateral dialogue", but "without the shadow of terrorism".
In the evening, he outlined his vision of a 'Clean India' to a 65,000-strong youthful crowd at New York's Central Park addressing them in an idiom they understood saying "I salute you" and "May the force be with you" from the evergreen hit Star Wars films.
A capacity crowd of nearly 20,000 star struck Indian-American gave him a rock star like welcome at the Madison Square Garden as he spoke to them in Hindi in his chatty style for over an hour as thousands more heard him on jumbotron screens at Times Square and in homes across the US.
Then packing meetings with two governors, including South Carolina's Indian-American Nikki Haley, 40 odd lawmakers, 11 CEOs and an address to the Council on Foreign Relations, again in Hindi, the Prime Minister headed to Washington.
An Indian-American writer suggested that Modi through his fast for the Hindu festival of Navratri and the choice of his apparel was speaking in code his "Hindu nationalist" supporters, while another implied that he was cocking a snook to the American establishment that had denied him a visa for nearly a decade.
Be as it may, the US officialdom from Obama also treated Modi no less as they broke the ice over an exclusive dinner at the White House. As they shared common experiences, the US President wondered how Modi kept up such a rigorous schedule on just a diet of warm water and yoga and told him how he himself enjoyed dancing during his 2010 trip to India.
So much so that as the summit ended with the two leaders giving a new mantra of "chalein saath saath - together we go forward," Obama joined Modi on an unscheduled trip to the memorial of African-American civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.
Modi had come full circle in just four short months. There lay the true significance of the Modi visit though some critics dismissed their joint statement vowing to deepen cooperation in from defence to nuclear to space to counter-terrorism to women's empowerment and health as merely a rehashed 'laundry list'.
What PM Modi himself has called a " hugely successful " and US officials branded as an "extraordinarily successful" journey was different from others before in more ways than just optics: the two sides have lined up a "pretty ambitious agenda of engagement" over the next nine months or so to translate words into action.

J&K: Seven killed in Pakistan shelling  trouble spreads toLoCA villager shows mortar shells allegedly fired from the Pakistan side in Chanana village at the India-Pakistan International border at Arnia sector in Jammu and Kashmir on Saturday. (Source: PTI)
Written by Arun Sharma | Jammu | Posted: October 6, 2014 1:40 pm | Updated: October 7, 2014 8:36 am
After the killing seven civilians and injuring nearly 50 others in night long shelling by Pakistan on civilian areas in Arnia sector along the international border near Jammu, the trouble has spread to Line of Control (LoC) in Rajouri and Poonch districts on Monday morning.
The entire Line of Control (LoC) right from Krishna Ghati (KG) sector to Mankote, Balakote, Keriand even Bhimber Gali (BG) have come under attack with Pakistani troops resorting to automatic weapons fire and mortar shelling from 8.30 am onwards. The Indian army was also retaliating, sources said, adding the exchange of fire was continuing as per reports reaching here in the afternoon.
Earlier, on the intervening night of Sunday and Monday, seven people were killed and nearly 50 others injured in Pakistani shelling in Arnia sector along the International Border near Jammu during early hours of Monday.
 
Sources said that four members of a family died when Pakistani mortar shells started raining on Arnia town around 3 am. Three more people succumbed to injuries at the hospital. A number of shells fell even in Arnia town’s main bazaar and the bus stand causing extensive damage to property and injuring civilians.

Significantly, it is for the first time since 2003 that Pakistani shells have fallen in Arnia bazaar. The town is nearly two kms away from the international border, which means that the Pakistani Rangers used long range mortars to target civilian population deep inside the Indian territory, sources said.
The Pakistani Rangers had been resorting to unprovoked mortar shelling and small arms fire along the international border since October 3. After a lull in exchange of fire for nearly a month, the Pakistani Rangers stepped up shelling during early hours of Monday around 12.30 am causing panic among the villagers. Apart from Arnia town, the villages most hit by shelling are Trewa, Suhagpur and Devigarh.
 
Border Security Force officials here said that Pakistani Rangers targeted ten BSF border outposts, besides civilian population with heavy mortar shelling and small arms fire in Arnia sector late last night. Pointing out that five civilians were killed and nearly 50 others injured in Pakistani shelling, they said that BSF also gave a befitting and calibrated reply to the Rangers.
The loss in Pakistan territory is yet to be ascertained, they said, adding that the firing was continuing till reports last came in.
 
The latest mortar shelling by Pakistan has led to fresh spate of migration from various border villages. The civil administration has been continued…

Indo-Asian News Service | Chennai | Posted: October 6, 2014 1:37 pm
Actor-filmmaker Lakshmy Ramakrishnan’s biggest strength is her family which has stood by her in all her endeavours. Now, they’ve even contributed to her upcoming Tamil directorial “Nerungi Vaa Muthamidathe”.
While Lakshmy’s husband has played a small role in “Nerungi Vaa Muthamidathe”, her youngest daughter assisted her in direction.
“My family has someway contributed to all my activities. Right from my first job in event management to my first directorial ‘Aarohanam’, they’ve been part of my journey. My second daughter Shruti assisted me in my first film,” Lakshmy told IANS.
“In this film, my daughter Shreeya, who was looking for an internship, decided to assist me. It’s through the film that she graduated to be assistant director. I convinced Ram (husband) to play a small role and he was happy to do it,” she said.
The film’s producer A.V. Anoop has also played a small role in the film, which features Shabeer, Pia Bajpai, Sruthi Hariharan, Thambi Ramaiah, Y.G. Mahendran and Ambika in important roles.
“Anoop has been into acting for quite some time. He’s a theatre artist and he recently acted in his Malayalam production ‘Mr. Fraud’ as well,” she added.
Lakshmy herself has also played an important role in “Nerungi Vaa Muthamidathe”, which is gearing up for release soon.

Mickey Virus directors next  clean comedy Meet ThePatelsSaurabh Verma says 'Meet the Patels' will have clean humour.
Indo-Asian News Service | Mumbai | Posted: October 6, 2014 1:28 pm
After making his directorial debut with ‘Mickey Virus’, Saurabh Varma is set to make his next comedy film titled ‘Meet The Patels’. He says it will have clean humour.
“‘Mickey Virus’ had a thriller element. But this time, I’m making an out-and-out comedy film. It’s based in Mumbai and there’s no abusive language in it, no slapstick comedy. It’ a clean comedy,” Varma told IANS.
He says the movie is an effort “to make a comedy which Indians would love”.
Talking further about ‘Meet The Patels’, he said: “This film will have two characters named Tom Patel and Jerry Patel. The story revolves around them. I am targeting all Indians but it will have a Gujarati flavour to it. There will be a Gujarati song too, but the whole idea of the film is to have universal appeal.”
To be produced by Krian Media, the film will go on the floors in November.
Varma’s first film starred Manish Paul and Elli Avram. However, he is yet to cast anyone for ‘Meet The Patels’.
“We’re in the process of casting. It is too early to reveal the names (as of now). In the next few days, we shall make an official announcement. There will be a lot of interesting characters in it and there are some very good actors (in the film industry) today,” he added.

Brazil elections spring a bag full ofsurprisesBrazil's President Dilma Rousseff, presidential candidate for re-election of the Workers Party, PT, talks about the results of the general elections during a press conference, in Brasilia, Brazil, Sunday, Oct. 5, 2014.(Source: AP)
Posted: October 6, 2014 1:18 pm | Updated: October 6, 2014 3:14 pm
It’s the presidential election that just keeps surprising.
A year after a spasm of huge anti-government protests across Brazil, President Dilma Rousseff piled up more votes in Sunday’s election than any challenger, but it wasn’t enough to avoid a runoff in three weeks.

The race kept up its unpredictable nature as Aecio Neves, a center-right former governor and senator with deep political lineage, came in second. He had languished in the polls during the campaign but surged in the past week to overtake former environment minister Marina Silva, who at one time was the front-runner.
In late August, Silva held a double-digit lead over the field after only entering the race following the death of her Socialist Party’s initial candidate in a plane crash. But then her reputation and credentials were picked apart by aggressive campaigning from Rousseff’s long-governing Workers’ Party.
With nearly all the votes counted, the president had 41.5 percent to Neves’ 33.6 percent. Silva got 21 percent.

The Oct. 26 runoff will now pit the candidates of Brazil’s two most powerful parties, which together have produced all of Brazil’s presidents the past 20 years and are well known to Brazilians.
Neves is backed by the well-organized Social Democracy Party, which held the presidency from 1994 until 2002, a period when Brazil tamed hyperinflation and turned the economy around.
“Aecio’s performance has been extraordinary, and one of the reasons for this is the very strong party structure behind him — a party with a strong nationwide presence and which has been in the presidency,” said Carlos Pereira, a political analyst at the Gertulio Vargas Foundation, Brazil’s leading think tank. “It is now a new election where everything is wide open. Aecio, who until recently no one believed had a chance, has emerged as a very strong candidate.”

‘Once upon a Friday in 2003, there came a movie ‘Ishq Vishk’ and gave the Indian film industry another chocolate boy by the name of Shahid Kapoor . And a Thursday in 2014 gave it an actor.’
The chocolate boy, then, went on to bag awards for his debut flick and people compared him with the evergreen chocolate hero of the industry – Shah Rukh Khan. He, actually, did resemble King Khan in his looks, acting and especially the choice of movies. But barring ‘Shikhar’ with Ajay Devgn, none of them acclaimed critical respect, leave alone audience’s love.
Through many duds and few hits like Sooraj Barjatya’s ‘Vivaah’, Imtiaz Ali’s ‘Jab We Met’ and Vishal Bharadwaj’s ‘Kaminey’, Shahid Kapoor managed to hold his fort in the Indian film industry.
Last year’s ‘R Rajkumar’ brought a much needed respite to this actor’s career and a lot was pinned on the recently released ‘Haider’.
One word for ‘Haider’ – One can be disappointed with the kind of cinema that’s running nowadays in India; depressed too. And then one day, ‘Haider’, with all its darkness and craft, arrives on the screen. ‘Haider’ happens to complete Vishal Bharadwaj’s Shakespearen trilogy. The adaptation of Shakespeare’s play ‘Hamlet’, ‘Haider’ needed a nuanced actor to portray ‘the most confused character of modern literature’.
Vishal Bharadwaj calls Shahid ‘the most talented actor of his times’, and adds that he needs to tap that talent. It’s quite coincidental that he is the only filmmaker who has been able to do this, till now.
When Shahid was chosen to play ‘Haider’, few would have expected him to carry off this role with elan. But to many’s surprise, the actor has nailed his part and how! In Irrfan Khan’s words, Shahid Kapoor doesn’t emerge as an actor in ‘Haider’; he erupts with a tremendous force. Shahid’s co-star in the movie took to Twitter to express this.
@shahidkapoor in haider doesn’t emerge as n actor he rather erupts with tremendous force. A new chapter begins from here onwards .
— IrrfanK (@irrfan_k) September 29, 2014
‘Haider’, which released this Thursday, has taken the whole industry by storm. Filmstars, filmmakers and critics can’t stop raving about the movie and about Shahid Kapoor, who plays the titular role in the movie. These celebrities are taking to Twitter to appreciate what the talented actor has achieved with this role. Farhan Akhtar was the first one to tweet his IIFA co-host ‘Pappu’. And ‘Pappu’ thanked his ‘Raju’.
I’m loving the music of Haider. Vishal B & Gulzar Saab in their element. All the best to the team & to my dearest Pappu @shahidkapoor

I was blown away by MS Dhoni s personality: Sushant Singh RajputComments
Ever since he made his debut with Kai Po Che (2013), Sushant Singh Rajput has made some interesting film choices. In his upcoming project with director Neeraj Pandey, he is set to play Indian cricket captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni on screen.
In an interview, the actor talks about the challenges of playing the lead in a biopic, meeting the cricketing star, his special equation with Shekhar Kapur , and more.
Is playing Dhoni on screen a huge responsibility for you?
As an actor, there is always a responsibility when you are portraying any character on screen. You have to meet your own expectations, [because] you want a large percentage of audience to come and watch the film. As for Dhoni, he is an inspiration, and is loved by millions. The incredible response after the [film’s] announcement only punctuates the massiveness of the project, and we will make sure the biopic transcends general expectations.
Recently, you met Dhoni regarding the film. How did the meeting go?
Five minutes into the meeting, I was blown away by his personality. He is a unique amalgamation of hard work, intelligence, patriotism, humility, passion and God-like inner peace. I am looking forward to many such conversations with him to carefully understand why he is the way he is, so that I can honestly portray him on screen.
This film is one of the rare biopics where the protagonist is still active in his own field.
Yes, and so it gets much more challenging. Everyone has a strong visual reference [of the person], since he is still playing and is immensely popular. So you, as an actor, have to match him completely in order to pull it off convincingly.
It’s believed that you are media shy compared to your contemporaries.
It’s a personal choice. The main objective is to be part of exciting films with wonderful directors, and I don’t think the ‘buzz’ or the ‘number of appearances’ in a week increases the possibility [of working in those films] by any measure. I am living my dream and will continue to follow my instincts and passion, and hopefully entertain the audience.
You and director Shekhar Kapur clearly share a great chemistry. In fact, he recently tweeted that you are “probably one of the best young actors we have today”.
We share a special bond, and talk about so many things when we meet. I haven’t met anyone else who understands human emotions better. Now, after getting to know him a bit more, when I watch his films again, I am able to understand the deeper meaning behind the narrative options he has taken, and the creative decisions he has made. I can't thank my stars enough to have gotten this opportunity to work with him so early in my career.
Why are you taking so many risks when your contemporaries are playing it safe in terms of film choices?
I chose to be an actor for selfish reasons. I love living different characters, and something happens to me when I am performing on stage or when I am in front of the camera. And that’s very liberating. I work for that. It helps me fight the fear of all kinds of uncertainties and insecurities.
Lastly, how important do you think you next with director Dibakar Banerjee will be, since it's coming at a very important time in your career (after a gap of a year)?
It is important for me, not because of the timing or anything, but because it’s a very special film. Honestly, as an actor, I learnt more in these seven months than I did in eight years of theatre, TV and films combined. Dibakar is a genius filmmaker.

PM Narendra Modi urges EC to probe Haryana approval for Robert Vadra land dealModi urges EC to probe approval for Vadra land deal
Agencies  Hisar, October 06, 2014
First Published: 12:23 IST(6/10/2014) | Last Updated: 18:34 IST(6/10/2014)
Prime Minister Narendra Modi Monday urged the Election Commission to look into Haryana government's approval of a land deal involving Sonia Gandhi's son-in-law Robert Vadra.
Addressing an election rally in Hisar Modi said, "They (Hooda government) know that after the elections,
the son-in-law (Vadra) will not get any clearances for illegal deals. So, in between the election process, they have dared to take such a decision,"
"I think Hooda was pressurised from the top (Congress leadership) to take such a decision," he added.
Watch: Modi hints at Vadra deals in Haryana election speech
The Election Commission, the prime minister hoped, would take "serious note" of the state government's decision.  "I hope they will take appropriate action for any violation of the Model Code of Conduct," he said.
"Despite the model code being imposed for the state elections, chief minister Bhupinder Hooda cleared land deal for the 'damaad' ( Robert Vadra) yesterday. The EC should take serious note of this."
"They knew they cannot do anything after the polls, so that is why they approved the land sale deal in a hurry," he added.
Modi's attack on Vadra came on a day The Indian Express  reported that Hooda government officially legitimised the land deal between Vadra and real estate major DLF.
The land deal in Shikhopur village of Gurgaon had been cancelled by Haryana's former director general, Consolidation, Ashok Khemka.
"It is clear from this decision of the shameless Hooda government that both he and the Congress party have already accepted defeat in Haryana," Modi said in his speech.
The prime minister also launched a scathing attack on dynastic politics, saying Haryana had not seen a government in which political families had looked beyond themselves and their family members.
"We want to make Haryana free from this 'parivaar-vaad' (dynastic politics). In the last 25 years, have you seen a government in Haryana which worked for the welfare of people," he asked.
"In Haryana, the government works only for the chief minister and his family members. All political leaders have been running their shops in Haryana for themselves and their families," Modi said.
Modi also took a dig at jailed former chief minister Om Prakash Chautala's Indian National Lok Dal saying that he "did not need the support of people in jail" to succeed.
Referring to Chautala's statement at a recent rally that he  would take oath as the state chief minister from jail, Modi said, "Some people are spreading lies. Some are dreaming of taking oath from jail, showing old photos with them taken in a certain program."

Gandhi Maidan: No takers for prime mega eventvenueAn aerial view of the crowd gathered during the Dussehra celebrations at Gandhi maidan in Patna on Friday. (Source: PTI Photo)
Written by Santosh Singh | Posted: October 6, 2014 2:06 pm | Updated: October 6, 2014 2:07 pm
The biggest mega event venue of Bihar, Patna’s Gandhi Maidan, has become a jinxed place now after two back-to-back incidents — the October 27, 2013 Patna serial blasts that killed six people during Narendra Modi’s Hunkar rally and now the stampede killing 33 people. As the state government has started removing senior officers in a bid to deflate criticism from media and Opposition, the question remains: Who owns responsibility for Gandhi Maidan, the district administration, the Patna Municipal Corporation, both or none.
Just as Patna police control room has been watching and assessing CCTV footages of the October 3 stampede, it is coming out with “suggestion” of deaths having been caused because of “asphyxia (loss of oxygen), not necessarily stampede”. If people falling over one another and dying is not stampede, what else could be described as stampede?
Home secretary Amir Subhani and ADGP Gupteshwar Pandey, however, have sought to play down “stampede debate” by saying they had been trying to find out if the incident was triggered by rumour and conspiracy.
Though the stampede was more a matter of law and order and crowd management problems, the historic ground, sprawling 20 lakh square feet, has no maintenance budget. It has only watchmen on rolls to take care of its security. The revenue department that pockets the revenue from it being used for functions is not authorized to spend a penny on its upkeep. It has to depend on contingency fund from the Zila Nazareth for its cleaning on special occasions such as Independence Day and Republic Day.
Patna Municipal Corporation, which is supposed to clean it, sends its employees intermittently, mostly at the request of the district administration. Even the Rs 5,000 security deposit paid for social, political and religious functions is also not spent on its cleaning. The Revenue Department keeps the security deposit and Rs 20,000 daily allotment money. In short, no one is willing take responsibility for Gandhi Maidan that has been witness to many a political upheaval.
In contrast, the Gandhi Smarak inside the ground  is looked after by the building construction department.
A Patna additional district magistrate said: “The Revenue department has deputed two watchmen in three shifts to look after the 200-year-old ground. Four gardeners are also assigned to the ground”.
Though the state police claim to have installed over a dozen CCTV cameras to check peripheral activities of the ground, none of the cameras are working. The detection of five live bombs from the ground premises, barely 200 metres from police headquarters, after the Hunkar rally further exposed the government’s claims.
Revenue Minister Ramai Ram could not be contacted, but a senior revenue department official said it was the PMC that had to clean the venue. “The district continued…

Had Chavan done anything wrong  I would have divorced him: SatvasheelaChavan‘Had Chavan done anything wrong, I would have divorced him’: Satvasheela Chavan

After former deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar threatened to “expose” Prithviraj Chavan, the latter’s wife Satvasheela Chavan said her husband could not do anything wrong, and that she would have “divorced” him if he had.
Her reaction came after Ajit Pawar told The Indian Express last week that he would “expose” Chavan as he had filed an RTI application seeking the number of builders and developers Chavan favoured in the last two months of his tenure as the chief minister. “My husband would do no wrong… I am pretty confident about it,” said Satvasheela, one of Chavan’s campaign managers. “Had my husband done anything wrong as chief minister or in his entire political career, my family and I would have ‘divorced’ him,” she added.
By ‘divorce’, she meant “all of them would have stayed away from him” and “would have had nothing to do with him”. Satvasheela said she had said as much to her husband. One of the terms and conditions that was set for him when he joined politics, said Satvasheela, was to uphold the high values and principles that her in-laws stood for.
“I was not keen on my husband entering politics. But once it was decided that he would enter politics, I had made it clear that his family’s honour should remain at the top of his agenda. I am glad, in over three decades, he has not done anything that could have hurt the family honour,” she said. And, she stressed, her husband is “a man of values and principles”.
Satvasheela said she had inherited “high values” from her in-laws — both her father-in-law and mother-in-law had served as MPs at different times. “And I have passed on these values to our daughters and daughters-in-law.” Confident of a comfortable victory for her husband, Satvasheela said: “We are not money-minded, we are people-oriented people. Our doors have no security, anybody can come any time,” she said, adding that there was no threat from rivals, be it Vilas Patil-Undalkar, a rebel Congressman, or Atul Bhosale of the BJP.
Satvasheela, who goes around the constituency along with her relatives, said they did not promise anything that they could not fulfil. “We don’t open our mouth so wide that flies can get into it,” she said.
She added that she was campaigning in every corner of the constituency. “Ours is all about team work. Congress leaders and supporters are putting their best foot forward. Each one of us have been assigned a particular job, be it social media, looking after women’s wing, youth wing, rallies, corner meetings…,” she said. She said the Congress was regularly holding corner meetings and rallies.

Special prayers were observed in numerous masjids, and also the Sayyid Madani Dargah in Ullal.

MFs buy shares worth over Rs 4 000 crore in SeptemberMutual Funds buy shares worth over Rs 4,000 crore in September
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: October 3, 2014  | 14:45 IST
Picture for representation only. (Source: Reuters)
Improved market sentiment helped mutual funds pick up shares worth more than Rs 4,000 crore in September, making it the fifth consecutive monthly inflow.
Besides, they pumped in a staggering over Rs 23,000 crore in the debt market during the period.
The inflow in equities during the month followed net investment of close to Rs 6,000 crore in August, Rs 5,000 crore in July, Rs 3,340 crore in June and Rs 105 crore in May.
Prior to that, fund houses have been net sellers in the equity market since September last year, while they were net buyers of shares to the tune of Rs 1,607 crore in August 2013.
As per the latest data compiled by market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), Mutual Funds (MFs) purchased shares worth Rs 4,171 crore last month.
Industry experts attributed the inflows in equities to improvement in market sentiments, primarily due to the new government's reforms agenda.
Besides, retail participation in equity schemes has increased significantly in the last few months.
"The money in equities has been coming in the past few months and mostly in the second half of May after the General Election results," said a market expert.
Mutual funds collect money from investors and buy stocks, including IPOs (primary market) and bonds.
In the first eight months of 2014, MFs purchased shares worth over Rs 8,000 crore, while they pumped in a staggering Rs 4.6 lakh crore in the debt market.
MFs offloaded shares worth Rs 14,208 crore last fiscal, lower than Rs 22,749 crore offloaded in 2012-13.
The financial year ended March 31, 2014 also marked the fifth consecutive year of net outflows by mutual funds in the equities after pumping in a net amount of Rs 6,985 crore in the share market in 2008-09.

No Home Loan for Man Who Charges Rs 1.5 Crore Per SpeechYou are here: Home Industries
Former Fed Boss Ben Bernanke Denied Mortgage Refinance
NDTV | Written By: Varun Sinha | Updated On: October 03, 2014 13:37 (IST)
Banks Need to Take Blame for Some Problems: Citi India CEO
Imagine Reserve Bank Governor Raghuram Rajan being turned down for a home loan once he retires. Yet, that is exactly what happened to former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, who was till February 2014, the most powerful central banker in the world.
At a conference in Chicago on Thursday, Mr Bernanke said he was unsuccessful in refinancing his mortgage, Bloomberg News reported. Refinancing means replacing an existing loan with a new loan offering lower interest rate or more flexible tenure.
According to reports, Mr Bernanke wanted to refinance the mortgage on his Capitol Hill house, which he and his wife had bought for $839,000 (nearly Rs 5 crore at 1 dollar=60 rupee) in 2004.
Mr Bernanke, who has not taken up a regular job after two terms at the Federal Reserve, reportedly charges $250,000 (Rs 1.5 crore) for giving a speech and has also signed a book contract, which is expected to fetch him millions of dollars.
According to analysts, his application for refinance was rejected on grounds that he recently changed his job, a criteria that makes getting credit difficult even in India.
Mr Bernanke's revelation led to many hilarious tweets,
Binyamin Appelbaum@BCAppelbaum
Name: Ben Bernanke. Job? None. Other sources of income? I'm writing a book. And giving speeches. #DENIED
Money.com@MONEY
Don't feel bad if you can't refinance your mortgage: Even Ben Bernanke can't get a loan
zerohedge@zerohedge
Going forward instead of getting paid at a rate of $250,000 per hour, Ben Bernanke would prefer a mortgage refi LOI instead
The episode highlights the tight credit situation in the US property market, economists say. It also shows how rigid lending rules have become post the subprime mortgage crisis that triggered the global recession in 2008.
The subprime crisis resulted from banks extending mortgages to risky buyers on high interest rates. Large investment firms then bought such loans as mortgage-backed securities (MBSs). A number of such loans became delinquent starting in 2007, triggering bankruptcy across many banks in the US. The fallout was a major contributor to the global recession that followed.

Piketty: We re ignorant on inequalityThomas Piketty: We don't know enough about inequality
By Patrick Gillespie   @CNNMoney October 4, 2014: 9:17 AM ET
 
Warren and Piketty on the same stage
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
There are few rock stars in economic and tax policy, but Thomas Piketty is one of them. The famous French economist is an authority on income inequality. His book on the subject sold out on Amazon and spent 22 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list this year.
But even after penning a 700-page book , Piketty admits that he and other economists have only skimmed the top of the inequality iceberg.
"We know a little bit more than we used to know, but we still know far too little." Piketty said. "The book is trying to put together a large quantity of historical data on the evolution of income and wealth distribution."
Piketty spoke at New York University on Friday to defend the research for his tome, "Capital in the 21st Century." One of his hallmark arguments is that the United States needs a progressive tax system to stem economic inequality.
"If inequality is two dimensional, you don't want a one dimensional tax system" said Piketty, referring to how the wealthy earn a lot more income over their lifetime, but also often start out with a big boost by getting a large inheritance from their parents or grandparents.
Americas have often debated whether to tax the estates of those who die and leave money to the next generation.

Piketty used extensive and historical tax data on incomes and estates in his book to argue that inequality in the United States and Europe is back to pre-World War I levels -- think Downton Abbey.
He claims that the wealth held by the top 1% is outpacing the economic growth of many developed nations. It is also influencing American politics.
"I think this very large concentration of wealth also affects the political system," Piketty said Friday. Wealth offers "access to the time of people [politicians]. Access of influence. Access for the pleasure of access."

The latest data on income inequality from the Federal Reserve supports Piketty's findings. While most of Americans saw declining or flat income gains over the past four years, the uber rich saw widespread increases.
It's even more pronounced when it comes to stock market gains , one of the main drivers of wealth. Less than half of Americans have any money in the stocks at all. The top 10% of U.S. families have a median value of $282,000 invested in equities. Middle class families, in contrast, have only $14,000.

Piketty rocketed to celebrity status in March when his tome hit U.S. book stores and stunned the world by being a bestseller even though it's wonky and data heavy. During his book tour this year, Piketty met with the White House Council of Economic Advisers and U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew.
The harshest criticism of Piketty's work came from the Financial Times. Its economic editor, Chris Giles, argued Piketty used flawed estate tax data in Britain to reach his conclusions on how much wealth the nation's 1% has. Giles suggested that Piketty should have used survey data instead. Piketty responded to Giles, admitting the estate tax data was not perfect, but said it was his best option to measure income inequality over time.
Although Piketty used the similar metrics to compare countries, he said no story is the same.
"Each country has a very complex relationship to inequality," he said. "All I'm trying to prove is this big reminder of a large historical perspective on inequality and taxation."

General Motors Recalls Cover Over 57 000 CarsYou are here: Home Corporates
GM Recalls Cover Over 57,000 Vehicles
Reuters | Updated On: October 05, 2014 14:42 (IST)
Essar Steel Raises $1 Billion to Dollarise Balance Sheet
Washington: General Motors Co said on Saturday it was recalling more than 57,000 vehicles in the United States for potential problems ranging from a wiring problem in the steering column to inadvertent shutdown of the engine.
The recall of 57,182 vehicles in three categories came a day after GM recalled 524,384 cars and sport utility vehicles globally for different problems. The No. 1 US automaker now has issued 74 recalls this year, affecting some 30 million vehicles.
Saturday's recalls included 46,873 Pontiac G8s from 2008 and 2009, and Chevrolet Caprices marketed as police vehicles between 2011 and 2013. GM said the cars' ignition keys could be accidentally knocked out of the "run" position by the driver's knee, shutting off the engine and air bags. GM, which has a reconfigured key to solve the problem, said it was aware of one crash but no injuries or fatalities in the recalled vehicles.
A total of 10,005 Cadillac CTS-Vs from the model years 2004 through 2007 and STS-Vs manufactured from 2005 to 2007 also were recalled because of potential overheating in their fuel pump modules, which the automaker will replace.
A loose electrical connection in the steering column led GM to recall 304 Chevrolet Sonics. GM will repair the bad connection, which could restrict full deployment of air bags in a crash.
A GM statement said it was unaware of any crashes, injuries or fatalities related to the recalled Cadillacs and Sonics.
GM's most serious recall involved 2.6 million cars with defective ignition switches linked to at least 23 deaths.
On Friday, the company said it was recalling 430,550 Cadillac SRX and Saab 9-4X SUVs for possible loose joint and worn threads in the rear toe link assembly that could cause the vehicle to wander at highway speed and could possibly even separate, with the risk of causing a crash.
The Detroit company also recalled 93,834 newer South Korean-built Chevrolet Spark cars because of a risk of the hood opening unexpectedly during driving.
GM said it was not aware of any crashes, injuries or deaths from this problem, but in documents filed with the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration it cited two cases in the United Kingdom and one in Denmark where the vehicle hood opened while the customer was driving.
GM also said it had told US dealers on Thursday to stop selling the newly introduced 2015 Chevy Colorado and GMC Canyon mid-sized pickup trucks in advance of a recall to fix a potential air bag defect.

CBI requests HC for hearing on Chautala s bail tomorrowPress Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: October 5, 2014 6:12 pm
CBI has requested the Delhi High Court for an urgent hearing tomorrow on its plea seeking immediate cancellation of bail to former Haryana Chief Minister Om Prakash Chautala over alleged violation of conditions.
CBI sources said the plea, which was moved last night, had made a special mention for an urgent hearing for cancellation of bail to Chautala, who was granted the relief on medical grounds in May this year. The former Chief Minister had been participating in election rallies in Haryana which goes to polls on October 15.
The 79-year-old Indian National Lok Dal chief was convicted and sentenced to 10 years in jail in a teachers’ recruitment scam case last year and was granted bail to undergo medical treatment.
Following repeated violations of bail conditions, which were brought to the notice of court by CBI, Chautala had volunteered on September 26 that he would surrender after which he was directed to surrender on October 17.
The CBI requested the High Court for an early hearing and in view of holidays in the court, the matter is likely to be listed before a vacation bench tomorrow, the sources said.
Four-time Haryana chief minister Chautala volunteered to surrender as the court was about to order the constitution of a medical board of AIIMS doctors to consider the necessity of keeping Chautala hospitalised.
CBI has informed the court that Chautala addressed a rally at Jind in Haryana on September 25, the sources said.
In its petition, CBI has prayed for immediate cancellation of bail of Chautala and sought his return to jail.
Delhi High Court had on Friday issued a notice to CBI on a petition seeking immediate cancellation of Chautala’s bail on the grounds that he would “misuse the grace period of 17 days given to him to surrender” by taking part in campaigning.
A special CBI court on January 22, 2013, had convicted and sentenced Chautala, his son Ajay and eight others to 10 years in jail for their role in the illegal recruitment of 3,206 junior teachers in 2000.
Among the others convicted in the case, 44 were sentenced to four years in jail while one was handed a five-year prison term. All of them were found guilty of cheating, forgery, using fake documents and conspiracy under IPC and of abusing their official position under the Prevention of Corruption Act.
Chautala was chief minister for six months between 1980 and 1990, five days in July 1990 and for 14 days in 1991.
Finally, he had a complete five-year tenure starting in 1999.

CSE hoping to resume trade on C-star platformCSE hoping to resume trade on C-star platform
Press Trust Of India | Kolkata Oct 05, 2014 08:30 PM IST
The Calcutta Stock Exchange (CSE), one of the country's oldest, is hoping to resume trading on its own platform C-star, which has remained closed since April 2013.
"We are hopeful of resuming trading on our own trading platform C-Star soon after Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) circular core settlement guarantee fund which gives greater clarity on the risk for clearing corporations," CSE MD & CEO B Madhav Reddy told PTI.
"We are evaluating to meet the regulator's requirement in meeting the risks on the clearing corporation," he said.
Reddy said that the CSE had settlement guarantee fund of over Rs 100 crore. It had also appointed a consultant to sell a real estate asset to raise Rs 250-300 crore to be ploughed back for running of the exchange.
The sources said that with the new guidelines on risk management in place they would not even require to buy a stake in a clearing corporation which they were planning earlier by hiving off assets.
Due to clearing corporation hurdle, C-Star, the CSE's own platform, remained non-functional since April 2013.
CSE failed to meet capital adequacy of Rs 500 crore for the new clearing corporation and was trying to tie up with other operational clearing corporations to carry out the settlements. The CSE had also sought an extension of nine months for implementing the Sebi's guidelines for regional stock exchanges, which ended in May, 2014.

Sensex awaits earnings kick-offThe indices stayed range-bound and supports remained unbroken in the truncated week
October 4, 2014:  
As investors preferred to remain cautious in the holiday-shortened week, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) decided to keep the key rates unchanged in the monetary policy announced last week.
Though this wasn’t out of sync with market expectations, broader indices went through a bout of volatility during the session.
The mid- and small-cap stocks experienced a relief rally and the respective indices closed the week on a positive note.
Indices representing rate-sensitive sectors such as BSE Bankex and Realty fell 1.8 per cent and 3.5 per cent respectively for the week.
But the IT Index surged 3.6 per cent recording a new high on the back of stronger dollar to support margins. Quite a few IT stocks also registered new highs for the week.
US markets found their base and rallied intra-week, trimming recent losses in the Dow and S&P 500 index, as the US jobless rate fell to a six-year low of 5.9 per cent in September.
It was a better-than-forecast payrolls report; an expansion in service industries also strengthened the investors’ confidence. However, both the US and European indices closed the week in negative zone.
Domestic markets will remain closed on Monday on account of Bakrid; the opening on Tuesday could set the tone for the week. The July-September earnings reports will kick off with Infosys scheduled to report its quarterly results on October 10.
Foreign investors have been wary through the week, remaining net sellers for much of last week. Their action is also a factor to watch out for in the ensuing week.
Oscillators in the daily chart are sloping down after a minor rise indicating that the short-term trend could weaken from here.
The weekly oscillators extended the decline. The negative divergence in this chart shows possibility of the medium-term outlook turning uncertain too.
The weekly price rate of change oscillator is just above the zero line. A fall to negative terrain will indicate short term bearishness.
Sensex (26,567.9)
The Sensex was choppy as it zipped between the intra-week high of 26,851.3 and low of 26,481.3.
The week ahead: The index has been moving sideways over the past one month. If it fails to rally above 26,887, it will signify that the Sensex can decline to 26,220 or 26,032 in the week ahead.
To alter the short-term trend, the index needs to decline below 25,233. However, a strong surge above 26,887 can take the index higher to 27,354 and 27,531.
Medium-term trend: As long as the index continues to hold above the key support level of 26,000, the view remains positive. The next key medium-term support will be at 24,500. On the upside, a decisive close beyond 27,400 can take the index to 28,400 in the medium term.
Nifty (7,945.5)
The Nifty hovered between the intra-week levels of 7,923 and 8,030.9 and closed 0.29 per cent lower for the last week.
The week ahead: The Nifty is hovering just above its 50-day moving average line at about 7,900.
The inability to rally above 8,032 once again will be the cue for traders to initiate short positions with a stop-loss at 8,050 levels.
Targets are 7,790 and 7,718. A conclusive break of 7,718 will indicate that the index can trend downwards to 7,540 levels. Nevertheless, a strong rally above 8,032 can push the index higher to 8,180 and 8,236 in the short term.
Medium-term trend: As long as the Nifty holds above 7,000, the medium-term outlook stays positive. Key support is placed at 7,800.
Global cues
The global markets witnessed a sell-off during the initial part of the week. However, only the US indices recovered sharply on Friday. The European and Japanese markets saw steep declines, closing below the key support levels. This emits short-term bearish signals.
CBOE volatility index closed on a flat note in the midst of volatility. The Dow recouped most of the intra-week loss on Friday to close marginally above the key support at 17,000 levels.
Immediate supports are at 16,800 and 16,650. Resistances are at 17,150 and 17,350. We reiterate that a fall below 16,300 will weaken the short-term uptrend.
The Do0llar Index extended its uptrend by gaining 1.3 per cent last week. Now, it is headed towards the resistance at 89. Supports are at 86 and 85 levels.

One-day cricket
India have a chance to become the sole number one team, a position currently shared with South Africa, in the ICC ODI rankings if the hosts blank West Indies 5-0 in the series starting October 8 in Kochi.
If India wins all five matches of the series, they will rise to 116 ratings point and grab sole position on top of the table, the ICC said in a statement.
A 4-1 win for India and 3-0 win for Australia against Pakistan in the UAE will put both the sides on 114 ratings points, but Mahendra Singh Dhoni’s side will retain the number-one position by a fraction of a point.
In the individual rankings, third-ranked Virat Kohli will be aiming to reclaim the number-one spot in the ODI batsmen’s list when he takes the field against the West Indies.
Kohli surged to the top of the table earlier this year but slipped after missing the series against Bangladesh. He now trails number-one ranked AB de Villiers by 24 ratings points.
Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni (sixth) and opener Shikhar Dhawan (seventh) are the other India batsman featuring inside the top 10.
For the West Indies, Darren Bravo (37th) is the high-ranked batsman, while Lendl Simmons is in 40th position.
Both will be looking to gain ground on their nearest competitors when the action gets underway.
In the ICC Players Rankings for ODI Bowlers, Ravindra Jadeja is India’s top ranked bowler in fifth spot, 13 points shy of England’s James Anderson. In Sunil Narine’s absence, 18th placed Kemar Roach is the West Indies top ranked bowler and he will be keen to progress up the leader board.
Jadeja also has a chance to climb the rankings for all-rounders as he currently sits in third place, five points off Sri Lanka’s Mathews.

Hewlett-Packard plans to split in two: WSJHewlett-Packard plans to split into two, says WSJ report
David Henry     New York   Last Updated: October 6, 2014  | 14:53 IST

Hewlett-Packard , which has struggled to adapt to the new era of mobile and online computing, plans to split into two companies as it looks to put more focus on the faster-growing corporate services market, according to a Wall Street Journal report on Sunday.
The move, which could be announced as early as Monday, would be a monumental reshaping of one of technology's most important pioneers, which still has more than 300,000 employees and is on track to book $112 billion in revenue in the current fiscal year.
Under the reported plan, the Silicon Valley stalwart will separate its computer and printer businesses from its corporate hardware and services operations, and spin the unit off through a tax-free distribution of shares to stockholders next year.
A company spokeswoman declined to comment on the report.
HP's printing and personal computing business accounts for about half its revenue and profit, according to its previous quarter's financial results. It is not clear how many of HP's more than 3,00,000 staff work in each of the planned businesses.
Founded by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard in a Palo Alto, California garage in 1939, HP was one of the companies that shaped Silicon Valley and the PC revolution. Lately, however, it has struggled to adapt to the shift towards mobile computing, and it has been overshadowed by younger rivals.
HP's market value of $66 billion is dwarfed by technology giant Apple's $596 billion and Microsoft's $380 billion.
The company has also been overtaken by aggressive Chinese PC maker Lenovo, which is now the world's No. 1 PC maker by shipments. Dell, which is HP's closest competitor in the US and facing similar pressure, was taken private by founder Michael Dell in 2013.
SPIN-OFF TREND
HP is the latest in a line of companies, often under shareholder pressure, to spin off operations in an attempt to become more agile and to capitalize on faster-growing businesses. Last week online auction company eBay said it would spin off electronic payment service PayPal.
HP and some of its investors have long considered such a move, the Journal report noted. As one of the older big computer companies, for several years HP directors have discussed ways to restructure to keep up with technology upstarts.
A source familiar with the matter said HP had held merger talks with storage and cloud-computing firm EMC recently, as a way of moving more forcefully into online services.
Many investors and analysts have called for a break-up of the company, or a sale of the personal computer business, so that HP could focus on the more profitable operations of providing computer servers, networking and data storage to businesses.
Company executives have said in the past that personal computers underpin and support the company as a whole. HP did consider spinning off its PC division in 2011 under then-CEO Leo Apotheker, but ultimately decided against the idea.
The PC business has shown signs of life in recent quarters, growing broadly geographically as businesses replace aging machines. Even so, the report of the plan to split off that business surprised some on Wall Street.
"I wonder what would have changed in the board's thinking that previously they thought they needed computers together with services to properly serve large enterprises to now," said Hudson Square Research analyst Daniel Ernst.
"PCs and printing remain in long-term secular decline, and while HP has managed that business well, the challenges for that portion of the split company will only grow as the demand continues to erode, and commoditization forces prices down further."
The Journal, citing one of its sources, said the plans call for current HP CEO Meg Whitman to become CEO of the new so-called enterprise company and also be chairman of the PC and printer company.
Current HP lead independent director Patricia Russo would be chairman of the enterprise company. The CEO of the PC and printer company would be Dion Weisler, who is currently an executive in that division, the report said.

Google doodles adventurer Thor Heyerdahl s 100th birthdayOct 06, 2014 at  11:06am IST
Google doodles adventurer Thor Heyerdahl's 100th birthday
26

New Delhi: Commemorating ethnographer Thor Heyerdahl's 100th birthday, Google has posted a doodle on its homepage. Born on October 6, 1914, Thor Heyerdahl, the Norwegian adventurer, became notable for crossing the Pacific on a balsa log raft. He later detailed his harrowing 101-day voyage in the book Kon-Tiki.
Experts scoffed at Heyerdahl when he set off to cross the Pacific aboard a balsa raft in 1947, saying it would get water logged and sink within days. After 101 days and 4,900 miles, he proved them wrong by reaching Polynesia from Peru in a bid to prove his theories of human migration.
After Heyerdahl's 1947 voyage, conventional anthropologists dismissed the college dropout's theories, saying they were only the work of a gifted amateur. But the adventurer gained worldwide fame with the voyage. His book about that trip sold tens of millions of copies and his 1951 movie about the Kon-Tiki voyage won an Academy Award for best documentary.

He followed that trip with expeditions on reed rafts seeking to show that ancient people could have sailed from the Old World to the New.
His later studies focused on ancient step pyramids - including those in Peru and on the island of Tenerife off Africa - which he believed could be evidence of maritime links between ancient civilizations.
Before Heyerdahl made his voyage on the Kon-Tiki, he had to overcome a major obstacle: He was deathly afraid of water. He had nearly drowned twice as a child in Larvik, Norway, and overcame his fear only at age 22, when he fell into a raging river in Tahiti and swam to safety.
His later expeditions included voyages aboard the reed rafts Ra, Ra II and Tigris. His wide-ranging archaeological studies were often controversial and challenged accepted views.
Until his illness, Heyerdahl had maintained a daunting pace of research, lectures and public debate over his unconventional theories on human migration.
Heyerdahl died on April 18, 2002. He was 87. Relatives said he died in his sleep at a hospital near at Colla Michari, Italy, where he was spending the Easter holiday when he became ill.
Heyerdahl had stopped taking food, water or medication in early April after being diagnosed with a terminal brain tumor.
He spent his final days surrounded by family at Colla Michari, a Roman-era Italian village he bought and restored in the 1950s. His permanent home since 1990 was on the Spanish island Tenerife in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Morocco.
Though he lived and worked abroad for decades, Heyerdahl was a national hero in his homeland, where one newspaper crowned him Norwegian of the Century in a millennium reader poll.

Formula One: Felipe Massa was screaming for the race to stopWilliams' F1 driver Felippe Massa during the Japanese GP on Sunday. (Source: Reuters)
Reuters | Suzuka | Posted: October 6, 2014 1:34 am | Updated: October 6, 2014 9:16 am
Jules Bianchi’s accident in Sunday’s Japanese Grand Prix has prompted questions over whether the Formula One race should have been started earlier to beat deteriorating weather conditions. The Frenchman suffered severe head injury after his Marussia slid off the slippery track, drenched by rain brought in by the approaching typhoon Phanfone, and hit a recovery vehicle.
Adrian Sutil had crashed his Sauber at the same point a lap earlier. There had been talk earlier in the week of bringing the race forward to beat the worst of the typhoon but the decision was to start as scheduled at 1500 GMT. “We weren’t asked about our opinion so there is nothing I can say,” Sutil, who witnessed Bianchi’s accident, said when asked about it. “It was clear it got more wet and it would have been quite easy to make the race earlier.”
Retired triple world champion and Mercedes non-executive chairman Niki Lauda agreed: “They could have started earlier, there’s no question about it,” said the Austrian. “It was foreseeable. They could have started the race at one but I don’t take these decisions.”
The race started behind the safety car as rain drenched the 5.8 km circuit but, with conditions clearly too treacherous, it was red-flagged and the field led back into the pits at the end of the second lap. Conditions gradually improved enough for the drivers to race on intermediate tyres, though the showers returned near the end with the light also fading.
“For me personally it wasn’t (that bad),” Mercedes race winner Lewis Hamilton said. “There was more and more rain coming and… you started to see more reflections,” added the championship leader, who can count on a lot more grip in his car than Bianchi in his Marussia.
Brazilian Felipe Massa, however, said he was “screaming for the race to stop” when the rain returned towards the end. “I was screaming on the radio five laps before the Safety Car that there was too much water on the track,” said the Williams driver.

Protests could hurt Hong Kong economy: World BankProtests could hurt Hong Kong economy: World Bank
PTI
Tweet
Singapore, Oct 6:  
Protests in Hong Kong could hurt the city’s economy — as well as China’s — but the impact will depend on how long the “uncertainty” lasts, the World Bank’s chief Asia economist said today.
Sudhir Shetty said the Bank was closely monitoring the events in Hong Kong, where thousands of pro-democracy protesters have paralysed major streets for more than a week, leading to a tense standoff with the government.
“Obviously we, like every other set of economic analysts, are looking very closely at the situation and following it and looking at its impact,” he told reporters in Singapore.
“The impacts will be both on the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region itself, their economy, but also in terms of the broader impact on the Chinese economy,” he added.
“As of now, what we anticipate is obviously a greater impact on Hong Kong SAR — so slower growth in 2014 than was being anticipated earlier.”
Shetty added that “at this stage, our best estimates...are that there isn’t as yet significant spillover to the broader Chinese economy, but it is still something that we and others will continue to watch“.
The Bank does not have a forecast for Hong Kong’s economic growth because it covers only developing economies.
But it forecast Chinese growth to ease to 7.4 per cent this year and 7.2 per cent in 2015 from 7.7 per cent last year.
Shetty said Hong Kong is a “high-income” economy comparable to Taiwan.
“The only point I would make is that both the short-term impacts on growth as well as the more medium-term impact on its role as a financial centre will depend obviously very much on how the current uncertainty plays out,” he said.
“Other things being equal, uncertainty is not a good thing for economic activity.”
Hong Kong civil servants returned to work at the government’s headquarters today as the protests — which saw tens of thousands hit the streets last week — subsided in the face of a deadline to disperse.
But although numbers dwindled dramatically at the main protest sites, many said they would return later in the day to resume their campaign for free elections.
The government was forced to shut its headquarters on Friday — leaving 3,000 civil servants at home — because of the massed ranks of protesters blocking the access roads.
The city’s chief executive Leung Chun—ying had insisted the offices must reopen today, warning he would “take all necessary actions to restore social order”.

Modi clear about forging ties with neighbour...Australia
('Even before taking oath, Modi's priorities…)
WASHINGTON: External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj has said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has "very clear" priorities to forge good relations with neighbouring countries as part of his "fast track" diplomacy.
"Even before taking oath, Modi's priorities of good relations with all neighbours were very clear with all the SAARC heads being invited to the swearing-in ceremony," Swaraj said.
"His visits to Bhutan, Nepal, and Japan and now to US all have been judged as great success," she said.
Swaraj, who met leaders of 100 countries during the annual session of the UN General Assembly, said this was part of the "fast track" diplomacy of Prime Minister Modi.
During her address to the Indian diaspora at an event organised by the Overseas Friends of BJP (OFBJP)-USA in New Jersey last week, Swaraj said she faced challenges during Iraq crisis wherein Indian nurses were kidnapped by the Islamic State militants, said a media release.
Swaraj, who visited 11 countries in 100 days as part of the "fast-track" diplomacy, said the new government however was able to secure their release in less than 48 hours.
Swaraj promised to the members of the Sikh community present at the event that India will do everything possible to secure the release of Sikhs kidnapped in Iraq.
She narrated eloquently her experiences during her visits to Nepal, Japan, and other countries and explained the enthusiastic support from China and Australia in India's growth and development.
Swaraj is considered one of the prime movers of Modi government's much-praised "fast-track diplomacy".
She said the Modi government will take care of the Indian diaspora's needs and redress their complaints and concerns.
Vijay Jolly , Global convener of BJP Overseas Affairs, said OFBJP is actively engaged in working on the diaspora-related issues in the US.
During the programme, Swaraj inaugurated a book titled "The Idea of One Religion" with a foreword by Modi.
Additionally, Punjabi Commerce Chamber donated USD15,000 towards Prime Minister Relief Fund for J&K disaster relief.

Hisar: Ahead of Assembly elections in Haryana, Prime Minister Narendra Modi raised the poll pitch on Monday and slammed the parties in the state for rooting for only one family.
Addressing a rally in Hisar, Modi took on the Hooda government, the Congress and party President Sonia Gandhi's son-in-law Robert Vadra. He hit out at the Hooda government for legitimising the land deal between Robert Vadra and DLF, saying that it was in violation of the model code of conduct. He has also urged the Election Commission to act on it.
Modi said, "In the midst, the Hooda government finalised Robert Vadra's land deals as they were unsure whether they will be able to win polls. I think the party high command must have ordered."

Modi also asked voters to put an end to dynasty politics and give the mandate to BJP this time. "There have been governments in Haryana who have set shops for families. Has democracy been made for certain families to flourish?" Modi asked.
Taking at dig at INLD chief Om Prakash Chautala, Modi said that he did not need the support of gangsters and people who are in jail.
Modi, "There are parties that are distributing my pictures saying that post elections they too will be supporting me. I don't need the support of people in jails. I don't need the support of gangsters."
The BJP is contesting polls in Haryana alone for 90 seats after it broke ties with Haryana Janhit Congress.
The voting is on October 15 and the counting of votes is on October 19.

Haryana poll: Modi rakes up Vadra land dealAsks Election Commission to take serious note of Hooda’s government clearing the deal
Hisar (Har), Oct 6:  
Prime Minister Narendra Modi today asked the Election Commission to take serious note of Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda clearing the land deal between Robert Vadra and DLF, alleging that it was done hastily as the Congress faced “certain defeat” in the October 15 Haryana Assembly polls.
“They (Hooda government) know that after the elections, the son-in-law (Vadra) will not get any clearances for illegal deals. So, in between the election process, they have dared to take such a decision,” Modi said at an election rally here.
“I think Hooda was pressurised from the top (Congress leadership) to take such a decision,” he said.
The Election Commission, the Prime Minister hoped, would take “serious note” of the state government’s decision.
“I hope they will take appropriate action for any violation of the Model Code of Conduct,” he said raking up the alleged land deal involving Sonia Gandhi’s son-in-law.
The Hooda Government had reportedly legitimised the land deal while holding as illegal the order of the state’s former Director General (Consolidation) Ashok Khemka who had cancelled the mutation of the land in Gurgaon.
“It is clear from this decision of the shameless Hooda government that both he and the Congress party have already accepted defeat in Haryana,” Modi said.

Flipkarts mega sale day is proving to be a public relations nightmareExplosive Growth
October 6, 2014
You surely know by now, thanks to jacket ads in major dailies and promotions on television, outdoors and the internet, that Flipkart is having a mega sale day. And competitor SnapDeal is snapping at their heels for Twitter trend dominance.
Share
Tap image to zoom
Flipkart ‘s mega sale The Big Billion Day is essentially a pre-Diwali sale meant to capitalize on the holiday mood of this long weekend and as a doff of the hat to where the company’s billion-dollar journey began—founders Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal (college-mates, not relatives) started the company out of a Bangalore flat numbered 6-10.
Flipkart founders sent  personalized emails to customers informing them of the mega offers and even beefed up its logistics anticipating huge demand.
But the mega sale, which has been the focus of attention on social media all day, is turning out to be a PR disaster for the company, with many users pointing out, with screenshots and other evidence, three aspects that showed up the sales in poor light.
1) The discounts game deploys an old trick in the book—the company is marking up prices before offering what seems like a large discount.
2) The items shown on the homepage at huge discounts are actually out of stock. Too many error pages are showing up when trying to purchase discounted items, frustrating users.
3) Rival websites such as Amazon and Snapdeal are offering goods at cheaper prices than what Flipkart has labelled as the discounted price.
Twitter has been abuzz with people trying to buy items from the website and facing error pages—a problem acknowledged by Flipkart .
And even if you find that one product you want to buy, there is a big chance that it is already out of stock. In fact, some have complained about products being out of stock within just minutes after the sale commenced at 8:00 am.

Had Chavan done anything wrong  I would have divorced him: Satvasheela Chavan‘Had Chavan done anything wrong, I would have divorced him’: Satvasheela Chavan

After former deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar threatened to “expose” Prithviraj Chavan, the latter’s wife Satvasheela Chavan said her husband could not do anything wrong, and that she would have “divorced” him if he had.
Her reaction came after Ajit Pawar told The Indian Express last week that he would “expose” Chavan as he had filed an RTI application seeking the number of builders and developers Chavan favoured in the last two months of his tenure as the chief minister. “My husband would do no wrong… I am pretty confident about it,” said Satvasheela, one of Chavan’s campaign managers. “Had my husband done anything wrong as chief minister or in his entire political career, my family and I would have ‘divorced’ him,” she added.
By ‘divorce’, she meant “all of them would have stayed away from him” and “would have had nothing to do with him”. Satvasheela said she had said as much to her husband. One of the terms and conditions that was set for him when he joined politics, said Satvasheela, was to uphold the high values and principles that her in-laws stood for.
“I was not keen on my husband entering politics. But once it was decided that he would enter politics, I had made it clear that his family’s honour should remain at the top of his agenda. I am glad, in over three decades, he has not done anything that could have hurt the family honour,” she said. And, she stressed, her husband is “a man of values and principles”.
Satvasheela said she had inherited “high values” from her in-laws — both her father-in-law and mother-in-law had served as MPs at different times. “And I have passed on these values to our daughters and daughters-in-law.” Confident of a comfortable victory for her husband, Satvasheela said: “We are not money-minded, we are people-oriented people. Our doors have no security, anybody can come any time,” she said, adding that there was no threat from rivals, be it Vilas Patil-Undalkar, a rebel Congressman, or Atul Bhosale of the BJP.
Satvasheela, who goes around the constituency along with her relatives, said they did not promise anything that they could not fulfil. “We don’t open our mouth so wide that flies can get into it,” she said.
She added that she was campaigning in every corner of the constituency. “Ours is all about team work. Congress leaders and supporters are putting their best foot forward. Each one of us have been assigned a particular job, be it social media, looking after women’s wing, youth wing, rallies, corner meetings…,” she said. She said the Congress was regularly holding corner meetings and rallies.

Country's largest carmaker  Maruti Suzuki India (MSI) today launched mid-sized sedan Ciaz with an introductory price starting at Rs 6.99 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi).
The petrol variants of the sedan are priced between Rs 6.99 lakh and Rs 9.34 lakh while the diesel variants are priced between Rs 8.04 lakh and Rs 9.8 lakh, respectively (ex-showroom Delhi). "Millions of Indians have enjoyed Maruti cars for years. These customers are looking to upgrade to mid-sized sedans. Ciaz is for them, " MSI Managing Director and CEO Kenichi Ayukawa told reporters here.
He added that the company has been able to achieve localisation content of 98 percent for the car. "Ciaz has been designed keeping in mind the needs and expectations of Indian sedan customers," Ayukawa said. Ciaz comes in petrol and diesel options, powered by 1.4 litre and 1.3 litre engines, respectively.
MSI, along with its vendors, has invested Rs 620 crore on development of Ciaz. The mid-sized sedan has been developed on a completely new platform. In addition to the domestic market, the company also plans to export the car to markets in the Middle East, Latin America and Africa.
In India, Ciaz would compete with Honda City, priced between Rs 7.19 lakh and Rs 11.05 lakh and Hyundai Verna tagged between Rs 7.39 lakh and Rs 11.72 lakh, respectively (ex showroom Delhi).
Since the bookings opened for the car last month, the company has received orders for 10,000 units. Ciaz will replace the SX4 sedan, which had a limited success. At its peak, SX4 sold about 3,000 units a month, while the current segment leader Honda City sells about 5,000 units a month. Overall, the mid-sized segment witnesses sales of around 16,000 units per month.
Maruti Suzuki stock price
On November 24, 2014, Maruti Suzuki India closed at Rs 3346.05, down Rs 2.75, or 0.08 percent. The 52-week high of the share was Rs 3397.60 and the 52-week low was Rs 1541.25.
The company's trailing 12-month (TTM) EPS was at Rs 102.82 per share as per the quarter ended September 2014. The stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio was 32.54. The latest book value of the company is Rs 694.45 per share. At current value, the price-to-book value of the company is 4.82.

India, Pakistan sweet sharing tradition on Eid a casualty to ceasefire violations

New Delhi: As the stand-off between India and Pakistan intensifies in Jammu and Kashmir, the countries have called off sweet sharing tradition along the Attari border on Eid. This cancellation comes after heavy shelling and firing from across the border has left five villagers dead and 29 injured in Jammu and Kashmir.
Defence Minister Arun Jaitley deplored the ceasefire violations by Pakistan and said the Indian armed forces were "fully ready" and are responding to each of these provocations from across the border.
"Armed forces fully ready to respond to each of these Pakistani provocations," said Jaitley
#india #pakistan #ceasefire violation #eid
Earlier, Home Minister Rajnath Singh asked Pakistan to stop ceasefire violations. "Pakistan should stop ceasefire violations now and understand the reality that times have changed in India," Singh said.
Meanwhile, Border Security Force officials said that they will take up the matter in the next meeting between both sides.
Congress and BJP condemned the ceasefire violations by Pakistan and said it was a "serious" issue.
"Whatever Pakistan is doing is certainly a serious matter. And we want to tell Pakistan that indulging in such activities is not good for that country," BJP leader Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said.
Condemning Pakistan's actions, former External Affairs Minister Salman Khurshid said it is despicable that such incidents have occurred on Eid. "There cannot be anything worse than this," the Congress leader said.
Five villagers were killed and 29 injured in heavy mortar shelling and firing by Pakistani troops targeting hamlets and outposts along the International Border in Jammu district since Sunday night in one of the worst ceasefire violations.
This was the 11th ceasefire violations along Indo-Pak border in Jammu and Kashmir during last four days.
On October 3, Pakistani troops and Rangers violated ceasefire in Gulmarg sector of Kashmir Valley and in Poonch and Jammu sectors in which a girl was killed and six persons were injured.

Modi set to storm Pawar bastionsPreparations are on at the HA ground in Pimpri where Narendra Modi will hold a rally on Oct 9.
Written by Manoj Dattatrye More | Pune | Posted: October 6, 2014 2:44 pm
After waging a verbal war with NCP chief Sharad Pawar during the first two days of his Maharashtra campaign, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will now head towards Baramati, the Pawar family’s bastion, where he will address a rally on Thursday, October 9. On the same day, Modi will visit Pimpri-Chinchwad, another Pawar stronghold as the NCP has been in control of the local civic body for over a decade now. BJP leaders said the party was going all out to cause a dent in Pawar’s forts.
When Modi holds his first rally in Baramati on October 9, it will also be the first time when a prime minister will be addressing a public meeting there in 34 years. Last time a PM made it to Baramati was in 1980 when Indira Gandhi campaigned for Congress (I) candidate Marutrao Chopde. “Indira Gandhi had come to campaign against Sharad Pawar who was then the head of Congress (S). Gandhi’s campaigning had no effect as Pawar saheb was elected with a huge margin,” said Kiran Gujar, who has been a close associate of Pawar for over four decades. Pawar had polled 54,919 votes while his rival could manage only 26,550 votes. As many as 1,838 votes were invalid. Pawar was contesting the Assembly elections that time.
On October 9, Modi will address a rally at the HA ground in Pimpri. The last time a PM visited the industrial town of Pimpri-Chinchwad was in 1984 when Rajiv Gandhi had addressed a rally at Sangvi Keshri college grounds in Chinchwad.
“There was a huge crowd in attendance at Rajiv’s rally,” recalled Babu Nair, a Congress leader. Gandhi had come to campaign for Congress candidate Shankarrao Bajirao Patil, who was contesting from Baramati Parliamentary constituency. Pimpri-Chinchwad was then part of the Baramati constituency. Now, it is part of Maval.
The massive turnout, however, did not translate into votes for the Congress candidate who lost by a margin of over 1,40,000 votes to Pawar. Shankarrao Bajirao Patil was the father of Congress leader Harshvardhan Patil.
BJP’s Bhosari candidate Eknath Pawar said the PM’s rally would swing votes heavily in favour of the two BJP candidates and one alliance candidate in Pimpri-Chinchwad. “We are all looking forward to the rally as it will be the first of its kind by any prime minister,” he said.
The NCP, however, said the rallies would not make any difference to the party. “It did not make a difference to Pawar forts then and it will not make a difference even today,” said Gujar.
Yogesh Behl, the Pimpri-Chinchwad NCP president who is considered the right hand man of Ajit Pawar, said: “Supriya Sule (Pawar’s daughter) had led by a margin of 70,000 votes in Baramati Lok Sabha seat during the recent continued…

Ben Affleck gets into heated debate over IslamPress Trust of India | Los Angeles | Posted: October 6, 2014 2:43 pm
‘Gone Girl’ star Ben Affleck clashed with author Sam Harris over the topic of Islam and radicalism on TV show ‘Real Time With Bill Maher’.
The 42-year-old actor, who was on a panel discussion on current affairs became angry when Maher and Harris started talking about radical elements in Islam.
“We have been sold this meme of Islamophobia, where criticism of the religion gets conflated with bigotry towards muslims as people. It’s intellectually ridiculous,” Harris said.
Affleck interrupted him saying, “Hold on — are you the person who officially understands the codified doctrine of Islam?”
He then told them their talk was “gross and racist”
Harris argued that Islam was currently the “motherlode of bad ideas” to which Maher agreed but an angry Affleck said, “It’s just an ugly thing to say.”
Affleck said, “How about the more than a billion people who are not fanatical, who don’t punish women, who just want to go to school, have some sandwiches, pray five times a day and don’t do any of the things that ‘all Muslims do’? You’re stereotyping. You’re taking a few bad things and you’re painting the whole religion with that same brush.”
The actor finally countered Harris’ views by saying that he disagreed with everything that he said.
“We’ve killed more Muslims than they’ve killed us, by an awful lot… yet we’re exempted from these things because they’re not really a reflection of what we believe in… I’m specifically telling you that I disagree with what you think,” the actor said.

Alls not well with AyurvedaKochi | Posted: October 6, 2014 2:34 pm
By Steena Joy
The science of Ayurveda, the origins of which lies in our very own Kerala, stands in danger of losing its authenticity and with it, the hordes of wellness tourists who flock to the state in search of a cure that eludes modern allopathy.
The numerous Ayurveda resorts and Kerala government Green Leaf certified treatment centres will also need to focus their attention on sourcing of the medicinal herbs needed in Ayurveda which are slowly depleting.
Dr G G Gangadharan, medical director, Institute of Ayurveda and Integrative Medicine (I-AIM) Healthcare Centre and chairman, National Steering Committee for Global Ayurveda Festival, (a biennial get together of the Ayurveda fraternity not only from Kerala but from the world over) says, “The global wellness market is worth some five trillion. India earns Rs 9,000 crore from Ayurveda services alone and we have not even seen the tip of the iceberg as far as this science is concerned.
Ayurveda is the only area where India is 5,000 years ahead of other countries. But this success story is in danger. Now even other countries like Switzerland, and Sri Lanka, our neighbours are offering Ayurveda. We have to make our visa procedures simpler and we have to document and up our research on this science. As Ayurveda is not officially recognised by many countries, it is difficult for patients travelling to India for Ayurveda to get medical insurance.”
He added, “What is even more alarming is on the production front. On the one hand, mass production of Ayurvedic medicines is diluting the science. On the other, a shortage of herbs required to produce these medicines is looming. When the demand for Ayurveda increases, how will the treatment centres get the plants and herbs needed for production? Ayurveda uses some 1600 plants and herbs of which only 120 are in actual usage. Of these about 60 are not easily available.”
Dr Gangadharan felt that a strong backward integration model needs to be adopted. “We have urged the government to implement a nursery technology programme to step up cultivation. Here again, some plants need to be cultivated ‘in situ’ in their original environment or they will lose their medicinal value. Some herbs like guggul which is the most used in Ayurveda is difficult to cultivate. So the government has to subsidise farmers and have a buyback arrangement.”
Baby Mathew, chairman and managing director, Somatheeram Ayurveda Group, opined, “Because of the good climate and soil, and also the availability of herbs and plants, Kerala is the ideal place for practising Ayurveda. It is good that the government has implemented GMP in Ayurvedic medicine manufacturing. But sadly, there are no high standard research facilities for Ayurveda like the IITs for technology or IHMs for hotel management. The government has finally given approval for setting up an Ayurveda University, so at least the tourism department and the health department are on the right track. But, we also need to give our Ayurveda treatment centres the ambience of continued…

Modis Swachh Bharat invite: Congress in Kerala wants Shashi Tharoor to come cleanTharoor was rapped by both the A and I groups in the state Congress
Written by Shaju Philip | Posted: October 6, 2014 2:33 pm | Updated: October 8, 2014 2:54 pm
Days after Congress MP Shashi Tharoor said he felt “honoured” to accept Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s invitation to join the Swachh Bharat Mission, state party leaders on Monday threatened disciplinary action against him.
“The sentiment of the Congress workers is against Tharoor. It was the hard work of hundreds of Congress workers that ensured his victory in the Lok Sabha elections. He should have been aware of that. He should not have fallen into the trap laid by Modi,’’ said Kerala Congress president V M Sudheeran.
Cutting across factions, party leaders said Tharoor’s stand was deplorable and went against the basic tenets of the Congress. While state party vice-president V D Satheeshan said those who have communal agenda should be ousted from the party, several others sought disciplinary action against Tharoor.
Criticising Tharoor’s stand, Kerala Home Minister Ramesh Chennithala said party workers had strong reservations in this regard. Sudheeran said they had received a complaint against the MP and the issue would be discussed with senior leaders including Chief Minister Oommen Chandy.
Addressing a press conference, state party vice-president M M Hassan, a close aide of Chandy, said Tharoor should stop “praising” Modi and warned him of disciplinary action.
Party general secretary M Liju, a Chennithala loyalist, said Tharoor had failed to understand Modi’s communal agenda. The people have not elected him for patting Modi, he said.
Tharoor posted his defence on his Facebook page. “I am astonished that anyone would suggest that I am pro-BJP. I have a 30-year paper trail of published writings on my idea of India and my profound belief in India’s pluralism. Being receptive to specific statements or actions of BJP leaders does not remotely imply acceptance of the party’s core Hindutva agenda. The PM pitched his appeal as a non-political one and I received it in that spirit. I am a proud Congressman and a proud Indian. In short: not pro-BJP, just pro-India,’’ he said.
As criticism against him mounted, Tharoor later tweeted, “Deeply concerned by reports of 5 killed and 50 injured in Pakistani shelling today. Over 100 ceasefire violations on LoC since BJP came into power.”
On Thursday, Tharoor, one of the nine eminent persons invited by Modi to join the Swachh Bharat Mission, had tweeted, “Honoured to accept the invitation of PM @narendramodi to join Clean India campaign. Just landed in Bucharest & heard the news. Action on return.”
In a series of tweets, where he tagged Modi and other BJP leaders, Tharoor said he would take action on it after returning to India.

Puppies For Sale
A store owner was tacking a sign above his door that read "Puppies For Sale." Signs like that have a way of attracting small children, and sure enough, a little boy appeared under the store owner`s sign. "How much are you going to sell the puppies for?" he asked.
The store owner replied, "Anywhere from $30 to $50."
The little boy reached in his pocket and pulled out some change. "I have $2.37," he said. "Can I please look at them?"
The store owner smiled and whistled and out of the kennel came Lady, who ran down the aisle of his store followed by five teeny, tiny balls of fur.
One puppy was lagging considerably behind. Immediately the little boy singled out the lagging, limping puppy and said, "What`s wrong with that little dog?"
The store owner explained that the veterinarian had examined the little puppy and had discovered it didn`t have a hip socket. It would always limp. It would always be lame.
The little boy became excited. "That is the puppy that I want to buy."
The store owner said, "No, you don`t want to buy that little dog. If you really want him, I`ll just give him to you."
The little boy got quite upset. He looked straight into the store owner`s eyes, pointing his finger, and said, "I don`t want you to give him to me. That little dog is worth every bit as much as all the other dogs and I`ll pay full price. In fact, I`ll give you $2.37 now, and 50 cents a month until I have him paid for."
The store owner countered, "You really don`t want to buy this little dog. He is never going to be able to run and jump and play with you like the other puppies."
To his surprise, the little boy reached down and rolled up his pant leg to reveal a badly twisted, crippled left leg supported by a big metal brace. He looked up at the store owner and softly replied, "Well, I don`t run so well myself, and the little puppy will need someone who understands!"
We ALL need is someone who understands us!!!
Get Set for some Action Tomorrow!!

Dear Agento, the same is the case with me. I have been holding since Valuepick recommended it through the downturn. Then came the news which you have referred. In between I came through a report of the Company doing well in `Business India` some time in 2011. Even a part say 50% of the stated valuation at which the part business has been sold is given back to  investors, the price is supposed to be more than 100/. But considering that such a development would have caught fancy of the market as Market always discounts such information in advance. The Management`s intention about what they intend to do with the sum is not known, nor therefore known to Market. But one thing is clear, without the sold part of the business there is not much in balance in the Company. warm regards!

Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and Industry Minister Yashodhara Raje Scindia will inaugurate the plant and would also lay foundation stone of the proposed composite textile project comprising spinning units of 185,000 yarn spindles, bed linen unit of 500 looms, captive power plant of 60 Mw.

Small cap indices of BSE reap gains  outshine blue-chipsSmall cap indices of BSE reap gains, outshine blue-chips
PTI     New Delhi   Last Updated: October 3, 2014  | 18:25 IST

Driven by bullish stock market sentiment and strong participation from retail investors, the mid-cap and small-cap indices of the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) have given big returns, surging up to 62 per cent and outperforming the larger index Sensex so far this year.
An analysis of the three indices shows that while the small-cap index of the BSE has given a return of 62.44 per cent, the mid-cap index followed with 41.84 per cent.
On the other hand, gain in the blue-chip Sensex has been at 25.49 per cent so far in 2014.
The Sensex touched its life-time high of 27,319.85 on September 8.
The mid-cap index touched its one-year peak of 10,000.86 on September 15 and the small-cap index hit its 52-week high of 11,245.52 on the same day.
Analysts said that when markets rally, these stocks make big gains than the front-lines. But during the times of uncertainty one witnesses greater losses in mid and small-cap counters.
Market experts said that positive investor sentiment following the formation of a new government and robust foreign fund inflows have been driving the domestic equity markets.
In 2013, small and mid-cap stocks had declined as much as 12 per cent.
Retail investors are major participants in mid-cap and small-cap stocks and activity in this segment has increased over the past few months.
Marketmen say smaller stocks are generally bought by local investors, while overseas investors focus on blue-chip shares.
The mid-cap index tracks companies with a market value that is on average one-fifth of blue-chips or large firms.
Small-cap firms are almost a tenth of that.

Judge: IRS watchdog not exempt from disclosure laws inWhite House caseBy Josh Hicks October 3 Follow @reporter_hicks
A federal court this week said the Internal Revenue Service’s inspector general is not exempt from disclosure rules as it investigates whether the White House received unauthorized access to protected taxpayer information.
Judge Amy Jackson, with the U.S. District Court in Washington, ordered the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration to process a Freedom of Information Act request from a conservative legal group seeking documents related to the probe.
Federal law allows federal agencies to withhold information if releasing it might compromise law-enforcement efforts. TIGTA relied on that exception in arguing that merely acknowledging the documents could harm its review.
Treasury Inspector General Russell George (Charles Dharapak/AP)
Jackson concluded that TIGTA already waived the exemption by publicly acknowledging its investigation.
TIGTA also argued that releasing the requested documents would essentially amount to releasing tax returns. Jackson rejected that claim as well, noting that the requested information would not identify individual taxpayers.
“This information is not ‘unique to a particular taxpayer’ and it is not ‘return information,’ as broadly as that term may be,” she wrote.
The judge’s order came as part of a lawsuit by Cause of Action, a conservative organization that has accused the Obama administration of targeting taxpayers for harassment.
Dan Epstein, the group’s executive director, called the court’s decision a “decisive win” for government transparency and accountability. “The court has ruled that the federal government cannot hide behind confidentiality laws to prevent Americans from knowing if our president has gained unauthorized access to their tax information,” he said.
TIGTA declined to comment on the decision Friday.
The watchdog agency’s investigation stems from an earlier discovery that the IRS targeted nonprofit groups for extra scrutiny based on their names and policy positions. The IRS has attributed the actions to bureaucratic bungling, but many conservatives insist that the administration was trying to hinder right-leaning groups during the 2010 and 2012 election cycles.

Bhel Comes Out With Whistle-Blower PolicyNew Delhi: Adhering to stronger corporate governance standards, state-owned Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (Bhel) has put in place a policy for whistle-blowers with safeguards to protect their identity and prevent victimisation.
Engineering and manufacturing player Bhel has interests in diverse areas including power, transmission, renewable energy and defence.
With the whistle-blower policy, the company also meets existing regulations in this regard.
Under the policy, the whistle-blower would not be subjected to "victimisation" and his or her identity would not be revealed.
"Any other employee assisting in the investigation or furnishing evidence in respect of complaint shall also be protected."
However, the policy makes it clear that no protection would be provided from disciplinary action in case the whistle-blower makes "false, motivated or vexatious complaint".
As part of safeguard measures, it has been suggested that "the text of the complaint should be carefully drafted so as not to give any details or clue as to the whistle blower's identity".
"However, the details of the complaint should be specific and verifiable."
Complaints should be addressed to the competent authority or audit committee chairman of the company as the case may be. Then the matter would be referred to the screening committee, which has to take a call on whether to proceed further within one week.
In instances where the complaint is against a board level executive, the same would be referred to the Department of Heavy Industry's Chief Vigilance Officer as Bhel comes under Heavy Industry and Public Enterprises Ministry.
To ensure better corporate governance standards and transparency, the new Companies Act - whose most provisions came into force from April 1 - requires companies to have a vigil mechanism for directors and employees to report genuine concerns. The listing agreement between companies and stock exchanges also has a similar provision.
The policy took effect at Bhel from September 16.

Era of alliances over  want full majority  says PM Modi in MaharashtraComments
Prime Minister Narendra Modi address an election rally in Gondia, Maharashtra on Sunday. (Source: PTI)
Stating that the era of poll alliances was over, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday urged the people of Maharashtra to give BJP “a full majority” in the October 15 Assembly elections.
Accusing the Congress-NCP regime of “looting” the state, Modi said both will be equally punished.
“The era of alliances has ended. If you want Maharashtra to progress, then give us full majority,” Modi said, addressing an election campaign rally here.
Modi cited examples of adjoining Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh where voters had given the BJP a full majority. “Maharashtra could be the number one state in the country,” he said.
NCP chief Sharad Pawar chose the Rajya Sabha route for himself but made Praful Patel a scapegoat and fielded him for Lok Sabha polls, Modi said.
“The Maharashtra Assembly polls will decide the fate of Maharashtra,” he said.
Modi observed that the inflation rate has come down for the first time in five years and cited reduction in petrol and diesel prices as important work done by his government.
“Both Congress and NCP have destroyed Maharashtra. Both are equally to blame and both will be equally punished,” he said.
“The maximum number of terror acts occur in Maharashtra. After Uttar Pradesh, the maximum communal riots occur in Maharashtra,” he said.
Appealing to the Maoists to shun violence and return to the mainstream, Modi said, “Put down guns from your shoulders and put ploughs on your shoulder. You will get relief.”
“Return to the mainstream. Stop the bloodshed. Be a partner in the country’s progress. Nobody has succeeded through violence,” he said.
“To political pundits, I wish to say, look around you and feel the atmosphere. We are going to get a clear majority (in Maharashtra),” he said.
“Sharad Pawar was agriculture minister, but in Maharashtra, 3,700 farmers committed suicide per year. However, Congress and NCP government did not shed tears for them. Such a cruel government never existed anywhere,” Modi said.
“Here, we had a chief minister (Prithviraj Chavan) who declined to share the stage with me. How can we work together if such governments are there in Maharashtra,” he said.
Modi described LBT as “looto baato tax.” “BJP will free you from LBT after being voted to power in Maharashtra,” he said.
“Congress people ask me to give them an account of work done by our government. First give me an account of your 60 years of work. After that, ask me the account of my 60 days in office. I am accountable to the people,” Modi said.
“Had I been allowed to complete the work of raising the height of the Narmada dam, Maharashtra would have got free electricity worth Rs 400 crore per year,” he said.
“Now, I can assure you that the work will be continued…

Obama: Heaven and earth must be moved to help disabled veteransBy Katie Zezima October 5 Follow @katiezez
President Obama delivers remarks at the dedication of the American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial near the U.S. Capitol in Washington on Sunday. (Reuters)
President Obama paid tribute Sunday to America's disabled veterans, saying the country must "move heaven and earth" to make sure they get the benefits they deserve and warned against rushing into war unless it is absolutely necessary.
Obama, speaking at the dedication of the American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial in the shadow of the U.S. Capitol, did not overtly mention the scandal involving the Department of Veterans Affairs over wait times for accessing care or his decision to open up a military campaign against the Islamic State militant group in Iraq and Syria.
But the specter of war — and supporting those going into it and thanking, honoring and taking care of those returning from it with wounds both mental and physical — imbued the somber speech. Obama acknowledged the "painful truth" that the country had not always supported its veterans and said memorials such as this one are a step forward toward fulfilling what he has called a solemn, critical obligation.
"In the United States of America, those who have fought for our freedom should never be shunned and should never be forgotten,” Obama said, standing near a reflecting pool with a flame in the middle that is part of the memorial, which sits adjacent to the Botanic Garden.
"When our wounded veterans set out on that long road of recovery, we need to move heaven and earth to make sure they get every single benefit, every single bit of care that they have earned, that they deserve," Obama said.
The American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial, built adjacent to the U.S. Botanic Garden and within view of the Capitol building is set to open Oct. 5, 2014. (American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial)
The memorial, which has been 16 years in the making , is the first in the country to specifically honor disabled veterans. Eighteen quotes from veterans and their families are etched into the glass panels, bronze sculptures and granite walls.
"If you want to see the character of our country, a country that never quits, look at these men and women," Obama said to the 3,100 people gathered on a sparkling fall day, many of them in wheelchairs or with lost limbs. At one point he asked those who have been wounded in battle to stand or raise their hands; hundreds of people did so.
Obama came into office vowing to end wars and made mention of the fact that the combat mission in Afghanistan is to wind down at the end of this year. But he started another offensive last month, authorizing military action against the Islamic State in Syria. He did the same in Iraq in August. As he has in the past — including to the annual convention of the American Legion in August — Obama warned against engaging in war unless there was a clear, pressing reason to do so.
"Let’s never rush into war — because it is America’s sons and daughters who bear the scars of war for the rest of their lives. Let us only send them into harm’s way when it’s absolutely necessary. And if we do, let’s always give them the strategy, the mission and the support that they need to get the job done," Obama said. When the mission is over, he said. "let us stand united as Americans and welcome our veterans home with the thanks and respect they deserve."
Obama said it is here at the memorial that he sees the perseverance and determination of men and women who have been wounded both physically and mentally in battle. The "unseen wounds of war," Obama, who in August announced 19 executive actions to help improve mental health care for veterans, said, "are just as real as any other, and they can hurt just as much, if not more."
Obama thanked the family, friends and support networks of disabled veterans, and he told veterans that, if they are hurting, they should never be ashamed to ask for help. He urged Americans who see veterans, "maybe with a prosthetic arm or leg, maybe burns on their face — don’t ever look away." He added: "You go up and you reach out, and you shake their hand, and you look them in the eye and you say those words every veteran should hear all the time: 'Welcome home, thank you.'"
Obama was flanked onstage by VA Secretary Robert McDonald, Interior Secretary Sally Jewell and actor Gary Sinise, who played Lt. Dan in "Forrest Gump" and has become a veterans advocate.
McDonald, who was confirmed as VA secretary in July, months after Eric Shinseki resigned, also did not mention the scandal. Instead, he called disabled veterans the VA's "most important focus."
"Few have given more to America," McDonald said. "This imposing memorial stands as a powerful reminder of their service and their sacrifice."

Schools join Jaya verdict protestsWritten by Arun Janardhanan , Johnson T A | Chennai | Posted: October 6, 2014 12:29 am
With protests erupting across Tamil Nadu against the conviction of J Jayalalithaa in a corruption case, an association of private schools on Sunday announced that their institutions will remained closed on Tuesday in solidarity with the former Chief Minister.
While the association call-ed for closure of all private sch-ools in the state, many schools took an opposite stand, making attendance on Tuesday compulsory. For instance, the Sacred Heart Matriculation Higher Secondary School here sent messages to parents that it reopens on October 7 and attendance was compulsory.
An association of college managements under the Anna University, Coimbatore, also announced closure of their institutions Tuesday in support of Jayalalithaa, who was sentenced to four years in jail in the disproportionate assets case.
Meanwhile, the IT wing of AIADMK has launched a massive WhatsApp campaign in support of ‘Amma’. The campaign sends out lakhs of messages every day with the help of more than 3,000 SIM cards and a computer algorithm, which was used by the party in the last LS polls. One of the coordinators of the party’s IT wing said the messages are being sent from SIM cards located in different parts of the country. “Otherwise, we are allowed to send only 100 messages through WhatsApp. So we have devised a computer programme through which we can send any number of messages at a time,” he said.
The messages are carefully drafted so as not antagonize those who are not party sympathisers. They are sent during peak hours, between noon and 3 pm and 6 pm and 9 pm, considering the behavioural patterns of Indian WhatsApp users. “To avoid interruptions on phone data networks due to massive data transferring, origin of 3,000 SIM cards are set at different locations in the country,” said a party’s IT volunteer.
While AIADMK had spent several lakhs for a similar campaign during polls with a budget allocation from the party, the expenditure in this campaign is yet to be revealed. Experts say it may run to several lakhs. “Amma will rise, like the phoenix!” says one WhatsApp sticker.
According to party sources, the brain behind the campaign is Aspire K Swaminathan, an Amma sympathiser and owner of leading online education firm, Aspire.
Jayalalithaa sympathisers are also organising special prayers at temples, churches and mosques across the state seeking divine intervention on her bail plea. Organisers said a special prayer session will be organised at Quaide Millath Jumma Masjid here on Monday. “Over 3,000 people will attend the prayer at 7 am. It is part of the usual Bakrid prayers, and we are praying for Amma too,” said an organiser.
The state has yet again turned a ground for a loud and extensive poster campaign. Last time such posters were put out was after the video footage capturing the last moments of Balachandran, the 12-year-old son of LTTE continued…

Broadways bountifully imaginative Curious IncidentBy Peter Marks October 5 Follow @petermarksdrama
NEW YORK – As she did with “War Horse,” director Marianne Elliott devises in the stimulating new stage adaptation of “The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time” a luminous technological raiment for a story aimed at older children and adults. Last time, the man-made architecture of a life-sized horse raised the proceedings (for which she was co-director) to the level of the inspirational. On this occasion, it’s the computer graphics-aided infiltration of the mind of a teenager, with a disorder on the autism spectrum, that stamps the evening as exceptional.
Mind you, some of the textual and performance elements of “The Curious Incident,” which began at London’s National Theatre and had its official opening Sunday night at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre, aren’t quite as seamlessly incorporated as the play’s visual marvels. An overly meticulous laying-out of unhappy developments, particularly in Act 1, belabors the storytelling, and the theatrical self-awareness accorded some of the characters — all that “we know we’re in a play” kind of stuff — succeeds only in confirming the need for more stringent editing.
Any time the superfluous conceits begin to bog things down, however, “The Curious Incident” revives, on the strengths of its ingenious design and the dazzling portrayal of its main character, 15-year-old Christopher Boone, by 25-year-old Alex Sharp , in a thoroughly commanding Broadway debut.
Based closely on Mark Haddon’s 2003 novel, about a gifted English boy who’s challenged both by a neurological disorder and the severe disturbances of his broken home, Simon Stephens’s script begins with Christopher’s discovery of the body of a neighbor’s dog, speared by a pitchfork — a killing at first mistakenly blamed on him. And though the play embarks with Christopher on his mission to find the killer, the show’s more important ingredients are the unusual workings of Christopher’s brain.
Bunny Christie’s set, a grid lined like a piece of graph paper, is a splendid canvas for Christopher’s rigidly ordered, numerically oriented circuitry, as well as for the images generated by video designer Finn Ross and lighting designer Paule Constable. The odd gaps in Christopher’s ability to relate to other people — he can’t bear to be touched, for instance — are filled for us by the pictorial rendering of his interior life. Projections of cascading numbers and letters, representations of street noise as flashes of undifferentiated static, vividly capture the external stimuli that overwhelm him.
Our perceptions of the story’s adults, including Christopher’s easily provoked father and estranged mother (Ian Barford and Enid Graham, both top-notch) and his empathic teacher (the fine Francesca Faridany), are filtered helpfully through Christopher, whose self-protective antennae seem to pick up on discord at every turn. (In the Boone household, dysfunction has indeed been a way of life.) The boy’s quest for a fitting punishment for the dog’s killer — and a securer sense of himself — culminates in a captivating sequence in Act 2, when Christopher runs away from his father and, on a fraught trip to London, is forced to navigate the mundane perils of the cosmopolitan beehive. An able ensemble that includes Helen Carey, Jocelyn Bioh, Richard Hollis and David Manis excels in realizing this and other illusions, under the guidance of choreographers Scott Graham and Steven Hoggett.
At times, admittedly, you need a little patience with the unfolding of “The Curious Incident.” While the piece supplies its share of touching moments — and even some outrageously sentimental ones, involving a puppy — the world it conjures is never overrun with kindly types, eager to come to the aid of a struggling young soul. That the production remains true to this rather unsparing vision is as much to its credit as is all that technical wizardry.
The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, by Simon Stephens, based on the novel by Mark Haddon. Directed by Marianne Elliott. Sets and costumes, Bunny Christie; lighting, Paule Constable; video, Finn Ross. About 2 1/2 hours. Tickets, $27-$225. At Ethel Barrymore Theatre, 243 W. 47th St., New York. Visit www.telecharge.com or call 212-239-6200.
Peter Marks joined the Washington Post as its chief theater critic in 2002. Prior to that he worked for nine years at the New York Times, on the culture, metropolitan and national desks, and spent about four years as its off-Broadway drama critic.

Neha Dhupia slams Yesudas  remarks against girls wearing jeansPress Trust of India | Indore | Posted: October 6, 2014 8:33 am
Bollywood actress Neha Dhupia condemned the remarks of veteran singer K J Yesudas against girls wearing jeans, saying such a “flawed” thinking regarding women’s apparel needs to be rectified.
“This is very unfortunate that women are being asked what to wear and what not, even as our country is moving forward. I feel that the flaw does not lie in the ensemble of women but in the minds of those who make such remarks. I think this thinking towards what half of our total population is wearing needs to be corrected,” Neha told reporters in response to a query regarding the singer’s remarks.
Neha was here for promotion of her upcoming film, ’21 Topon ki Salami’ directed by Ravindra Gautam. The film, also starring Anupam Kher, Divyendu Sharma and other star cast, is slated for release on October 10.
“It is challenging to bring yourself to the notice of the audience as an actress in a multi-cast film. I feel bored when am asked to act in a film wherein hero and heroine are the only lead characters,” she said.
Responding to a query, Neha said she would like to work in any biopic which is based on a true story.
Yesudas had on October 2 resented women wearing jeans, saying this went against the Indian culture.
“Women should not cause trouble to others by wearing jeans….What should be covered should be covered,” Yesudas had said.

(If you really want to get…)
You are a diligent saver, a careful investor and a meticulous planner. Yet, you have not been able to build wealth even as everyone around you seems to be wallowing in money. What's stopping you from getting rich? If it's bad luck, you can buy one of those good fortune charms hawked on late night TV shows. But if you really want to get to the root of the problem, you need to assess where you are going wrong in your investments.
Our cover story this week is about the money myths and investing flaws that prevent you from getting rich. It could be the lure of penny stocks or the tantalising potential of the futures and options segment. Small investors often lose their shirts (and nearly everything else) when they enter these high-risk arenas without adequate knowledge.
But mistakes can happen even if you play ultra safe. If a fixed deposit offers 9%, the post-tax returns for someone in the 30% tax bracket will be barely 6.3%. That's not too bad until you factor in 8% inflation. So even though the investor does not feel it, his money is losing value. This is one of the biggest investing mistakes Indians make when they pour money into fixed deposits. In the following pages, we have listed the common hurdles that prevent investors from getting rich.
Many of these hurdles are really self made. They can be done away with by changing your approach to investing. Gold, for instance, should not occupy more than 5-10% allocation in your portfolio. This can happen if you treat the yellow metal less as an investment and more as a hedging tool.
There's no point in dwelling on mistakes unless we can offer a solution. So, each financial mistake has been followed by advice on how to avoid it. This stress on utility has been ET Wealth's hallmark since the time it was launched. In this 200th issue of the newspaper, we hope to live up to the expectations of our readers.

Confronting an office bully takes courage. (Design Pics/Thinkstock)
Q: My manager is treating one of my colleagues unfairly, yelling at her when she makes even the smallest mistake and looking for reasons to blame and punish her. She verbally attacks my colleague in front of the rest of us for things that are not against the rules and not a big deal. I think it is beginning to affect my coworker's health. Isn't this kind of treatment by a boss unethical?

Don't say — or do — this in Asia
A: The short answer: Yes. It’s always unethical to make other people feel unsafe, disrespected, or marginalised at work — and especially those who report to you.
“If we think about a strong ethical culture as a house with wooden beams, respectful behaviour is the centre, load-bearing beam,” said Linda Fisher Thornton, author of 7 Lenses: Learning the Principles and Practices of Ethical Leadership and chief executive officer of Leading in Context, a consulting firm based in Richmond, Virginia, in the US.
Leaders must show the way by modeling respectful conduct. Why does this matter? Because, aside from a leader’s duty not to harm those in their charge, bullying is toxic for the corporate culture, Fisher Thornton said.
“When people fear being attacked, they understandably tend to ‘pull in’ to protect themselves, much like a turtle pulling its head into its shell,” she said. Employees begin to spend their time thinking about what’s going on in the office and how to avoid being the next victim — instead of focusing on their work. All this wasted energy, Fisher Thornton said, is diverted away from the company’s real business.  
As for what you should do as a colleague when faced with this dilemma, it’s important not to escalate the situation. Yelling back at your manager when she attacks your colleague is not likely to work – and might even put you in the crosshairs. But you can try to do the right thing by your officemate in other ways.
Start by reaching out to see if your harassed colleague could benefit from some quiet support, Fisher Thornton said. Next, decide how you will report the problem. If your company has a policy preventing such behaviour — and a strong record of enforcing it – then your way is clear, especially if you feel comfortable going to your manager’s boss about the situation. Make sure you’ve documented the problem with notes, copies of emails and any other evidence before you alert a senior manager or the human resources department.
Be careful, Fisher Thornton warned, if your firm doesn’t have a history of holding strong against bullying. (This could also be a problem if this is the first workplace bullying problem your company has had to confront.)
“If the manager finds out that you reported her, and if she is fairly confident that nothing will be done to stop her, her behaviour could worsen,” she said.
In the event that you decide not to confront your manager or to report her, make sure that her behaviour doesn’t force you into violating your personal ethical standards as you go about doing your job.
Whatever happens, don’t agree to do anything that you feel compromises you  or damages your credibility, Fisher Thornton said: “You can look for a new job if you ever decide to leave, but your reputation can never be traded in for a new one.”

Neither Hong Kongs protesters nor its government appear to have any idea what theyre doingThe Future of Hong Kong
October 6, 2014
HONG KONG—By this time today, Hong Kong’s streets and government buildings were supposed to be clear of protesters that have brought parts of the city to a standstill. But despite pledging to “ take all necessary actions ” to restore order, Hong Kong’s government has allowed the protesters to remain—even as their ranks have been diminished, at least temporarily, by those returning to work and school for the day.
The strange impasse has created a surreal atmosphere in the city known for its efficiency and professional focus, as office workers sidled past barricades and wandered down empty closed-off streets to get to work, while protesters clad in masks and goggles sit in tiny, tired groups. The situation is also raising questions about Hong Kong’s governance over the long term.
Protesters give an inch
Protesters cleared a corridor through the blockades outside one entrance to the government’s headquarters building on Sunday night, after protest leaders and government representatives agreed to meet for the first time. On Monday morning, makeshift tents and supply centers still dotted a main highway in the center of town, and protesters were sprawled in the middle of key roads as government employees filed in to work.

“We’re going to see how the government reacts,” said one 19-year old protester at the entrance, who said his surname name was Lui, sitting near the cleared corridor. Because of the corridor, government employees “can go back to work, and other citizens won’t blame us,” he said.
Lui said he and the scant dozen protesters sitting near him had decided to clear the corridor themselves, rather than acting on specific directions from student leaders or Occupy Central, the groups that started the protests. “We don’t know what direction this is headed, and we don’t know what to do next,” he said, so his group was acting on its own.
A threat unfulfilled
Hong Kong chief executive CY Leung’s failure to back up his hard-line pledge indicates that the government’s strategy is also far from fully-formed.
By not forcefully uprooting the protesters as threatened, Leung may have saved Hong Kong’s government from another ugly backlash like the one that swelled protesters ranks after they were tear-gassed last weekend, but the long-running nature of the protests has raised serious questions about how the crucial financial hub will be governed going forward.
 “The basic question of governance is on the agenda,” Fitch Ratings, the credit rating agency, said on Monday, while noting that Hong Kong’s ratings outlook is stable. “The central issue is whether the territory has a government, however chosen, that rests on a basic degree of consent among the population, allowing it to draw up and implement effective policies.” Without that, “protests and disruption could flare up again,” making the city a less attractive place to invest.
Fighting fatigue and chaos
Many members of the young student groups that were one of the driving forces behind the protests, were exhausted after a week of confrontations with police and reputed organized crime members, and unsure how to move the movement forward .

Just another Monday commute?(Reuters/Carlos Barria)
Just a few hundred yards away from the cleared corridor, on the other side of the government headquarters building, another group wearing face masks and goggles blocked a separate entrance to the government headquarters that was still fully barricaded this morning.
“We’re not going to remove it at all,” said W.W., a 30-year-old freelance filmmaker who was manning the area. That decision had been taken by the group of about 20 people who have been sitting in front of the entrance in recent days. “While publicly there are three groups in charge, this location is self-operated,” he said. “The whole movement has been like this for several days.”
Protester barricades have kept all of Harcourt Road—a main thoroughfare in the center of town that stretches to eight lanes in spots—completely closed to vehicle traffic, despite the sparse crowd.

— Heather Timmons  (@HeathaT) October 5, 2014
Because of the promised crackdown, many protesters had been gearing up for a tough night and they seemed somewhat amazed Monday morning with the lack of police response.
“How could you imagine we could block Hong Kong for nine days?” said Johnny, a 38-year old actor who was sitting with a small group outside the barricades in front of one entrance to the chief executive’s office. He said he had been with the protest since Sept. 28, albeit with breaks for showering and sleeping. “I expected them to clear us, but it looks like they won’t,” he said. Every day, Johnny said, he woke up and wondered: “Where will we go next?”
 

Suzuki Motor in advanced stage of developing new diesel engineSuzuki Motor in advanced stage of developing new diesel engine
By Ketan Thakkar , ET Bureau | 6 Oct, 2014, 08.15AM IST

India levies higher excise tax on vehicles having engine size of more than 1.5 litres and that is the reason for developing a separate variant.
Mumbai: Maruti Suzuki may have more diesel options from its own portfolio of engines to power its vehicle, as parent Suzuki Motor in an advanced stage of developing a new 1.5-litre four-cylinder power plant targeting the Indian market.
Suzuki has already developed an 800-cc diesel engine and Maruti is expected to start using it soon. That engine is built on a modular platform, so there are multiple derivatives of it are expected. After the 800-cc engine, it is working on two derivatives of a four-cylinder engine, a 1.6-litre variant for Europe and a 1.5-litre one for India. India levies higher excise tax on vehicles having engine size of more 1.5 litres.
ET broke the news on Suzuki's endeavor to develop an 800-cc diesel engine in July 2012.
Maruti, India's top car maker by volume, currently sources diesel engines from Italian auto maker Fiat. "This new engine is expected to complement the existing Fiat multi-jet engine and will not replace it. The aim is to offer wider choice to the customers," said one of the people close to the company.
"The first probable product (with the new diesel engine) is expected to the next-generation Ertiga, even the future SUV and a new MPV is expected to be powered by this 1.5-litre engine," this person said.
He said the Ciaz sedan will also likely get the engine when it is upgraded, two to three years down the line, when it gets its mid-life refresh
A Maruti spokesperson said the company doesn't comment on its future products.
In an interaction with ET earlier, Kenichi Ayukawa, Maruti's managing director, said Suzuki was aiming to develop its own family of diesel engine, but didn't share the specifics then.
Chairman RC Bhargava had told ET that despite the bridging price gap between diesel and petrol, diesel-powered vehicles will continue to see strong demand.
Bhargava said: "If Suzuki develops a diesel engine family, for sure it will help Maruti Suzuki."
With the advent of newer technologies, diesel vehicles have bridged shortcomings on refinement with petrol-powered variants. Diesel also offers better mileage, a major consideration for Indian vehicle buyers.
Suzuki is developing the diesel engines with key inputs from its Indian subsidiary's research and development division.
People involved with the development said that the endeavour to have the company's own diesel engine began way back in 2009-10. The royalty for the new engine will be determined after it is packaged into the product said the person in the know of the development.
Gaurav Vangaal, senior analyst for forecasting at consultancy firm at IHS Automotive, said having its own a 1.5-litre motor will give Maruti more engine flexibility for its B-segment cars.
Fiat engine has always been fantastic performing its job under the hood since a decade and trade off would be difficult for Maruti.
"In this competitive world of auto industry, the consumer choice for getting more performance driven power train cannot be undermined. I would say every customer is important to maintain leadership dominance and if you don't offer anyone else will and not giving an option to choose from, simply brings you out of the competition," added Vangaal.
Hormazd Sorabjee, editor of Autocar India, said the 1.3-litre multijet diesel engine that Maruti sources from Fiat is no longer a benchmark in the market and it is getting eclipsed by bigger and better engines from the competition - Renault, Honda Motor, Volkswagen and Ford Motor have all brought in 1.5-litre diesels.
A 1.5-litre engine is generally better suited for sedans and compact SUVs but by the time it comes, the opportunity could be lost.
"The real dilemma is whether Maruti Suzuki should be investing in their own diesel engine. The introduction comes at a time, when the world is moving towards more stringent emission norms. When India moves towards the next level of emission norms, the diesel engine will have to upgraded, which will push the cost up and may make diesel cars less competitive," Sorabjee said.

Business Line Finance Minister Arun Jaitley
NEW DELHI, Oct 6:  
India's Finance Minister Arun Jaitley was discharged from hospital on Monday after recovering from an infection that followed a stomach operation to treat diabetes, a doctor said.
"The minister is well. He has been treated for the ailments and has now been discharged," said Amit Gupta, senior surgeon and spokesman at the state-run All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi.
Jaitley, who also holds the defence portfolio, was moved to an isolation ward last month to reduce the number of people visiting him after he contracted the infection.
Despite his recovery, Jaitley may not be able to attend a World Bank meeting on Oct. 10-12 in Washington, where he had been expected to hold a series of high-level meetings.
Gupta declined to comment on whether the 61-year-old minister would be able to travel any time soon.
Jaitley also had to miss a meeting of finance ministers from the Group of 20 nations in Australia last month after gastric bypass surgery to treat weight gain related to a long-standing diabetic condition.

JSW Steel in talks to buy London Mining
Reuters
Tweet
Oct 6:  
JSW Steel Ltd, India's third-largest steelmaker, is in talks to buy Sierra Leone-focused iron ore miner London Mining Plc, two people with knowledge of the matter said.
The news, confirming a weekend report in Britain's Sunday Times newspaper, sent shares in AIM-listed London Mining up almost 18 per cent in early trading on Monday.
London Mining, which has been hit by a falling iron ore price and the Ebola crisis that has gripped the region, would come "cheap" given its market value of $10 million, one of the sources said, adding the deal would help JSW meet some of its demand for steelmaking ingredient iron ore.
Action against illegal mining in India has led to a sharp fall in domestic iron ore output, forcing JSW to import heavily. It plans to ship in 10 million tonnes of iron ore this fiscal year ending March 31.
"Talks (with London Mining) have been going on for many months. JSW people have visited them also," said the source, who declined to be named as the information is not yet public.
Debt-laden London Mining said last week it was in talks with a potential investor for funds, but the funding would take a number of weeks to implement.
Like other junior iron ore miners, London Mining is battling record low prices for the steelmaking raw material in the face of stagnant demand from the world's top consumer, China, and oversupply from the biggest players in the industry.
A JSW spokesman did not immediately reply to a request for comment. London Mining was not immediately available for comment.
JSW is controlled by billionaire Sajjan Jindal.

For economists, it often happens when updating data long left sitting in a remote corner of our desktops.
It happened to me recently. I refreshed an old chart and suddenly realized how—and why—an issue that spooked economists and financial markets alike back in 2011 and 2012 has faded so far into the background.
During the height of the European financial crisis, economists and journalists eagerly followed the latest updates on a mysterious-sounding data series known as TARGET2, which needed to be unearthed from the depths of the websites of each and every national central bank in the euro area.

TARGET2 stands for Trans-European Automated Real-time Gross settlement Express Transfer. (It is the second iteration of the system, thus the “2.”) Essentially, this a European Union payment system used by large institutions—mostly banks—to make large, cross-border euro-denominated payments throughout the course of the day. These are large amounts of money. In 2012, roughly €2.5 trillion worth of transactions  were made on the TARGET2 system each day .
In practice, during the crisis the system worked more as a transfer system between countries that were seeing capital flow into or out of the country.
Here’s how it worked. Imagine a CFO at a corporation in say, Spain, back in 2011 when the crisis was intensifying. Yields on Spanish government debt were rising as markets were starting to lose confidence. There were serious doubts about the possibility that Spain might be forced to request an EU/IMF assistance program . The CFO became reasonably nervous about the safety of the bank where her company kept its money. So she decides to move the company’s account to a stronger bank in, say, Germany.
She directs her Spanish bank to transfer the company’s money, say €100 million, to the new German bank. This implies to opposite things: Deposits at the Spanish bank go down by €100 million, and deposits at the German bank go up by €100 million.
Now, like all banks, the Spanish bank doesn’t have that company’s €100 million just sitting around in a vault somewhere. (Banks make money by lending out deposits.) And the CFO of our company, most likely, is not the only one who had the brilliant idea to move money to safety. So the Spanish bank probably finds itself in a situation where its deposit base is naturally shrinking.
But still, assets and liabilities on bank balance sheets must match. That means the Spanish bank must raise the money it needs to send to the German bank, if it wants to avoid raising additional doubts about its solvency. If such doubts grow unchecked, they could trigger a full-on bank run. Now, in normal times the Spanish bank could borrow needed cash cheaply and easily from other banks. But 2011 and 2012 were not normal times.
The interbank market—where banks lend money to one another—was basically frozen. The Spanish bank might have come up with the money by selling assets, such as the bonds or other investments the bank owned. But that would have taken too long. And borrowing from depositors was not an option. Remember, this was a situation where depositors were pulling money out of the bank, not depositing more in.
So what is to be done? Luckily for the banks in the euro zone countries that ended up under highest stress, the European Central Bank had a solution. The ECB would provide cheap, long-term loans in exchange for collateral, via its Longer-Term Refinancing Operations (LTROs). The ECB launched two extraordinary version of these operations (on December 2011 and February 2012 ) offering to lend cash for three years. European banks jumped on the offer,  borrowing roughly €1 trillion  (paywall).
Through this program the ECB essentially acted as a conduit between countries that were experiencing constant outflows and those where capital was constantly flowing in, in search of safety.
This is reflected in the chart. Countries where banks were constantly borrowing from the ECB—the actual system through which the money was transferred in LTROs was our old friend TARGET2—such as Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Italy and Spain were net borrowers of the Central Bank’s liquidity. As a result the accumulated a TARGET2 deficit vis à vis the ECB.
On the other hand, banks in countries like Germany were receiving large flows of that safety-seeking cash. As it started to pile up, these German banks didn’t see a lot of good places to immediately invest it. (After all the European economy was in turmoil.) So they simply started to deposit their excess reserves at the ECB—again using our TARGET2 payment system—driving their account TARGET2 balance at the ECB into a giant surplus.
And that’s how things continued to develop until 2012.
Since then, things have changed dramatically. Why?
Well, the most clear development came in August 2012, when the ECB announced it was willing to buy government bonds on the secondary market , if the country asked for help, via a program known as outright monetary transactions (OMT). The possibility of a buyer like the ECB, which had theoretically bottomless pockets—although there were some constraints on the maturities of securities it said it would buy—stopped the European government bond selloff in its tracks.
Over the next few years, prices for European bonds issued by troubled countries rose sharply, dissipating some of the doubts about the immediate solvency of the banking systems in those countries. The return of confidence eased concerns of depositors and other lenders, making it easier and cheaper for those banks to raise money.
Banks that saw deposit outflow, such as our imaginary Spanish bank, were better able to raise the money they needed. They therefore returned some or all of the money they borrowed from the ECB. In other words, conditions have been normalizing. (Although this is happening very slowly and we are still far from pre-crisis balance.)
So, is that it? Problem solved?
Not exactly. While short-term issues of financial stability have improved markedly, the wild ride of TARGET2 balances in recent years highlights a new problem for the ECB. As I recently pointed out here , the ECB’s approach to unconventional monetary is ultimately outside the central bank’s control, because it is driven by banks’ demand for (and decision to reimburse) the money created by the central bank. In other words, during the worst phase of the crisis, the ECB effectively outsources the central bank’s balance sheet management to banks in the private sector.
Why is this a problem? You need only look at the recent readings of dangerously low inflation in the euro zone to understand why. If the ECB truly wants to keep the risk of falling into a Japanese-style deflationary trap at bay, it must act decisively to expand its balance sheet—as the US Federal Reserve did—on its own.

Coal India awards contracts for two washeries
PTI
Tweet
New Delhi, Oct 6:  
State-owned Coal India has awarded contracts for construction of two washeries as part of efforts to augment its capacity to crush coal and ensure better quality of the dry fuel.
The government had earlier said that comprehensive measures for enhancing domestic coal output were being put in place along with stringent mechanism for quality control and environmental protection, which includes supply of crushed coal and setting up of washeries.
“CIL (Coal India Ltd) has initiated action through global tenders to establish 16 coal washeries with an aggregate capacity of 100.6 Mty... Construction job of three washeries are in progress and the same for two washeries have been awarded,” Coal India said in a report.
It added: “Jobs of other washeries are in different stages of evaluation.”
Of the 16 coal washeries, six are coking coal with a capacity of 18.6 million tonnes per year and 10 non-coking coal washeries with a capacity of 82 million tonnes per year, it said.
At present, CIL operates 17 coal washeries with a total capacity of 39.4 million tonnes per year. Out of these, 13 are coking coal washeries with a total capacity of 24.90 million tonnes, while four are non-coking coal washeries with a total capacity of 14.50 million tonnes, it added.
The Standing Committee on Coal and Steel had earlier pulled up Coal India for delays in setting up of washeries and had desired that the coal PSU prepare an action plan to expedite the work of commissioning of washeries.
The committee had also observed that the washeries were not set up despite the Ministry of Environment and Forests restricting the use of coal containing more than 34 per cent ash content in power stations located 1,000 km away from pit heads.

Eurozone sentiment hits lowest level since M...Eurozone sentiment falls in October to lowest level since May 2013

Sentix research group's index tracking morale among investors in the euro zone tumbled to -13.7 in October from -9.8 the previous month. 
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
BERLIN: Sentiment in the eurozone dropped for a third consecutive month in October, hitting its lowest level since May 2013, suggesting the single currency bloc will fall into recession, a survey by Sentix showed on Monday.
Sentix research group's index tracking morale among investors in the euro zone tumbled to -13.7 in October from -9.8 the previous month. That undershot the consensus forecast in a Reuters poll for a reading of -11.5.
"While expectations were only just below the zero-mark in September, they are now clearly in negative territory and that means a technical recession in the euro zone - two consecutive quarters of contraction - is ever more likely," Sentix said in a statement.
"It's conspicuous that neither the European Central Bank's rhetoric nor its measures were able to drive up investors' expectations of the economy this month," Sentix added.
Last week the ECB laid out plans to buy rebundled packets of debt within weeks to shore up the flagging euro zone economy and its president said the bank would do more if needed.
A sub-index of expectations for the euro zone's economy fell to -7.3 in October, its lowest level in two years, after a reading of -2.5 in September.
Investors' perception of the current euro zone situation dropped to its weakest level since August 2013.
An index tracking Germany plunged to its lowest level since September 2012, with Sentix saying investors seemed to be increasingly concerned about economic risks such as tensions over Ukraine and other crises abroad as well as the U.S. Federal Reserve's tighter monetary policy.

Indian-origin Briton on trial for wife s honeymoon murder in Cape Townprint

British millionaire Shrien Dewani on Monday pleaded not guilty to charges of murdering his young bride while on honeymoon in Cape Town as his long-awaited trial got under way.
Speaking from the dock, Dewani, dressed in a dark suit and tie, glanced nervously around court and said he was "not guilty" of charges of murder, kidnapping and obstructing justice.

The prosecution is expected to argue that Dewani is a gay man who was so desperate to escape an arranged marriage that he hired hitmen to kill his bride on their Cape Town honeymoon.
In a statement read by defence layer Francois van Zyl, Dewani admitted he was bisexual, but said he was "instantly physically attracted" to Swedish-born bride Anni (nee Hindocha), who was shot dead on November 13, 2010, aged 28.
"I've had sexual interaction with both males and females. I consider myself bisexual," Dewani's statement said.
Businessman Dewani finally appeared in court after losing a three-year extradition fight in Britain and was ruled mentally fit to stand trial.
He was sent back to South Africa in April to answer charges.
He claims that he and his bride were hijacked at gunpoint as they drove through Cape Town's impoverished Gugulethu township in a taxi.
Dewani escaped unharmed, but his wife's body was found in the abandoned car the next day.
Local media have reported that one of the main witnesses for the prosecution will be a sado-masochism "master" from Britain who will claim that Dewani paid him for sex.
Gay prostitute Leopold Leisser is said to have claimed in a statement to British police that Dewani had told him he was getting married to a "lovely girl", but he needed "to find a way out of it".
The three South Africans have been tried and convicted and are serving jail sentences of between 18 years and life for their role in Anni Dewani's death.
Taxi driver Zola Tongo admitted guilt in a plea bargain along with another man, Mziwamadoda Qwabe. The two were sentenced to 18 and 25 years in prison respectively.

A third man, Xolile Mngeni, was later found guilty of firing the shot that killed Anni Dewani and was sentenced to life imprisonment.
Tongo's claim that Shrien Dewani had offered him 15,000 rand ($1,300, 1,000 euros) to have Anni killed is expected to play a key role in the prosecution's arguments.
The case has angered many in South Africa who accuse Dewani of callously using the country's reputation for violent crime to murder his wife in the belief that he would get away with it.
   
Justice and closure
Anni's family said it has been "a period of torture" since her death.
"All I ask for is the full story and justice," Anni's father Vinod Hindocha told reporters in Cape Town on Sunday.
Another family member, Anni's uncle Ashok Hindocha, said they hoped the trial would help them get on with their lives.
"We are not going to get Anni back... but we need to know the truth so we can move on," he told a news conference.
Dewani fought a long legal battle to avoid being extradited from Britain to South Africa, claiming he had mental health problems, including depression and post-traumatic stress.
But an assessment by South African psychiatric experts found he was "not mentally ill" and fit to stand trial.
Both Dewani and Anni are of Indian origin, from what news reports have described as devout Hindu families.
Anni's cousin Sneha Hindocha, in a statement cited by South Africa's The Sunday Independent, chronicles a rocky 17-month courtship during which Anni repeatedly felt sexually rejected by Dewani.
The defence is likely to paint a picture of a happy newlywed couple.
The trial is set to run into December.

Playing MS Dhoni on screen will be challenging: Sushant Singh RajputComments
Ever since he made his debut with Kai Po Che (2013), Sushant Singh Rajput has made some interesting film choices. In his upcoming project with director Neeraj Pandey, he is set to play Indian cricket captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni on screen.
In an interview, the actor talks about the challenges of playing the lead in a biopic, meeting the cricketing star, his special equation with Shekhar Kapur , and more.
Is playing Dhoni on screen a huge responsibility for you?
As an actor, there is always a responsibility when you are portraying any character on screen. You have to meet your own expectations, [because] you want a large percentage of audience to come and watch the film. As for Dhoni, he is an inspiration, and is loved by millions. The incredible response after the [film’s] announcement only punctuates the massiveness of the project, and we will make sure the biopic transcends general expectations.
Recently, you met Dhoni regarding the film. How did the meeting go?
Five minutes into the meeting, I was blown away by his personality. He is a unique amalgamation of hard work, intelligence, patriotism, humility, passion and God-like inner peace. I am looking forward to many such conversations with him to carefully understand why he is the way he is, so that I can honestly portray him on screen.
This film is one of the rare biopics where the protagonist is still active in his own field.
Yes, and so it gets much more challenging. Everyone has a strong visual reference [of the person], since he is still playing and is immensely popular. So you, as an actor, have to match him completely in order to pull it off convincingly.
It’s believed that you are media shy compared to your contemporaries.
It’s a personal choice. The main objective is to be part of exciting films with wonderful directors, and I don’t think the ‘buzz’ or the ‘number of appearances’ in a week increases the possibility [of working in those films] by any measure. I am living my dream and will continue to follow my instincts and passion, and hopefully entertain the audience.
You and director Shekhar Kapur clearly share a great chemistry. In fact, he recently tweeted that you are “probably one of the best young actors we have today”.
We share a special bond, and talk about so many things when we meet. I haven’t met anyone else who understands human emotions better. Now, after getting to know him a bit more, when I watch his films again, I am able to understand the deeper meaning behind the narrative options he has taken, and the creative decisions he has made. I can't thank my stars enough to have gotten this opportunity to work with him so early in my career.
Why are you taking so many risks when your contemporaries are playing it safe in terms of film choices?
I chose to be an actor for selfish reasons. I love living different characters, and something happens to me when I am performing on stage or when I am in front of the camera. And that’s very liberating. I work for that. It helps me fight the fear of all kinds of uncertainties and insecurities.
Lastly, how important do you think you next with director Dibakar Banerjee will be, since it's coming at a very important time in your career (after a gap of a year)?
It is important for me, not because of the timing or anything, but because it’s a very special film. Honestly, as an actor, I learnt more in these seven months than I did in eight years of theatre, TV and films combined. Dibakar is a genius filmmaker.

PM Narendra Modi urges EC to probe approval for Robert Vadra land deal in HaryanaModi urges EC to probe approval for Vadra land deal
Agencies  Hisar, October 06, 2014
First Published: 12:23 IST(6/10/2014) | Last Updated: 18:34 IST(6/10/2014)
Prime Minister Narendra Modi Monday urged the Election Commission to look into Haryana government's approval of a land deal involving Sonia Gandhi's son-in-law Robert Vadra.
Addressing an election rally in Hisar Modi said, "They (Hooda government) know that after the elections,
the son-in-law (Vadra) will not get any clearances for illegal deals. So, in between the election process, they have dared to take such a decision,"
"I think Hooda was pressurised from the top (Congress leadership) to take such a decision," he added.
Watch: Modi hints at Vadra deals in Haryana election speech
The Election Commission, the prime minister hoped, would take "serious note" of the state government's decision.  "I hope they will take appropriate action for any violation of the Model Code of Conduct," he said.
"Despite the model code being imposed for the state elections, chief minister Bhupinder Hooda cleared land deal for the 'damaad' ( Robert Vadra) yesterday. The EC should take serious note of this."
"They knew they cannot do anything after the polls, so that is why they approved the land sale deal in a hurry," he added.
Modi's attack on Vadra came on a day The Indian Express  reported that Hooda government officially legitimised the land deal between Vadra and real estate major DLF.
The land deal in Shikhopur village of Gurgaon had been cancelled by Haryana's former director general, Consolidation, Ashok Khemka.
"It is clear from this decision of the shameless Hooda government that both he and the Congress party have already accepted defeat in Haryana," Modi said in his speech.
The prime minister also launched a scathing attack on dynastic politics, saying Haryana had not seen a government in which political families had looked beyond themselves and their family members.
"We want to make Haryana free from this 'parivaar-vaad' (dynastic politics). In the last 25 years, have you seen a government in Haryana which worked for the welfare of people," he asked.
"In Haryana, the government works only for the chief minister and his family members. All political leaders have been running their shops in Haryana for themselves and their families," Modi said.
Modi also took a dig at jailed former chief minister Om Prakash Chautala's Indian National Lok Dal saying that he "did not need the support of people in jail" to succeed.
Referring to Chautala's statement at a recent rally that he  would take oath as the state chief minister from jail, Modi said, "Some people are spreading lies. Some are dreaming of taking oath from jail, showing old photos with them taken in a certain program."

Samsung Electronics Makes $14.7 Billion Bet With New South Korean Chip PlantYou are here: Home Corporates
Samsung Electronics Makes $14.7 Billion Bet With New South Korean Chip Plant
Reuters | Updated On: October 06, 2014 14:33 (IST)
Essar Steel Raises $1 Billion to Dollarise Balance Sheet
Seoul: South Korean IT giant Samsung Electronics plans to spend $14.7 billion on a new chip facility - its biggest investment in a single plant - leaning on its semiconductor business to bolster profits as its smartphone dominance wanes.
Samsung, the world's top memory chip maker, said the plant would be located in Pyeongtaek, roughly 75 kilometres (47 miles) south of Seoul. The company said it would create 150,000 jobs, equal to about a third of the city's population.
The bet on chips comes as its smartphone business is being squeezed by Apple Inc in the premium segment and undercut by Chinese rivals like Lenovo Group Ltd in mid-to-low end. April-June operating profit for Samsung's mobile division fell in annual terms for the second straight quarter, the longest streak since at least 2011.
But with the higher demand for mobile devices comes increased orders for mobile chips, and Samsung Electronics' semiconductor division will be key to propping up the company's bottom-line, analysts say.
The plant in Pyeongtaek will make either logic or memory chips, Samsung Electronics said, adding that a final decision had not been made yet.
"Right now the only part of the company that is bringing in steady profits is the semiconductor division, so it looks like the company will keep investing in the business," said IM Investment analyst Lee Min-hee.
The chip business is likely to be a lone bright spot in what is otherwise expected to be a poor third quarter for the South Korean giant. Samsung will issue its earnings guidance for the period on Tuesday.
The mean forecast from a Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S survey of 42 analysts calls for the firm's July-September operating profit to come in at 5.6 trillion won ($5.24 billion), its weakest performance since the fourth quarter of 2011.
Some analysts forecast that the semiconductor division will report stronger operating profit than the handset division in the third quarter for the first time in more than three years. The chip business recorded a 1.9 trillion won profit in the second quarter, compared with 4.4 trillion won for the mobile business.
The company's global smartphone market share has declined in annual terms in the past two quarters, according to Strategy Analytics, in step with the profit drop at its mobile division.
Shares of Samsung Electronics closed 0.9 per cent higher on Monday, compared with a 0.4 per cent decline in the broader market.
Glut concerns
Samsung Electronics said its chip production capacity was expected to rise by a "low double-digit percentage". Construction of the new plant is scheduled to be completed by the second half of 2017.
Any capacity increase can be ominous for competitors in a deeply cyclical industry. Shares in domestic rival SK Hynix Inc fell more than 8 per cent at one point on Monday after Samsung's announcement.
Market conditions for memory chips have remained favourable this year partly due to stronger-than-anticipated demand from personal computers and servers. Industry players like Samsung Electronics have so far been careful about capacity expansion, keeping supply conditions on a tight leash.
Besides SK Hynix Inc, competitors in the memory industry include Micron Technology Inc and Toshiba Corp.
"While the plant won't enter production until 2017, Samsung's investment plan hurts sentiment because it suggests that Samsung wants to make further market share gains," IM's Lee said.
Some analysts said investors may be over-reacting on SK Hynix shares, given how output from the new Samsung plant won't materialise for several years and it is not yet clear what chips will be made there.
They also noted that the investment will be spread out over three years, keeping spending on the project well within Samsung's typical annual semiconductor-related investments.
"This isn't about Samsung trying to destroy the industry cycle but trying to maximise profits from the semiconductor business," CIMB analyst Lee Do-hoon said.
Pyeongtaek
The tech giant said it had brought forward its investment plan for Pyeongtaek by more than a year in response to calls from regional governments to help boost economic activity in the area.
"Samsung will continue to balance its domestic and foreign investments to ensure optimal global production structure," the company said.
Analysts said there could be practical benefits to having the new plant in relatively close proximity to other domestic chip plants as opposed to building one overseas. Some said building a new plant near Seoul makes it easier for the company to recruit local engineering talent as well.
"To some extent this is also a response to the current government's call for big corporations to invest domestically," said Korea Investment Trust Management fund manager Baik Jae-yer.
The government has proposed a tax on excess profits at big corporations in an effort to prod them to spend more on investment, wages and dividends.

Maruti to phase out SX4Home News Markets Companies Tech Economy Opinion Features Portfolio Catalyst BL Ink Multimedia Blogs

Maruti Suzuki SX4 may come back in a new avatar

Tweet
Hyderabad, Oct 6:  
The country’s largest carmaker, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, has decided to phase out its C segment sedan SX4.
This decision comes in the wake of the roll-out of the new premium sedan, Ciaz, across the country.
Introducing the new sedan here on Monday, Partho Banerjee, Vice-President, Dealer Development, Maruti Suzuki India, said the company has decided to discontinue the SX4.
Other models
The company had in the past phased out its popular small car Maruti 800, Zen hatchback and Esteem and Baleno sedans.
The SX4 could not achieve the expected volumes for the company.
A dealer requesting anonymity said it would be good if the company continued with SX4 sales even after the launch of the Ciaz sedan.
The SX4 car is an ideal family car with more seating but was marketed for a busy executive, said the dealer.
Reposition needed
All that the company needs to do is to reposition it to attract a new segment of buyers and then market both SX4 and Ciaz as different cars for different needs, say market experts.
According to company sources, SX4 is likely to come in a different avatar into India.
It is globally sold as a big hatch and this could make way into India for its strong attributes such as high seating capacity and spacious interiors.

Car damaged in Sec 46  7th incident in 6weeksBabu Ram Aggarwal with his car in Sector 46, Chandigarh, on Sunday. (Express photo by: Jasbir Malhi)
Chandigarh | Posted: October 6, 2014 3:14 pm | Updated: October 6, 2014 3:22 pm
Kartik Kumar
The rear windscreen of a car was smashed with bricks by unidentified persons in Sector 46 on Saturday night, making it the seventh incident of vandalism of cars and other vehicles in southern sectors in the last six weeks. In all cases, vehicles were smashed and burnt at night.
Owner Babu Ram Aggarwal is at a loss why his car was damaged. He had no enmity, nor did he fight with anyone. In fact, in most cases the vehicle owners were equally clueless. And all cases, except one, have remained unsolved.
On September 10, windscreens of two cars, belonging to Major R S Gujral (retd) in Sector 35, were damaged. CCTV cameras at his residence recorded a group of boys arriving in a white Scorpio car, throwing bricks at the cars, one parked inside the house and the other outside, and driving away.
“We are clueless. In some of the cases where the culprits can be seen in CCTV recordings, the footage was unclear due to resolution issues. With barely any leads, we are now following a policy of containment,” said ASP (South) Urvija Goel.
“The PCR vehicles monitoring the area have been ordered to intensify patrolling,” said the ASP.
On September 22, Kamla Kapoor, a resident of Sector 38, reported that unidentified persons had burnt her two cars parked outside her residence. The police said that the cars were burnt with the help of a flammable liquid. A case was registered against unidentified accused, but no one has been arrested.
Earlier, on September 9 morning, three cars in Sector 32 were found vandalised. The miscreants had used bricks and iron rods to damage the vehicles parked outside houses. The complainants suspected involvement of two persons living near the locality, but the police found no evidence against them.
In a similar case, three men damaged a car parked outside a house in Sector 56 with bricks and bamboo sticks on September 12. The car’s rear and side windows were broken. Owner Sahil Kumar came out after hearing the noise of breaking of windowpanes and saw three youths fleeing on a motorcycle, but could not identify them. A case was registered against one of the neighbours on suspicion, but investigation showed nothing against him.
The police’s only success has been in a case in which three auto-rickshaws, two motorcycles and a Scooty were burnt in the wee hours of August 26 in Sector 56. Following investigation, the police arrested three men, who confessed to the crime stating that they were under the influence of alcohol.

David Warner inspires Australia to easy win over Pakistan in one-offT20IAggressive southpaw David Warner led Australia's assault (Source: AP)
Reuters | Dubai | Posted: October 6, 2014 3:14 pm
Three debutant bowlers and a typically rampaging innings from David Warner helped Australia coast to a six-wicket victory over Pakistan in their sole Twenty20 international in Dubai on Sunday.
The win meant Aaron Finch began his stint as T20 captain in style to boost the tourists ahead of the three-match one-day series starting on Tuesday.
Debutants Cameron Boyce, Kane Richardson and Sean Abbott all took wickets in their first overs to restrict Pakistan to 96-9 under the lights. Boyce ended up with two for 10 while stalwart Glenn Maxwell picked up three for 13.
Warner then led the assault on the easily gettable total, reaching his fifty by smashing a switch-hit six. He finished on 53 not out off 39 balls as Australia made their target in 14 overs.

John Lennons guitar to fetch USD I million atauctionPress Trust of India | London | Posted: October 6, 2014 3:12 pm
A guitar that Beatles star John Lennon played on the recording of ‘Paperback Writer’ is expected to fetch as much as USD 1 million at the auction. The online bidding will begin on 14 November. The late musician had given his Gretsch 6120 guitar to his cousin, reported The Independent.
“I was just cheeky enough to ask John for one of his spare guitars. I had my eye on a blue Fender Stratocaster lying in the studio, but John suggested the Gretsch and gave it to me,” Birch said.
TracksAuction.com said yesterday that this casual favour meant Birch was now in possession of one of the most significant of Lennon’s guitars to come on to the market in the past 30 years.

IIM data shows dip in CATregistrationsPrint
Written by Ardhra Nair | Pune | Posted: October 6, 2014 3:01 pm
The data released by the Indian Institute of Management has an interesting trend to show. While there are several MBA colleges coming up and even premier management colleges like IIMs proposed, there has been a dip in the registrations for Common Admission Test (CAT), the entrance exam held for an MBA degree. From last year’s 1.95 lakh, the registrations have come down to 1.89 lakh this year. The year before last, the registrations stood at 2.14 lakh.
Experts feel that once considered a dream course, the management degree is losing its  sheen. Students and experts are both of the view that it is the increasing supply and reducing demand for management graduates that is giving way to such a situation.
“For students who seriously want to pursue an MBA degree, getting placed in big institutes like IIM and ISB is very important. However, the problem arises when a lot of students opt for the course just to add a degree to their resume,” said Pallavi Sinha, an MBA aspirant.
Another student from a prestigious college in the city said, “When companies come to recruit us, they do not look for what text books teach us. There is a huge difference in what recruiters want and what we are taught.”
Pratibha Singh, Co-founder, Talks About People, a leading hiring consultancy firm, said, “Students from big B schools are placed really well. However, the problem is with smaller institutes which are responsible for diluting the quality of the course.  There are colleges which give out degrees, which are later declared invalid by higher authorities. This hurts the image of the course.”
She added, “Companies now prefer people who before pursuing MBA have specialised in a certain filed and gained some experience. These aspirants have actually worked on the ground and have sound concepts, which doubles up with an MBA degree to land them big jobs.”

Arun Jaitley discharged from AIIMS  doctors say vitalsstablePrint

Minister of Finance and Defence Arun Jaitley was discharged from AIIMS on Monday morning after a week-long stay in a private ward at the institute for treatment of a respiratory infection.
AIIMS spokesperson Dr Amit Gupta told The Indian Express: “Mr. Jaitley was discharged from AIIMS today. His respiratory infection, developed after a recent surgery, was successfully treated and all his vitals are now stable.”
Jaitley was admitted in a private ward at the hospital’s Cardio Neuro (CN) tower, and advised isolation to ensure fast recovery. Doctors said Jaitley who had reportedly complained of a stomach infection first in a follow up after his surgery, was treated “primarily for a respiratory infection” at AIIMS, that he developed later. ” Very few people apart from his doctors were allowed to visit him,” Dr. Gupta said.

Jaitley underwent a gastric bypass surgery for diabetes management at Max hospital in Saket on September 2, and was diagnosed with a stomach infection and chest congestion during a routine follow up  lat the hospital, after three weeks. Doctors also said he had lost “considerable” weight, his diabetes was controlled and kidney function improved-all intended outcomes of the surgery for diabetes management. Jaitley was later shifted to AIIMS for treatment of his respiratory infection.
Jaitley had been clearing urgent official matters from the hospital, and doctors said he was exercising and eating well in the last few days of his hospital stay.

With his own start-up  CoEP student races ahead in appworldPrint

At a time when every engineering student in the city is appearing for placement interviews, Shashwat Pradhan, a fourth year student of College of Engineering, Pune (CoEP), is already an entrepreneur planning to expand his company. With one of his apps “topping the charts” last week in BlackBerry World and another too among the top ones, Shashwat now plans to extend his expertise to other platforms like iOS and Android.
Emberify, which was founded by Shashwat, has two developers and a designer working for it at present. “It was founded on July 25 (2014) and I was operating it in stealth mode till now. I first wanted the apps to do well and then go public about it,” said Shashwat, a final year student of computer science engineering. Emberify is a start-up company working on consumer-based analytic and utility apps.
“Using contextual information, cloud integration and analytic technologies, we aim to create a more relevant mobile experience for their users. Emberify has also been accepted into FbStart, a start-up mentoring program by Facebook,” said Shashwat.
While Shashwat’s parents are from IIT Kanpur, his elder brother works in the US and his younger brother is studying in Delhi Public School here. “I always wanted to start something of my own. I took up computer science engineering so that I could make my own start-up,” said Shashwat, who hasn’t appeared for any of the placement interviews happening in his college.
The first two products of the company in the last three months, Instant and Reminder Now, were well received by the target group. Reminder Now is an app that gives the user reminders based on his/her location and requirements. “For example, if you want to buy milk, enter that in the app. The moment you pass a grocery store, it will remind you that you need milk.
Similarly, if you have to discuss an important topic with someone, the app will remind you once the person calls or texts you. If you have to submit a project or anything like that, the app will remind you the moment you are leaving for your office etc. Hence, this app is very useful. Reminder Now made it to the No. 1 slot last week in the category of paid apps in BlackBerry World, which hosts over a  hundred thousand apps,”  said Shashwat.
The other app, Instant, helps one track the use of cellphones. “In this age where technology is taking over, people have become cell addicts. This leads to many requiring apps that can help them track the usage of phones. This app can be set in a way that it tracks your daily, weekly and monthly cell usage, analyses the kind of usage and then gives you a full report. If you want to use your cell for only four hours a day, the app will tell you to stop once you have reached your daily limit. This is especially useful for people in the business world and parents who want to keep a check on their children using continued…

Stocks could still stumble as earnings season looms
Greece expects to swing to growth in 2015...and
versions
ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Greece's economy is on track to emerge from a six-year recession this year and grow by 2.9 percent in 2015, though unemployment in the bailed-out country is likely to remain high, the finance ministry said Monday.
The government — facing the threat of an early general election — submitted a draft of the 2015 budget to parliament that sees tax cuts and a return to modest growth of 0.6 percent in 2014, ending the depression that erased roughly a quarter of national output.
"The country is entering a long period of sustained economic growth rates and primary surpluses that will bring growth in employment, reducing unemployment and improving living standards for all citizens," said Deputy Finance Minister Christos Staikouras.
"This is the result of unprecedented sacrifices made by Greek society, households and businesses. These sacrifices must not be wasted."
Prime Minister Antonis Samaras' conservative coalition is hoping to begin easing austerity measures demanded by bailout creditors who provided 240 billion euros ($303 billion) in emergency loans. The bulk of funding from eurozone countries ends this year, while loans from the International Monetary Fund will continue through 2016.
Staikouras said the government is committed to reducing emergency taxes, including a deeply unpopular bailout tax known as the solidarity charge.
But he conceded unemployment was likely to average 27 percent this year before beginning a slow decline.
Megan Greene, chief economist at Manulife Asset Management, said next year's growth target is optimistic as the government needs a strong performance to meet its targets.
"The draft budget is politically motivated — the whole point is for the government to boost its ever-waning popularity," she said.
The government faces a strong challenge from the anti-bailout Syriza opposition party and has called a vote of confidence in parliament this week. He could be forced to call an early general election by February, when the government would need opposition support in parliament to elect a new president.
Leading in opinion polls, Syriza is demanding a renegotiation of the bailout deal and a cut to public debt.
National debt is expected to reach 318.6 billion euros ($402 billion) this year, or 175 percent of GDP, according to the draft budget.

Global stocks higher after US jobs data...and
versions
NEW YORK (AP) — Some encouraging corporate news failed to give the broader stock market a boost on Monday, and stocks edged lower as investors waited for news on the outlook for the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy.
Hewlett-Packard jumped after announcing that it is splitting itself in two. One company will focus on personal computers and printing and the other on technology services. Medical-equipment maker Carefusion surged on word that it was being acquired by its rival Becton Dickinson and Co.
But after opening higher, stocks gave up their early gains and alternated between small gains and small losses.
The market's bull run has faltered in recent weeks and the Standard & Poor's 500 index logged its biggest monthly drop since January last month.  Stocks rebounded from that slump on Friday after a report showed a pickup in hiring last month, but many investors remain uncertain about the outlook for stocks as the Fed nears the end of its bond-buying stimulus program and considers raising rates.
"The tug of war between the bulls and the bears is ongoing now," said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential Financial.
The S&P 500 fell 3.08 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,964.82. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 17.78 points, or 0.1 percent, to 16,991.91. The Nasdaq composite fell 20.82 points, or 0.5 percent, to 4,454.80.
Hewlett-Packard gained after announcing that it is splitting itself in two. One company will focus on personal computers and printing and the other on technology services such as data storage, servers and software. The stock climbed $1.67, or 4.7 percent, to $36.87.
Carefusion jumped $10.58, or 22.9 percent, to $56.75 on news that it was being acquired by a rival. New Jersey medical equipment maker Becton Dickinson and Co. said it will pay $12.2 billion for the company, in a combination focused on medication systems for hospitals and pharmacies. Becton climbed $9.14, or 7.9 percent, to $124.98.
The Fed is due to release minutes on Wednesday of its policy meeting last month and the central bank will end its bond purchases this month. Now investors are watching for clues about the likely timing of any interest rate hike.
Investors should remember that if the Fed is raising rates, it will be because the economy is strengthening, said Karyn Cavanaugh, a senior market strategist at Voya.
"If the potential rise in interest rates is predicated on stronger growth....and if the market recognizes that earnings are good, and the economy is good then (higher rates) it shouldn't be much of an event," said Cavanaugh.
H&R Block logged the biggest drop in the S&P 500 after saying that its latest attempt to sell its banking business is getting delayed in the regulatory approval process. The tax preparer said it would not be able to complete the deal before the next tax season. Its stock dropped $1.75, or 5.5 percent, to $29.91.
Nasdaq-listed GT Advanced Technologies, a supplier to Apple, was also among the day's biggest losers. The company, which is developing sapphire materials to replace glass on some Apple's products, lost almost all of its market value after saying that it was filing for bankruptcy. The stock plunged $10.25, or 93 percent, to 80 cents.
In emerging markets, Brazil's stock market surged after the left-leaning President Dilma Rousseff was forced into a runoff race against Aecio Neves, a center-right challenger, who only surged in the final week of the campaign. Rousseff is promising to expand Brazil's social programs and continue strong state involvement in the economy, while Neves says he will pursue more centrist economic approaches, such as central bank independence, more privatizations and the pursuit of trade deals with Europe and the United States.
Brazil's benchmark Ibovespa index rose 4.7 percent to 57,115.
The dollar fell to 108.96 yen and the euro inched up to $1.2624. U.S. government bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which moves in the opposite direction to its price, fell to 2.42 percent.
In energy trading, oil rose as the value of the dollar dropped. Meanwhile, natural gas fell sharply on forecasts for warmer weather.
U.S. benchmark oil rose 60 cents to $90.34 a barrel. Brent crude, a benchmark for many international oils imported by U.S. refiners, gained 48 cents to $92.79 a barrel in London. Oil is priced in dollars, so a decline in the dollar makes oil cheaper for buyers holding other currencies.
Natural gas dropped 14 cents to $3.90 per 1,000 cubic feet amid forecasts of mild temperatures along parts of the East Coast. Wholesale gasoline rose 3.47 cents to $2.413 a gallon and heating oil rose 0.5 cent to $2.621 a gallon
In metals trading, the price of gold rose $14.40, or 1.2 percent, to $1,207.30 an ounce. Silver also gained, climbing 40 cents, or 2.4 percent, to 17.23 an ounce. Copper gained 3.7 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $3.04 per pound.

German factory orders down sharply in August...and
versions
BERLIN (AP) — German factory orders dropped sharply in August, led by a big drop in demand from abroad and canceling out a large rise the previous month, official data showed Monday.
Orders in Europe's biggest economy were down 5.7 percent compared with the previous month, the Economy Ministry said, a significantly worse showing than the 2.5 percent drop economist had predicted.
The ministry said big-ticket orders were slightly below average and demand was hit by the timing of school vacations in Germany, but conceded that demand was weakened by the "hesitant economic development" of the 18-nation eurozone and uncertainty caused by "geopolitical events" — shorthand for crises in Ukraine and the Middle East.
The previous month's data had sent a positive signal, with orders rising 4.9 percent in July following two more modest drops.
"Besides technical factors largely causing this enormous swing ... we think that the first signs of fundamental weakness have arrived in the German manufacturing sector," said Andreas Rees, an economist at UniCredit.
A closely watched survey of German business confidence has declined for the past five months amid fears caused by the persistent turmoil in Ukraine and sluggish growth in Europe and China.
The drop in August was led by a 9.9 percent fall in orders from outside the eurozone, followed by a 5.7 percent decline in demand from other countries in the eurozone. Domestic orders were down 2 percent.

Keep cash in hand. Most probably by the end of this month or the next, depending upon when we hit the 8300-8400 area, most of the infra stocks are going to bottom out.
That will be the time to go aggressive long in those stocks. You will not get a 2nd chance after that fall.

Coverage of antenatal care in India has to be increased: WHOobstetrics/gynecology
''Antenatal care is very important for health workers to detect mothers with obesity or diabetes... both specific risks during pregnancy," says Dr. Flavia Bustreo, Assistant Director General at WHO.
In 2013, globally, preterm birth complications were responsible for 15 per cent (0.96 million) of deaths in children under five years of age. It is a leading cause of death in neonates (0-27 days after birth). According to WHO, about 15 million babies are born preterm (before 37 completed weeks of gestation) every year. Such births are seen both in the developed and developing countries.
India ranks first in the list of 10 countries that account for 60 per cent of all preterm births; the U.S. is ranked sixth in the list.
“India has little more than 50 per cent of antenatal care coverage. So in order to face the issue of premature births, low birth weight babies and stillbirths, the first aspect is to increase the coverage of antenatal care,” Dr. Flavia Bustreo, Assistant Director General at WHO told this Correspondent. “During antenatal care, health workers can detect whether progress of foetal growth is happening normally, pregnant mother’s nutrition is good or look out for any other complications.”
What is evident in the latest data is that across the world, nearly 30 per cent of maternal deaths are linked to indirect causes like gestational diabetes and obesity — especially among young mothers, and the influence of communicable diseases on maternal deaths.
“So antenatal care is very important as health workers can detect mothers who are obese or have diabetes. These are specific risks during pregnancy and should be given particular care,” Dr. Bustreo said. “This is not happening in India. India has to particularly care for mothers for what we call as pre-existing conditions.”
Pregnant mothers who have diabetes, are obese or have preeclampsia (high blood pressure) are less likely to complete full term and babies will be born with low birth weight. Therefore, antenatal care becomes all the more important.
Of course, babies who are born before full term can still survive as simple interventions and treatments are available. For instance, corticosteroid given to mothers before delivery can greatly facilitate the development of the babies’ lungs. It can also be given to babies soon after their birth in cases when delivery takes place even before the steroid can be given to pregnant mothers. The steroid greatly reduce the possibility of neonatal deaths. Similarly, kangaroo mother care can go a long way in keeping babies warm and improve their chances of survival.
More to do
“India has to still progress. What is available as special care facilities for babies that are low birth weight and premature are not sufficient in number. What I have seen happening is that some of the facilities in private hospitals have moved very fast especially in the cities. But when you come to rural areas in North India, this is something that is still missing,” Dr. Bustreo said. “So this leads to loss of babies who are born too early or born too small. This is part of India’s challenge.”
Within reach
While being critical of the shortcoming of the Indian government, she is still very optimistic. “Our latest data show that India is just an inch away from reaching the MDG4 (child morality) and MDG5 (maternal mortality) targets. [The current under-five mortality rate is 56 and should reach 42 before December 2015. The MMR is 190 and should drop to 140 before the end of next year.] It’s just a matter of the curve accelerating a little bit. I am hopeful that if the new government concentrates constructively on the challenges and focuses on the strengths of immunisation programme then India can achieve the MDG4 target,” she stressed.
One big challenge that stares the country in the face is the reach of antenatal care. According to the 2014 data, antenatal care in rural areas is about 50 per cent for more than one visit and about 10 per cent for more than four visits. The availability of skilled attendant at the time of delivery is only about 20 per cent in rural areas.
Yet, Dr. Bustreo remains confident. “These data are retrospect. We don’t measure them in real time. I can tell you some countries that have seen huge progress when they applied themselves to the task. For example, in the case of child mortality, we have seen annual rate of reduction of seven per cent, nine per cent and even 10 per cent in the case of Ethiopia, Rwanda and Malawi,” she said. “So if India applies specific measures, I am quite confident that it would really come close to meeting the goals and it would surprise everybody.”
Talking about the huge number of adolescent marriages and women’s role in the society and education, she noted that positive results can be obtained despite certain determinants that impact on maternal and child mortality taking a long time to change.
“What we are arguing at this juncture is that India can strengthen the provision of care so even if you have a young adolescent pregnant mother or if a pregnant mother is affected by gestational diabetes or is biologically not matured and delivers a preterm baby, she and the baby can be saved,” she noted. “Some determinants will take a generation to change but providing critical care will not take a generation.”

Ready for Australias pace challenge: RohitThe Hindu Rohit Sharma. File photo
TOPICS
Test cricket
Gearing up for the pace test that awaits India in Australia come December, batsman Rohit Sharma said the likes of Mitchell Johnson and Peter Siddle would be a tough challenge to deal with but the Indians are no longer intimidated by bouncy tracks Down Under.
“Australia will be a challenging tour for us. Mentally, each and every cricketer have a different way of preparing or doing their respective homework for a tour. I am no different and I will also have my plans in place as we come nearer to the time of the tour,” Rohit told PTI in an interview.
“Facing the likes of Mitchell Johnson, Peter Siddle, Ryan Harris will be a stern test. But we have faced Dale Steyn, Morne Morkel in South Africa. We have played on bouncy as well as seaming pitches in South Africa, New Zealand and England in the past one year.
“Also, most of us have been to Australia before and know what to expect from pitches out there. Also it will be a good preparation for us before the World Cup, next year,” he explained.
The tour includes four Test matches starting December 4 in Brisbane. The series’ other games will be played in Adelaide (December 12 to 16), Melbourne (December 26 to 30) and Sydney (January 3 to 7).
After a break, the ODI tri-series will start on January 16, the finale of which will take place on February 1 in Perth.
Rohit has been more consistent as a batsman after he started opening the batting for India in the ODIs and he admitted as much.
“Opening the batting for India changed me as a player. My perspective on building an innings has improved tremendously since I started opening the batting. I believe I have become a better overall cricketer once I started opening the batting,” said Rohit.
Ajinkya Rahane has also done well as an opener in England ODIs and Rohit does not feel that there is any competition between him and the fellow Mumbaikar.
“I have loved my role as an opener but I am proud of what Ajinkya has achieved in England. For me, it does not matter which position I am batting as long as I am making a contribution to team’s cause. If I am told to open by the team management, I would humbly accept it and if I told to bat in the middle-order, it will be an equal honour. I have no choices or preferences as far as batting slots are concerned,” said Rohit.
The right-hander was castigated from all quarters for playing a lofted drive at the stroke of tea time during India’s third Test against England at Southampton but the 27-year-old does not regret playing that shot against off-spinner Moeen Ali.
“I agree that the dismissal at Southampton is one of the disappointing ones in my international career. But if you ask whether I regret playing that shot, then I would say ‘no’
“I had a plan in my mind but I couldn’t execute that plan properly. The dejection is there because of non—execution,” Rohit, who is nursing a shoulder injury and fractured finger, said.
He then gave a technical explanation to his answer.
“I had already hit Moeen Ali for two fours at that point of time. The idea was not to let a part-time offie dominate us. I was batting freely and had started middling the ball.
Myself and Ajinkya were having a good partnership (74 runs).
“I didn’t want to get into a shell. It was a tossed up delivery and I came too close to the pitch of delivery and couldn’t get the required elevation. That ball might have gone for a six,” said the stylish Mumbai batsman.
Rohit, who had to return home with a fractured finger during the England series, said he is on course for a comeback soon.
“You feel bad but in sports injuries will happen and I have learnt to live with it. I am in a happy space as far as my rehabilitation is concerned. I am aiming to make a comeback during the Test series but will only come back when I am completely match-fit,” said Rohit, who has so far played 7 Tests apart from 124 ODIs and 42 T20 Internationals.
On a different note, when asked whether he would like some extra padding on his gloves since he has now had a fracture twice, the batsman answered in the negative.
“I know a lot of batsman use extra cushion on their gloves but I have never felt comfortable with that idea of using extra padding on my gloves. I feel that my hand manoeuvring will suffer due to that,” he said.

At home with web pioneer Dame Wendy HallOctober 3, 2014 2:56 pm
Web pioneer Dame Wendy Hall on the future of the internet
By Ben Martynoga
The computer scientist talks about personal data, cyber crime and why, one day, we could all have chips in our brains

Welcome to our mini safari park,” beams Dame Wendy Hall as she leads the way into her three-acre woodland garden on the edge of the New Forest in southern England. “There are the giraffes, and here’s Rosie the rhino. There’s a hippo floating around somewhere, too . . . We got our inspiration from South Africa’s Kruger National Park and wanted to bring some of that drama back to our own piece of forest.”
More
At home with tech entrepreneur Zach Sims
Hall is no ordinary zookeeper. Thankfully, the full-size rhino does not present a threat because it is bright green and made of plastic. It means Hall is free to relax in her summer house and talk about a subject close to her heart: the future of the web and the internet.
Hall, 61, a professor of computer science at the University of Southampton, is well placed to comment. Ten years ago, alongside internet pioneers Tim Berners-Lee and Nigel Shadbolt, she established a new academic discipline: web science. Now she works with economists, lawyers, cognitive scientists, historians, computer scientists and experts from many other fields to understand what happens when global networks of humans interact with global networks of computers. Their grand aim is to chart the frantically paced evolution of internet-based technologies. They want to predict where it is going in the future and what it means for how we live and interact.

Hall’s new garden pond
Electric-blue dragonflies zip over the surface of Hall’s freshly dug 10-metre wide pond – “definitely deep enough for a dip” – as she recalls her first encounters with computers. The early signs were not encouraging. During her mathematics degree in the early 1970s she had to tussle with punch card-programmed mainframes – “awful things,” she says. As home computers became more powerful and user-friendly, she quickly spotted their huge potential and acquired the skills to program and master them.
Favourite thing
“I’m a Scorpio Dragon,” says Hall with a twinkle in her eye. “That’s a very intense combination”. Her friend and colleague in China clearly recognised this fact in giving her this Liuli crystal dragon. “Isn’t it beautiful?” says Hall. “You can see how the sunlight flows through it and all the colours change.”
Even before the hardware could cope, she was certain the future lay in merging multiple streams of information by linking video, text and images on screen. By the end of the 1980s, just as Berners-Lee was floating the first plans for the world wide web, Hall’s research group at Southampton university had developed Microcosm, their own similar hypermedia system. It was the web that ultimately took the world by storm, but Hall has been at the forefront of developments in that sphere ever since. No surprise, then, that in 2009 she was made a dame for her services to science and technology.
A heavy shower drives us back up the long garden to the house she shares with her husband, Pete, who recently retired as a physics professor. It stands in the village of West Wellow, a few miles outside Southampton, the city where Hall has spent almost all her working life. She leads the way through large sliding glass doors and into an expansive open-plan living space that dominates the asymmetrical, A-frame, 1972-built house. The bedrooms are reached from a mezzanine balcony above. Two wooden giraffes, purchased from a roadside stall in South Africa during one of Hall’s frequent trips abroad, peer over the banister. The walls are decorated with abstract paintings in grey and yellow, photographs of the couple’s patch of woodland and intriguing telescope images of the stars made by fellow Southampton professor Greg Parker.

Living area
She settles on a comfortable cream leather sofa to continue the discussion. Hall is visibly excited by the huge promise of internet technology to deliver better education, healthcare, transport and commercial opportunities. She is also relaxed about increasingly sophisticated devices becoming incorporated into our own bodies. “I’m sure we’ll end up with chips in the brain.” It follows that she is an enthusiastic adopter of new technologies. The interview is punctuated by rapid fact checking and image-finding on her smartphone. However, Hall also recognises the need to turn off; each year she spends a week in rural France with her husband without access to the internet. Admittedly, she says, it is “actually a real pain” these days to be offline for a whole week.
The web is very masculine. Women are 50 per cent of the users, so why aren’t they part of its design
Although she is a “glass half-full person” by nature, Hall is not blind to the dangers of the world’s ever growing reliance on computer networks. Online privacy, loss of control over personal data and the omnipresent threat of cyber crime and cyber terrorism concerns her deeply. “I liken it a bit to climate change: we all know there’s a problem and there will have to be huge international, national and personal efforts to sort it all out.” Hall is part of the new Global Commission on Internet Governance and the surveillance review ordered by UK deputy prime minister Nick Clegg. She stresses that it is not in the interests of the Googles and Facebooks of this world to create products that the public are too frightened to use. With a bit of luck, she is right and we are not doing too little, too late to avert the looming crisis.

Metal chest of drawers
Hall walks into her compact office that looks out on to the garden. There is a conspicuous absence of a computer on her desk, but she draws a sleek laptop from her handbag and sets it on the glass surface. Like the rest of the house there are surprisingly few books on display. “We love to read but have chucked most of them and gone digital,” she says. The couple’s large CD collection survived the chop. They don’t listen to the discs any more, favouring downloadable files, but they consider the collection “a bit of an artwork that contains our shared history”.
Music is important to Hall. She loved being a teenager in London in the swinging ’60s and still doesn’t “like everything being silent”. She wishes she could find more time to play the black piano that takes up almost half of her small office.
She walks back into the living room via a well-equipped kitchen with cherry-red cupboard doors. Apart from a well-used coffee machine, the kitchen is spotless. “I love cooking but don’t have much time for it these days.”

Garden and summer house
Hall, who chose not to have children so as to focus on her career, is not at all interested in playing out traditional gender roles. Moreover, she is exasperated by the fact there are still so few women in computer science.
“Big data, the web of things, the internet: it’s all very masculine. Women are 50 per cent of the users, so why aren’t they part of its design?” she asks. She is increasingly passionate and outspoken on the subject of gender equality in science and technology , but is wryly aware that as she devotes more of her prodigious energy to the issue, her male contemporaries are free to push on and further widen the gap that she wants to eliminate.

Bird vase
Hall suddenly worries that the music coming from the high-tech sound system might be interfering with the recording of the interview. But she can’t make it stop and has to ask Pete for help. “It’s streamed, dear,” he says with mock condescension.
Computer scientist she may be, but Hall is no geek. The fact that she doesn’t obsess over technical details may be key to her success. Hall’s career has transported her from a PhD in an esoteric branch of mathematics to “the more fluffy end of computing”. In imagining a future where the internet and all the technologies built up on it serve mankind benignly and productively, Hall is willing to think outside the box. “I’ve always got my inspiration from the great science fiction writers: they don’t worry about how.”

Missed the Sunday shows Watch these three videos and get caught up.By Sean Sullivan October 5 Follow @WaPoSean
Missed the Sunday shows? Don't worry, we've got you covered. Here's what you need to know.
1. Ebola was a dominant topic of conversation. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Thomas Frieden said on CNN's "State of the Union" that Thomas Eric Duncan, who is being treated for Ebola in a Dallas hospital, is "fighting for his life." Frieden expressed confidence on ABC's "This Week With George Stephanopoulos" that there are no signs that anyone else in the United States has contracted Ebola.'
2. Asked whether he thinks the United States should send ground combat troops to northern Iraq and Syria, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) responded on CBS's "Face The Nation" by saying, "If we need special forces there, if that's what the generals say, then we need to do it." He added: "I think special forces and others are probably going to have to be on the ground, because after those missiles hit and they get out of those Humvees, they repaint their trucks. We have got to know where they are, and are the hits being successful?"
3. David Axelrod, a top former adviser to President Obama, said on NBC's "Meet The Press" that it was a "mistake" for Obama to say that his policies are effectively going to be on the ballot this fall.
Sean Sullivan has covered national politics for The Washington Post since 2012.

I regret drunk driving: LindsayLohanPress Trust of India | London | Posted: October 6, 2014 9:30 am
Actress Lindsay Lohan, who was arrested twice for driving under the influence of alcohol in 2007, says she regrets her actions.
Lohan, 28, who has also been in rehab nine times, vows never to drive drunk again, reported Contactmusic.
“I would never have got behind the wheel of a car after having a drink. Ever,” the ‘Mean Girls’ actress said when asked what one thing about her life she would change.
Lohan, who is currently starring in West End play ‘Speed-the-Plow’, says she had lost focus in the past but is determined to get her career back on track.
“Acting is what I do, it’s therapeutic for me, it’s fun for me. At the end of the day that’s the most important thing. The diligence and focus you have to have, that I maybe lost sight of for a little bit. Well I’m prepared now to deliver and all I can do is my best,” she said.

At least five civilians were killed and 34 injured on Monday as Pakistani troops resorted to heavy mortar shelling and firing from across the International Border (IB) and the Line of Control (LoC) in the Jammu and Poonch sectors.
Jammu Divisional Commissioner Shantamanu said the firing and shelling damaged a number of houses.
Pakistan said four persons were killed on its side in the Indian firing. The firing evoked strong condemnation from India with Defence Minister Arun Jaitley deploring the ceasefire violations. Home Minister Rajnath Singh asked Pakistan to stop such violations.
“They [Pakistan] should understand that the ground reality has changed in India,” Mr. Singh said. The Indian armed forces were “fully ready” and were responding to each of these provocations, Mr. Jaitley said.
The firing took place in the Arnia sector of RS Pura division, about 45 km from Jammu city. According to the Divisional Commissioner, the firing from the Pakistani side started at 11.30 p.m. on Sunday night and stopped at 7.30 a.m. on Monday. Among those killed was a 13-year-old girl.
According to a Defence spokesperson, the Pakistani troops also resorted to mortar shelling and firing on forward posts along the LoC in the Bhimber Gali area of Poonch since Monday morning.
Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah said the targeting of civilian areas exposed the frustration of the Pakistan government.
Pakistan’s Foreign Office spokesperson said a strong protest was lodged with India through diplomatic channels.

Nobel season opens with Snowden  chili research spicing up predictionsNobel season opens with Snowden, chili research spicing up predictions
AFP  Stockholm, October 06, 2014
First Published: 11:07 IST(6/10/2014) | Last Updated: 11:11 IST(6/10/2014)
Comments
Nobel season opens with speculation rife over fugitive US intelligence leaker Edward Snowden's prospects for the peace prize and whether the first award announced Monday -- the medicine prize -- could go to research into chili, heat and pain.
US physiologist David Julius has been touted by Sweden's leading daily Dagens Nyheter to win the medicine prize for discovering that pain receptors have the same reaction to pain, temperature and the spicy component of chili.
"David Julius's discoveries have given us a much deeper understanding of how feeling works and completely new possibilities to produce drugs against chronic pain," Maria Gunther, science editor at the paper wrote.
While the Nobel week begins with three science prizes -- including physics on Tuesday and chemistry on Wednesday, most of the speculation surround the coveted peace prize to be announced Friday.
This year's peace prize has drawn a record 278 nominations, including that for Snowden -- whose name was put forward by two Norwegian lawmakers for his exposure of widespread US electronic surveillance.
Snowden analyst would be a controversial choice as "many continue to see him as a traitor and a criminal", according to Kristian Berg Harpviken, director of the peace research institute Oslo (PRIO), one of few analysts to publish a list of potential winners.
Nonetheless the five members of the Nobel Committee could still give him the award to "underline the independence of the Nobel Committee" from the Norwegian and US authorities, according to Nobeliana.com, a website run by leading Norwegian Nobel historians.
   
Too controversial
Others have rubbished the Snowden speculation.
"Judging from the past, I can't see that coming. It's too controversial -- and Scandinavians are too fond of the (United) States," Robert Haardh, head of Stockholm-based Civil Rights Defenders told AFP.
Pope Francis -- topping bookmaker Paddy Power's list with 9/4 odds -- would be another controversial choice.
"Pope Francis has brought attention to the fate of the poor, and the need for a new approach to development and economic redistribution," according to PRIO's Harpviken.
But critics argue that a Nobel for the pope would cause a similar outcry to President Barack Obama's 2009 Nobel -- less than a year into his presidency -- which drew complaints that he was awarded for potential good deeds in the future rather than anything he had achieved.
Other favourites, also tipped last year, were 17-year-old Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani activist for girls' right to education and Congolese doctor Denis Mukwege.
While analysts believe the conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine do not easily lend themselves to a peace prize, the Nobel Committee could choose to promote international security cooperation as it did with last year's award to the chemical weapons watchdog OPCW.
"What we badly need at the moment is the re-evaluation of multilateral cooperation," Ian Anthony, head of the Stockholm peace research institute, SIPRI, told AFP.
Awarding a group like the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) could, "focus people's thinking" on how to solve conflicts like the one raging in Ukraine, he said.
   
'It makes scientists heroes'
Before getting to the peace prize, it is scientists who will be first in focus.
Nobel season is one of those few occasions in the year when scientists are in the media spotlight, said Sven Lidin, head of the Nobel Committee of Chemistry.
"It makes scientists heroes. It puts science on the agenda, and for a few days when the prizes are being announced and during the ceremony, the scientists are like rock stars, which is fantastic," he told AFP.
Among those predicted to take home the physics prize are professors Charles Kane and Shoucheng Zhang from the US and Laurens Molenkamp from the Netherlands.
The trio are Dagens Nyheter's bet for the prize for their work on new form of material, known as topological insulators, with potential real-life implications for computing.
Swedish public radio's science department meanwhile believes that Swedish evolutionary geneticist Svante Paabo could be a contender for the chemistry prize for his work on Neanderthal DNA along with US geneticist Craig Venter, one of the first to map the human genome.
   
Africa's turn?
As for the literature prize, which is expected to be announced on Thursday, Japanese author Haruki Murakami is once again the bookmakers' favourite -- with Ladbrokes offering odds of 5/1.
But literary critics are less confident about his chances.
"Murakami is probably a readers' favourite and certainly popular with many journalists but he lacks that extra depth," said Elise Karlsson, literary critic with Swedish daily Svenska Dagbladet.
With just four African literature laureates since the prize began in 1901, Kenyan author Ngugi wa Thiong'o and Algerian writer Assia Djebar are strong favourites among critics.
The economics prize -- traditionally dominated by Americans -- will wrap up the Nobel season on October 13.
Laureates will receive eight million Swedish kronor ($1.11 million, 878,000 euros) per award.

Associated Press | Hong Kong | Posted: October 6, 2014 12:02 pm | Updated: October 6, 2014 1:49 pm
Passionate, student-led protests for democratic reforms over the past week in Hong Kong have subsided Monday as many residents returned to work.

But a few hundred demonstrators remained camped out in the streets, vowing to keep up the pressure on the government until officials show they are sincere in responding to their demands.
Schools reopened and civil servants returned to work Monday morning after protesters cleared the area outside the city’s government headquarters.

Medical scientist who discovered Ebola fears that it may spread to IndiaOct 06, 2014 at 12:23pm IST
Medical scientist who discovered Ebola fears that it may spread to India

London: Professor Peter Piot who discovered Ebola in 1976 fears that it might spread to India. In an interview with British newspaper 'The Guardian', he expressed concerns over India's ability to prevent the deadly disease from entering India.
He said, "There will certainly be Ebola patients from Africa who come to us in the hopes of receiving treatment. And they might even infect a few people here who may then die. But an outbreak in Europe or North America would quickly be brought under control. I am more worried about the many people from India who work in trade or industry in West Africa. It would only take one of them to become infected, travel to India to visit relatives during the virus's incubation period, and then, once he becomes sick, go to a public hospital there. Doctors and nurses in India, too, often don't wear protective gloves. They would immediately become infected and spread the virus."
Professor Peter Piot, the Director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, was a researcher at a lab in Antwerp when a pilot brought him a blood sample from a Belgian nun who had fallen mysteriously ill in Zaire (now known as DR Congo).
In an interview with British newspaper 'The Guardian', he expressed concerns over India's ability to prevent the deadly disease from entering India.
#ebola #india #peter piot
He said, "In 1976 I discovered Ebola, now I fear an unimaginable tragedy."
A large number of Indians work or engaged in trade and commerce in the Western African countries like Nigeria, Ghana, DR Congo, Congo Brazwille, Angola, Namibia etc.
The government of African nations has put all international airports in India on alert and the passengers from India are made to go for a compulsory medical check up before exiting the airport.

Man kills friend for  poking  his girlfriend on FacebookMan kills friend for 'poking' his girlfriend on Facebook
AFP
print
A British man has been sent to jail for killing his friend because he "poked" his girlfriend on Facebook.
Scott Humphrey, 27, punched 29-year-old Richard Rovetto to death in a cab on their way back from a boys' night out, wtsp.com reported.
Humphrey allegedly hit Rovetto so hard that he fell and banged his head on the floor.
According to the cab driver, "Humphrey was accusing Rovetto of contacting his girlfriend in the past and doing so via Facebook".
Rovetto replied back, saying he was unaware of Humphrey's relationship with the woman.
Humphrey will spend the next four years and four months of his life in jail, the report added.

US chants NaMo mantra during Modi visitUS chants NaMo mantra post PM Modi's visit
Arun Kumar     Washington   Last Updated: October 10, 2014  | 13:36 IST
Prime Minister Narendra Modi (Photo: Reuters)
Prime Minister Narendra Modi was dressed for the occasion wherever he went, but the diverse colours that he donned on his recent visit to the United States had one unifying theme - to win America. And this is being talked about even a week after his visit.
And win America Modi did even before he reached Washington for a much awaited summit with US President Barack Obama after wowing the Indian diaspora, sharing the stage with top American music stars to reach out to America's liberal youth and wooing the big business in the Big Apple.
FULL COVERAGE: PM Narendra Modi in US
It was a surprise performance from a once provincial leader with little foreign policy experience who came to power just four months ago though with a historic win in the elections giving his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) a clear mandate for the first time in 30 years.
Landing in the financial capital of the US in a smart casual maroon bandhgala and black pants, he got out of his car in front of his hotel to shake hands with delighted members of the Indian-American community chanting "Modi Modi" as anxious security guys scrambled to keep their charge safe.
Then he switched to a more formal bandhgala suit for meetings with the city's mayor and a Nobel Laureate cancer researcher. That was to be the pattern of the Prime Minister's 100-hour action-packed whirlwind tour laced with symbolism.
Next day wearing his trade mark half sleeve Modi kurta and churidars with a grey shawl thrown on his left shoulder, he paid homage at Ground Zero where the twin towers of the World Trade Centre stood before the 9/11 attack, to show the country's resolve to fight terrorism and solidarity with Americans.
Switching to a formal blue bandhgala suit, Modi then took to the world stage with an address to the UN General Assembly choosing to speak in Hindi, the country's official language (the other being English).
And instead of mouthing clichÃ© ridden paeans to non-alignment he gave a call to form a 'G-all' in today's interdependent world. Yet he also chided Pakistan for raking up Kashmir at the UN and offered to engage in a "serious bilateral dialogue", but "without the shadow of terrorism".
In the evening, he outlined his vision of a 'Clean India' to a 65,000-strong youthful crowd at New York's Central Park addressing them in an idiom they understood saying "I salute you" and "May the force be with you" from the evergreen hit Star Wars films.
A capacity crowd of nearly 20,000 star struck Indian-American gave him a rock star like welcome at the Madison Square Garden as he spoke to them in Hindi in his chatty style for over an hour as thousands more heard him on jumbotron screens at Times Square and in homes across the US.
Then packing meetings with two governors, including South Carolina's Indian-American Nikki Haley, 40 odd lawmakers, 11 CEOs and an address to the Council on Foreign Relations, again in Hindi, the Prime Minister headed to Washington.
An Indian-American writer suggested that Modi through his fast for the Hindu festival of Navratri and the choice of his apparel was speaking in code his "Hindu nationalist" supporters, while another implied that he was cocking a snook to the American establishment that had denied him a visa for nearly a decade.
Be as it may, the US officialdom from Obama also treated Modi no less as they broke the ice over an exclusive dinner at the White House. As they shared common experiences, the US President wondered how Modi kept up such a rigorous schedule on just a diet of warm water and yoga and told him how he himself enjoyed dancing during his 2010 trip to India.
So much so that as the summit ended with the two leaders giving a new mantra of "chalein saath saath - together we go forward," Obama joined Modi on an unscheduled trip to the memorial of African-American civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.
Modi had come full circle in just four short months. There lay the true significance of the Modi visit though some critics dismissed their joint statement vowing to deepen cooperation in from defence to nuclear to space to counter-terrorism to women's empowerment and health as merely a rehashed 'laundry list'.
What PM Modi himself has called a " hugely successful " and US officials branded as an "extraordinarily successful" journey was different from others before in more ways than just optics: the two sides have lined up a "pretty ambitious agenda of engagement" over the next nine months or so to translate words into action.

No exchange of sweets between India and Pakistan at Wagah on EidPrint
Press Trust of India | Amritsar | Posted: October 6, 2014 2:42 pm | Updated: October 7, 2014 9:19 am
With tension prevailing on the border, the traditional exchange of sweets between the troops of India and Pakistan along the Wagah border in Punjab on Eid has been called off.
Official sources said during a late evening flag meeting between the sector commanders of the Border Security Force and Pakistan Rangers on Sunday, the other side refused to fix a proper time for the ceremony to be held today.
“The Pakistan side refused the exchange of sweets on Eid today. They cited no reasons but it is understood that the prevailing tension along Jammu and Kashmir border due to unprovoked firing incidents from the other side is the reason,” the sources said.
Hence, the BSF did not make any movement along the Wagah border and the border gates remained shut. The exchange of sweets between the border guarding troops of the two countries is an old and traditional gesture between the two sides which is aimed to show goodwill and this practice has been continuing for many years now.
The same drill is held during Deepawali and Independence day of both the countries.
Senior commanders from both the sides exchange sweets in their official uniforms along the Wagah land border here which is also frequented by locals and tourists from both sides. Sources, however, said that the evening retreat and lowering of flag ceremony is expected to take place as scheduled for every day.
Seven villagers were killed and at least 50 injured in heavy mortar shelling and firing by Pakistani troops targeting hamlets and outposts along the International Border in Jammu district on Monday in one of the worst ceasefire violations.

You probably dont know the real story behind Baby on Board signsThank you for letting us know.(Image via Safety 1st)
SHARE
Annalisa Merelli @missanabeem
October 6, 2014
In a recent piece about American parenting  and its effects on marriages, Danielle and Astro Tellers semi-jokingly attribute the origin of elevating children to gods—and parenting to a religion—to one viral object: the “ Baby on Board ” sign.
Whether or not the sign can be used as the ultimate testimony of an unhealthy obsession with one’s children, there are a enough legends surrounding its creation and use to prompt a little record-setting.
It is common belief that the sign was created so that, in the event of an accident, the emergency workers would know to look for an infant.
“I’ve never heard that theory before,” said Paul Maxwell, a paramedics with thirty years experience who runs a child injury prevention organization.  “I surveyed my crew and everyone thinks its to warn people to be extra cautious driving behind so as to not crash into them.”
And they are right.
Michael Lerner had the idea of marketing the sign in 1984, right after he drove his 18-month-old nephew home. He realized people were impatient at his driving :
“People were tailgating me and cutting me off,” he says. “For the first time, I felt like a parent feels when they have a kid in the car.”
He partnered with a couple that had been trying to promote the signs and was successful in doing so. Baby on Board became a fad, which he pivoted into a whole company, tapping into the need for well-designed and marketed products for child safety (drawer locks for instance), Lerner founded Safety 1st. The company reached $158 million in sales in 1999 and earned Lerner $38 million when it was acquired by Canadian company Dorel Industries in 2000.
It is possible that the misconceptions about the sign’s origin and purpose come from the fact that Safety 1st, the company that produces the Baby on Board signs, is a maker of other baby products with a focus on safety—from car seats to strollers. But that is not what the signs meant to be for.
Another widely spread legend—somewhat connected with the emergency theory—that the sign was created after a tragic accident :
Years ago, I heard a story about WHY the signs were created but only once, and I wonder if it is true. The story was that a serious car accident occurred and an unconscious woman was removed from the vehicle. The front of the car was badly damaged and it wasn’t until later (vague time frame) that a car seat with a dead infant was discovered under the front dash of the passenger side.
That, too, is—thankfully for the morals of those who’d have turned the tragedy into profit—not how the sign happened.
As it is now, the sign apparently isn’t much more than a novelty item. According to some reports, the signs may end up distracting drivers (and arguably increasing the likelihood of accidents) and slowing down the emergency intervention: drivers admit to often display the signs irrespective of whether their children are on board and emergency personnel may waste time looking for little ones when they are not there, rather then succoring adults.

Indias steel demand likely to grow 3.4% this year: WSAIndia’s steel demand likely to grow 3.4% this year: WSA
PTI
Tweet
New Delhi, Oct 6:  
Domestic steel makers, who are facing subdued off-take, have something to cheer about now as a premier global industry association has projected India’s steel demand to grow at 3.4 per cent during the current year.
World Steel Association (WSA), in its short-range demand outlook, has pegged demand growth for the next year even higher at six per cent, a significant rise as compared to 1.8 per cent in 2013.
“India’s outlook is improving following the election of a new government which is promising pro-business reforms. In 2014, India’s steel demand is expected to grow by 3.4 per cent to 76.2 million tonnes in 2014, following a growth of 1.8 per cent in 2013,” WSA said today.
“In 2015, structural reforms and improving confidence will support a further six per cent growth in steel demand but elevated inflation and fiscal consolidation remain key downside risks to the outlook,” it added.
In its April outlook, WSA had projected 3.3 per cent growth in steel demand for India in 2014.
Moody’s Investor Service had in August said steel consumption in India would pick up once the government’s infrastructure spending policies are put in place.
Continuing with subdued consumption trend for the last couple of years, India’s steel consumption grew by just 0.3 per cent to 31.17 million tonnes (MT) during the April-August period of 2014-15.
A S Firoz, Chief Economist, Joint Plant Committee (JPC), a body under the Steel Industry, recently said consumption of steel would certainly rise in India as a lot of infrastructure projects are already in the pipeline and that was why his assessment of three per cent growth was “not a tall order“.
“Besides, the automotive sector is reviving which will certainly pull the demand up. Capital goods sector and lot of machinery sector have also potential to do well. So, all these will pull demand,” he had said.
Construction sector accounts for around 60 per cent of the country’s total steel consumption while automobile sector consumes 15 per cent. Both sectors have been plagued by a slowdown in the economy.
WSA forecasts that the global apparent steel use would, however, nearly be halved at two per cent in the current year from 3.8 per cent growth recorded last year mainly due to slowdown in Chinese demand. The growth rate for next year would remain static at two per cent in 2015 to reach at 1,594 MT.

Kerala Muslims now sponsoring sacrificial meat for needful in northIndiaMuslims offer prayers on the occasion of Eid-ul-Zuha on Monday. (Source: Express photo by Gurmeet Singh)
Written by Shaju Philip | Thiruvananthapuram | Posted: October 6, 2014 3:31 pm | Updated: October 6, 2014 5:26 pm
Muslims in Kerala are now sponsoring hundreds of sacrificial animals to their poor brethren in North and North-Eastern states on the day of Eid.
Various relief and service organisations of different Kerala Muslim sects collect the fund from community members in Kerala and the amount is handed over to co-coordinators in respective states to buy sacrificial animals.
Kerala-based Relief and Charitable Foundation of India, promoted by prominent Sunni leader Kanthapuram A P Aboobacker Musaliyar, has made arrangements to distribute sacrificial meat to 50,000 families in 15 states.
Its all-India coordinator Muhammed Shafi said there are Muslim families in many North Indian villages which would not get sacrificial meat. “In Kerala, even a mahallu with 500 families would be sacrificing 20 to 30 animals on the day of Eid.”
“Kerala Muslim families under such mahallu committees would get huge quantity of meat. Lavishness is tangible with a family of five members, sometimes, getting meat of 5 kg or 10 kg on the day. Hence, we thought to help those people who are not lucky to get sacrificial meat. This time, we have focused on flood-hit Kashmir region,’’ says Shafi.
Shafi said a section of affluent Muslims in Kerala are offering sacrificial animal in Kerala and also outside the state. “Some are sponsoring the sacrificial animal only to our scheme. We want to take two kg of sacrificial meat to a five-member family in the North Indian villages, where the animals sponsored from Kerala would be sacrificed.”
The practice of Kerala Muslims offering sacrificial animals to North Indian states had existed in the past in stray incidents of interventions, but it got an organised nature only in last two years.
“The animal to be scarified would be decided by local leaders in respective states, depending upon the ban on particular animals. In some states, only goat is allowed as sacrificial animal, whereas in other states we are allowed to kill male buffalo,” said Shafi.
Jamaat-e-Islami in Kerala has a Qurbani (sacrifice of livestock) scheme to take sacrificial meat to impoverished Muslim villages in North Indian states. Its coordinator Abdul Latheef Kaloor said their activity targeted 2 lakh families. Last year, 1.75 lakh families had benefited from this offer.
He said instead of offering the animal in Kerala, many are now willing to perform the act in other states. This would ensure that every member of the community gets a share of the sacrificial meat, he said.
Other Muslim segments in Kerala are also engaged in sponsoring sacrificial animal in North India in various extents.

Ed Sheeran to perform at Courtney CoxsweddingEd Sheeran introduced Courteney Cox to her now fiance Johny Mcdaid. (Source: AP)
Press Trust of India | London | Posted: October 6, 2014 3:31 pm | Updated: October 6, 2014 7:39 pm
Singer Ed Sheeran plans to write a new song to perform at Courteney Cox and Johny Mcdaid’s wedding.
The ‘Sing’ hitmaker, who introduced the ‘Friends’ actress to her now fiance, said he might have to pen a new track for the big day because he has performed many of his existing tracks at other wedding receptions, reported Contactmusic.
“I’ve played it (Thinking Out Loud) around six times at six different weddings as a first dance now. My mates keep getting married and they keep asking me to sing it… Johnny won’t have that, he’ll expect me to write a song. He won’t let me get away with singing the song that’s been used for someone else,” Sheeran said.
Cox, 50, and the Snow Patrol rocker, 38, became engaged in June and are reportedly set to marry at the end of the year.

Eid celebrations in Kashmir a low-keyaffairPress Trust of India | Srinagar | Posted: October 6, 2014 3:26 pm
Eid-ul-Zuha celebrations were a low key affair in the Kashmir Valley on Monday as people observed austerity following last month’s devastating floods that left over 280 dead and property worth over Rs one lakh crore was destroyed.
Although Muslims made a beeline to Eidgahs, mosques and shrines to offer prayers, the usual fervour and zeal associated with the festival was missing.
The largest Eid congregation was held at Hazratbal Shrine where over 35,000 faithful, including Chief Minister Omar Abdullah, offered prayers, officials said.
The officials said 25,000 people gathered for Eid prayers in a school at Rajouri Kadal in the city. Reports of large congregations were also received from all district headquarters of Kashmir Valley, they said.
The sacrifice of animals such as sheep and goats as part of rituals of Eid-ul-Zuha, also known as Bakri Eid, was made by many devotees but the number of animals slaughtered this year was far less compared to previous years.
“Nearly 50 lakh people were affected by floods. I don’t think many of them would be in a position to offer sacrifice this Eid,” said Abdul Rehman, a flood victim from Jawahar Nagar locality.
With wide parts of Kashmir devastated by the ravaging floods last month, many locals decided to refrain from celebrating the festival this time around. Most locals abstained from purchasing new clothes for the festival, as is the practice on the occasion, and also avoided bursting firecrackers as part of celebrations.
Meanwhile, a minor law and order problem erupted after Eid prayers at Safa Kadal as a mob pelted stones at security personnel.
“The mob was chased away by using batons and normalcy was restored very soon,” a police officer said.
JKLF chairman Mohammad Yasin Malik, who had planned to offer Eid prayers at Lal Chowk along with businessmen and traders of the area, was taken into preventive custody by police ahead of the prayers.
Another separatist leader Shabir Ahmad Shah was placed under house arrest.
However, chairmen of both factions of Hurriyat Conference – Syed Ali Shah Geelani and Mirwaiz Umar Farooq — offered Eid prayers at Hyderpora and Eidgah respectively.

EXPRESS LOL: How will Amazon counter Flipkarts Big BillionDayPrint

Flipkart, fresh off the filling of its warchest with Rs. 6500 crore, is going big, with a Big Billion Day that promises discounts like never before. But there’s someone waiting in the wings, someone with two times the money, someone who has only ever before been defeated by Alibaba.

Shah Rukh Khan: Fan did not require a big femalestarPress Trust of India | Mumbai | Posted: October 6, 2014 3:19 pm
The female lead in Shah Rukh Khan’s forthcoming Yash Raj film ‘Fan’ is yet to be revealed but the Bollywood superstar says the movie is such that it does not require any big leading lady.
The 48-year-old actor is currently shooting for the film and will be seen in a different avatar in the movie helmed by ‘Band Baaja Baarat’ director Maneesh Sharma.
“I have ‘Fan’ with YRF and Maneesh. There are two girls in the film. It is a film where I don’t think you need a big lady star. It is cosy interesting, different film. It is one of the challenging films that I have done in 20 years. We are still discussing as to how we can take it ahead. It is a story of a fan of a movie star,” Shah Rukh told PTI. The actor has signed Rahul Dholakia’s next movie, ‘Raees’ and Rohit Shetty’s next. He is also in talks for another movie but nothing has been finalised yet.
“‘Raees’ it is a space I have never tried, it is a different film. Rahul Dholakia narrated the film to me and I liked it very much. They are cosy for me as an actor. Then I have Rohit’s film and another which I have not signed yet,” he said.
Shah Rukh is gearing up for his Diwali release ‘Happy New Year’, which will see him reunite with his ‘Main Hoon Naa’ and ‘Om Shanti Om’ director Farah Khan.
The heist comedy also stars Abhishek Bachchan, Boman Irani, Deepika Padukone, Sonu Sood and Vivaan Shah and will hit theatres on October 24.
Shah Rukh, who has produced the film via his Red Chillies Entertainment, said he plans to expand his production house and is also open to venturing into the regional space.
“We want to expand and plan to make three-five films a year may be with me or without me but not 10-12. We have started the process. The film has to have quality, essence then only we will make it. We want to take time and make good quality films,” the Chennai Express’ star said.
“I want to make a Marathi film. Rohit and I were talking about it but nothing concrete has happened. It is a good space. Not just Marathi but any other language film,” he added.

Chennai | Posted: October 6, 2014 3:17 pm | Updated: October 10, 2014 3:55 pm
After the likes of Sachin Tendulkar and Virat Kohli, cricket captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni has become the latest cricketer to own a football team in the high-profile Indian Super League, investing in the Chennaiyin FC ahead of the event starting October 12.
Dhoni, the current Indian cricket captain, has pencilled a deal to be a co-owner of Chennaiyin FC along with Bollywood actor Abhishek Bachchan.
Dhoni was excited to be a part of ISL as he is also passionate about football.
“I used to be a goalkeeper in school and always enjoy playing and watching the game. I wanted to be associated with football so when the opportunity came to be a part of Chennaiyin FC I was ecstatic as this gives me a chance to connect with the city of Chennai again. I have played
franchise cricket for this city so I know how supportive they are,” Dhoni stated.
He added, “I am sure all the players of Chennaiyin FC will see how much love Chennai gives to their players. The Hero Indian Super League is a fantastic platform for football to grow with so many big names, IMG-Reliance and Star India associated with it. I look forward to an exciting season ahead but at the same time it’s important that we develop the grassroots level and produce more football stars in India.”
Last month, Dhoni’s deputy in the Indian cricket team was announced as co-owner of ISL team FC Goa. Tendulkar is a co-owner of Kerala Blasters while ex-cricket captain Sourav Ganguly is a co-owner of Atletico de Kolkata.
The announcement was made by Chennaiyin FC co-owner Vita Dani.
“It is an absolute honour to have the legendary MS Dhoni as one of the co-owners of our franchise, Chennaiyin FC. Mahi has a strong association with the people of Chennai and so with him coming on board, we take another giant step towards achieving the goal of creating a world class football club in Chennai. Vanakkam Mahi!”
Chennaiyin FC starts their ISL campaign with an away game against FC Goa on October 15 while their first home fixture is against Kerala Blasters on October 21.
To a question if ISL would be as successful as IPL, Dhoni said, “Well it should be. There is no good reason as I said before that all the big players have associated themselves with the teams in ISL. All we need is support of the common man.”
He said like in the IPL, the upcoming football league, with the presence of international stars, will help in understanding different cultures.
“What it (IPL) helped us in a way was we started understanding different cultures. Initially, I thought Matthew Hayden will be very aggressive. But it turned out to be that he was a fun loving person. So, you get to know each other and more about the culture. It is the same case over here in ISL.
“The most important thing will be for our youngsters to look up to the international players as they play different type of football in Spain and France etc. So they bring their recipes and put continued…

Swachh Bharat: Khushboo tweets support for the missionBJP
(Prime Minister Narendra…)
NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi tagged South Indian superstar Kamal Haasan as one among the nine in his Swachh Bharat challenge, but he wasn't the only Tamil star who was impressed.
Khushboo Sundar , former member of the DMK, also tweeted her support for the abhiyaan on the day of the launch, setting off speculation that the BJP may be her next political port of call. "#SwatchhBharat..it's the duty of every citizen to keep our Bharat clean...start with home...use dustbins... segregate recycling items.. don't dump," says her tweet on the issue, along with a couple of other RTs from the prime minister's twitter handle.
"I believe that it's a great campaign, and that we all should contribute since it is our Bharat we will be cleaning up," she told ET. "As for joining the BJP or any other political party, let me say that I'm no longer with the DMK, and am currently on a break from everything, to figure out what to do next," she said.
"I don't want to join anyone in a hurry and later find out that either we have an ideological mismatch, or there is no growth there. That's what happened in the last political party I joined," she said.
Sundar was a member of the DMK and had quit the party on June 16 this year after she found "the one-way path of hard work in the party" not to her liking. She also had differences with DMK patriarch M Karunanidhi's designated successor MK Stalin.
The state BJP, which has been on the lookout for suitably prominent faces to project, has not exactly been lukewarm, but have adopted a wait-and-watch policy. "In the past, we had pursued actor Sivakumar, and the prime minister had met with his son Surya as well. But nothing came of that," said the source.
PM Modi actively wooed Rajnikanth, but apart from wishing the party well, the superstar hasn't committed anything. The state is in a political vacuum with Jayalalithaa in jail and the DMK not exactly in fighting form. Sundar, like others, is also watching which way the tide will turn before 2016 when assembly elections are due.
"A lot of my plans depend on what happens in the run-up to the Assembly polls in 2016," Sundar said.

Army Ranger veteran Peter Kassig identified as next Islamic State victimBy Dan Lamothe October 3 Follow @danlamothe

The possible next victim of the Islamic State militant group is Army Ranger veteran Peter E. Kassig, who moved to the Middle East to do humanitarian work before being taken hostage.
Kassig is shown at the end of a video released Friday that depicts the apparent beheading of Alan Henning, a British humanitarian aid worker who was taken hostage in Syria last year. Kassig started a small medical relief company known as Special Emergency Response and Assistance, or SERA, in 2012 that has headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, according to the company’s LinkedIn page . The city is close to the Syrian border and a way station of sorts for relief workers and journalists.
Kassig also was an employee with TYR Solutions LTD, a British firm that provides security and consulting and training for individuals planning to go to war zones, according to his LinkedIn profile .
Kassig enlisted as an infantryman, and was in the Army from June 2006 to September 2007 before being medically discharged as a private first class, Army officials aid. He was with the Army’s famous 75th Ranger Regiment from October 2006 to September 2007, and deployed with them to Iraq from April to July 2007.
Kassig said in an interview published by Time magazine last year that he traveled to the Middle East in 2012 after leaving the Army and while on spring break from Butler University in Indiana. He wanted to learn about the humanitarian crisis in Syria firsthand and see what he could do to raise awareness about it.
In a web page raising funds for his cause , the former soldier said he felt that more could be done to help the Syrians, and thought the most effective way was “through a close connection to those who were in desperate need, by meeting them where they were.”
“We may not have much but I have always felt that the reasons why you do something are as important as what you do,” he wrote. “This is about making a difference not just through material goods, but also the exchange of ideas and experiences that the interanational [sic] community benefits from through this type of iniative [sic].”
In a 2012 interview with CNN , Kassig said that he first traveled to the Lebanese capital of Beirut where he studied how complicated the conflict was. He said some people questioned what he was doing.  He told CNN he also wondered whether America was doing enough to help, although he didn’t support military intervention.
“This is real, and it’s scary stuff, and it’s sad what is happening to people here,” he told CNN. “People back home need to know about it, they need to know. Sometimes you gotta take a stand, you gotta draw a line somewhere.”

The market remained closed on Thursday and Friday on account of 'Mahatma Gandhi Jayanti' and 'Dussehra', respectively.
Traders said fall in demand at prevailing higher levels and a weakening trend global market pulled down gold and silver prices.
Globally, gold in New York, which normally sets price trend on the domestic front, fell two per cent to $1,190.30 an ounce, the lowest since December 31 after US employers added more jobs in September than forecast, stoking speculation that the Federal Reserve will move closer to raising interest rates.

Telangana and BHEL sign MoU for power generationUpdated: October 4, 2014 23:51 IST
Telangana and BHEL sign MoU for power generation
Swathi. V
electricity production and distribution
Cancellation of coal block allocations as ordered by the Supreme Court very recently, has come as a blessing in disguise for the power-starved Telangana State, as it is set to save one year from the duration required for erection of new plants by BHEL in the newly-formed State.
The Telangana government on Saturday entered into an agreement with the public sector giant for construction of new thermal power plants of 6,000 MW capacities in the State in the next three years.
Of this, at least 1,080 MW will be operational within 24 months, as against the standard 36 months required for erection of a power plant. Highly placed officials from the Telangana State Power Generation Corporation (TSGENCO), however, are optimistic that erection of units totalling 3,380 MW will be completed in the next two years.
“Due to cancellation of coal block allocations by the Supreme Court, material meant for other projects is lying idle with us. We will use them for four units of 270 MW in Manuguru, thus saving one year from the project duration,” Chairman and MD of BHEL B. Prasad Rao said.
The decision to entrust BHEL with installation of 1,080 MW at Manuguru was announced 10 days ago, when the Chief Minister K. Chandrashekhar Rao evinced interest in entrusting the rest of the projects too to BHEL.
The latest agreement for 6,000 MW on EPC basis was sealed between the Chairman and MD of the TSGENCO D. Prabhakar Rao and Mr. Prasad Rao, in the presence of the Chief Minister.
Imported coal
About 4,000 MW of the agreed capacity will be set up in Manuguru of Khammam district, and the rest is tentatively planned for Ramagundam in Karimnagar district. Land for all the projects will be provided by the Telangana government. Imported coal will be used to light up all the units.
BHEL has the necessary expertise and already executed thermal power projects in Bhupalapally, Singareni Collieries and Kothagudem, the performance of which was stated to be above the national average of the plant load factor.

Caps have choice with Tom WilsonBy Alex Prewitt October 5 Follow @alex_prewitt
(John McDonnell/The Washington Post)
In the coming weeks, once his stint on injured reserve ends , Capitals forward Tom Wilson will be ruled healthy enough to return, one more body lumped onto the crowded roster. Right before that point, Washington’s front office and coaching staff will confront a decision.
Last season, as a teenage rookie, Wilson debuted with the Capitals over 82 games, one of just two NHL rookies to play the full slate . But he spent the year averaging fewer than eight minutes per game, received more fighting majors (14) than he tallied points (10) and became a poster child for the downside of rushing prospects into the sport’s highest level.
“You’ve got to wait,” general manager Brian MacLellan said Saturday, during a long-ranging interview in his office at Kettler Capitals Iceplex. “We’ve got to wait for Wilson. We’ve got to get him back, see where he’s at. He’s missed some development time now. We’re going to have to ease him back into it, get him back to 100 percent then make our decisions. I don’t think we can do anything until we know where he’s at.”
When they do, what road should Wilson be sent down? A surplus of right-wingers awaits his return – Eric Fehr on the first line, Joel Ward on the third line, Troy Brouwer wherever – and the Capitals have insisted Wilson deserves a boost up the lineup, to avoid burying him into a fighting, grinding role again.
“He did,” MacLellan said, when asked if Wilson got rushed into the NHL. “But he handled it well, I thought. He probably could’ve handled a little bit more. He’s a physically mature man, so I think he can handle the NHL. Would’ve been great to have him come in, 100 percent, move up the lineup right away. But that’s not the way it panned out. We’ll get him there eventually.”
One option, and the most likely it seems, is delaying the choice while Wilson re-acclimatizes himself with NHL speed. His last game was the season finale versus Tampa Bay, when he logged 12 minutes for only the fourth time – all in March and April. Then he “fell” back home this summer, fracturing his fibula and halting his development while the ankle healed from surgery .
“You always want more minutes,” Wilson said in mid-September. “Everyone does. We’re all competitive guys and that’s what makes the game so great – everyone comes to camp and wants to have a spot on the team and whatever responsibility I can handle as a second-year guy, I’m going to be thrilled about and I’m going to do my best.”
The Capitals believe Wilson deserves more responsibility, but only once healthy. His current contract – a three-year, entry-level deal annually worth roughly $1.3 million in average value – would allow Wilson to rehab in Hershey, much like a baseball minor leaguer sent to the farm to get right.
“I’m not going to say this is going to be the situation,” Trotz said. “This could be a likely situation, where Tom would actually come up, play a lesser role with us, play less minutes, catch up with maybe not the speed but play the minutes. Then as he builds up a little bit of strength on that, an endurance factor on that, then maybe he goes for a stint and plays more minutes, maybe in a Hershey situation. It’s funny how that might work, but talking to the trainers, it might be a case in point where he actually can handle eight or 10 minutes here, but probably couldn’t handle 20 minutes off the bat.”
This would alleviate the pressure for Wilson to rush into the lineup because, right now, the Capitals like their choices at right wing. But they also know Wilson factors heavily into their future plans, and getting him top-six minutes must come with time.
“Huge part [of the future],” MacLellan said. “He’s a good player. He’s a well-liked teammate. We want him to get better as a player. Continue to evolve as a player. We’re going to do what’s best for him.”

Hewlett-Packard Plans to Split into Two Companies: ReportAmerican Tower to Buy Over 4,800 Bharti Airtel Phone Masts in Nigeria
Silicon Valley stalwart Hewlett-Packard Co, which has struggled to adapt to the new era of mobile and online computing, plans to split into two companies as it looks to put more focus on the faster-growing corporate services market, according to a Wall Street Journal report on Sunday.
The move, which could be announced as early as Monday, would be a monumental reshaping of one of technology's most important pioneers, which still has more than 300,000 employees and is on track to book $112 billion in revenue this fiscal year.
Under the reported plan, HP will separate its computer and printer businesses from its corporate hardware and services operations, and spin the unit off through a tax-free distribution of shares to stockholders next year.
A company spokeswoman declined to comment on the report.
HP's printing and personal computing business accounts for about half its revenue and profit, according to last quarter's financial results. It is not clear how many of HP's more than 300,000 staff work in each of the planned businesses.
Founded by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard in a Palo Alto, California garage in 1939, HP was one of the companies that shaped Silicon Valley and the PC revolution. Lately, however, it has struggled to adapt to the shift towards mobile computing, and it has been overshadowed by younger rivals.
HP's market value of $66 billion is dwarfed by Apple Inc's $596 billion and Microsoft Corp's $380 billion.
It has also been overtaken by aggressive Chinese PC maker Lenovo, which is now the world's No. 1 PC maker by shipments. Dell, which is HP's closest US competitor and facing similar pressure, was taken private by founder Michael Dell last year.
SPIN-OFF TREND
HP is the latest in a line of companies, often under shareholder pressure, to spin off operations in an attempt to become more agile and to capitalize on faster-growing businesses. Last week online auction company eBay Inc said it would spin off electronic payment service PayPal.
HP and some of its investors have long considered such a move, the Journal report noted. As one of the older big computer companies, for several years HP directors have discussed ways to restructure to keep up with technology upstarts.
A source familiar with the matter said HP had held merger talks with storage and cloud-computing firm EMC recently, as a way of moving more forcefully into online services.
Many investors and analysts have called for a break-up of the company, or a sale of the personal computer business, so that HP could focus on the more profitable operations of providing computer servers, networking and data storage to businesses.
Company executives have said in the past that personal computers underpin and support the company as a whole. HP did consider spinning off its PC division in 2011 under then-CEO Leo Apotheker, but ultimately decided against the idea.
The PC business has shown signs of life in recent quarters, growing broadly geographically as businesses replace aging machines. Even so, the report of the plan to split off that business surprised some on Wall Street.
"I wonder what would have changed in the board's thinking that previously they thought they needed computers together with services to properly serve large enterprises to now," said Hudson Square Research analyst Daniel Ernst.
"PCs and printing remain in long-term secular decline, and while HP has managed that business well, the challenges for that portion of the split company will only grow as the demand continues to erode, and commoditization forces prices down further."
The Journal, citing one of its sources, said the plans call for current HP CEO Meg Whitman to become CEO of the new so-called enterprise company and also be chairman of the PC and printer company.
Current HP lead independent director Patricia Russo would be chairman of the enterprise company. The CEO of the PC and printer company would be Dion Weisler, who is currently an executive in that division, the report said.

Cricketers fight for foothold in baseball-mad CubaAP Children gather in the street to start a game of cricket in the neighbourhood of San Miguel del Padrón in Havana.
TOPICS
cricket
The Caribbean is divided between baseball-playing countries with U.S. ties and cricket-playing islands that once belonged to the British Empire. Nowhere is more baseball-crazy than Cuba, but even here, a tiny-but-passionate group of men is trying to win people over to cricket, baseball’s slower-paced, more courtly British relative.
Mostly descendants of sugarcane workers who migrated from other islands in the early 20th century, Cuba’s cricket partisans subsist on homemade and donated equipment from the embassies of cricket-playing countries. They recruit players from the streets and teach them rules of the new sport, while exploiting baseball-honed skills such as batting and running bases.
The offspring of immigrants from the island of Martinique, Kiomai Aguiar said he played baseball and basketball as a child, then switched to cricket at 16, falling in love with its leisurely pace and courtly interactions between players. He now coaches Caballero and other youngsters playing pickup games in San Miguel del Padron on the outskirts of Havana.
“It’s a game that forces you to think, to organize, to do things deliberately. At the same time there’s respect and unity among the players,” said Aguiar, a 35-year-old unemployed maintenance worker. “There’s not a single cricket pitch in Cuba, so we play where they let us, on a soccer field, a baseball field, a running track.”
Cuba has organised cricket in six of its 16 provinces, with 1,150 registered players throughout the country of 11 million, said Barbara Delarra, an official with Cuba’s National Sports Institute.
“Youngsters like it because it’s similar to baseball, with pitching, batting and fielding. It’s a new sport and appealing to youngsters frustrated with baseball,” she said.
Cricket is also part of the cultural identity of Caribbean migrant communities in Cuba, the descendants of some 2,50,000 workers from Jamaica, Dominica and other British colonies who moved to sugar towns in eastern Cuba where they attended Protestant churches, ate spicier food and played cricket.
“They kept a lot of their identity,” said Jorge Giovannetti, chair of the Department of Sociology and Anthropology at the University of Puerto Rico and an expert on Caribbean migration to Cuba. “They kept some of their diet, they kept some of their religious heritage, and cricket is part of it as well.”
Cricket is most deeply rooted in the eastern province of Guantanamo, home to many of Cuba’s immigrant-founded communities, where cricket is frequently taught to children in afterschool athletics programs despite the lack of standard equipment.
“If we don’t have a bat, we make it from a stick. If there’s no ball, we make it from rags,” said Eliecer Brooks, the descendant of Jamaican immigrants who plays for Guatanamo’s cricket team. “We’ve wanted to maintain this tradition because it’s beautiful to remember one’s roots.”
Without a national tournament, Cuba has amateur tournaments like one played on a Havana soccer field last month between three Cuban teams and three teams of students from cricket-playing countries like Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
Adithya Senavirath, a Sri Lankan studying at the Latin American School of Medicine, where foreigners receive free medical education, said he enjoyed playing against Cubans instead of the fellow foreign students he usually faced in cricket.
“The Cubans have skills, they’re good bowlers,” he said. “They lacking some technique, but they learn fast.”

Report: HP to split into two companiesHP to split into two companies, report says
By Gregory Wallace   @gregorywallace October 5, 2014: 6:14 PM ET
Meg Whitman, the CEO of HP, has led a restructuring of the company.
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
The next step for computing giant Hewlett-Packard's restructuring may be a split into two companies.
The Wall Street Journal, citing unnamed sources, reported Sunday that HP ( HPQ , Tech30 ) plans to put the PC and printer operations under one roof and its business that provides software and services to corporate customers under another.
The Journal said the announcement could come as soon as Monday, and that the separation would take place next year.
HP spokeswoman Sarah Pompei declined to comment on the report.
The split follows a number of spinoffs and breakups this year. Most recently, eBay ( EBAY , Tech30 ) announced on Tuesday it would spin off the online payment platform PayPal , which it bought in 2002.
Meg Whitman, the CEO of HP, took the helm in 2011 and unveiled a five-year restructuring plan. That included a major overhaul of the printer and PC business in 2012. Layoffs then and since have totaled at least 45,000, and HP projected savings of $4.5 billion per year.
Related: Big companies that are making big job cuts
Her predecessor, Leo Apotheker, considered a corporate split similar to the one the Journal reported, but he left the company after only 11 months.
Whitman would have leadership roles at both companies, the Journal said. She would be CEO of the enterprise business and chairman of the hardware company.
Some investors applauded the potential move.
The split would allow HP to be more "nimble" and let it "reshape" its business, said Brendan Connaughton, chief investment officer at ClearPath Capital Partners.
In particular, Connaughton said, the move would put renewed focus on enterprise services, "where they have incredible margins," sometimes upwards of 20%.
HP is among the top five performers in CNNMoney's Tech 30 index , which tracks significant tech companies. Its stock has climbed nearly 26% this year, bolstered by earnings that have climbed even as sales slumped.

Gruden wont avoid Seattles ShermanBy Liz Clarke October 5 Follow @lizclarketweet
(John McDonnell/The Washington Post)
When Green Bay faced the Super Bowl champion Seattle Seahawks in the teams’ opener this season, quarterback Aaron Rodgers conceded half the field to cornerback Richard Sherman .
Of Rodgers’ 33 passes in the game, not one was directed at a receiver covered by Sherman, whose 20 career interceptions in just three season lead the league.
The strategy both irked and honored Sherman. It didn’t play out so well for Rodgers, either, who was intercepted by Seattle’s other all-pro cornerback, Byron Maxwell, en route to a 36-16 defeat.
Washington (1-3) faces a similar conundrum in preparing for Monday night’s meeting with Seattle (2-1).
Coming off a humiliating defeat in which Kirk Cousins ’s interceptions accounted for four of the Redskins’ six turnovers, where exactly should the backup quarterback target his throws?
“It’s a heck of a deal,” Coach Jay Gruden conceded of game planning against a Seattle secondary stocked with big players known for big-time plays. But Gruden said he had no intention of limiting Cousins to half the field. The 6-foot-3 Sherman boasts tremendous range, speed, smarts and the mind-set of a wide receiver, having played the position at Stanford before being converted to a cornerback midway through his college career.
“He’s obviously a great corner,” Gruden said of Sherman, who led the NFL with eight interceptions last season. “But we feel like we have good receivers, and we have to go out and challenge whoever the corner is. That’s why we went out and got DeSean Jackson and Pierre Garçon and Andre Roberts. So hopefully those guys will be up to the challenge. They definitely have to step up their routes, their route discipline coming in and out of breaks. And the quarterback has to do a great job with the accuracy and anticipation for us to have a chance.
“We’re not going to shy away from anybody, but obviously we know both corners are very good.”
Cousins echoed the coach’s sentiments, likening game planning around potential matchups to a chess match.
“[Richard Sherman] is a great corner; we have a lot of respect for him,” Cousins said. “There’s a reason he signed a great contract (worth $54.7 million over four years) and has a lot of success and a Super Bowl ring. So, he’s a guy to be aware of on the field. But at the same time you don’t want to be letting it affect you too much. That’s a balance you have got to find.”
Through three games this season, Sherman has yet to get an interception. Maxwell and 6-3 strong safety Kam Chancellor each have one.

Need to make sports integral part of school curriculum: Aamir KhanPress Trust of India | Chandigrah | Posted: October 6, 2014 11:32 am
Concerned over children not participating in outdoor activities, Bollywood superstar Aamir Khan today strongly lobbied for making sports an integral part of school curriculum in the country.
Interacting with media here after the airing of the first episode of the new season of ‘Satyamev Jayate’, the 49-year-old actor said, “Our children have the right to be taught sports as they are taught Maths or English.
“There is a strong need to reach out to children of weaker sections of society for teaching them sports. Sports should be made integral part of curriculum of main education.” On the habit of new age children interested in indoor games, Aamir said, “It frightens me that children play alone and are cut off from the rest of the world. Outdoor games help
in connecting with people.”
The ‘Dhoom 3 ‘ star said that intake of drugs by the youth is also a matter of concern. “We will come out with an episode in future to keep children away from drugs,” he said.

Talking about ‘Satyamev Jayate’, the actor said, “I am not the hero of the show. I get you introduced to the hero, the people who have been doing good things in their life.” Aamir said that the issue-based show has had an impact on the society and government in different states, including Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra which have taken decisions like distribution of generic medicines free to poor and raising the sex ratio.
He admitted that there is a need to highlight certain issues concerning Bollywood as well.
Aamir said that each individual had a capacity to do something and must contribute towards bringing change in the country. “If I can’t solve any problem that does not mean I sit idle, keep quiet and become a fence sitter. This country belongs to all…contribution from everybody is needed for bringing a change,” he said.
Aamir ruled out any plan to join politics, saying, “I enjoy my work.”

Chances are, you have your eyes on a new smartphone. The iPhone 6 or 6 Plus, Motorola Moto X, or Samsung Galaxy Note 4 has your attention. But to make way for the new phone, you need to get rid of your old phone.
I'm going to tell you how to make the most money when selling your old phone, even if the screen is broken or doesn't work.
Your tech (old and new)
Before you do anything ...
It's best not to sell your phone until you already have the new smartphone. Preparing a phone for sale means you won't be able to use it, and you don't want to be without a smartphone.
Plus, if it turns out you don't like your new one you'll want a backup.
After you have the new phone – and you've transferred your must-have information and made sure everything is working properly – it's time to completely wipe the old hardware. You don't want your personal information falling into the wrong hands, after all.
After your gadget is good and wiped, it's time to figure out how much it's worth. A site like WorthMonkey is a great starting point.
Just put in your model and it will give you the going rate. It even includes prices for the condition your gadget is in. Here's a hint: Fewer screen cracks mean more money. That's why I always recommend putting your protective phone in a case.
Once you know the gadget's worth, it's time to decide how you're going to turn it into cold, hard cash. Let's start with the easiest option.
Turn your gadget into a free gift card
Not everyone wants to go through the rigmarole of selling a gadget themselves. It could also be that your gadget really isn't worth that much in the first place. In either case, your best bet is a trade-in.
This usually means you give the phone to a store in exchange for store credit. In a trade-in, you take what the store offers, so there's no negotiating for a better price.
Unless you find a special promotion, it's a good bet that you won't be getting the best deal, either. What you will get, though, is a hassle-free, pretty fast way to turn your phone into money you can use.
You can trade in your gadget through Walmart , Best Buy and Amazon . Be sure to check to see which one offers the best price. If no one company offers the price that you want, then you'll probably want to sell your gadget on your own.
Note: Everything I'm talking about so far assumes that the phone actually works. If your phone is broken, keep reading to the end for your options.
How to sell your phone yourself
Your first question when selling your phone should be whether or not people want that model. The iPhone 4s, for example, is still one of the most popular iPhone models.
If you find your phone just isn't selling, then your best bet will be recycling services on the next page. Amazon has what is probably the easiest way to sell any gadget with Sell on Amazon .
You can compare prices on the product page for your gadget, pick a reasonable price, and wait for offers to roll in. Once sold, you can opt to either ship your product to an Amazon warehouse with "Fulfillment by Amazon" or handle the shipping yourself.
Opting for "Fulfillment" when selling your gadget usually means that the company will take a hefty cut of the sale, but it's also the fewest possible steps to get your gadget sold. If you want to go local, you can always sell your gadget on online classified services like Craigslist.
Always be sure to meet at a public place like a coffee shop or mall when you do something like this, and always deal in cash. Auction giant eBay is also an option. Don't forget that your friends and family might be open to buying an inexpensive older gadget. Just make sure it still works well.
Recycling services
Smartphones contain many valuable minerals. So valuable, in fact, that many companies will buy up any smartphone to get them.
These companies usually buy in bulk from any major retailer, but they have online storefronts, too. Sites like Nextworth , BuyMyTronics , YouRenew and Gazelle will buy your old phone for cheap.
That makes them not such a good deal for a working phone. However, if your phone is broken or scratched to the point where no one wants it, these services will usually give you a reasonable price.
They know how much they can earn by reprocessing the phone's materials. As always, be sure to compare prices between the possible options and spend the time researching the best value.

India asks Pak to stop ceasefire violations after border firing kills 5Pakistan continues to violate ceasefire, kills 5 civilians
Tarun Upadhyay , Hindustan Times  Jammu/New Delhi, October 06, 2014
First Published: 07:50 IST(6/10/2014) | Last Updated: 09:27 IST(7/10/2014)
Comments
The Indian government hardened its stance and asked the Border Security Force (BSF) to “retaliate with full force” after five civilians were killed and 29 wounded in firing by Pakistani forces along the border in Jammu on Monday, official sources said.
 
Tensions flared after four Pakistani civilians, including two children and a woman, were killed in retaliatory firing by India as home minister Rajnath Singh and defence minister Arun Jaitley warned Pakistan to stop such attacks if it wanted peace talks with India.
 
“Ceasefire violation must stop. Pakistan must realise that a decisive government has come to power, which will not take such instances lying down,” Singh told HT in an interview.
Read: Pak must realise Modi govt not UPA, says Rajnath Singh
 
India and Pakistan exchanged fire in Arnia and RS Pura sectors late on Monday, the heaviest firing between the two countries since India called off bilateral talks last month. Jaitley said the repeated ceasefire violations would not help normalise relations between the two countries and Indian armed forces were responding to all provocations from across the border.
 
"This is resulting in a series of ceasefire violations as a result of which innocent civilians have lost their lives. Pakistan must realise that the kind of environment it is generating between the two countries is certainly not going to help in normalising relations. The onus of creating a positive environment is on Pakistan which is utterly failing to do so," Jaitley said.

A senior government official told HT on condition of anonymity that border agencies, mainly the BSF and the army, had received instructions to not just match mortar for mortar but “outnumber the number of mortars in retaliation”.
 
“There is no hesitation to our response now. If Pakistan fires five mortars, we can retaliate with 10,” he said.
 
The violence puts more strain on already-tense ties between India and Pakistan after New Delhi called off planned foreign secretary-level talks following the Pakistani ambassador’s meeting with Kashmiri separatist leaders last month.
 
Worst affected by the Pakistani firing in India was Mashain-de-kothe village, where four members of a family were killed. Mortars also landed at Arnia town, about three km from the International Border (IB), forcing thousands of people to flee their homes.
 
“When firing started we thought it would be another routine thing. But when heavy mortars started pounding our homes and heard cries, it was our worst nightmare,” said Soma Devi, a relative of the family that lost four members to the firing.
 
BSF sources said India will not have a flag meeting after the firing which began late last Thursday in a bid to disrupt Dussehra celebrations. Media reports said three militants were killed as the army foiled an infiltration bid along the Line of Control in Tangdhar sector.
 
The Pakistani ministry of foreign affairs issued a statement condemning what it described as India’s “unprovoked firing”.
 
“The government of Pakistan has lodged a strong protest with the government of India through diplomatic channels and called for restraining its forces from constant violation of the ceasefire," it said in the statement.
 
With tension prevailing on the border, the traditional exchange of sweets between Indian and Pakistani troops at the Attari border in Punjab on Eid was called off. However, sweets were exchanged at Chakan-da-bagh area in Poonch.

Gold sinks to lowest level in 15 months | Oil hovers near $92Bullion sinks to lowest in 15 months on robust US data

Gold has also failed to capitalise on geopolitical tensions caused by military conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the rise of Islamic State, which has declared a cross-border caliphate in Iraq and Syria.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
SINGAPORE: Gold tumbled to its lowest level in around 15 months on Monday after better-than-expected US jobs data boosted the dollar, dampening safe-haven appetite for bullion and pushing silver and platinum to multi-year lows.
Gold, which often influences other precious metals, has also failed to capitalise on geopolitical tensions caused by military conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the rise of Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.
By 0641 GMT, cash gold was little changed at $1,191.30 an ounce after earlier falling to $1,183.46 an ounce, its weakest since June 2013.
Platinum touched its lowest since 2009, silver fell to its weakest since 2010, and palladium hit an 8-month low.
"A strong dollar is a major problem for gold. Sentiment is very bearish but I think we expect some kind of rebound," said Ronald Leung, chief dealer at Lee Cheong Gold Dealers in Hong Kong, who pegged support at $1,180 an ounce.
"There's a little bit of physical buying, but premiums haven't changed. We have to see what happens later in the day. If demand is coming, of course, it will push up the premiums."
Premiums for gold were quoted at $1.20 to $1.60 an ounce to the spot London prices, unchanged from last week, despite a sharp drop in cash gold prices.
The absence of main gold consumer China is weighing on the physical market, which usually sees a pick up in demand from jewellers and retail investors when prices fall.
Chinese markets have been shut for national holidays and will reopen on Wednesday.
US gold was $1,191.70 an ounce, down 0.10 per cent.
The dollar held on Monday near a more than four-year high, touched after last week's upbeat US nonfarm payrolls report increased speculation that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates in mid-2015 or earlier.
Data from the Labor Department on Friday showed US non-farm payrolls rose 248,000 last month and the jobless rate fell to 5.9 per cent, the lowest since July 2008, underscoring that the US economy continues to improve.
In Tokyo, sellers pushed up premiums for gold bars to 25 cents to spot London prices from zero last week to offset the decline in global prices.
"At this moment, demand is not good. But maybe when the holiday in China is over, the premiums may go up further," said a dealer in Tokyo.
Markets in Singapore, a key bullion trading centre in Southeast Asia, were also closed for a public holiday.

Where was respect for Thackeray while breaking ties  Sena asks ModiSena questions Modi's respect for Bal Thackeray
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  Mumbai, October 06, 2014

Comments
A day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi refused to criticise the Shiv Sena out of respect for the late Bal Thackeray, the former saffron ally hit back saying he should have remembered it when the BJP broke off the alliance.
An editorial in the Sena mouthpiece Saamna on Monday said, " Modi said he won't say a word against Sena as a tribute to Bal Thackeray. We appreciate that. But what happened to that  respect while you were breaking off the alliance?
If the BJP had shown some understanding in seat sharing  and kept the alliance intact, that would have been a true tribute to Bal Thackeray, the editorial further said.
Read: Won't criticise Shiv Sena as tribute to Bal Thackeray: Modi
Modi had said on Sunday at a campaign rally in Maharashtra that he would not criticise former ally Shiv Sena out of respect for its late leader, Bal Thackeray.
"Political pundits are saying why is Modi not criticising Shiv Sena in his campaign speeches. This is the first election in absence of late Bal Thackeray, for whom I have great respect. I have decided not to utter a single word against Shiv Sena. This is my tribute to Balasaheb Thackeray," he had said.
The Sena editorial was also scathing on Modi's attempt to use Shivaji  Maharaj's name during his campaign.
"The new head of Delhi shouldn't forget that Shivaji Maharaj was the embodiment of Purusharth (manliness). Where will you get that from?", the Sena asked Modi.
Questioning Modi's statements on his love for Maharashtra, the Sena asked, "PM Modi came all the way from Delhi to say that Congress-NCP alliance looted Maharashtra. But what was Gujarat CM Anandiben's intention of coming to Mumbai. She said all Mumbai-based industrialists should shift to Gujarat. Isn't that a way of looting Maharashtra."
Referring to BJP's stand on the Vidarbha row, the Sena accused the party of trying to split Maharashtra.
Modi in all his campaign speeches in the state  had been trying to highlight the BJP's respect for Maharashtra and warrior king Chhattrapati Shivaji.
" It was the Vajpayee government which named Mumbai airport after Shivaji. You were CM , but you didn't think of it. Even Victoria Terminus was named Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus by Vajpayee government," Modi had said in an attack on the ruling Congress-NCP government.

Early signs of credit quality recovery: CRISILEarly signs of credit quality recovery: CRISIL
BS Reporter | Mumbai Oct 07, 2014 12:01 AM IST
With the slight turnaround in the economy, the credit quality of corporate debt is also showing signs of recovery, rating agencies CRISIL and CARE said.
While this is a good sign at the start of the third quarter, further improvement in credit quality is expected to be gradual and any significant recovery will be subject to a sustainable increase in investment demand, CRISIL, a subsidiary of Standard & Poor’s, said in a statement.
Indian economy grew 5.7 per cent in the quarter ended June 2014. It expanded 4.7 per cent in FY14, compared to 4.5 per cent in the previous financial year.
According to CRISIL, recovery signs are reflected in credit ratio. The ratio of number of upgrades to number of downgrades was 1.64 times for April-September 2014 with 741 upgrades and 451 downgrades. Companies with low debt exposure primarily witnessed positive trends (upgrades) in credit quality.
The upgrades were visible for export-linked sectors and non-discretionary consumer segments such as traders, packaged foods, pharmaceuticals, textiles and agricultural products. These segments continue to have the highest upgrade rates.
In contrast, weak liquidity, and pressure on profitability were key drivers for downgrades. Firms with high leverage (ratio of debt to earnings before interest, depreciation and amortisation) was four times, These units are subject to significant credit quality pressures as evident from their credit ratio below one during first half of 2014-15.
Players operating in the construction, engineering and capital goods, and automobile (auto) ancillary sectors had higher downgrade rates than their counterparts in other sectors.  CARE Ratings said its modified credit ratio (MCR), the ratio of (upgrades plus reaffirmations to downgrades plus reaffirmations – was increasing. MCR registered a significant improvement in the second quarter. The ratio at 1.25, in the second quarter of FY15 came in at a three-year high. MCR reflects the continued improvement in the credit quality of the rated entities.
The MCR has been on the path of steady progress for the past five quarters. The trend of upgrades outnumbering downgrades has been in vogue since Q2 of FY14.
Also, a higher number of entities have had their ratings being reaffirmed.
In Q2 of FY15, ratings for 170 entities were upgraded (80 in Q2 of FY14), 61 entities had their ratings downgraded (61 in Q2 of FY14) and 372 entities saw reaffirmation (326 Q2FY14).
Pawan Agrawal, senior director at CRISIL Ratings, said credit quality buoyancy in the overall economy is still some time away. For that to happen, investment demand, which depends on the extent to which the central government pushes big ticket policy reforms, needs to substantially increase.
A gradual improvement in the credit ratio is expected over the medium term, as economic growth records mild recovery from the lows of the two years through March 31, 2014, it added.

Flipkart s sale over: You just don t know it...Big Billion Day
(There have been a number…)
Flipkart has been advertising for its Big Billion Day sale from the past couple of weeks. There have been a number of deals running on the ecommerce portal since morning 8am across various categories with discounts as high as up to 80%. However, the sale has already come to an end within 7 hours.
In case you don't know what the Big Billion Day Sale is about - Flipkart aims to do business of more than 1 billion in one day on 6th October 2014. We are not sure if Flipkart has already achieved its sale target by 2pm but most of the deals will not be processed anymore. At approx. 2pm, seller accounts of third party vendors on Flipkart have been put as pending i.e no more orders will be taken for the day and products will now show the status as 'out of stock'. A few selected deals will continue to be listed, but essentially the sale is over.
The main reason behind this move is that Flipkart has already received more than 3,00,000 orders in the first 6 hours of the sale - a number that is the limit of their enormous logistics team to process. They will not risk taking more orders and then fail to process them in dispatch tomorrow. A wise strategy to avoid bad mouthing on late delivery, however limiting the sale in such a way will only lead to more complaints from the users.
Throughout the sale, social media was anyway abuzz with complaints against the site crashing and giving errors, orders disappearing from shopper carts and deals going out of stock as soon as they went live. Online shoppers have been continuously checking Flipkart ever hour for new deals and we are not sure hot Flipkart plans to inform its users about the sale end.
Considering the hype created around the sale, Flipkart should have been expecting such traffic and orders, especially since they have already done flash sales that led to their site crashing in the past. At the time of writing of the article, Flipkart's Twitter account is still going on about the sale being continued as announced. However, the end of a one-day sale in just a few hours is not something expected from Flipkart at the time when competing websites Amazon and Snapdeal are continuously offering better deals throughout the day.
Flipkart plans to do another week of similar sale from October 10th to October 16th and we hope that they work on their backend to avoid similar issues during that time.

Mumbai, Oct 6:  
Actor Dhanush topped the cyberspace chart as the most sensational celebrity in Kollywood. This is the second year in a row that he stays on top, according to a survey done by security firm McAfee.
McAfee researched Tamil popular culture's most famous people to reveal the riskiest Kollywood celebrity across the web and unveil the 2014 edition of its ‘Most Sensational Celebrity’ research.
Dhanush trumps Trisha Krishnan, who topped the list in 2013, according to a company press release.
As cyber criminals exploit consumers’ need to be updated on celebrity news, McAfee’s survey highlights the pitfalls of the trend. These criminals capitalise on the public’s fascination to lure them to sites loaded with malware, which in turn allows them to steal passwords and personal information.
This year, searching for a ‘celebrity name’ coupled with search terms like‘wallpaper’, ‘videos’, ‘free download’, ‘hot pictures’, ‘selfie’ and ‘internet memes’ have resulted in instances of malware-laden sites, the release said.
McAfee’s annual study finds searching for popular celebrities online can lead to identity theft.

Called the “ health epidemic of the 21st century” by the World Health Organization, stress is a factor in nearly half of work-performance issues and costs US businesses an estimated $300 billion a year  “through absenteeism, diminished productivity, employee turnover and direct medical, legal and insurance fees,” according to the American Psychological Association. Since not every office provides sleep pods and massage retreats  like Google  does, here are some stress-relief hacks for the rest of us:
Look up from that screen
By some estimates, Americans on average now spend 12 hours  a day in front of electronic screens. While many of us need our computers, tablets, phones, and phablets for work, a  2012 study  from Sweden’s University of Gothenburg found that constantly staring at a screen without frequent breaks can increase your risk of stress. Power off those screens from time to time, or just relocate yourself to another area of your office for a few minutes to give your eyes, and your mind, a much-needed break.
Laugh a little
Doesn’t it seem like children are a lot less stressed than adults? Maybe one reason is that they laugh a lot more than we do (children laugh 400 times a day , versus 25 for adults), and laughing is a good way to reduce stress . According to researchers at Loma Linda University in California, laughter reduces cortisol—the stress hormone—and will even help improve memory. It may not be easy to schedule laughing into your day, but this is a good excuse to take an occasional break and watch a funny YouTube segment or chat with your neighbor about something funny that happened recently.
Don’t resort to gobbling comfort foods
When stressed, we tend to reach for chocolate, ice cream, or other junk food for comfort. But new research shows that comfort food is a myth : Fast foods and sugary goodies can actually trigger and worsen stress , and stress will usually simply dissipate over time  whether or not you eat. So instead of reaching for some munchies, just take a moment to sit and breathe.
But you can chew on gum
While comfort foods probably won’t help, researchers have found that chewing gum can —by reducing the stress hormone cortisol. Chewing can also boost alertness and productivity, although some experts say the effect only works for the first 20 minutes.
Don’t beat yourself up if you zone out occasionally
We tend to label those who space out as unproductive and dysfunctional. But allowing our minds to wander when dealing with something complicated or stress-inducing can help us be creative and come upon new solutions . Of course, if you find yourself spacing out chronically, that’s not ideal.
Bring your pet to work
This stress relief method may not be an option for many, but research shows that interactions with pets can decrease “the onset, severity or progression of stress-related conditions” (which is why some  universities and clinics use them to unwind stressed students). The very act of stroking a pet can reduce your heart rate and “happy talk” to an animal can help lower blood pressure.
Put on your headphones
While some offices ban the use of headphones  for fear that it breaks concentration, research has shown that  music reduces levels of the stress hormone cortisol. Listen to some upbeat music to feel more optimistic and slower music to feel more relaxed. Quartz has some tips on how to optimize your playlist.
Focus your breathing
You don’t need to roll out the yoga mat to get some of the benefits of  mindful meditation . The refocusing of your mind onto your present thoughts and emotions, as well as the flow of your breathing, can help ease stress .
Plan your day in anticipation of stress
Often stress occurs when we feel we’ve lost control over a situation, and the degree to which we feel this way can affect how we react . So plan out your day ahead of time to better anticipate and manage points of potential tension throughout the day.

Quartz Daily BriefAmericas editionHong Kong protests dwindle  Brazils presidential run-off  Samsungs chip pivotGood morning, Quartz readers!
What to watch for today
Hong Kong protests limp into their second week. The Hong Kong government let a dwindling number of protesters  remain in place  on Monday morning, after a small path was cleared to allow government workers to return to work. As officials and students attempt to set up negotiations, it’s not clear that either group knows what it’s doing .
Airstrikes against the Islamic State continue. The world awaits a response to the apparent beheading of Britain’s Alan Denny , a kidnapped aid worker in Syria, by ISIL jihadists. Among the targets of the US-led bombing campaign is a former French intelligence officer who has defected to Al Qaeda , and who reportedly survived a cruise missile attack against the Qaeda-allied Nusra Front.
Japan recovers from typhoon Phanfone. Winds of up to 180 kph (112 mph)  passed through Japan  causing flight cancellations and the loss of power to thousands of homes. One US airman was killed after being washed out to sea from his post, and two others are missing.
Over the weekend
HP is splitting in two. The company plans to separate its PC and printer businesses from its hardware and services operations next year,  according to the Wall Street Journal  (paywall). The split could unleash another round of deal-making by tech companies, including the combination of the HP hardware business with data storage giant EMC.
Brazil got a step closer to its next president. Incumbent Dilma Rousseff won the most votes  in Sunday’s first-round election , and pro-business candidate Aécio Neves surged ahead of environmentalist challenger Marina Silva to finish second. A runoff between Rousseff and Neves will take place on October 26.
Samsung bet on smartphones—just not its own. The South Korean tech giant, facing sharp declines in profits from its smartphone division, is investing 15.6 trillion won ($15 billion) in a new semiconductor factory to build chips for mobile devices . Samsung’s own devices are getting squeezed by Apple and low-margin Chinese competitors—but much of the industry uses Samsung’s chips.
Snapchat and Square closed in on new money. Yahoo is preparing to invest around $20 million  (paywall) into Snapchat, according to the Wall Street Journal, in a deal that would value the messaging app at $10 billion. And Square, an electronic payments start-up that is facing new competition from Apple and a standalone PayPal, secured $150 million in new venture capital funding  that values the company at $6 billion.
The World Bank was downbeat on China, cutting its 2014 growth forecast to 7.4%  due to fears that Beijing’s attempts to tackle local government debt, shadow banking, and pollution would hurt the economy in the short term. The World Bank also projects China will only grow by 7.2% in 2015.
Mexico discovered a mass grave. Nearly 30 charred bodies  (paywall) were discovered in the western state of Guerrero, near the site where  student activists clashed with police a week ago . A prosecutor said that a criminal gang ordered the police to “disappear and finish off” the students, but the motive was unknown.

Nobel Prize for medicine goes to trio for discovering brains GPSNobel Prize for medicine goes to trio for discovering brain’s GPS
Reuters
Tweet
Reuters Professor Ole Kiehn presents the winners of the Nobel Prize in Medicine US-British scientist John O'Keefe and Norwegian husband and wife Edvard Moser and May-Britt Moser for their discoveries of cells that constitute a positioning system in the brain, at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm October 6, 2014.
STOCKHOLM, Oct 6:  
American-British scientist John O'Keefe and Norwegians May-Britt Moser and Edvard Moser won the 2014 Nobel Prize for medicine for discovering the brain's "inner GPS" that makes it possible to orient ourselves in space and help understand diseases like Alzheimer's, the award-giving body said on Monday.
"The discoveries...have solved a problem that has occupied philosophers and scientists for centuries," the Nobel Assembly at Sweden's Karolinska Institute said in a statement when awarding the prize of 8 million Swedish crowns ($1.1 million).
"How does the brain create a map of the space surrounding us and how can we navigate our way through a complex environment?" the body added.
The Mosers join an exclusive club of married couples to win a Nobel Prize that includes scientific greats Pierre Curie and Marie Curie.
"Knowledge about the brain's positioning system may, therefore, help us understand the mechanism underpinning the devastating spatial loss that affects people with this (Alzheimer's) disease," the body added.
O'Keefe is director of the Sainsbury Wellcome Centre in Neural Circuits and Behaviour at University College London. The Mosers are both based in scientific institutes in the Norwegian town of Trondheim
Medicine is the first of the Nobel prizes awarded each year. Prizes for achievements in science, literature and peace were first awarded in 1901 in accordance with the will of dynamite inventor and businessman Alfred Nobel.

Indias seaborne trade may cross 830 mt by 2016-17: studyIndia’s seaborne trade may cross 830 mt by 2016-17: study
Our Bureau
Tweet
Ahmedabad, Oct 6:  
Growing at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of over eight per cent, the seaborne trade in India may cross the 830 million ton (mt) mark by 2016-17, apex industry body ASSOCHAM said on Monday.
“This would require massive investment to the tune of over Rs 17,000 crore as there is a need to augment the port capacity by over 140 mt from the current level of about 690 mt,” according to a study titled ‘Shipping Industry: Today & Tomorrow,’ conducted by The Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (ASSOCHAM).
“The private sector participation is imperative for such huge investments in the shipping sector,” said D.S. Rawat, national secretary general of ASSOCHAM, while releasing the study.
Lack of level-playing field for private operators, hinterland connectivity, especially lack of co-ordination between road, rail and port authorities and proper risk allocation are certain key issues affecting port development in India, he said.
The government needs to act as a facilitator to create opportunities for attracting fresh investments in the shipping sector, more so as about 41 per cent of India’s fleet of ships belong to the 20-year-plus age group indicating a slow rate of new fleet addition.
This augurs well for the Rs 7,300 crore worth of India’s shipbuilding and ship-repair industry as 20-years-plus older ships require more frequent and extensive repair and maintenance. “However, this makes the Indian fleet less competitive as mostly young vessels below 15 years old are often preferred in international trade.”
Drastic decline in share of Indian ships in carriage of overseas trade over the years is a significant concern. Indian shipping carriage dropped from about 36 per cent to just about eight per cent between 1990-91 and 2009-10. “This is causing a drain on precious foreign exchange in terms of payment of freight charges and this could instead be used for other high priority imports and scaling up infrastructure facilities.”
India can save up to Rs 26,000 crore by 2016-17 if we can increase the share of coastal shipping in total traffic carriage thereby reducing the burden on other modes of transport. There is a need to encourage coastal shipping as a viable mode of bulk freight transportation as it has just about three per cent of share in carrying regional traffic.

Our KBC win is not flash in the pan: Achin NarulaPress Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: October 6, 2014 4:13 pm
Brothers Achin and Sarthak Narula, who created history by winning maximum prize money of Rs 7 crore on ‘Kaun Banega Crorepati’, say their win on the show was not just luck but a culmination of 10 years of hardwork.
Achin, the elder of the two, says rejection over the past 10 years did not deter him from trying to make it to
the hot seat and win the game. “Our win is not a flash in the pan. My journey started 10 years back. The reason behind our success was that I did not give up. I did get frustrated at times but did not want to quit. I wanted to keep trying and then I was recently joined by my brother who was preparing for SSC examination,” Achin told PTI.
The 28-year-old marketing manager says he and his family thought they would not go beyond Rs 25 lakhs in the game. “My father is still in shock. He would not have imagined in the best of his dreams and worst of the nightmares that we will get Rs 7 crore. Our benchmark was Rs 25 lakhs and only when we crossed that, we thought we could do something big,” he said.
Achin adds the whole atmosphere on the ‘KBC’ sets was nerve-wracking and the duo decided to go with the flow rather than plan their moves.

“During the last few questions my brother and I exchanged no notes. We decided to enjoy the moment. There was a lot going in our mind, the background music was quite thrilling, the lights were on us, you have Mr Bachchan facing you and then you also think that you are on national TV. So, it was best to not think much,” he said.
Hailing the Bollywood megastar as benevolent, Achin says Amitabh Bachchan made sure they were at ease while playing the game. “Mr Bachchan makes you comfortable and make sure a candidate is relaxed. He is very kind. After we won, he told us we took a big risk, I said we took a big one but calculated risk. Luckily it paid off,” he said.
Achin feels he is living a dream as till a month back he was looking for a new job and now he can start his own business.
“It has been the life-defining moment for me and my family. Till one month back, I was looking for a promotion or changing my job and now everything has changed. I have not made concrete decisions about what we will do with this money but now I can think and explore a lot of things but I know I won’t make stupid decisions because I have seen downside of life,” he said.
The first thing on his mind, however, is his mother’s cancer treatment. “We want her to recover as soon as possible. Her chemotherapy is over. Now, she is in monitoring phase. Our win is because of her prayers. My first priority is her treatment,” continued…

I learnt Hindi by watching Akshay Kumars film: Lisa HaydonPrint

Model-turned-actress Lisa Haydon, who shares screen space with Akshay Kumar in upcoming film ‘The Shaukeens’, says in her initial years in Bollywood she used to watch the ‘Khiladi’ star’s films to learn Hindi.
Akshay will do a cameo as himself in ‘ The Shaukeens ‘ and the 28-year-old ‘Queen’ actress essays the role of a crazy fan of the Bollywood star. “I still can’t believe that I am doing a film with Akshay.
I am a fan but not a crazy one like a play in the movie. If he knew I was psycho, he would never work with me. There is so much respect for him. When I was learning Hindi, I used to watch his films because he speaks the language so well,” Lisa Haydon told PTI.
‘The Shaukeens’ is a remake of the 1982 film ‘Shaukeen’ directed by Basu Chatterjee.
The new film stars Anupam Kher, Piyush Mishra and Annu Kapoor, who are lusting after a much younger girl played by Lisa.
The movie has been directed by Abhishek Sharma of ‘Tere Bin Laden’ fame and produced by Akshay. It will hit theatres on November 7.

Formula One prays for stricken Jules BianchiMarshalls clear the way for an ambulance carrying Jules Bianchi after the race was stopped following the crash. (Source: Reuters)
Reuters | Posted: October 6, 2014 3:50 pm
French Formula One driver Jules Bianchi remained in a critical condition after suffering severe head injuries in a Japanese Grand Prix crash on Sunday, with the sport praying for him to pull through.
The 25-year-old’s Marussia team issued a statement on Monday giving no medical details but acknowledging a “huge outpouring of support and affection for Jules and the Team at this very difficult time”.
They said any update about his condition would be guided by the wishes of his family.
“Together with Jules’ care, they will remain our highest priority. Therefore, we would ask for patience and understanding with regard to further medical updates,” added the British-based team.
French media said Bianchi remained critical and was under artificial respiration, contrary to reports on Sunday evening that suggested he was breathing unassisted after surgery.
Sky Sports television reported from the Mie General hospital in Yokkaichi, near Suzuka, that his family were expected to arrive from France shortly.
Bianchi suffered the injury when he aquaplaned off a wet track and hit the back of a recovery tractor that had been deployed to remove Adrian Sutil’s crashed Sauber.
The race was then stopped, with his fellow drivers and teams in a state of shock.
Race winner Lewis Hamilton, who leads the championship for Mercedes, said he was praying for the Frenchman.
“Our first thoughts go to Jules — it overshadows everything else when one of our colleagues is injured and we are praying for him. Next to this, the race result doesn’t seem significant at all,” the Briton said.
The governing International Automobile Federation (FIA) said the driver had been extracted unconscious from the car and taken to hospital where a scan revealed a severe head injury. He underwent immediate surgery.
Marussia said senior team officials would stay at the hospital to support the driver, along with representatives of Ferrari.
While racing for a struggling tail-end team, for whom Bianchi scored their first ever points this season, the Frenchman also has a contract with Ferrari as a test driver.
Highly regarded and a popular figure in the paddock, the Nice-born driver finished an impressive ninth in Monaco last May and was tipped as a talent for the future — possibly with Ferrari.
He is also managed by Nicolas Todt, son of FIA president and former Ferrari principal Jean, whose other drivers include Brazilian Felipe Massa and Venezuelan Pastor Maldonado.

Ed Sheeran to perform at Courtney Coxs weddingEd Sheeran introduced Courteney Cox to her now fiance Johny Mcdaid. (Source: AP)
Press Trust of India | London | Posted: October 6, 2014 3:31 pm | Updated: October 6, 2014 7:39 pm
Singer Ed Sheeran plans to write a new song to perform at Courteney Cox and Johny Mcdaid’s wedding.
The ‘Sing’ hitmaker, who introduced the ‘Friends’ actress to her now fiance, said he might have to pen a new track for the big day because he has performed many of his existing tracks at other wedding receptions, reported Contactmusic.
“I’ve played it (Thinking Out Loud) around six times at six different weddings as a first dance now. My mates keep getting married and they keep asking me to sing it… Johnny won’t have that, he’ll expect me to write a song. He won’t let me get away with singing the song that’s been used for someone else,” Sheeran said.
Cox, 50, and the Snow Patrol rocker, 38, became engaged in June and are reportedly set to marry at the end of the year.

First online murder may happen by end of year: expertsThe Hindu The world’s first ‘online murder’ via a hacked internet-connected device could happen by the end of this year, experts have warned. File photo

science and technology
The world’s first ‘online murder’ via a hacked internet-connected device could happen by the end of this year, experts have warned.
The European Union’s law enforcement agency Europol has cautioned that governments are ill-prepared to combat the looming threat of “online murder” as cyber criminals exploit internet technology to target victims.
In an alarming assessment of the physical danger posed by online crime, Europol said it expected a rise in “injury and possible deaths” caused by computer attacks on critical safety equipment.
The Europol threat assessment published last week cited a report by US security firm IID which predicted that the first murder via ‘hacked internet-connected device’ would happen by the end of 2014, ‘The Independent’ reported.
The opportunities for tampering with devices come amid predictions that tens of billions of devices will be connected to the internet within the next couple of decades, according to experts.
The Europol report suggests crooks could also use the web to carry out new forms of extortion and blackmail, such as locking people out of their homes or cars before payment of a ransom.
“The IoE [Internet of Everything] represents a whole new attack vector that we believe criminals will already be looking for ways to exploit,” according to the Europol threat assessment.
“The IoE is inevitable. We must expect a rapidly growing number of devices to be rendered ‘smart’ and thence to become interconnected. Unfortunately, we feel that it is equally inevitable that many of these devices will leave vulnerabilities via which access to networks can be gained by criminals,” the report said.
“There’s already this huge quasi-underground market where you can buy and sell vulnerabilities that have been discovered,” said Rod Rasmussen, the president of IID.
Rasmussen said that while the first reported murder was yet to happen, “death by internet” was already a reality from online extortion and blackmail that has led to suicide.
He said if his firm’s prediction of an online murder did not come to pass in 2014, it would likely happen within the next few years.

Keep cash in hand. Most probably by the end of this month or the next, depending upon when we hit the 8300-8400 area, most of the infra stocks are going to bottom out.
That will be the time to go aggressive long in those stocks. You will not get a 2nd chance after that fall.

Tamil Nadu electricity regulator proposes tariff hike for wind energyTN regulator proposes tariff hike for wind energy
T E Narasimhan | Chennai Oct 06, 2014 08:41 PM IST
The Tamil Nadu Electricity Regulatory Commission (TNERC) is proposing to increase tariff by about eight paisa for wind energy in Tamil Nadu. Industry representatives have said that the proposed increase would not be sufficient and the state will not be an attractive destination for the investors if the regulator does not rework on tariff and also if it decides to proceed with its monthly adjustment of banking.
The commission has published consultative papers on fixing tariff for wind and bagasse-based cogeneration projects and has asked for feedback by October 27. It has also come out with a consultative paper on power procurement by distribution licensees from biomass based power plants.
In the consultative paper, the commission has pegged the wind energy tariff at Rs 3.59 a unit. The prevailing tariff for wind energy under the previous order is Rs 3.51 a unit for wind mills commissioned on or after the order dated July 31, 2012.
Responding to which, DV Giri, secretary-general, Indian Wind Turbine Manufacturers Association, said tariff in the state was the lowest even though the PLF was good compared to other states. Tamil Nadu accounted for 37 per cent of the wind energy over the country’s installed capacity.
In Tamil Nadu, the tariff is at Rs 3.51 per unit and the average PLF is around 30 to 32 per cent, while in Andhra Pradesh the tariff is at Rs 4.70 and the average PLF is around 28 per cent. In Madhya Pradesh, the tariff is at Rs 5.92 per unit and the average PLF is around 22 per cent.
“Though the PLF in Madhya Pradesh is far lower, the tariff of Rs 5.92 is very attractive for the investor and over and above that he gets 50 paise as GBI (generation based incentive), which is available in Tamil Nadu,” Giri said.
The commission explained that it had adopted a two-part tariff as it did in the previous order of July 2012. This is done when the fuel cost varies and is taken as pass through. The fixed cost for a 20-year period ranges from Rs 1.34-1.81; and the variable cost for financial year 2014-15 is pegged at Rs 2.39 and for 2015-16 at Rs 3.07 a unit.
Effectively, the tariff for the two years will be Rs 4.74 per cent and Rs 4.90 a unit for new cogeneration plants. In the last order, the tariff in the first year was Rs 3.76 a unit.
The second issue, which is alarming, is the proposed policy of monthly adjustment of banking is detrimental to the industry, Giri said. The association has requested TNERC to continue the present policy to attract investment.

Germany To Consider Ban On Late-Night Work EmailsGermany To Consider Ban On Late-Night Work Emails

Germans want to spend less time answering emails and more time doing this.  | altrendo images via Getty Images
reddit
A decade ago, Antje Schmid would have left her office in Germany's financial hub of Frankfurt, gone out to drink a frothy pilsner or two with friends, and would have put her job out of mind until the next morning.
That was before smartphones. Today, the 25-year-old continues to get emails and calls from colleagues and bosses at the advertising agency long after she's clocked out.
"The interruptions increased," Schmid told The Huffington Post in an interview. "You are reachable always and everywhere."
But that might not last forever. Last month, German Labor Minister Andrea Nahles commissioned a study to assess the psychological and economic effects of work-related stress. The findings, slated to be released in 2016, are expected to generate legislation that would ban employers from contacting workers after office hours. Such a law, currently being pushed by the powerful multi-service trade union Vereinte Dienstleistungsgewerkschaft, or ver.di, now seems more likely to reach fruition since it gained Nahles' support .
"There is an undeniable relationship between constant availability and the increase of mental illness," Nahles told the Rheinische Post . "We have commissioned the Federal Institute for Occupational Safety and Health to work out whether it is possible to set load thresholds. We need universal and legally binding criteria."
Dominik Ehrentraut, a spokesman for the Labor Ministry, told HuffPost a law won't be formally proposed until the findings are released in 2016.
If passed, such a law could serve as a model for preserving workers' privacy and curbing the culture of being constantly on-call for work. Though some workers in France earlier this year adopted a so-called ban on emails after 6 p.m., the labor agreement was not cemented into law.
Some large companies, such as Daimler and Volkswagen, have already adopted rules to limit work-related stress. Last month, Daimler allowed about 100,000 workers to delete emails they received while on vacation. In 2011, Volkswagen agreed to stop its BlackBerry servers from sending emails after working hours.
But for many, work still seeps into the home life. Germany is often lampooned as the punctual , industrious workhorse of Europe. But when the country ratified its constitution in 1990, it preserved for its citizens the right to develop one's personality . And it's difficult to work on your character and hobbies when your professional life looms constantly in the background.
"That sort of self-development needs time," Thomas C. Kohler, a German legal expert and law professor at Boston College, told HuffPost, "and the idea that anybody could interrupt you on your own time to have you do work without a good excuse would be contrary to those sorts of attitudes."
Americans may often conflate staying late at the office with having a strong work ethic, but Germans see it as a sign of poor time management, Kohler said.
"With Germans, while they're at work, they only work -- you'll rarely hear a radio in the background," Kohler said. "They consider it a sign of inefficiency if you cannot complete a day's work in that day. So if you're staying late at the office, it would often be regarded as a sign of your inability to get the work done."
He said he expects the government in Berlin to pass legislation to curb off-hour emails and calls, but that drafting such a law to have a meaningful impact across a wide range of industries could be complicated. And then there are the challenges of enforcing it.
For Schmid, most of the after-hours emails she receives are from colleagues with whom she is working on group projects. She said legislation to free workers from the obligation to be always on-call would help rid her of the guilt she feels for not responding. But she doubts that a blanket rule could work.
"Maybe the government could help companies to make up unique rules for their firms, or put pressure on managers," she said.
If a law doesn't get enacted, Germany's famously powerful labor unions could push more companies to adopt standards as to when employees have to be available, said Stephen Silvia, an American University professor and expert in German industrial relations.
"There is a long tradition of the German labor movement carving out free time and pushing for working time reduction," he said.
He pointed out a famous poster from the 1950s, on which a grinning 5-year-old boy holds his hand up in the air, declaring: " On Saturdays, daddy belongs to me. "
But as technology makes more Germans reachable around the clock, every hour is increasingly up for grabs.

Apple's new mobile operating system iOS8 is causing significant issues for some users who connect their phones to cars via Bluetooth, reports Apple news blog MacRumors, citing reports on the technology giant's Support forums and its own user forums.
It appears that following an upgrade to iOS 8, or after purchasing a new iPhone 6 or 6 Plus, users seem to be having trouble pairing their phones to their car audio systems, MacRumors posted in a blog.
Several issues faced by users include the devices refusing to pair entirely, neglecting to play audio over the speakers, or disconnecting when a call comes in.
The Bluetooth pairing problems are not just limited to cars, as iOS 8 users have also reported issues pairing their devices with headphones, speakers, headsets and more.
MacRumors had also posted on Monday that a bug in iOS 8's 'Reset All Settings' option could erase iCloud drive documents, citing user reports.
The US-based tech major has been plagued by problems following the September release of its new iPhones and iOS8, with iPhone 6 Plus buyers discovering their phones can bend when placed in back pockets, and the company pulling a botched iOS8 update after reports of dropped cellular service.
Apple could not be immediately reached for comment.

SBI to Have Dedicated SME Branches to Increase Coverage
Press Trust of India | Updated On: October 05, 2014 16:53 (IST)
American Tower to Buy Over 4,800 Bharti Airtel Phone Masts in Nigeria
Mumbai: State Bank of India, which is flush with liquidity as large corporates are holding back investments, is focusing on increasing its SME loan book by opening dedicated branches across the country.
"Earlier, we had sourcing teams and branches for SMEs, and sanction was done after being appraised by the SME city credit cell, that is a factory concept. But we have found that there is a lack of ownership in such a business model, so, we are now getting dedicated SME branches that will only do SME advances," Arundhati Bhattacharya, chairperson of the country's largest lender, told PTI in an interview recently.
Banks have been witnessing rising number of defaults from large corporates, especially from the infra space, as the economy has been moribund for almost three years now, while the system as whole has not been reporting rising defaults from SMEs.
The bank has already done pilot projects in Mumbai and Delhi and will soon roll out in other parts.
The bank's SME advances declined marginally to Rs 1,73,010 crore in the June quarter from Rs 1,75,407 crore a year ago, while gross advances rose 12.52 per cent to Rs 12,32,288 crore in the quarter from Rs 10,95,145 crore a year ago.
Ms Bhattacharya said that under the new model, the people who source the loans will not only appraise them, but will also be responsible for post sanction monitoring.
"So, they will be responsible end-to-end," she added.
The quality control of the loan given to the SMEs will be done by the SME credit cell. Besides, the bank has also formed an off-site inspection team, which will do an online audit of the sanctions on an almost real time basis so as to ensure that the loan is not manipulated, she added.
"The sanction terms and the proposals will be uploaded and off-site inspection team will audit it and will come back if they see any lacunae in that," the chairman said.
Under the new model, the bank will not open new SME-focused branches but will convert few of its branches into pure SME branches.
"Certain branches will be converted so that they become pure SME branches and other jobs that were being done there, those will get migrated to closeby branches," she said.
Net profit rose 3.33 per cent to Rs 3,349 crore in the June quarter from Rs 3,241 crore a year ago, while gross NPAs declined 66 basis points to 4.90 per cent.

Rohit Sharma gearing up for Australia pace testPress Trust of India | Mumbai | Posted: October 5, 2014 6:26 pm
Gearing up for the pace test that awaits India in Australia come December, batsman Rohit Sharma said the likes of Mitchell Johnson and Peter Siddle would be a
tough challenge to deal with but the Indians are no longer intimidated by bouncy tracks Down Under.
“Australia will be a challenging tour for us. Mentally, each and every cricketer have a different way of preparing or doing their respective homework for a tour. I am no different and I will also have my plans in place as we come nearer to the time of the tour,” Rohit told PTI in an interview.
“Facing the likes of Mitchell Johnson, Peter Siddle, Ryan Harris will be a stern test. But we have faced Dale Steyn, More Morkel in South Africa. We have played on bouncy as well as seaming pitches in South Africa, New Zealand and England in the past one year.
“Also, most of us have been to Australia before and know what to expect from pitches out there. Also it will be a good preparation for us before the World Cup, next year,” he explained.
The tour includes four Test matches starting December 4 in Brisbane. The series’ other games will be played in Adelaide (December 12 to 16), Melbourne (December 26 to 30) and Sydney (January 3 to 7).
After a break, the ODI tri-series will start on January 16, the finale of which will take place on February 1 in Perth.
Rohit has been more consistent as a batsman after he started opening the batting for India in the ODIs and he admitted as much.
“Opening the batting for India changed me as a player. My perspective on building an innings has improved tremendously since I started opening the batting. I believe I have become a better overall cricketer once I started opening the batting,” said Rohit.
Ajinkya Rahane has also done well as an opener in England ODIs and Rohit does not feel that there is any competition between him and the fellow Mumbaikar.
“I have loved my role as an opener but I am proud of what Ajinkya has achieved in England. For me, it does not matter which position I am batting as long as I am making a contribution to team’s cause. If I am told to open by the team management, I would humbly accept it and if I told to bat in the middle-order, it will be an equal honour. I have no choices or preferences as far as batting slots are concerned,” said Rohit.
The right-hander was castigated from all quarters for playing a lofted drive at the stroke of tea time during India’s third Test against England at Southampton but the 27-year-old does not regret playing that shot against off-spinner Moeen Ali.
“I agree that the dismissal at Southampton is one of the disappointing ones in my international career. But if you ask whether I regret playing that shot, then I would say ‘no’.
“I had a plan in my mind but I couldn’t execute that plan properly. The dejection is there because of non-execution,” Rohit, who is nursing a shoulder injury and fractured finger, said.
He then gave a technical explanation to his answer.
“I had already hit Moeen Ali for two fours at that point of time. The idea was not to let a part-time offie continued…

Wall Street s beer goggles are clearing upWall Street's beer goggles are clearing up. Now what?
By Matt Egan   @mattmegan5 October 5, 2014: 9:23 AM ET
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
Investors are sobering up -- and they may not like what they see.
For the past five years, investors have gotten drunk off the Federal Reserve's easy-money punch bowl.
The Fed's stimulus program, known as quantitative easing or "QE," left investors with beer goggles on. Stocks and bonds that normally would look unattractive suddenly looked pretty good.
Now that Janet Yellen is getting ready to remove the punch bowl, investors are being forced to take a more critical look at their portfolios.
"Everything looks good under the drug of QE, but once QE goes away those goggles start to clear up. Those warts and blemishes start to matter. Risk appetites change," explains Peter Boockvar, the Lindsey Group market analyst who came up with the beer goggles analogy back in January.
Even some members of the Fed admit the analogy works. Richard Fisher, the head of the Dallas Fed who has been critical of QE, used it in a speech earlier this year .
Related: Gold is back en vogue as investors worry
Sobering up: Recent turbulence in the stock market can partly be explained by the beer goggles effect.
Investors have been dumping stocks found in the previously red hot Russell 2000, sending that basket of smaller-sized stocks into "correction" mode last week. That's Wall Street code for a 10% decline from a previous high.
Smaller stocks are riskier than their larger cousins because their shares change hands less frequently, making it more difficult to buy and sell them. They're also more vulnerable to swings in the economy and credit markets than big stocks like Apple ( AAPL , Tech30 ) or Google ( GOOGL , Tech30 ).
The same sobering up process has hit so-called momentum stocks. High-flyers like Tesla ( TSLA ), El Pollo Loco ( LOCO ) and Netflix ( NFLX , Tech30 ) are all hovering well below their 52-week highs. Even red hot GoPro ( GPRO ) started responding to the laws of gravity last week.
That doesn't necessarily mean these are lousy stocks; just that investors realize they may take a breather as less of the Fed's easy money is sloshing around the financial system.
Even the credit markets are seeing the beer goggles impact. Junk bonds have taken a hit in recent weeks as Wall Street bets on which companies will be healthy enough to roll over their debt once interest rates begin to climb.
Related: The 5 hottest mutual funds & ETFs of 2014
Reshaped risk and reward: The Fed's emergency actions transformed the risk and reward of virtually all asset classes. That's because with interest rates at zero, cash in the bank earns virtually nothing. It actually loses value due to inflation.
To avoid losing money, investors are forced to put more of their money in riskier assets like stocks and bonds. That helps explain one of the driving forces for the bull market in stocks and why the U.S. government can borrow money for 30 years at just 3%.
But now the Fed is hitting the brakes on QE and is poised to lift interest rates off the floor next year.
'Brace for a correction' So what should investors do in this changing environment?
Boockvar believes the bull's party days may soon be over.
"People should brace for a correction. You could easily have a bear market if the Fed starts to lose control," he said.
Boockvar argues that the Fed's easy-money policies only pulled forward a lot of asset price gains.
"They want you to buy a car today instead of tomorrow. They want you to buy a stock today instead of tomorrow. When that drug goes away, you need to give back some of those gains that were artificially gotten," he said.
Related: Good news is really good news. Finally!
Others believe the party could still go on, just at more hushed tones and only for some parts of the stock market.
David Lebovitz, a global market strategist at JPMorgan ( JPM ) Asset Management, expects large-cap stocks to fare better than small caps because they have better access to credit.
He especially likes stocks with exposure to the IT, energy and financial sectors.
The point is, blindly throwing money into the stock market might not be the best play once QE ends.
"We're at a point in the cycle where differentiation is much more important. It's going to be much more about security selection," Lebovitz said.

Its highly unlikely that youll become infected with Ebola. So what are you so afraid ofJust consider how the New York tabloids covered a potential Ebola case in the city two months ago.
Ebola scare in the city: http://t.co/BU8srB5koR What you need to know about the Ebola virus: http://t.co/kxYs44FxHn pic.twitter.com/muEPntrMX6
— New York Daily News (@NYDailyNews) August 5, 2014
Fear of Ebola eclipses other health crises around the world, including diarrhea, a preventable and treatable condition that still kills 1.5 million children each year.
When Dr. Oz called Ebola "the biggest medical crisis our country, and the world is facing," he couldn't possibly have been referring to the number of cases, deaths, or the infrastructure needed to fight it . There are other ailments that are bigger in all of those senses. But we fear few of them like we fear Ebola.
That fear has a familiar narrative, one that plays out like a movie. "There's a fascination with the drama of the disease," said Priscilla Wald, author of " Contagious : Cultures, Carriers, and the Outbreak Narrative" and a professor at Duke University. "Why are we so afraid of something like Ebola? You hear about liquefying organs. There's the bleeding from the eyes."
Ebola is a scary way to die, to be sure. But there are other dramatic ways to meet one's end. And yet, we don't talk about car crashes like a contagion, nor do we apply the same focus to other, more common killers, such as influenza or pneumonia. "We're not scared of hearing that someone's lungs fill up with fluid," Wald said. "That's not scary. It's just deadly."
As the worst Ebola outbreak in history unfolds in West Africa, The Post's Joel Achenbach explains how the deadly virus wreaks havoc on the human body. (Davin Coburn/The Washington Post)
In a sense, Ebola has captured our collective fear because it, like epidemic movies, relies on a fictional burst of imagination. Ebola is an ingredient in an outbreak story we're already primed to tell, in zombie stories and films such as "Contagion."
When applied to a real epidemic, Wald said, the speculative outbreak narrative sidelines a necessary discussion about the underlying causes of the actual outbreak. "We are not talking about global poverty," she said.
The reason Ebola — a disease that has a relatively low transmission rate — has spread so dramatically and quickly through Liberia, Sierria Leone and Guinea has little to do with the characteristics of the virus. Now, as before the outbreak, "people are malnourished, with ill shelter, and most importantly, no access to adequate healthcare," Wald said.
In the West African regions at the center of the epidemic, the spread of Ebola has been nothing short of disastrous. On top of the 3,400 people in the region who have died from the disease, Ebola's spread has crippled the already fragile health-care systems of the hardest-hit countries. In Liberia, people are dying of treatable, preventable illnesses , because the health system there is so overwhelmed by Ebola.
In other words, one could view Ebola as a real doomsday for the Liberian capital of Monrovia, one of the worst-hit cities in the Ebola epidemic. In Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, the virus has spread at an unprecedented rate, and the death toll has long since surpassed all previous Ebola outbreaks combined . It is going to take a significant international effort to help contain Ebola in West Africa under these conditions.
The United States should be a different story, with Ebola easier to contain. But the mere potential of an outbreak here is exactly what many Americans are imagining.
Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the agency is trying to contain the spread of Ebola in West Africa stressing that "an outbreak anywhere is potentially a threat everywhere." He added that the CDC is now looking into the issue of entry screening at the airports. (Centers for Disease Control)
Even before the first U.S. Ebola case, four in 10 adults were concerned about the possibility of a large-scale outbreak of the disease in America, according to a Harvard poll conducted in August . The concern is probably fueled in part by a widespread lack of knowledge about Ebola: Nearly 70 percent of Americans incorrectly believe the virus spreads "easily," and a third of Americans believe (incorrectly) that there is an effective treatment for Ebola. Twenty-six percent of Americans are concerned that they or one of their loved ones will get Ebola within the next year.
Ryan Hall, a psychiatrist who has written about the 1995 Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo, said that the "long-term maintenance" following an acute crisis like the U.S. Ebola case can be more severe than the initial panic, with people who believe a case of the sniffles could be Ebola flooding hospitals or, he said, something like a "spike in heart attacks at home" because no one wants to go to the hospital because they think they'll be at risk of Ebola infection there.
"This is going to eat at people for 20 to 30 days until we see if there's a new case," Hall said, referring to the length of time it can take for Ebola to become symptomatic. (Generally, symptoms appear within 21 days of exposure.) If there is a second case, Hall said, the anxiety period will be extended: "That 20 to 30 days is going to restart."
Humans have a long history of overreacting like this, often to threats that turn out to be false. When the brain comes into contact with a perceived threat, there are generally one of three outcomes. If the threat is real, and the individual reacts to the threat properly, it's called a "hit." "If it is a genuine fear and I don't act, it's a miss. If I act and it's not, it's a false alarm," said Shmuel Lissek, founder of the ANGST Lab at the University of Minnesota, where he studies the human brain's responses to fear.
As it turns out, our brains may have evolved to avoid "misses." In early human history, Lissek said, "the cost of a miss ... of not taking it seriously, could potentially be lethal." But the cost of a false alarm is much lower. The simple version of this idea? Better safe than sorry.
Some people, more than others, have trouble inhibiting this fear response, even when the logical part of their brains tell them that the threat isn't real. "Somebody might rationally be 95 percent sure they're not gonna contract Ebola, but there's still a five percent chance they could," Lissek said. "They focus on that five percent and say 'what if?'"
According to Lissek, one of the best things health officials can do to help to calm that reaction is to find the "stop, drop, and roll" of Ebola prevention. "Being over-trained with things helps in the face of stress," he said, adding that it's helpful to "have concrete things that people can do" to prevent an Ebola infection, or to respond if the virus reaches where they live.
This is why the military drills emergency responses into soldiers. If responding to an emergency is as easy as drinking a latte, the anticipation of that emergency produces less anxiety; it removes the mystery, the dramatic appeal of the disease, to have a solution to the problem.
Susan Sontag knew this decades ago. She wrote in "Illness as Metaphor" that "any disease that is treated as a mystery and acutely enough feared will be felt to be morally, if not literally, contagious." At the time, in the late 1970s, the author had cancer, a disease that she observed had carried something of a taboo among the rest of society. She applied the same characterization to TB in the past, and eventually, to the AIDS/HIV epidemic.
Although Ebola is not present here in the way that TB, AIDS, or cancer ever have been, the same principle arguably applies.
So what should you do if you fear Ebola is coming to get you? Kaplan had one idea. "Turn off the TV," he advised.

HP to split into two companies  report saysHP to split into two companies, report says
By Gregory Wallace   @gregorywallace October 5, 2014: 6:14 PM ET
Meg Whitman, the CEO of HP, has led a restructuring of the company.
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
The next step for computing giant Hewlett-Packard's restructuring may be a split into two companies.
The Wall Street Journal, citing unnamed sources, reported Sunday that HP ( HPQ , Tech30 ) plans to put the PC and printer operations under one roof and its business that provides software and services to corporate customers under another.
The Journal said the announcement could come as soon as Monday, and that the separation would take place next year.
HP spokeswoman Sarah Pompei declined to comment on the report.
The split follows a number of spinoffs and breakups this year. Most recently, eBay ( EBAY , Tech30 ) announced on Tuesday it would spin off the online payment platform PayPal , which it bought in 2002.
Meg Whitman, the CEO of HP, took the helm in 2011 and unveiled a five-year restructuring plan. That included a major overhaul of the printer and PC business in 2012. Layoffs then and since have totaled at least 45,000, and HP projected savings of $4.5 billion per year.
Related: Big companies that are making big job cuts
Her predecessor, Leo Apotheker, considered a corporate split similar to the one the Journal reported, but he left the company after only 11 months.
Whitman would have leadership roles at both companies, the Journal said. She would be CEO of the enterprise business and chairman of the hardware company.
Some investors applauded the potential move.
The split would allow HP to be more "nimble" and let it "reshape" its business, said Brendan Connaughton, chief investment officer at ClearPath Capital Partners.
In particular, Connaughton said, the move would put renewed focus on enterprise services, "where they have incredible margins," sometimes upwards of 20%.
HP is among the top five performers in CNNMoney's Tech 30 index , which tracks significant tech companies. Its stock has climbed nearly 26% this year, bolstered by earnings that have climbed even as sales slumped.

Didn t get that joke Your sense of humour changes with ageIndo-Asian News Service | Posted: October 6, 2014 10:13 am
Things that you find funny today may not amuse you when you grow older, a study suggests, indicating that with age, our sense of humour also changes.
While young and middle-aged adults considered aggressive humour to be funny, older adults did not, the findings showed.
“Television sitcoms in which characters make jokes at someone else’s expense are no laughing matter for older adults,” said co-researcher Tehan Stanley, an assistant professor of psychology at University of Akron in the US.
The older adults preferred “affiliative humour” in which a number of characters share and navigate an awkward situation.
The researchers studied how young, middle-aged and older adults reacted to “aggressive humour”.
The findings appeared in the journal Psychology and Aging.

Cristiano Ronaldo hits third treble in five gamesReal's Cristiano Ronaldo (right) scores his second goal during a Spanish La Liga soccer match between Real Madrid and Athletic Bilbao. (Source: AP)
Madrid | Posted: October 6, 2014 10:47 am
Cristiano Ronaldo scored his third hat-trick in five games as Real Madrid moved into the top four for the first time this season with a 5-0 win over Athletic Bilbao.
It took Ronaldo just two minutes to extend his scoring streak to eight games as he headed home Gareth Bale’s cross and Karim Benzema made the game safe when he doubled Madrid’s lead just before half-time yesterday.
Bale teed up Ronaldo once more to make it 3-0 and the Portuguese then turned provider for Benzema to tap home his second of the game.
Ronaldo rounded off the scoring two minutes from time when he unintentionally deflected Pepe’s effort home to take his tally for the season to 17 goals in just 11 matches in all competitions.
Victory takes Real back to within four points of leaders Barcelona behind Valencia and Sevilla, but ahead of champions Atletico Madrid who drop down to fifth.
A fourth defeat in five league games for Athletic, meanwhile, means Ernesto Valverde’s men end the weekend in the relegation zone.
Madrid were back to full strength after coach Carlo Ancelotti had rested a few of his regular starters in the 2-1 win over Ludogorets Razgrad in midweek and took just two minutes to make the breakthrough against an Athletic side shorn of confidence.
Bale turned onto his weaker right foot, but still managed to pick out a perfect cross for the unmarked Ronaldo to head home at the back post.
Athletic ‘keeper Gorka Iraizoz then made a smart save low to his right to deny Ronaldo a second and Benzema just couldn’t stretch to turn home another Bale cross as the hosts piled on the pressure.
However, the Basques settled midway through the half and Iker Muniain’s spectacular dipping volley from the edge of the area forced Iker Casillas into action with a fingertip save.
Crucially Real managed to get the second goal before half-time, though, as Benzema rose highest to head Luka Modric’s corner in via the crossbar.
Bale wasted a great opportunity to make it 3-0 five minutes into the second-half as he blazed over with just Iraizoz to beat.
However, the Welshman made amends five minutes later when he raced onto Benzema’s pass and squared for Ronaldo to tap home his second of the night.
Bale came close again when he shot just wide after being set up by a lovely backheel from James Rodriguez and was then flagged offside when he did finally have the ball in the net.
Madrid were continuing to open up the Athletic defence at will and made it 4-0 21 minutes from time when Ronaldo unselfishly squared for Benzema to roll into an empty net rather than going for a hat-trick.
Ronaldo did then go in search of his third hat-trick in five games, forcing Iraizoz into a flying save with a powerful header.
However, the World Player of the continued…

Players get first feel of silverware  IndiaFrom left, Fredrik Ljungberg, David James, David Trezeguet, Robert Pires during the unveiling of the trophy of the inaugural Indian Super League (ISL) in Mumbai on Sunday. (Source: AP)
Written by Shahid Judge | Mumbai | Posted: October 6, 2014 1:19 am | Updated: October 6, 2014 8:24 am
As the Indian Super League’s Big Two — Robert Pires and Alessandro Del Piero — stepped towards the just-launched, generously sized silverware, the photographers went into a tizzy. Their faces hidden by their cameras, the lensmen stepped on each other toes in search of the perfect frame while shouting requests at the men on the dias. They wanted them to smile, wave, turn left, look right, do the ‘V’, lift the Cup, all that at the same time.
This sudden pandemonium would make Pires and Del Piero — though veterans of such trophy photo-ops — freeze at first but later left them amused. The global superstars were getting a first-hand, first-time feel of the riotous excitement that is associated with packed sporting arenas around India. In the days to come, the promoters of this ambitious league will hope for an encore of Sunday’s minor chaos when the stalwarts take field.
The other marquee players on the stage also seemed anxious of the surprises that they would encounter on this exotic Indian journey. Though rivals, they were all in the same boat. Having matched their wits against each other in other leagues, there was a comforting familiarity between the stars dressed in their respective franchise colours.
They even took digs at each other. Kerala Blasters’ player and manager David James playfully joked that Mumbai City FC star Fredrik Ljungberg would not be able to beat him in goal, nor would he win. Pires was asked how long his friendship with his former Arsenal teammate would last, to which the Frenchman laughed as he replied, “It stops now.”
The non-English speakers — North East United’s Joan Capdevila and Pune City FC’s David Trezeguet — seemed oblivious of the proceedings. Though, Capdevila did exchange pleasantaries with Atletico de Kolkata star Luis Garcia.
Before the players went on the stage, a promotional video, starring franchise owners — Sachin Tendulkar, Virat Kohli, Saurav Ganguly, Abhishek Bachchan, Ranbir Kapoor and John Abraham — was aired. As of now the owners are certainly more famous than the footballers on stage. Maybe, things will change at the end of the first season.

How RBI eases rules for opening bank accountsDipak Mondal      Follow @dipdown80    Edition: October 2014
The Reserve Bank of India, it seems, has finally lent ear to millions of such prospective account holders.(Photo: Reuters)
Most of us have faced a problem in opening a bank account in the absence of valid know-your-customer, or KYC, documents, and wished for a simpler documentation process.
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), it seems, has finally lent ear to millions of such prospective account holders. It has simplified the KYC documentation to make account opening less onerous.
SINGLE DOCUMENT FOR PROOF OF IDENTITY AND ADDRESS
Earlier, as part of the KYC process, one had to submit separate proofs for address and identity. The RBI has done away with this. Now, a single document with photograph and address of the applicant will suffice. Among the documents approved for KYC include passport, driving licence, voter ID card, PAN card, Aadhaar and job card.
NO SEPARATE PROOF FOR CURRENT ADDRESS
If you were new to a place and did not have a valid address proof, opening a bank account was nearly impossible. This problem has been taken care of. Now, customers have to furnish only one address proof (current or permanent) for opening a bank account. All that he is required to do is to make a simple declaration about his/her current address.
'SMALL ACCOUNTS' FOR THOSE WITH NO KYC DOCUMENT
This is probably the best piece of news for students who live away from home and migrant workers. They can now open a 'small account' instead of a full-service account.
A small account can be opened by self-attesting a photograph and giving thumb impression on the application in the presence of a bank employee. Small accounts, as the name suggests, will have restrictions in terms of loan (a maximum of Rs 1 lakh a year), withdrawals (not more than Rs 10,000 a month) and maximum balance (Rs 50,000 at any point of time).
These accounts will be operational only for a year. However, if the account holder provides proof that he/she has applied for a valid KYC document , the account can be extended for another 12 months.
RELAXATION FOR LOW-RISK CUSTOMERS
A person without valid KYC documents but categorised as 'low-risk' can open an account by submitting any of the following-identity card with applicant's photograph issued by a central/state government department, statutory/regulatory authority, public sector undertaking, scheduled commercial bank or public financial institution; or, a letter issued by a gazetted officer with an attested photograph.
Further, if low-risk customers are not able to submit the KYC documents due to genuine reasons, they can do so within six months from the date of opening the account.

Brazil elections spring a bag full of surprisesBrazil's President Dilma Rousseff, presidential candidate for re-election of the Workers Party, PT, talks about the results of the general elections during a press conference, in Brasilia, Brazil, Sunday, Oct. 5, 2014.(Source: AP)

It’s the presidential election that just keeps surprising.
A year after a spasm of huge anti-government protests across Brazil, President Dilma Rousseff piled up more votes in Sunday’s election than any challenger, but it wasn’t enough to avoid a runoff in three weeks.

The race kept up its unpredictable nature as Aecio Neves, a center-right former governor and senator with deep political lineage, came in second. He had languished in the polls during the campaign but surged in the past week to overtake former environment minister Marina Silva, who at one time was the front-runner.
In late August, Silva held a double-digit lead over the field after only entering the race following the death of her Socialist Party’s initial candidate in a plane crash. But then her reputation and credentials were picked apart by aggressive campaigning from Rousseff’s long-governing Workers’ Party.
With nearly all the votes counted, the president had 41.5 percent to Neves’ 33.6 percent. Silva got 21 percent.

The Oct. 26 runoff will now pit the candidates of Brazil’s two most powerful parties, which together have produced all of Brazil’s presidents the past 20 years and are well known to Brazilians.
Neves is backed by the well-organized Social Democracy Party, which held the presidency from 1994 until 2002, a period when Brazil tamed hyperinflation and turned the economy around.
“Aecio’s performance has been extraordinary, and one of the reasons for this is the very strong party structure behind him — a party with a strong nationwide presence and which has been in the presidency,” said Carlos Pereira, a political analyst at the Gertulio Vargas Foundation, Brazil’s leading think tank. “It is now a new election where everything is wide open. Aecio, who until recently no one believed had a chance, has emerged as a very strong candidate.”

NEW DELHI: Maruti Suzuki India, country's largest car maker on Monday launched the Ciaz sedan between Rs 6.99 lakh and Rs 9.8 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi). Maruti Ciaz will take on the likes of Honda City and Hyundai Verna .
Developed with an investment of Rs 620 crore, the most on a product by Maruti yet, Ciaz is aimed at the Indian and Chinese markets.

Aircraft flies into turbulence, six injured
S. Anil Radhakrishnan
Thiruvananthapuram
Six persons were injured on board a Jet Airways plane after it struck severe turbulence en route to Thiruvananthapuram from Dammam on Sunday.
The injured were given medical assistance after the 9W 656 flight landed at the Thiruvananthapuram airport at 7.03 a.m. Two of them — Biju Kumar of Alappuzha and Siva of Parasala — were shifted to an adjacent private hospital, airport sources said.
The airport authorities were ready with the ambulance after the commander reported of the turbulence to the Air Traffic Control. There were 153 passengers in the flight that took off from Dammam in Saudi Arabia at 11.47 p.m.
The incident occurred 400 km from the international airport and when the aircraft was flying around 30,000 ft. above the Arabian Sea. Many of the passengers had gone to sleep after food when the turbulence hit the plane.
“There was screaming and crying. The aircraft jolted thrice from side to side and we thought it was going to crash. Food spilled all over the cabin. The injured were those who did not keep their seat belts fastened,’’ one of the passenger said.
Mr. Siva was discharged from the private hospital after preliminary treatment. Mr. Biju Kumar, who suffered neck injuries, is under observation.
The aircraft after a detailed inspection returned to Muscat as scheduled, airline sources said. It is the first incident in recent times here.
An Air Traffic Controller told The Hindu that ‘clean air turbulence’ occurred without warning. Passengers who did not wear seat belts were most likely to be thrown off from their seats, he said.

PARIS: The European Commission is likely to reject France's 2015 budget draft at the end of October and ask for a new one that would better meet Paris' deficit reduction obligations under European Union rules, several euro zone officials said.
It would be the first time the EU executive arm exercises its power to demand changes to a national budget draft under new prerogatives that EU countries granted the Commission in 2013.
The Commission is also likely to step up the disciplinary procedure against France to the last stage before sanctions, while at the same time granting Paris the extra two years it wants to bring down its budget shortfall to within EU limits, the officials said.

Jules Bianchi’s accident in Sunday’s Japanese Grand Prix has prompted questions over whether the Formula One race should have been started earlier to beat deteriorating weather conditions. The Frenchman suffered severe head injury after his Marussia slid off the slippery track, drenched by rain brought in by the approaching typhoon Phanfone, and hit a recovery vehicle.
Adrian Sutil had crashed his Sauber at the same point a lap earlier. There had been talk earlier in the week of bringing the race forward to beat the worst of the typhoon but the decision was to start as scheduled at 1500 GMT. “We weren’t asked about our opinion so there is nothing I can say,” Sutil, who witnessed Bianchi’s accident, said when asked about it. “It was clear it got more wet and it would have been quite easy to make the race earlier.”
Retired triple world champion and Mercedes non-executive chairman Niki Lauda agreed: “They could have started earlier, there’s no question about it,” said the Austrian. “It was foreseeable. They could have started the race at one but I don’t take these decisions.”
The race started behind the safety car as rain drenched the 5.8 km circuit but, with conditions clearly too treacherous, it was red-flagged and the field led back into the pits at the end of the second lap. Conditions gradually improved enough for the drivers to race on intermediate tyres, though the showers returned near the end with the light also fading.
“For me personally it wasn’t (that bad),” Mercedes race winner Lewis Hamilton said. “There was more and more rain coming and… you started to see more reflections,” added the championship leader, who can count on a lot more grip in his car than Bianchi in his Marussia.
Brazilian Felipe Massa, however, said he was “screaming for the race to stop” when the rain returned towards the end. “I was screaming on the radio five laps before the Safety Car that there was too much water on the track,” said the Williams driver.

China kicks out 160 000 fake government staf...A total of 162,629 officials who were taking government wages without working have been removed in a nationwide campaign over the last year.

BEIJING: China has taken 160,000 "phantom" government staff off its official payroll who were receiving salaries despite not doing any work, state-media reported on Monday.
A total of 162,629 officials who were taking government wages without working have been removed in a nationwide campaign over the last year, the People's Daily newspaper said.
The province of Hebei in northern China saw the largest number of such officials, according to the paper, with nearly 56,000 identified.
Chinese President Xi Jinping has launched a high-profile campaign against rampant corruption and misuse of government funds, in the face of widespread public anger.
Critics say the campaign has been hampered by a lack of fundamental reforms, such as the creation of an independent legal system.
"The problem of government staff receiving salaries without working has been one of the problems most keenly reported by cadres," the People's Daily said.
China's official Xinhua news agency called the sacked workers "phantom officials".
So far no such "phantom officials" have been found in the commercial hub of Shanghai or in Tibet , the People's Daily added.
The officials involved would be punished, it said, without giving details.

Playing Dhoni will be challenging: Sushant Singh RajputComments
Ever since he made his debut with Kai Po Che (2013), Sushant Singh Rajput has made some interesting film choices. In his upcoming project with director Neeraj Pandey, he is set to play Indian cricket captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni on screen.
In an interview, the actor talks about the challenges of playing the lead in a biopic, meeting the cricketing star, his special equation with Shekhar Kapur , and more.
Is playing Dhoni on screen a huge responsibility for you?
As an actor, there is always a responsibility when you are portraying any character on screen. You have to meet your own expectations, [because] you want a large percentage of audience to come and watch the film. As for Dhoni, he is an inspiration, and is loved by millions. The incredible response after the [film’s] announcement only punctuates the massiveness of the project, and we will make sure the biopic transcends general expectations.
Recently, you met Dhoni regarding the film. How did the meeting go?
Five minutes into the meeting, I was blown away by his personality. He is a unique amalgamation of hard work, intelligence, patriotism, humility, passion and God-like inner peace. I am looking forward to many such conversations with him to carefully understand why he is the way he is, so that I can honestly portray him on screen.
This film is one of the rare biopics where the protagonist is still active in his own field.
Yes, and so it gets much more challenging. Everyone has a strong visual reference [of the person], since he is still playing and is immensely popular. So you, as an actor, have to match him completely in order to pull it off convincingly.
It’s believed that you are media shy compared to your contemporaries.
It’s a personal choice. The main objective is to be part of exciting films with wonderful directors, and I don’t think the ‘buzz’ or the ‘number of appearances’ in a week increases the possibility [of working in those films] by any measure. I am living my dream and will continue to follow my instincts and passion, and hopefully entertain the audience.
You and director Shekhar Kapur clearly share a great chemistry. In fact, he recently tweeted that you are “probably one of the best young actors we have today”.
We share a special bond, and talk about so many things when we meet. I haven’t met anyone else who understands human emotions better. Now, after getting to know him a bit more, when I watch his films again, I am able to understand the deeper meaning behind the narrative options he has taken, and the creative decisions he has made. I can't thank my stars enough to have gotten this opportunity to work with him so early in my career.
Why are you taking so many risks when your contemporaries are playing it safe in terms of film choices?
I chose to be an actor for selfish reasons. I love living different characters, and something happens to me when I am performing on stage or when I am in front of the camera. And that’s very liberating. I work for that. It helps me fight the fear of all kinds of uncertainties and insecurities.
Lastly, how important do you think you next with director Dibakar Banerjee will be, since it's coming at a very important time in your career (after a gap of a year)?
It is important for me, not because of the timing or anything, but because it’s a very special film. Honestly, as an actor, I learnt more in these seven months than I did in eight years of theatre, TV and films combined. Dibakar is a genius filmmaker.

US technology major Apple's iPhone 6 series will be sold in India at starting price of Rs 53,500 and the high end model at Rs 80,500 during the time of launch.
Both iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 plus come in three versions in terms of storage: 16 GB, 64 GB and 128 GB.

Vendors through e-commerce have starting offering the premium smartphones at price starting from around Rs 56,000. They even claimed to have sold some units of iPhone 6 at this price.

Elon Musk is the true successor to Steve JobsOne of the greats?(Reuters/Toru Hanai)
SHARE
John McDuling @jmcduling
October 6, 2014
Yesterday marked three years since the tragic passing of Apple’s visionary co-founder Steve Jobs.  And it’s increasingly clear that his true successor as the world’s most important, and exciting, entrepreneur is not Mark Zuckerberg, Jack Dorsey or even Tim Cook. It’s Elon Musk.
If there were any doubts about that then they were dispelled last week. All it took was a cryptic tweet from the 43 year-old South African-born CEO of electric car maker Tesla to send the technology and business media into raptures .
About time to unveil the D and something else pic.twitter.com/qp23yi59i6
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 2, 2014
Nobody knows for sure what “the D” is (let alone the “something else” Musk refers to), but theories abound. Among the most plausible of them is the idea that Tesla could be launching an all-wheel-drive and/or dual-motor version of its Model S sedan. The most ridiculous  speculation is that the announcement could involve a Tesla delivery van or dune buggy. We will have to wait until Oct. 9 to find out for sure.
At any rate, if the ensuing frenzy of half-leaks and wild conjecture felt familiar, that might be because it’s exactly the strategy Apple, since the Jobs era, has used to promote its own new products. And with great effect, as the company continues to be wildly successful, with the most sought-after consumer devices in existence.
Fast Company succinctly explained  Apple’s approach to building hype a couple of years ago:
Apple is a master of the teaser marketing campaign, dragging on the suspense for as long as possible. For weeks if not months before the release of every iPhone, the media conversation builds to deafening levels. Apple stokes the buzz by providing virtually no information…In essence, Apple created a cliffhanger as the media and bloggers speculated,”What could it be…?”
Musk’s tweet appears to have successfully created a groundswell of anticipation (and large amounts of free press). And the parallels don’t stop there.
Great products, beautifully designed
Although Tesla’s products lack the mainstream appeal of Apple’s, they inspire a similar, cult-like devotion among users. Maybe that’s because Musk is exhibiting a Steve Jobs-like obsession with the beauty and quality of them.  Musk also appears to be subtly channelling the Apple founder in his mode of promotion.
Jobs  famously said  (paywall) that companies fall into decline once “the quality of the product becomes less important. The company starts valuing the great salesman, because they’re the ones who can move the needle on revenues.”
Yet Jobs, in his own way, was a truly great salesman. He has been described as the greatest marketer of his time. Just watch him introduce the original iPhone back in 2007,  gush over its many revolutionary qualities, and gently mock the early smartphones it swiftly rendered obsolete:
Aesthetically, Musk’s introductions for his products are quite different. But as the following video of him introducing the beta version of the Model S shows, he exhibits an extraordinary level of confidence in his them. Like Jobs, he exudes an intimate familiarity that suggests he is heavily involved in their design and creation,  as well as immense pride:
Jobs used to pen brazen letters to the public airing grievances about outdated practices (by the music industry or Adobe, the maker of Flash  software) he felt were affecting the Apple user experience. Musk’s open letters about his vision for Tesla and critiques of the patent system bear some resemblance.
Customer focus
It is a popular myth that Jobs professed not to listen to Apple’s customers. Actually, he was just as obsessed with customer service as he was with every other aspect of the Apple user experience. He famously fielded basic customer queries and even once rang a customer directly  to apologize for long delays on repairs to a computer.
Musk has far fewer customers to deal with than Jobs did—Tesla’s cars are still niche products—but he is exhibiting a similarly strong customer focus.

Steve Jobs helped found one truly great company, Apple, and another highly regarded one, Pixar. He was forced out as Apple CEO, only to return triumphantly and not just resurrect it, but turn it into the biggest corporate empire the world has ever seen, on the back of a string of truly iconic products. He helped changed the way humans communicate and consume media.
Musk’s business achievements are impressive: He founded and sold PayPal, a company that now looks destined to play a key role in the mobile payments battle ; is the CEO of both Tesla and the orbital exploration company SpaceX; and is chairman of solar panel maker Solar City. Still, it remains to be seen whether he can ever scale the corporate heights Jobs did.
But his impact on the planet might end up being even more profound. He could help transform energy storage and commercialize space exploration. He talks, with a straight face, about colonizing Mars and saving the human race. If he achieves even half of that, he won’t just be the next Steve Jobs. He will be on his own level of greatness.

Spending time with Jaddu bhai (Jadeja)  Ashwin bhai proved helpful: PawanNegiPress Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: October 6, 2014 4:37 pm
Not even in his wildest dream did Pawan Negi think that he would take a five-for on a stage like the CLT20 final and after producing that unexpected stellar effort, the overnight star attributed his success to his stint at Chennai Super Kings and inspiration Daniel Vettori.
Negi beat the likes of Robin Uthappa, Jacques Kallis, Ryan ten Doeschate with his flight and guile on way to a memorable spell in only his second match of the tournament for the Chennai Super Kings.
“It really was a perfect night for me. I never thought I would get to play the game in the first place but looking at the pitch, coach (Stephen Fleming) decided to field me and I am glad I could repay the faith,” the Delhi-born Negi told PTI after returning home from Bangalore.
It was a remarkable showing from the 21-year-old medium pacer-turned spinner considering the limited opportunities he got during Chennai’s campaign, in the presence of established Indian tweakers Ravindra Jadeja and Ravichandran Ashwin.
“There are not a lot of people in Delhi with whom I can discuss my bowling. That way spending time with Jaddu bhai (Jadeja) and Ashwin bhai in the nets proved quite helpful, even when was not getting a game. And anyway I was told by coach Fleming to be ready for my chance. He said it could come anytime,” said the diminutive cricketer, who has just played two first-class games for Delhi since his debut in 2011.
Though he got the taste of IPL with Delhi Daredevils, Negi says spending a season with the mighty Super Kings has lifted his game by leaps and bounds.
“Initially I was nervous with Dhoni bhai, Fleming, Andy Bichel (bowling coach) and other big names around. But now I am okay with the dressing room atmosphere, it feels like family. Overall it has been a thorough learning experience. You don’t get to bowl to top-quality batsmen that often in domestic cricket as you do in IPL and CLT20,” he said.
While Jadeja and Ashwin are known to use a lot of variations, Negi keeps it simple. He made it a point to bowl slower through the air and fox the batsmen in the flight.
“That is how I have always liked to bowl and will continued to do so. The pitch in the final offered assistance and things went as per plan,” said Negi pointing out to his favourite dismissal of the day when he had Uthappa stranded outside the crease.
Negi still trains with childhood coach Ajay Verma but for the bowling part, he relies mostly on his role model Vettori.
“I am yet to meet him but I constantly watch his videos on the Internet. That itself has taught me so much.” Negi knows the fame and moolah lies in the shortest format but he is determined to prove his worth in Ranji Trophy also.
“Hopefully, I will get to play more of four-day cricket. Doing continued…
The pitch in the final offered assistance and things went as per plan

Aamir Khan wants to play Munnabhais CircuitThe three, reportedly, used to have long chats during the making of 'PK' about Raju Hirani's movies
Express News Service | New Delhi | Posted: October 6, 2014 4:23 pm | Updated: October 7, 2014 9:19 am
Bollywood superstar Aamir Khan wants to play ‘Circuit’ in the third instalment of ‘Munnabhai’ series, according to a report carried in Hindustan Times .
‘Munnabhai’ series’ director Rajkumar Hirani has worked Aamir Khan in ’3 Idiots’ and with Sanjay Dutt in ‘Munnabhai MBBS’ and ‘Lage Raho Munnabhai’. The three stawarts have come together for the much awaited movie ‘PK’, in which Aamir and Sanjay have shared screen space for the first time.
The three, reportedly, used to have long chats during the making of ‘PK’ about Raju Hirani’s movies and that’s when Aamir Khan had expressed his desire to play ‘Circuit’ in the next edition of ‘Munnabhai’. The role which has been made famous by Arshad Warsi.
According to the story: “While shooting, the three of them would have conversations about Raju sir’s films. During discussions about the making of Munna Bhai (2003), Aamir would always say that he’d like to do the role of Circuit. He has always liked the films and he told Raju sir that if there ever was a third installment in the series, he would love to play that role. It helps that he’s played something similar in Rangeela (1995).”
While Sanjay Dutt loved Aamir’s idea, Raju Hirani has also confirmed the news. He said: “Aamir is often heard saying that he would like to do the role of Circuit. Aamir, Sanjay and Raju’s camaraderie is well known on the sets, which only makes it comfortable for them to work together.”
Let’s hope we see the trio in action soon.

Shelling exposes Pak frustration after failure to get response on Kashmir: OmarAbdullahPress Trust of India | Jammu | Posted: October 6, 2014 4:19 pm
Condemning the shelling on civilians in Arnia region of Jammu that left five dead, J&K Chief Minister Omar Abdullah on Monday said that targeting of civilian areas exposed the frustration of the Pakistani government after its failure to gain international attention on the Kashmir issue.
“They (the Pakistani leadership) have nothing else to speak, but only Kashmir. Whenever they go abroad, they try to raise only Kashmir issue, but every time they miserably fail to get international attention. The cross-border shelling is an indication of their frustration,” he told reporters after meeting civilians injured in the shelling at the Government Medical College Hospital here.

Omar strongly condemned the firing and said, “Either we are unable to understand Pakistan’s motive behind the increase in the incidents of ceasefire violations or the internal situation in Pakistan is so bad that by targeting Indian side they want to divert the attention of their own people from their internal turmoil.”
The Chief Minister said that at a time when people of Jammu and Kashmir should be getting Eid greetings from the Pakistan side, the Pakistani army has gifted them with bombs.
“There was no reason to violate the ceasefire. It was a deliberate attempt from the Pakistani side to target the civilian areas. The death and injury to so many innocent civilians is a part of their nefarious designs,” he said.

When this mediation centre gets knottier and knottiercasesThe two counsel maintain that the spark for dispute is often petty, which leads to court cases and police complaints.
Written by Japjeet Duggal | Chandigarh | Posted: October 6, 2014 4:16 pm | Updated: October 6, 2014 4:18 pm
The mediation centre at the Punjab and Haryana High Court has witnessed a change in the nature of complaints it is getting in the cases of matrimonial disputes over the last one year, with more cases under sections 376 (rape) and 377 (unnatural offences) of the IPC being registered by the police.
“After the criminal law was amended (following the Delhi gangrape), the police are adding sections of rape against the father-in-law of the woman or any other male relative. Sections of unnatural offences are also being added,” says senior advocate Atul Lakhanpal, member of the mediation and conciliation committee.
Says Reeta Kohli, co-ordinator of the mediation centre, “Police and counsel for the petitioner women make them add allegations which are non-bailable just to make their cases stronger. It defeats the purpose of mediation. On the one hand, we are trying to get the families together and on the other, the police and the counsel are trying to break them by levelling false allegations.”
The two counsel maintain that the spark for dispute is often petty, which leads to court cases and police complaints. “A couple came to me for counselling along with their families. The woman had imposed Section 377 on her husband. In one session, I called them both without their families. When I asked them the reason, both of them said that there was no incident of unnatural offence. The dispute started because the man said the woman used to serve him a cold cup of tea,” says Lakhanpal.
Kohli says, “The concept of early counselling is missing. Couples come to us when the situation gets worse. In most of the cases, the couples part ways, but in peace. They shake hands and leave after we settle. We have even seen cases where women have paid maintenance and parted ways.”
Both mediators say the high court is now expanding their mediation centre. “More and more people are coming to the mediation centre. It is quick, easy and effective. People either get together, or part ways but it is settled with the consent of both persons involved. People are coming in for mediation directly.”

Our KBC win is not flash in the pan: AchinNarulaPress Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: October 6, 2014 4:13 pm
Brothers Achin and Sarthak Narula, who created history by winning maximum prize money of Rs 7 crore on ‘Kaun Banega Crorepati’, say their win on the show was not just luck but a culmination of 10 years of hardwork.
Achin, the elder of the two, says rejection over the past 10 years did not deter him from trying to make it to
the hot seat and win the game. “Our win is not a flash in the pan. My journey started 10 years back. The reason behind our success was that I did not give up. I did get frustrated at times but did not want to quit. I wanted to keep trying and then I was recently joined by my brother who was preparing for SSC examination,” Achin told PTI.
The 28-year-old marketing manager says he and his family thought they would not go beyond Rs 25 lakhs in the game. “My father is still in shock. He would not have imagined in the best of his dreams and worst of the nightmares that we will get Rs 7 crore. Our benchmark was Rs 25 lakhs and only when we crossed that, we thought we could do something big,” he said.
Achin adds the whole atmosphere on the ‘KBC’ sets was nerve-wracking and the duo decided to go with the flow rather than plan their moves.

“During the last few questions my brother and I exchanged no notes. We decided to enjoy the moment. There was a lot going in our mind, the background music was quite thrilling, the lights were on us, you have Mr Bachchan facing you and then you also think that you are on national TV. So, it was best to not think much,” he said.
Hailing the Bollywood megastar as benevolent, Achin says Amitabh Bachchan made sure they were at ease while playing the game. “Mr Bachchan makes you comfortable and make sure a candidate is relaxed. He is very kind. After we won, he told us we took a big risk, I said we took a big one but calculated risk. Luckily it paid off,” he said.
Achin feels he is living a dream as till a month back he was looking for a new job and now he can start his own business.
“It has been the life-defining moment for me and my family. Till one month back, I was looking for a promotion or changing my job and now everything has changed. I have not made concrete decisions about what we will do with this money but now I can think and explore a lot of things but I know I won’t make stupid decisions because I have seen downside of life,” he said.
The first thing on his mind, however, is his mother’s cancer treatment. “We want her to recover as soon as possible. Her chemotherapy is over. Now, she is in monitoring phase. Our win is because of her prayers. My first priority is her treatment,” continued…

I learnt Hindi by watching Akshay Kumars film: LisaHaydonPrint

Model-turned-actress Lisa Haydon, who shares screen space with Akshay Kumar in upcoming film ‘The Shaukeens’, says in her initial years in Bollywood she used to watch the ‘Khiladi’ star’s films to learn Hindi.
Akshay will do a cameo as himself in ‘ The Shaukeens ‘ and the 28-year-old ‘Queen’ actress essays the role of a crazy fan of the Bollywood star. “I still can’t believe that I am doing a film with Akshay.
I am a fan but not a crazy one like a play in the movie. If he knew I was psycho, he would never work with me. There is so much respect for him. When I was learning Hindi, I used to watch his films because he speaks the language so well,” Lisa Haydon told PTI.
‘The Shaukeens’ is a remake of the 1982 film ‘Shaukeen’ directed by Basu Chatterjee.
The new film stars Anupam Kher, Piyush Mishra and Annu Kapoor, who are lusting after a much younger girl played by Lisa.
The movie has been directed by Abhishek Sharma of ‘Tere Bin Laden’ fame and produced by Akshay. It will hit theatres on November 7.

Hewlett-Packard to split into two listed com...Hewlett-Packard to split into two companies
Hewlett-Packard to split into two companies
The split will be through a tax-free distribution of shares to stockholders next year, the company said in a statement on Monday.
ET SPECIAL:
Hewlett-Packard Co said it would split into two listed companies, separating its computer and printer businesses from its faster-growing corporate hardware and services operations.
HP said its shareholders would own a stake in both businesses through a tax-free transaction next year.
Shares of the company, which has struggled to adapt to the new era of mobile and online computing, rose 6.3 percent to $37.40 in premarket trading on Monday.
Each of the two businesses contribute about half of HP's current revenue and profit.
The move will result in a monumental reshaping of one of technology's most important pioneers, which still has more than 300,000 employees and is on track to book $112 billion in revenue this fiscal year.
The printing and personal computing business, to be known as HP Inc, will be led by Dion Weisler, currently an executive in that division.
HP's current chief executive, Meg Whitman, will lead the new Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, which will house the corporate hardware and services operations. She will also be chairman of HP Inc.
Current HP lead independent director Patricia Russo will be chairman of the enterprise company.
Founded by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard in a Palo Alto, California garage in 1939, HP was one of the companies that shaped Silicon Valley and the PC revolution.
Lately, however, it has struggled to adapt to the shift towards mobile computing, and it has been overshadowed by younger rivals.
The announcement on Monday confirmed a report of the split in the Wall Street Journal on Sunday.
HP is the latest in a line of companies, often under shareholder pressure, to spin off operations in an attempt to become more agile and to capitalize on faster-growing businesses.
Last week online auction company eBay Inc said it would spin off electronic payment service PayPal.
Up to Friday's close, HP's stock had risen nearly 26 percent this year.

From tubes to transistorsWikimedia Commons It was only on October 7, 1954, that the first experimental version of the IBM 604, an all-transistor calculator, was built, Image shows IBM 604 Electronic Calculator at National Science Museum in Amsterdam.
TOPICS
technology (general)
In this week's 'An eye for an i', we will take a look at one of the first devices that made the transformation from vacuum tubes to transistors
Did you know that the first half of the 20th century was dominated by vacuum tubes? Be it radio, television, telephone networks or computers, vacuum tubes were the basic component for all electronics.
It was only in the 1950s, a few years after the invention of semiconductor devices, that the switch from vacuum tubes to transistors took place. Today, we will look at one of the first devices that made the transformation.
The IBM 604 Electronic Calculating Punch was introduced in 1948. A lot of planning talent was invested in this device and with considerable expectations, the future of IBM hinged around it.
A desk-sized machine that took in punch cards to process problems, the IBM 604 comprised of over 1250 vacuum tubes that enabled it to perform operations. It was no computer, but as a calculator it could process over 100 cards per second, performing addition, subtraction, multiplication and division using binary coded decimal arithmetic. That was still a lot of calculation at a pretty quick pace during those times.
Vacuum tubes played the role of controlling electric current in electronics through a vacuum in a sealed container. Transistors, that were invented in 1947 by William Shockley, could perform the same function of controlling flow of electricity in circuits, thereby switching on and off appropriately. Therefore, it was only a matter of time before engineers employed these to build their logic.
This, however, did not happen immediately. It was only on October 7, 1954, that the first experimental version of the IBM 604 using solid-state devices instead of vacuum tubes were built.
Paved way for commercial calculator from IBM
Over 2000 transistors were employed in this device. As the initial IBM 604 was built such that it could be manufactured and serviced easily, its design allowed for an easy tech swap from tubes to transistors.
The resulting all-transistor calculator was neither faster, nor smaller than the vacuum tube based machine. What it had going for it, however, was the fact that it consumed only 5 per cent of the power when compared with that needed for the older model.
The success was met with enthusiasm and it urged IBM to build the first commercial calculator based on transistor technology. The IBM 608 was the product and it came out to the market in 1958.
Not affordable
Commercial success though, was still a step away. With over 3000 transistors used, and transistors still being expensive, these calculators were not quite affordable.
With time, however, more and more products took to the new technology, prompting the prices of transistors to fall below that of vacuum tubes. And since then, solid-state devices have replaced vacuum tubes, ushering in an era of low-power, smaller and faster computing devices.

India and Pakistan did not exchange sweets along the Wagah border in Punjab on the occasion of Eid on Monday after the Pakistan Rangers violated the ceasefire along the international border in Jammu district killing five civilians and injuring 29.
In one of the worst ceasefire violations, Pakistani Rangers resorted to firing and shelling of mortars on 10 border outposts and civilian areas along the international border in Arnia belt of Jammu district on Sunday night.

During a late evening flag meeting between the sector commanders of the Border Security Force and Pakistan Rangers on Sunday, the Rangers refused to fix any time for the ceremony to be held on Monday, PTI quoted unnamed official sources as saying.
"The Pakistan side refused the exchange of sweets on Eid today. They cited no reasons but it is understood that the prevailing tension along Jammu and Kashmir border due to unprovoked firing incidents from the other side is the reason," the sources said.
The BSF too did not make any movement along the Wagah border and the border gates remained shut on Monday.
The exchange of sweets between the border guarding troops of the two countries is an old and traditional gesture which is aimed to show goodwill. The same drill is held during Diwali and Independence day of both the countries.
Senior commanders from both the sides exchange sweets in their official uniforms along the Wagah land border which is also frequented by locals and tourists from both sides.
PTI also reported that the evening retreat and lowering of flag ceremony is expected to take place as scheduled.

India asks Pak to stop ceasefire violations at the borderPakistan continues to violate ceasefire, kills 5 civilians
Tarun Upadhyay , Hindustan Times  Jammu/New Delhi, October 06, 2014

The Indian government hardened its stance and asked the Border Security Force (BSF) to “retaliate with full force” after five civilians were killed and 29 wounded in firing by Pakistani forces along the border in Jammu on Monday, official sources said.
 
Tensions flared after four Pakistani civilians, including two children and a woman, were killed in retaliatory firing by India as home minister Rajnath Singh and defence minister Arun Jaitley warned Pakistan to stop such attacks if it wanted peace talks with India.
 
“Ceasefire violation must stop. Pakistan must realise that a decisive government has come to power, which will not take such instances lying down,” Singh told HT in an interview.

India and Pakistan exchanged fire in Arnia and RS Pura sectors late on Monday, the heaviest firing between the two countries since India called off bilateral talks last month. Jaitley said the repeated ceasefire violations would not help normalise relations between the two countries and Indian armed forces were responding to all provocations from across the border.
 
"This is resulting in a series of ceasefire violations as a result of which innocent civilians have lost their lives. Pakistan must realise that the kind of environment it is generating between the two countries is certainly not going to help in normalising relations. The onus of creating a positive environment is on Pakistan which is utterly failing to do so," Jaitley said.

A senior government official told HT on condition of anonymity that border agencies, mainly the BSF and the army, had received instructions to not just match mortar for mortar but “outnumber the number of mortars in retaliation”.
 
“There is no hesitation to our response now. If Pakistan fires five mortars, we can retaliate with 10,” he said.
 
The violence puts more strain on already-tense ties between India and Pakistan after New Delhi called off planned foreign secretary-level talks following the Pakistani ambassador’s meeting with Kashmiri separatist leaders last month.
 
Worst affected by the Pakistani firing in India was Mashain-de-kothe village, where four members of a family were killed. Mortars also landed at Arnia town, about three km from the International Border (IB), forcing thousands of people to flee their homes.
 
“When firing started we thought it would be another routine thing. But when heavy mortars started pounding our homes and heard cries, it was our worst nightmare,” said Soma Devi, a relative of the family that lost four members to the firing.
 
BSF sources said India will not have a flag meeting after the firing which began late last Thursday in a bid to disrupt Dussehra celebrations. Media reports said three militants were killed as the army foiled an infiltration bid along the Line of Control in Tangdhar sector.
 
The Pakistani ministry of foreign affairs issued a statement condemning what it described as India’s “unprovoked firing”.
 
“The government of Pakistan has lodged a strong protest with the government of India through diplomatic channels and called for restraining its forces from constant violation of the ceasefire," it said in the statement.
 
With tension prevailing on the border, the traditional exchange of sweets between Indian and Pakistani troops at the Attari border in Punjab on Eid was called off. However, sweets were exchanged at Chakan-da-bagh area in Poonch.

Hewlett-Packard to Split into Two CompaniesIndian Oil's Credit Profile to Improve, Says Moody's
Hewlett-Packard Co said it would split into two listed companies, separating its computer and printer businesses from its faster-growing corporate hardware and services operations, and eliminate another 5,000 jobs as part of its turnaround plan.
HP said its shareholders would own a stake in both businesses through a tax-free transaction next year, the details of which still needed to be worked out. (Read: Can Hewlett-Packard Survive the Tablet Trend? )
Each business contributes about half of HP's revenue and profit.
Shares of the 75-year-old company, which has struggled to adapt to the new era of mobile and online computing, were up 4 percent at $36.60 in early trading on Monday.
A spinoff of the PC business was last proposed in 2011 by then-Chief Executive Leo Apotheker as the company struggled in the highly competitive PC market. HP later ditched the plan - and Apotheker, replacing him with current CEO Meg Whitman. (Also read: HP Faces Uphill Battle With Newly Minted PC Unit )
"Make no mistake, one HP was the right thing to do to begin the turnaround of this company," Whitman said on a conference call. "But now ... this is definitely the right tactic."
HP said it planned to cut 5,000 more jobs as part of its multi-year restructuring, raising the total under Whitman to 55,000. The company currently has more than 300,000 employees.
The separation will result in a fundamental reshaping of one of technology's most important pioneers, which is on track to generate $112 billion in revenue in the fiscal year this month.
Many investors and analysts had called for a break-up of the company, or a sale of the PC business, so that HP could focus on the more profitable operations that sell computer servers and networking gear and data storage to businesses.
"Shareholders will now be able to invest in the respective asset groups without the fear of cross-subsidies and inefficiencies that invariably plague large business conglomerates," Ralph Whitworth, former HP chairman and founder of Relational Investors LLC, said in a statement.
Relational owns a 1.49 percent stake in HP, which has a market value of almost $70 billion.
HP is the latest in a line of companies, often under shareholder pressure, to spin off operations in an attempt to become more agile and capitalize on faster-growing businesses.
Online auction company eBay Inc, which was formerly run by Whitman, said last week it would spin off electronic payment service PayPal.

Battle for primetime
Librarians wont stay quiet about government surveillanceBy Andrea Peterson October 3 Follow @kansasalps
Librarians are among the loudest voices opposing government surveillance. (BigStock)
In September 2003, Attorney General John Ashcroft called out the librarians . The American Library Association and civil liberties groups, he said, were pushing "baseless hysteria" about the controversial Patriot Act. He suggested that they were worried that spy agencies wanted to know "how far you have gotten on the latest Tom Clancy novel."
Ashcroft was 17 speeches into a national speaking tour defending the Patriot Act, a law expanding government surveillance powers that passed nearly unanimously in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. And all along the way, the librarians showed up to protest.
In the case of government surveillance, they are not shushing. They've been among the loudest voices urging freedom of information and privacy protections.
Edward Snowden's campaign against the National Security Agency's data collection program has energized this group once again. And a new call to action from the ALA's president means their voices could be louder and more coordinated than ever.
Guarding patrons' library activities is considered a core value of the profession, written into the ALA's code of ethics : "We protect each library user's right to privacy and confidentiality with respect to information sought or received and resources consulted, borrowed, acquired or transmitted."
Over the years, the U.S. government has tested the limits of how far librarians will go to defend that code. Near the end of the Cold War, FBI agents asked New York City librarians to watch for patrons who might be diplomats from foreign hostile powers trying to recruit intelligence agents or gathering intelligence. Library officials were alarmed.
"These things are so far removed from the professional duties of a librarian that I find it almost inconceivable that this whole thing is happening,'' Nancy Lian, head of the New York Library Association, said in a New York Times article at the time. A judicial order, she noted, would be required for such action.
Early resistance
Library groups were wary of the Patriot Act from the start, according to Emily Sheketoff, head the ALA's Washington office.
"We were engaged because we feared that the government would overstep," Sheketoff said, a fear she believes has been validated.
Given the political climate after Sept. 11, even individual legislators who said they agreed in principle didn't pull their support of the bill. "It was a steamroll that we couldn't even slow down," she said. After the bill passed, the group trained library employees around the country on how to respond if the government requested information.
Section 215 of the act - later used to justify the bulk collection of domestic phone metadata as revealed by Snowden - was called the "library provision." The implication was that the government could use it to get library records. By 2003, some libraries placed signs in their lobbies, warning patrons that the government could obtain their records under the bill. Hundreds of meetings were organized to discuss the privacy implications of the law at libraries around the country.
Stewart Baker, the assistant secretary for policy at the Department of Homeland Security under President George W. Bush, said it was a "disservice to public debate" that Section 215 was ever known as the library provision, arguing that there was no evidence it was used in the context suggested by library groups.
When Ashcroft's promotion tour rolled around, many of his talks took place behind closed doors while librarians and civil liberties advocates protested nearby.
The backlash to his comments was fierce. "It turns out people like and trust their local librarians," Sheketoff said. As a result, Ashcroft telephoned Carla Hayden, then-president of the association.
"I must say, it was quite something," Hayden said. "When you have the opportunity to express something to a person in that position, you want to do it well."
Hayden said she reminded Ashcroft that libraries were open to working with law enforcement through judicial channels. But, she said, she believed the Patriot Act went beyond that relationship.
Hayden said Ashcroft "expressed that he was sorry that he might have said something that could have been offensive - and that he didn't intend that." In fact, Hayden said, he told her that he had "good library experiences in his life."
Ashcroft did not respond to a request for comment for this story. Baker believes the apology came as a result of the librarians' media campaign.
But in his view, Ashcroft was justified. As he put it: "The implication of their campaign was that library records across the country were being rifled through by people in the name of national security trying to figure out who was reading books they disapproved of - that was pretty clearly what the parade of horribles suggested and that Section 215 was somehow implicated in that. And none of that is true."
The Connecticut Four
Within two years of Ashcroft's apology, four library officials in Connecticut found themselves in a legal battle over handing over patron information - and unable to talk about it.
In July 2005, two FBI agents presented George Christian with a national security letter - an information request that doesn't require judicial approval - seeking data about patrons' library use. He was the executive director of a consortium called Library Connection. Such letters existed before the Patriot Act and did not derive from Section 215. But their use was expanded by the law.
The government wanted to know who had used a device at an IP address in February, Christian said. The address was assigned to a router that served many devices, and to hand over that data could have violated the privacy of many patrons beyond the subjects of the FBI's investigation, said Christian, an accidental librarian who is trained as a software developer.
Christian questioned the constitutionality of the search. The most astounding part, he said, was the gag order attached to the letter. "It was perpetual, with no expiration date," he said. Such conditions are a standard feature of national security letters, requiring recipients to keep secret even the fact that they received a letter.
"Gag orders were made controversial," Baker said. "They're a routine feature of a lot of criminal and other investigations whenever you don't want the defendant or the suspect to know you're investigating them."
Instead of keeping quiet, Christian called an emergency board meeting. His colleagues unanimously decided to challenge the request. The American Civil Liberties Union agreed to take up the case. The group was already representing an Internet service provider fighting a similar request and was looking for a library to join the challenge.
Because of the gag order, none of the four library officials - Christian, Barbara Bailey, Peter Chase and Jan Nocek - could add their names to the suit. The four were known as John Doe throughout the case. During the first hearing, none could be in the courtroom, lest their identities be revealed. "We watched it from a closed-circuit television in Hartford," Bailey said.
Their identities eventually slipped to the media through faulty redaction in court documents related to the case. Even then, the four were unable to speak out - or testify about it during a debate over the Patriot Act's renewal.
"It was incredibly stressful," Christian said. The group was bound to silence until May 2006, when the government withdrew the request - and with it the gag order. That made the "Connecticut Four," as they have come to be known in library circles, among the only recipients of such an order who can publicly discuss the experience.
Library advocacy in a post-Snowden world
Snowden's leaks have only deepened the concern about the degradation of privacy rights. "Now we know that it really didn't matter what they passed," Sheketoff said. "What they were sweeping up was everything, way beyond what anybody had ever envisioned."
Librarians have deployed new methods to protect patron privacy.
"As technology has changed and we've moved from the card catalogue and paper records to electronic records, we are always looking to destroy the record as soon we can," Sheketoff said. "When you return a book, the record is destroyed so that when the government comes we can say that we legitimately only know what you have out at the time."
In Massachusetts, the local branch of the American Civil Liberties Union has partnered with some librarians to deploy services like anonymous browsing tool Tor that can shield patrons' activity from electronic snooping.
The ALA backs reform of surveillance laws - specifically the bipartisan Senate version of the USA Freedom Act, which would limit data collection under Section 215.
Allies in the civil liberties community praise the group's track record. As Kevin Bankston, policy director at New America's Open Technology Institute, put it: "Librarians are on the front lines of the information society, charged with providing easy access to information for all, and are often some of the first to raise their voices over emerging Internet policy issues, whether around online censorship, digital copyright, or most often post-9/11, overreaching surveillance."
ALA President Courtney Young has called for the group's 57,000 members to pledge an hour a week to advocacy - including reaching out to members of Congress.
For his part, Christian has grown less optimistic as the push to reform the law has dragged on.
"We are obviously all in trouble," he said. "What happened to us seems like kindergarten compared to the revelations from Snowden."

Bachelor contestants include former FOX Newser  Redskinette Jillian AndersonBy Emily Heil October 3 Follow @emilyaheil
Last season’s “Bachelor” and a finalist. (ABC/Rick Rowell)
Washingtonians might see a familiar face among the ladies vying to be the last rose-clutching lady standing in Season 19 of “The Bachelor,” the ABC show in which an eligible man winnows down a pool of women to one to be his wife.  
Though the show hasn’t released the cast list for the latest installment set to air early next year, sources say it includes Jillian Anderson, a 25-year-old Redskinette who until last month worked on the assignment desk at FOX News’s D.C. Bureau. 
Anderson is not currently listed on the roster for the Redskins cheerleaders, so it may be that she’s left or gone on leave to begin filming the reality show in L.A. A Redskins rep didn’t immediately return our calls.
Her apparent right-leaning politics could prove to be a big asset in her attempts to land the season’s titular bachelor. Chris Soules, the hunky Iowa farmer who’s the show’s big prize, has been known to hobnob with prominent GOP pols, including at this photo op with Texas Gov. Rick Perry at the Iowa State Fair (Soules was judging a barbecue contest; Perry was making the rounds in the early-caucus state like a potential presidential contender).

Mother Of NBC Freelancer With Ebola Voices Her Worst Fear About Diseasereddit
The 33-year-old NBC News freelancer who contracted Ebola has been identified as Ashoka Mukpo. On Friday morning, his parents spoke to "Today" about his progress.
Mukpo was working with NBC's Dr. Nancy Snyderman and her crew when he began showing symptoms of the virus. He was quickly quarantined, as were the rest of the news team. All are being sent back to the United States for further treatment.
Mukpo's mother, Diana Mukpo, and his father, Mitchell Levy, spoke to NBC's Tamron Hall about his conditions.
"His spirits seem better today," Levy said. "He knows he's going to come home." He said his son was suffering from "just a mild fever" so far.
Diana Mukpo said Ashoka was getting excellent care, but that she worried about what will happen between now and when he leaves Liberia on Sunday.
"I can really only hope and pray that his symptoms don't worsen," she said.
Snyderman, who is facing weeks of isolation as she continues her self-quarantine , thanked people for the good wishes and tweeted a reminder about where she thinks attention should be placed:

Hungry for Culture 11 Business Lessons Inspired by Restaurant Royaltyreddit
NewCo , a new kind of "decentralized" innovation conference, recently crawled across New York City. I heard whispers of its magic when our company hosted sessions during its San Francisco leg but after experiencing it first-hand, I can attest that its magic was understated. Dynamic companies across industries opened up their homes to present big ideas and create an ideal format for networking with an array of career superstars - from JPMorgan to Live in the Grey.
The magic of the conference, in French terms, could be described by terrior. Terroir gives wine its sense of place and some places have more than others. I'd argue that the "terrior of a business" breeds culture, innovation and community. Over the course of the two-day conference, I had the pleasure of visiting many offices (Foursquare, Outbrain, Lerer Hippeau Ventures and TED) and meeting the brains behind them. Each session was memorable in its own right but the lessons learned at Union Square Hospitality Group (USHG), can and should be applied to any work environment. After all, Danny Meyer, USHG Founder, legendary restaurateur and native St. Louisan (Go Cardinals!) basically authored the bible for building culture and achieving hospitality bliss.
As you strive to build the best workplace and culture for your business, keep in mind these these tips from the USHG brain trust:
Innovation
Strive to be the company that would put you out of business because "new gets old tomorrow." Honor risk-takers and allow your org chart to embrace innovation. Pause to celebrate wins and quickly move on to strive for further excellence. Most importantly, be highly allergic to mediocrity.
Hiring
It all starts with hiring. Hire high-achievers. These are people that want to improve at what they do for your company. People cannot be taught to care. (Case-in-point, my friend Camilla moved across the country to work for USHG... so they must be doing something right because she's a smart cookie :)
Camaraderie
Colleagues must first take care of one another. Build an army of people that will have your back. When you fall, they will immediately pick you back up. This critical foundation will enable you to best serve your customers and partners.
Decision-Making
Make the process as rich as possible and make decisions for the long-term. The cost of your relationships with your customers outweighs all.
Leadership
Leadership must create a culture of sharing while keeping things in equilibrium. Alignment fosters impact.
Success
Success can be defined as being the favorite in your category. Being "the favorite" carries with it an emotional response.
Failure
Inspiration comes from celebrating failure and missteps. The most critical learnings are often birthed out of failure.
Humility
Raise your hand and ask for help.
Reputation
Reputations are built on what you've done, not what you are planning to do.
Empowerment
Make sure that you give people the permission to do great work. There are two four-word phrases to live by: "You can do it," and "I'm rooting for you."
Competition
Respect your competition and their hard work.
As you can tell, the session was as enjoyable as the tasting menu at Gramercy Tavern or the toasted ravioli at Blue Smoke. (Seriously, you must try them.)
Don't miss NewCo if it's coming to your city. Thanks for a few great days!

Hospitals Need to Teach Their Staff Hospitalityreddit
I recently came across an article in Crains' about a health care system hiring restaurateur and hospitality maven Danny Meyer to help their staff learn to be more hospitable. I find it ironic that hospitals need to take lessons in "hospitality" when the word hospital itself is the root of the word hospitality. Hospital comes from the Latin word hospes, which in ancient times meant a place for strangers along the way to find comfort and welcome. Obviously, this meaning has been lost in translation in our modern health care system.
Meyer operates several highly regarded restaurants in New York and formed a consulting arm, Hospitality Quotient, or HQ, following the success of his book, The Transforming Power of Hospitality in Business (Harper Collins,2006). Last year, AdvantageCare hired HQ to train its entire staff, including doctors, on how to be more empathetic ( see my blog on that subject ). Full-day workshops teach the medical staff how to interact with patients in a friendly manner rather than with curt one word answers to a request. A patient is a guest who can take his or her business elsewhere. This seems to be a novel idea in health,care, but it may be gaining more traction. Similar workshops were given back in 2011 when the Erlanger Health System in Chattanooga hired The Ritz Carlton hotels to give customer service lessons to all 4,500 employees.
While health,care and hospitality today are different businesses, they are the same in that both are about caring for people who come to you for a service. There are still vast differences, however, in how they approach that service. One particularly glaring example comes from a friend of mine who had broken her kneecap falling on black ice last winter. Before her consultation with the doctor at a well-regarded New York hospital, she was sent down the hall to get an X-ray.  Without so much as a "hello and how are you," the technician simply pointed to a low metal slab indicating the woman should lie down there. This metal slab, about a foot off the floor, without handrail or padding was extremely difficult to negotiate without assistance, and impossible when your very painful knee doesn't bend. Sadly, this type of encounter is the norm in many hospitals. In this case, my friend decided to fix the situation herself by questioning the technician about where to put her coat; did he have a pillow and some padding for the "slab," and would he mind helping her get into position. She did this only because she liked the doctor who was treating her and she later told him in no uncertain terms they needed to teach some manners to the technicians.
Imagine if you went into a restaurant and the host without smiling or offering a greeting just pointed to a table, did not ask if you wanted to hang up your coat, and did not assist in seating you. You would never go back. (And that host would be fired.) Even banks, once considered cold and dour institutions, teach their staff how to make small talk with clients. "How is your day going? Is there anything else I can help you with?" And while it is obvious that the bank staff has been coached, people do respond and it makes the time there much more pleasant and the transactions smoother.
A few years ago, The Daily Mail in London surveyed hospital complaints and published their report about the rudest hospitals in the U.K. The list of examples was long and painful.  A nurse yanked the pillow from under the head of a patient who had just died while her family was still around her saying their goodbyes. Another nurse yelled at elderly patients because she assumed all elderly people were hard of hearing. A doctor spoke on his cell phone during a consultation. Verbal abuse and rudeness topped the list and complaints.  When the newspaper asked the National Health Services (NHS) about it, they were told, "Manners are a luxury we can't afford." (The same NHS in a survey of their own found that good bedside manner can shorten hospital stays. More irony!)
I hope more health care systems will follow the lead of AdvantageCare and help all of their employees learn proper bedside manner.
It is fun to imagine some extremes in the other direction, such as being asked about your choice of hospital rooms depending upon size, décor, or the view out the window (which, by the way, is a very important component in patient well-being). Would you like a different color sheet and pillow case for your bed? We also have florals and plaids. How about the blanket, is it warm enough? We can offer you a choice of sleepwear and loungewear from our  extensive collection of gently used outfits left us by past residents. If you are unhappy with your roommate, we can help you choose another with match.com. How are you enjoying that Picasso print on the wall, the woman with several faces? If it upsets you, perhaps we can change it to a still life with flowers.
Now, perhaps if Danny Meyer can exert his influence on the food, hospitals would truly be more hospitable. But that's another story.

Ferguson police chief asks county police to manage protestsBy Robert Samuels October 3 Follow @newsbysamuels
Police arrest several protesters in Ferguson, Mo., late on Oct. 3, 2014. (Robert Samuels/The Washington Post)
Ferguson, Mo., police chief Thomas Jackson ceded responsibility for managing protests in the city to the larger St. Louis County police department on Friday.
A “lack of resources and manpower were the main driving force in Chief Jackson’s request,” according to a county press release. Sgt. Brian Schellman, spokesman for county police, added that Jackson made the request via a phone call to County Police Chief Jon Belmar.
Belmar almost immediately accepted the task, which will include authorizing arrests of protesters and handling their release. With 460 members, the county police department is nearly 10 times the size of the police department in this suburb of 21,000.
Jackson had previously told The Post that the disturbances in Ferguson were unlike anything he had handled in 30 years of policing. His department, he said, was learning as they go.
Since the slaying of Michael Brown, Jackson has not only had to manage policing a city rife with racial tension, but had to deal with a phalanx of media requests. His spokesman, Devin James, did not immediately return a call for comment.
Meanwhile, community leaders in Ferguson have consistently criticized the handling of nightly protests as being arbitrary and unnecessarily aggressive. After a relatively tranquil few days, those questions were resurrected after Ferguson police authorized the arrest of several protest leaders and freelance journalist Mary Moore early Friday morning. The final tally of those arrested, according to state Sen. Maria Chappelle-Nadal, was 14.
The decision to give responsibility to county police apparently stems from meetings this week with the Department of Justice, which is investigating the department for civil rights violations. Aldolphus Pruitt, president of the local NAACP, told The Post that civic leaders argued that the number of police departments in Ferguson had made it impossible to “determine who the hell is in charge.”
“There was a desire expressed to have a more unified company system,” said Pruitt, who cautiously supported the decision. After all, it was county police who had tear-gased people on the street in the early days of protesting. Still, Pruit added “they are a bigger, better-trained and more professional police department. It will hopefully help things improve.”
Meanwhile, activists from a group known as the Millenials continued to tweet about their arrest. Brittany Farrell, 25, posted pictures on Friday evening of those arrested in orange jumpsuits, unable to pay escalating bond costs.
Late Monday night, Farrell and others had linked arms and stood in the middle of the street, daring police to arrest them for “standing up for their constitutional rights.” Police eventually walked away from the protesters that night, and Capt. Ron Johnson of the Missouri Highway Patrol said he respected their rights to peaceful protest.
The group reappeared on a rainy Thursday, after police asked protesters to quiet down and obey an 11 p.m. noise ordinance.
The protesters chanted even louder and began to walk toward the police department parking lot with their hands up. From a distance, a police officer on an intercom commanded them to get back on the sidewalk or risk arrest.
The protesters locked arms again and continued to chant. At least a dozen police officers approached them quickly, and the group began to race back to the nearby sidewalk.
“Get them,” an officer in a brown uniform told others. They arrested the group quickly, pulling apart those who linked arms, yelling charges to them such as “inciting violence” and “failure to obey.”
In the mix was Moore, the journalist, who was recording the action.
“What a remarkable display of making your own rules as you go,” said Patricia Bynes, a Democratic committeewoman of Ferguson Township. “They took the journalist who was doing her job and wasn’t involved.”
Of the nightly protests in Ferguson after the slaying of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, at the hands of a white police officer, Darren Wilson, this rainy night was relatively small and quiet. Protesters had complained that the noise ordinance had been enforced arbitrarily. Some nights police ask then not to drum after 11. But there were no drums on this night and police asked the protesters to stop yelling. They did not comply.

If you love IKEA but can’t stand assembling its furniture, listen up.
The Swedish furniture company recently announced that its new living room line — REGISSÖR — will not only require zero tools to assemble, but according to a promotional video, the furniture can be built "in less than five minutes." This comes as big news from a brand notorious for requiring blood, sweat, tears and hours of your life to put together its furniture.
IKEA touts that the time-saving trick is found in its new special wedge dowels that replace the screws, nuts, bolts and other hardware that would typically come with its furniture.
“By making it even easier to assemble our furniture, we want to give people who may find it challenging a new reason for choosing IKEA,” Janice Simonsen, design spokesperson for IKEA, said in a press release . 
The REGISSÖR line will roll out this month, featuring a bookshelf, cabinets and a coffee table, while the new assembly approach will also be available on the STOCKHOLM sideboard and cabinet. Additional storage units using tool-free assembly are slated for spring 2015.

Women more likely to watch same-sex pornIndo-Asian News Service | Posted: October 6, 2014 10:18 am
Women are more likely to watch same-sex porn videos than heterosexual porn videos, says an interesting study, adding that women watch more porn than men.
The findings revealed that top three categories for female viewers are “lesbian,” “gay (male),” and “teen,” while the top categories for men are “teen,” and “mature”.
“By segmenting by gender within our analytics tools, we were able to generate data that brings us one step closer to answering the time old question: what do women want,” wrote researchers from porn search engine Pornhub.
The study, done along with internet media company Buzzfeed, provides insight into the gender differences when viewing pornography, Latin Times reported.
An earlier study published in the journal Cyberpsychology, Behavior and Social Networking had found that women are just as likely to be addicted to pornography as men.

Hewlett-Packard plans to split in two: report1
“There's still lots of opportunities in other adjacencies, where we don't chase the market leaders,” said Whitman, who will be CEO of HP Enterprise, the business that will sell computer servers and networking gear and data storage to businesses.
Whitman said HP's balance sheet had improved markedly over the past few years, allowing the company to come to the decision to split up from a position of strength.
“This would not have been possible three years ago,” she said, referring to a proposal to spin off PCs in 2011.
Some analysts expressed skepticism about the latest move.
Barclays analysts noted that the sudden announcement in 2011 was disruptive to HP's sales, its sales force and demand.
“If the (latest) decision by HP isn't well communicated or is not well executed, the negative share shifts could be material,” they said in a note.
Analysts at Bernstein Research also warned of “material negative synergies” and one-time costs associated with the spinoff, largely in purchasing but also in distribution. The separation, they said, was fueled by weakness, not strength.
A spinoff of the PC business was last proposed in 2011 by then-Chief Executive Leo Apotheker. HP later ditched the plan - and Apotheker, replacing him with Whitman.
HP said it planned to cut 5,000 more jobs as part of its multi-year restructuring, raising the total under Whitman to 55,000. The company currently has more than 300,000 employees.
The separation will result in a fundamental reshaping of one of technology's most important pioneers, which is on track to generate $112 billion in revenue in the fiscal year this month.
While there were skeptics, many investors and analysts had called for a break-up of HP or a sale of the PC business so that HP could focus on the more profitable side of its operations.
“Shareholders will now be able to invest in the respective asset groups without the fear of cross-subsidies and inefficiencies that invariably plague large business conglomerates,” Ralph Whitworth, former HP chairman and founder of Relational Investors LLC, said in a statement.
Relational owns a 1.49 percent stake in HP.
HP is the latest in a line of companies to spin off operations in an attempt to become more agile and capitalize on faster-growing businesses.
Online auction company eBay Inc, which was formerly run by Whitman, said last week it would spin off electronic payment service PayPal.
“We like the spin and believe it could create additional value over time,” UBS analyst Steven Milunovich, wrote. “In our view, focus is more important than synergies, and it is hard to be good at both consumer and enterprise computing.”
HP's printing and PC business will be led by Dion Weisler, currently an executive in that division. Whitman will be chairman of HP Inc.
Goldman Sachs & Co served as financial adviser to HP. Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz was legal adviser.
 

BG Group is to receive $350m (220m)                             
Egyptian government pays $350 million to BG Group
Following the commitment from the Egyptian government to repay outstanding debts to the energy industry, BG Group plc (LSE: BG.L), a world leader in exploration and LNG, has received a $350 million payment. This reduces the company's domestic receivables balance in Egypt to around $1.2 billion.
 
The payment is the result of the government of Egypt raising funds specifically to help repay debts to the oil and gas sector.
 
While the Group has been impacted by the reduction of LNG exports from Egypt, the company continues to investigate options for increasing the supply of gas and is working with the government on resolving the outstanding receivable balance.
 
 
Notes to Editors:
BG Group operates in Egypt through its wholly-owned subsidiary BG Egypt. The company is one of the largest producers of natural gas in Egypt spanning the gas chain from exploration through development and production to LNG. In 2013, Egypt contributed 18% of Group production.
 
BG Group plc (LSE: BG.L) is a world leader in natural gas, with a broad portfolio of business interests focused on exploration and production and liquefied natural gas. Active in more than 20 countries on five continents, BG Group combines a deep understanding of gas markets with a proven track record in finding and commercialising reserves.

but the nation had been divertingBG announces £300m North Sea deal
Shares in UK oil and gas firm BG Group have plunged almost 15% after it warned continuing problems in Egypt would hit production this year and in 2015.
It expects to produce 590,000-630,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day this year, at least 5% below forecast.
It said Egypt was using more gas for its domestic market than had been agreed, leaving less for export.
It has issued a Force Majeure in the country, a sign to investors of circumstances beyond its control.
'Uncertainty'
"We face short-term issues which are reflected in our revised 2014 guidance. This is very disappointing," BG's chief executive Chris Finlayson said.
BG counts on Egypt for about a fifth of its production.
The firm said there was "continued uncertainty" over the level of future diversions to the Egyptian domestic market.
"BG Group... will continue to negotiate with the Egyptian authorities and other stakeholders to seek a long term solution," it added.
BG also cut its 2015 guidance to between 710,000 and 750,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, lower than the 775,000 to 825,000 target issued in May.
BG also said its guidance had been hit by lower-than-expected gas prices in the US.

London tech firms break record for attracting venture capital funding
Monday 06 October 2014
London-based technology firms are attracting record levels of venture capital investment, as funds from around the world look to capitalise on the growth of companies in London’s booming technology sector, according to new figures released today.
 
A new quarterly barometer measuring venture capital investment into London’s technology companies – published by London & Partners, the Mayor’s promotional company for London – shows that technology firms in the capital have attracted more than $1 billion in investment so far in 2014.¹
 
The $1.021 billion raised by London tech firms during the first three quarters of this year is almost 30% more than the previous full-year record of $719 million raised during 2013. It is also more than ten times the amount raised in full-year 2010, highlighting the success of initiatives aimed at fostering the growth of the capital’s technology cluster, such as Tech City and London Technology Week.
 
The figures also demonstrate the attractiveness of London and London-based technology firms to the international investor community.
 
The Mayor of London Boris Johnson said “These figures show, without any question, that this is an incredible period for technology firms in our city. Tech is blossoming and our reputation for innovation and discovery, allied with outstanding talent, is attracting record breaking levels of investment from around the globe.” 
 
Eileen Burbidge, Partner at Passion Capital, which invests in technology startups, and London technology ambassador, said: “In just four short years the amount of venture capital funding going into London’s technology firms has increased more than ten-fold. That’s an astonishing rate of growth, which is testament to the exciting innovation that’s happening in London.”
 
Venture funding deals in London range from small seed capital investments through to later stage venture deals. As the market grows and matures, companies find it easier to access larger amounts of growth funding. So far this year three companies – takeaway.com, farfetch.com and Funding Circle – have all successfully completed funding rounds in excess of $50 million.
 
The largest deal completed during the third quarter was a $65 million series D funding round by Funding Circle, the peer-to-peer lending network, in a deal led by Index Ventures with participation from existing investors, Accel Partners, Union Square Ventures and Ribbit Capital.
 
Samir Desai, Co-founder and CEO of Funding Circle said: “Since we launched Funding Circle in 2010 we have secured $123 million of venture capital funding in London – starting with our first $1 million seed funding in 2010, right up to our latest $65 million round in July. This support has allowed us to build the world’s leading marketplace for business loans. In the UK, more than 5,500 small businesses have accessed over £370 million, and at the end of 2013 we took our marketplace model to the US, to help fill the small business funding gap which also exists there. The latest round will help us to consolidate our growth even more, and allow us to explore further international markets.”
 
In addition to the venture capital funding received by London companies, London has also seen new VC funds base themselves in London in 2014 to invest in tech opportunities around the world.
 
According to London & Partners, new funds worth than $1.5 billion have set up in the capital during 2014, with companies including Index Ventures, Google, Santander and Balderton Capital creating new London-based investment vehicles.
 
The increase in funding correlates with the growth of technology companies in the capital.  There are currently more than 34,000 digital technology firms in London. That number is expected to rise to 45,000 in the next decade creating 46,000 new jobs and creating more than £12 billion of economic activity, according to recent research by Oxford Economics².

Govt seeks AG s opinion on need for Ordinance on coal blocksGovt seeks AG's opinion on need for Ordinance on coal blocks
Press Trust of India | New Delhi Oct 06, 2014 02:55 PM IST
The Coal Ministry has sought the opinion of Attorney General on whether the government needs to bring out an Ordinance to deal with the issues arising from the Supreme Court decision to de-allocate coal mines.
The issues that need to be resolved by the government in the coal mine case include forfeiting of bank guarantees and title deeds of the land mines purchased by the companies, sources said.
The Coal Ministry, they said, is seeking "advice of Attorney General on the issue of Bank Guarantee forfeited/ imposed on the allocatee companies, the cancellation of mining leases, the right and title of the land purchased by the allocatee companies".
Depending on the advice of the Attorney General of India, they said, the ministry will take a view on the Ordinance so as to deal with the implications of the Supreme Court's order in the coal case.
In a major blow to the corporate sector, the Supreme Court had last month quashed allocation of 214 out of 218 coal blocks alloted to various companies since 1993 terming the method as "fatally flawed" and allowed the Centre to take over operation of 42 such blocks which are functional.
The apex court said the beneficiaries of the illegal process "must suffer" the consequences and refused to show sympathy to private companies which submitted that Rs 2.87 lakh crore have been invested in 157 coal block and Rs 4 lakh crores in end-use plants.
It, however, saved from the "guillotine" four allocations one each to SAIL and NTPC and two blocks to Sasan Power Ltd owned by Anil Ambani's Reliance Power and also gave six months breathing time to rest of them to wind up their operations by March 31, 2015.

Mumbai, Oct.6:  
The global semiconductor revenue is on pace to reach $338 billion in 2014, a 7.2 per cent increase from 2013. This is also a 6.7 per cent rise from the previous quarter's forecast, according to a study by Gartner.
"Semiconductor revenue set an all-time record in the third quarter of 2014, fuelled by a strong electronics build for the holiday season," said Jon Erensen, research director of Gartner.
"Get ready for a flood of new product introductions, ranging from simple low-cost tablets to high-end ultramobiles and smartphones. Demand for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus has been robust, but there is concern for other types of devices planned for the holidays,” Erensen added.
While some products may not sell through during the holiday season, Gartner remains bullish on 2014 consumer demand and forecasts 2014 unit production of smartphones and ultramobiles to increase 27.0 per cent and 18.9 per cent, respectively.
The semiconductor market is expected to grow 5.8 per cent in 2015, with high inventories in the first quarter of 2015 emerging as the largest concern, Gartner said in a statement.

Why 2014 is more about Obama than 2010 wasBy Aaron Blake October 6 Follow @aaronblakewp
From behind a teleprompter, President Obama pauses while speaking at the Global Health Security Agenda Summit at the White House on Sept. 26. (Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)
The Fix Boss writes in his weekly column about how the 2014 election is looking more and more like the 2006 election -- for a whole host of reasons.
Here's the crux:
At the start of the  2006 election season , Republicans controlled 55 seats, buoyed by two consecutive elections — 2002 and 2004 — that had moved seats their way. But their vulnerabilities were significant. Despite defending only 15 seats (to the Democrats’ 17), the GOP had incumbents in Pennsylvania and Rhode Island — two states that President George W. Bush had lost convincingly two years earlier — as well as sitting senators in places such as Missouri and Montana who, through a combination of the competitiveness of their states and their own foibles, were in deep trouble. As the cycle wore on, Sen. George Allen (R-Va.) turned his race ultra-competitive by referring to a  Democratic tracker as a “macaca.”
...
The main factor was the  deep unpopularity of Bush , who sat at 37 percent nationally. That distaste for the head of the Republican Party made Democratic messaging easy: Don’t like President Bush? Send him a message by voting against the person who has voted with him [fill-in-the-blank-but-it’s-a-lot percentage] of the time. Bush stayed largely hidden on the campaign trail, but it didn’t matter.
This is the key point. We like to talk about how the 2010 election was a rebuke of Obama and the 2006 election was a rebuke of President Bush. And 2014 is looking more and more like both of them.
But where 2014 starts to look more like 2006 is when you dig a little deeper and find that it's not just a motivated opposition; it's also about the president's depressed base of support.
Per Gallup polling , in the past three midterms -- 2006, 2010 and 2014 -- a very similar proportion of the opposition party said their vote was in opposition to the president: 57 percent, 57 percent and 58 percent, respectively. Not much difference.
Where 2006 and 2014 are a little different, though, is in the president's base. In 2010, 45 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters said their votes would be in support of the president; in both 2006 and today, that number was below 40 percent for the president's party (39 percent in 2006 and 38 percent in 2014).
So essentially, according to Gallup's numbers, the reason 2014 is looking more like 2006 is not because of the motivated opposition, but because of an unmotivated base of support. Obama at least had a little more of that in 2010; he doesn't have it as much today.
And that's arguably even more troubling for Democrats in 2014 than it was for Republicans in 2006, because Democrats' voter base is much more prone to drop off in midterm elections.
So which was worse for the president's party, 2006 or 2010?
Here's where things get a little confusing. Although Democrats gained six Senate seats and 31 House seats in 2006, Republicans gained six Senate seats and 63 House seats in 2010. So 2010 was better for the opposition party, right?
Well, not quite. The reason the GOP gained so much ground in 2010 was because it began in a really bad spot -- with just 179 of the 435 seats in the House and 41 seats in the Senate. It had a lot more room to grow.
Democrats in 2006 were in a significantly better position from the start (202 House seats and 44 Senate seats), and thus their gains were more hard-won. It was at least as good a year for the opposition party as 2010 was, and probably a better one, despite the seat-gain numbers.
Republicans, of course, won't gain 63 or even 31 House seats on Nov. 4, unless something shocking happens. They just simply have too many seats (i.e. a majority) to start out with.
But that doesn't mean that 2014 won't be just as good for the opposition party. In fact, it's looking quite comparable -- at least as far as the election being about the president.

Hewlett-Packard , a pioneer in business computers, on Monday announced plans to break into two parts as it separates its personal-computer and printer businesses from its technology services.
The company, which has been undergoing a multi-year restructuring, said the PC and printer business will use the name HP Inc. The services business will take the name Hewlett-Packard Enterprise.
HP CEO Meg Whitman will lead the Enterprise business. HP PC and printer chief Dion Weisler will be CEO of HP Inc. Current lead independent director Pat Russo will be chairman of the Enterprise unit, Hewlett-Packard announced.
An HP breakup, which had been under discussion for more than a year, would follow recent corporate splits as companies aim to satisfy shareholders by sharpening their focus. On Tuesday, online-auction giant eBay said it was spinning off its PayPal payments-processing unit.
"The decision to separate into two market-leading companies underscores our commitment to the turnaround plan," Whitman said in the announcement. "It will provide each new company with the independence, focus, financial resources, and flexibility they need to adapt quickly to market and customer dynamics, while generating long-term value for shareholders."
"The major benefit I see in the move is that the enterprise business will have a singular focus on the data center, and the PC and printer business can be a lot speedier and agile," said Patrick Moorhead, president of Moor Insights & Strategy, a tech analyst firm. He said HP will need to ensure its PC and printer business has enough cash to compete in both the consumer PC and emerging smart home markets.
HP, founded 75 years ago in a garage in Palo Alto, Calif., where it's currently based, has been trying to reverse sagging sales as it faces tough competition from Oracle and IBM. In 2012, under Whitman's leadership, it merged its PC business with its more lucrative printer one.
It has also been cutting costs and laying off tens of thousands of employees . And as more computing moves to mobile devices, Whitman has tried to steer HP's business into the growing demand for cloud-computing systems.
In August, HP reported good news: a sales uptick. It said a resurgence in PC shipments helped boost its year-over-year revenue 1% to $27.6 billion. Its Personal Systems group, which includes PCs and notebooks, grew 12% in that time.
Desktops accounted for about 40% revenue of HP revenue as consumers seek out larger computer screens for more more sophisticated tasks they cannot do on tablets.
In the last year, HP also held talks to merge with data-storage giant EMC Corp., but the Journal said those negotiations recently ended because of lack of shareholder support.

Homeland crowns Carrie Mathison Drone QueenClaire Danes as Carrie Mathison in “Homeland.” (Joe Alblas/Showtime)
This post discusses the plot of the Oct. 5 episode of “Homeland.”
When Carrie Mathison’s (Claire Danes) co-workers in Afghanistan present her with a birthday cake, she notices that below the blazing candles is a new title for her: “The Drone Queen.” It would be an uneasy sobriquet under any circumstances: We first met Carrie three years ago when she was investigating Sgt. Nicholas Brody (Damian Lewis), an American soldier and prisoner of war who dedicated himself to terrorism after a young boy he’d come to know in captivity was killed in a drone strike. And there is something particularly uneasy about watching Carrie, who used to do her best work on the ground at personal risk to herself, call in strikes from the the sterile chill of an operations center.
“We had an unbelievably rigorous first three months of this season because it is like a pilot,” Meredith Stiehm, an executive producer on “Homeland,” said in August, talking about the show’s reboot in the wake of Brody’s death last season. “We went to this week in Washington talking to these CIA people and asked State Department people, asking them, ‘What’s on your mind?’ And then we debated all five to seven of those countries for quite some time. So it did feel like the process you go through when you’re creating a new show.”
But even though “Homeland” is focused on Pakistan this year, the show feels more like a reset than a whole new program. Drones are still its main concern. It is just the way into the subject that is different.
In its initial iteration, “Homeland” focused on the impact of drone strikes by emphasizing how a Westerner — if one who had converted to Islam and spent years living with the Osama bin Laden-like Abu Nazir (Navid Negahban) — was radicalized by America’s use of the weapons. This time, the show is coming in from a number of new angles.
First, there is Ayaan Ibrahim (Suraj Sharma), a young man who survives a strike that Carrie calls in. The hit was  supposed to take out just the No. 4 figure on the American kill list, but the weapon ended up detonating in the middle of a wedding. Ayaan is the only person pulled out of the rubble, and the look he aims at the cameras in the sky after identifying the bodies of his families is poisonous and grief-stricken.
“Homeland” has been talking for years about how collateral damage from drone strikes can produce new enemies for America. Ayaan’s performance for the cameras is unnerving to Carrie and her colleagues because it is clear he knew to look for them. The American drone teams are no longer anonymous figures raining death down on unsuspecting targets.
Pakistani citizens may not have the technology to shoot drones out of the skies, but they can make clear to drone operators that they know who they are and what they are doing. And they can visit their own kind of horror back on casualty-averse Americans, as they do when Sandy (Corey Stoll), the station chief in Islamabad, has his cover blown. The scene of him being cornered on a street, then dragged from Carrie and Quinn’s (Rupert Friend) car, is among the most effective and unnerving action sequences “Homeland” has ever put on-screen.
The cumulative impact of drone strikes and targeted killing grinds away at American personnel, too, as becomes clear in a young pilot’s tense confrontation with Carrie in a bar.
“You know me as Smash 12. I flew the mission into Pakistan the other night,” the man tells Carrie, before demanding to know how she deals with making calls that lead men like him to kill innocent civilians, as with the guests at the wedding. “Do you ever feel that? Sick to your stomach? … I killed 4 Canadian soldiers in January on bad orders. Dropped a 200-pound bomb on their heads. Monsters. F—— monsters. All of you.”
“It’s a job,” Carrie tells Quinn, who is clearly distressed by the prospect of “checking names off a kill list for a living.” They both know that what they are doing is not just a job. The new “Homeland” is not that new, and it has a major trust deficit to pay off. But it can still be unsettling when it asks whether jobs like this one should even be done at all.
[Correction: The initial version of this post suggested that Ayaan's family had been killed by a drone. In fact, it was a targeted strike. Carrie is responsible for calling in both kinds of operations. The post has been updated to reflect the difference.]

The real reason why Indias shopping websites are at each others throats this weekExplosive Growth
October 6, 2014
The fireworks began much before the festival, when India’s e-commerce giants rolled out glittering advertising campaigns, reportedly spending some Rs200 crore, last month.
That’s a small indicator of the big prize that India’s shopping websites including Flipkart, Snapdeal and Amazon are fighting for—the massive bump in sales in the festive season surrounding Diwali (October 23). Without dominating this season, no website can hope to lead the all-out war this sector has come to resemble. For smaller sites, this month alone can account for a third of their annual sales. And with every passing year, the size of Diwali sales is rising.
But what makes this online contest exceptional is that the entire e-commerce sector in India, too, is coming off an exceptional year. There’s been a massive capital influx, strong growth in the user base and a steady uptick in adoption of online shopping, partly a result of improved economic sentiment since a new government took over in New Delhi.
“We have grown more than 600% in the last year or so,” said Sandeep Komaravelly, senior vice-president for marketing at Snapdeal.com, which has 20 million registered users and reaches over 4,000 towns and cities in India.
“Given the increase in the scale of our operations, we are expecting a 100% jump from the sales we had last year during the festive season,” Komaravelly added.
The company has already seen the results of their marketing efforts early on in the festive season. Between 3rd and 5 October, Snapdeal registered a 100% jump in sales and sold a smartphone every six seconds, a laptop every 20 seconds and a tablet every 30 seconds. A saree was sold every 30 seconds and a pair of shoes every 10 seconds.
“We expect it to be the biggest Diwali we have seen so far,” Komaravelly said.
Flipkart, the other homegrown e-commerce giant, seems to have similar expectations with its ‘Big Billion Day’ campaign—purportedly India’s biggest sale (currently underway, not entirely glitch-free ), with deep discounts and offers across 70 categories. “A large chunk of the annual business happens in the time between Dussehra and Diwali,” said Shoumyan Biswas, head of offline marketing at Flipkart.
But this time, the festive season could be so big that Flipkart, which has 22 million registered users,  reportedly  doubled its delivery staff over the last few months.
Some of this expansion may well have been coming. The e-commerce market has attracted huge investment in the last year. In July, Flipkart raised $1 billion , the biggest round of funding in any Indian startup and one of the largest amounts raised in a single round worldwide. Within a day of Flipkart’s funding announcement, Seattle-headquartered global e-commerce major Amazon said it would invest $2 billion in its Indian operations.
Snapdeal, after raising $233.7 million this year, may also be looking for more money. Tata Group’s chairman emeritus Ratan Tat a and Wipro chairman Azim Premji  are investors in the firm.
E-commerce players have scaled operations and expanded teams, with the fresh rounds of funding. “In the last couple of months particularly online retailers have gotten a lot of visibility with their fundraising rounds and partnerships,” said Devangshu Dutta of Third Eyesight, a consulting firm focused on the retail and consumer products industry.
“Compared to previous years, a lot of money has been spent on driving traffic and they have gotten a lot of press. The companies have improved their service and delivery infrastructure as well.”  There is also a shift in the consumer mindset now. Shopping online is more than just experimentation for customers, he added.

It’s not just the sheer numbers of online shoppers that go up around the festivals. The typical basket size also increases. “Customers spend around Rs1,000 on the website at other times, during Diwali the average goes up to Rs1,500 on our website,” said Sanjay Sethi, CEO and founder of Shopclues, which registered over Rs350 crore ($56.8 million) in online sales last year. “We expect a 40-50% increase in sales this festive season.”
And as India’s online marketplace matures, it’s not just discounts on electronics and fashion—typically the most popular e-commerce segments—that attract consumers. BullionIndia.in, for instance, a startup that allows customers to buy gold and silver online at wholesale price, is offering a discount around Dhanteras, an auspicious day preceding Diwali when Hindus purchase precious metals.
“While customers are buying other products online, buying gold and silver online hasn’t caught on as much. But we are offering discounts at this time and that has impacted our sales positively,” said Sachin Kothari, director, BullionIndia.

Restoring lost heritage: Capitol Complex to be revamped  CBRI Roorkee roped in forhelpThe Vidhan Sabha as a part of the Capitol Complex in Chandigarh. (Source: Express photo)
Written by Khushboo Sandhu | Chandigarh | Posted: October 6, 2014 5:00 pm | Updated: October 6, 2014 5:04 pm
Considered to be an uneconomical project that earned much criticism from politicians when it was being constructed, the Capitol Complex in Sector 1 has brought the city to the world heritage map. For its creator Le Corbusier, it was a project he was convinced should be set up in the newly created city that was a product of the vision of the then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru.
Nehru laid the founding principles of the new city when he said, “Let this be a new town, symbolic of freedom of India unfettered by the traditions of the past… an expressions of the nation’s faith in the future”. The city that was envisioned just after partition was to serve as the new capital of erstwhile Punjab.
It was a unique design with which the city  was created. The Capitol Complex was the head of the city, the seat of power. The plaza was to be its heart, green spaces its lungs and industrial area to be the viscera.
The recent approval of the Ministry of Home Affairs for Capitol Complex to be a part of the transnational dossier of six countries for according the UNESCO heritage status is likely to get more recognition for this renowned creation.
The Complex
The Capitol Complex comprises three buildings – Secretariat, Assembly and the High Court. The fourth building planned by Corbusier was the Governor’s Palace which has not been built till now. Apart from the buildings, six monuments had been planned. Of these two, including the Geometric Hill and the Martyrs’ Memorial, have been completed only partially.
Senior architect S D Sharma says, “The High Court was the first to be inaugurated in 1953 followed by the Secretariat and the Assembly. Some politicians at that time felt that too much money is being spent on it. However, Corbusier was convinced of what he was doing and was adamant.”
Sharma adds, “The Capitol Complex is a profound expression of Corbusier’s genius.  Versatile use of concrete has been made. At present, the buildings are being tinkered around with which needs to be stopped. There is a need to preserve these buildings.”
Corbusier had proposed a design of a 25-storeyed building for the Secretariat. However, with the lack of resources and technology at that time, a decision was made to reduce the height. The Secretariat now comprises six eight-storeyed blocks.
Meanwhile, the proposal for Governor’s Palace is hanging fire even six decades after the project was envisioned. Several proposals have been mooted over the years. It was decided that instead of the Governor’s Palace, Museum of Knowledge would be made. However, even this has to see the light of day.

Australia  Pakistan turn focus to spin forODIsPakistan's batting too will be tested after their miserable show on the Sri Lankan tour (Source: AP)
Agence-France Presse | Sharjah | Posted: October 6, 2014 4:56 pm | Updated: October 6, 2014 5:32 pm
Pakistan and Australia will focus on spin when they start a three-match one-day series in Sharjah on Tuesday, despite the absence of top bowler Saeed Ajmal, who is suspended over his suspect bowling action .
Pakistan have been hard pressed to compensate for the missing Ajmal, who has single-handedly won them matches in all three formats of the game in the last five years.
He was reported for a suspect bowling action on Pakistan’s August tour of Sri Lanka and was subsequently banned from international cricket after a bio-mechanic analysis found his action illegal.
Skipper Misbah-ul Haq stressed Pakistan must move on.
“It’s really difficult to fill Ajmal’s gap because he has been the number one or two bowler in the one-day rankings, but if Ajmal is not there we must try to fill his gap and move forward,” said Misbah on Monday.
Pakistan have two left-arm spinners in the squad in Raza Hasan, who took 2-17 in Pakistan’s six wicket defeat in the lone Twenty20 in Dubai on Sunday, and the experienced Zulfiqar Babar.
Pakistan will also miss allrounder Mohammad Hafeez, who injured his hand on Saturday and will miss the limited over series.
But Misbah conceded that Pakistan will have to put runs on the board after being restricted to 96-9 in the Twenty20 match, with Australian spinners Glenn Maxwell (3-13) and Cameron Boyce (2-10) causing trouble.
“I think the Australian batsmen have improved against spin by playing in the Indian league. If it’s spinning and the bowler puts it in the right areas, then its difficult for everyone, its tough and at the same time you have to bat well against their spinners,” said Misbah.
Pakistan’s batting will again be tested after their miserable show on the Sri Lankan tour where they lost the one-day series 2-1 and the Tests 2-0.
Australia also are without their regular captain Michael Clarke who is facing a race against time to get fit from a hamstring injury for the two Tests which follow the one-dayers.
Also out are allrounders Shane Watson (ankle) and Mitchell Marsh (hamstring).
Skipper George Bailey said Pakistan will be tough even without Ajmal.
“There’s no doubt he’s been very important to Pakistan,” said Bailey of Ajmal.
“But Pakistan will be trying to prove they don’t rely too much on him and it will pose different challenges (for us).”
Bailey accepted it will be a challenge to counter the spin.
“I still think teams are doctoring their wickets when we come and play to produce very large spinning wickets, which says to me that teams still think that we’re vulnerable against spin,” Bailey said.
“The challenge for us is to become good against spin.”
Pakistan have not beaten Australia in a one-day series since winning 2-1 Down Under in 2002. Since then Australia have won three in a row in 2009 (UAE), 2010 (Australia) and 2012 (UAE).
I think the Australian batsmen have improved against spin by playing in the Indian league

Should one use bonuses to repay loan or invest in equityLike this story, share it with millions of investors on M3
Should one use bonuses to repay loan or invest in equity?
Recently in an interview, an expert recommended that the Diwali bonus should be invested in equity instead of repaying the home loan.
Post your opinion here
 
Amit Trivedi
Recently in an interview, an expert recommended that the Diwali bonus should be invested in equity instead of repaying the home loan. His logic was very simple: on the home loan EMIs, one gets dual tax advantages whereas equity looks poised for a multi-year bull market.
As anyone can understand, and that seems to be the argument of this expert that as long as your cost of borrowing (the interest paid on loan) is lower than the expected return on investment, borrowing money to invest is a brilliant idea. Evidence suggests that if you were looking for safe (or guaranteed) returns, you would have to settle for return on investment that is lower than your cost of borrowing. Take a look at the rate at which a bank gives loans and compare the same with the interest the same bank offers on fixed deposits. On the other hand, higher returns would not come with safety. Some amount of risk must be taken – this risk may result into negative returns – may be temporary or permanent.
Coming back to the expert’s advice, can such a generalized advice be applicable to all?
Let us look at certain scenarios.
First of all, let us start with a secular bull market – a multi-year bull market. The last time we saw one in 2003 to 2008. Sensex closed on 25th April, 2003 at 2,924.03 points to go up to 20,873.33 (day’s closing value) on 8th January, 2008. What a rise! More than 7 times in less than 5 years! If one is looking for an example of a multi-year bull run, this was it.
Was it really a smooth journey? The graph above looks quite a smooth upside movement. However, if we look at the first 14 months, the picture looks different.
And now compare the graph with the present times. Currently, Sensex is around 50% up from last year’s low point. If we take a similar number for the above, it would be Sensex level of 4,500. This level was achieved in October-2003. If someone entered at that time, by June-2004, one was back to the investment value.
This would have been a period of extreme stress for someone who chose not to repay the home loan and invested in equity markets. One must also remember that this was a time when the interest rates were rising, which is different from the current times – at least the rates are not increasing now.  
Then again, there was an almost 30% drop in May-June-2006.
It is in such times that the investor’s individual situation must be considered. What if the investor has enough to survive through this period? What if he doesn’t have enough?
In the absence of such a provision, the investor runs the risk of taking money out of equities if an emergency need arises. With a home loan outstanding, and EMIs to pay, it becomes even more important to stay clear from volatility.
While equity may be a good vehicle for wealth creation over a long period, it is essential that one have the ability to stay for that long period. A debt burden reduces one’s ability to stay put. History of financial markets suggests that at the heart of every financial crisis lies too much debt. This can happen in personal finances, too.
It is important to understand one’s own financial situation and not pay heed to a generalized advice. While running may be a good exercise, it may be harmful to an obese person. Personal finance is “personal”. There are different solutions for different situations.
Second, the expert appeared too confident of knowing the future. This is a different problem altogether. Financial markets are not as simple as one thinks. Very often, the markets move exactly against the popular view. This risk cannot be ruled out. At the leak of market rally in 2008, hardly anyone predicted the downfall. At the same time, at the bottom of the market in March-2009 or even last year, who thought of a bull run?
While you may listen to the experts’ viewpoints, the final decision cannot be outsourced, since the consequences of the decision cannot be outsourced.

Top 10 financial tips to get ahead in life
No matter how much or how little you're paid, you'll never get ahead if you spend more than you earn. It's easier to spend less than to earn more and thrifty efforts in a number of areas can result in big savings.
Post your opinion here
V Viswanand
Max Life Insurance
Although making resolutions to improve your financial situation is a good thing to do at any time of year, it is better if you do it at the beginning of a new financial year. However, regardless of when you begin, the basics remain the same. Here are the top ten keys to getting ahead financially.
1. Get paid what you're worth and spend less than you earn
It sounds simple, but many people struggle with this rule of thumb. Make sure you know what your job is worth, by evaluating your skills, productivity, job tasks, contribution to the company, and the going rate, both inside and outside the company, for what you do. Being underpaid even a thousand rupees a year can have a significant cumulative effect over the course of your working life.
On the other hand, no matter how much or how little you're paid, you'll never get ahead if you spend more than you earn. It's easier to spend less than to earn more and   thrifty efforts in a number of areas can result in big savings.
2. Stick to a budget
Staying within your budget means forced savings. How can you set spending and saving goals if you don't know where your money is going?  An individual with a budget in place has more control over finances; he is in a better position to handle his cash flow to pay immediate dues and also make provisions for other goals. From your income, if you first save money, then spend on non discretionary necessities and finally indulge in discretionary expenses. You will have no trouble meeting your financial needs even with small sums. This practice, if developed early, can make you wealthy.
3. Pay off credit card debt
Credit card debt is the number one obstacle to getting ahead financially. You can save some additional cash every month just by paying your bills, particularly credit card dues, on time. Reducing credit card debt will add to your monthly expenses, but will eventually give you more money to work with each month.
4. Contribute to a Retirement Plan
When it comes to retirement planning, it is never too early to start; the earlier you start and remain invested, your savings will have more time and potential to grow. Any delay in retirement planning can have a major impact on your retirement corpus. One of the best ways to grow your retirement savings is to make a plan for regular contributions towards a retirement plan. For instance, retirement specific life insurance plans let you plan in a Safe, Secure and Self Completing manner. They also bring in the much required discipline. 
5. Idle savings is the devils workshop
Do not let your income remain idle in savings accounts. As a matter of fact, money stacked away in savings bank account only depletes over a period of time since interest amounts provided by banks never seem to match up with inflation rates. Additionally, interest on savings bank amounts are also taxable.
6. Reduce lag time
There may be times when you are between investment cycles. Between maturity of one instrument and re-investment into another try to reduce if not eliminate time gap. Do your own research on investment instruments. Do not blindly rely on intermediaries.
7. Plan for emergencies / Set up a contingency fund
A contingency fund is a pool of money usually invested in liquid investments from where money can be quickly converted into cash. Keeping some money in reserve for financial emergencies is a sound practice. The general rule for emergency savings is to have enough funds to repay today’s bills plus living expenses for 3 to 6 months.
8. Review your insurance coverage
Buying a term policy makes immense sense to protect your dependents and your income in the case of untimely death or disability. However, purchasing life insurance is not just a ‘fill it, shut it, forget it’ lesson. It requires a periodic review, preferably once a year like most other long term financial instruments.
9. Update your will
If you have dependents, you need to register a will no matter how little or how much you own.  It is also important to update the will since it ensures that your possessions will be properly divided among your loved ones.
10. Keep good records
If you don't keep good records, you're probably not claiming all permissible income tax deductions and credits. Set up a system now and use it through the year. It's much easier than scrambling to find everything when it is time to pay taxes and missing items that may have saved you money.

My old post, when some one said lloyd is trading cheap because of its oem status;
"Some say this is because Lloyd is oem player. But key is not ancillary or manufacturing here. Even ancillary companies command good valuations. See Amarraja batteries, Exide batteries (A commodity sort of players commanding 20 times earnings with no major technology involved), Motherson sumi(this also another ancillary commanding 25 multiples), wabco india etc. Forget all these companies, even Lloyd was commanding good multiples during the years 2006-2008, when it was trading around 200 with earnings of less than 10, sales of around 350cr. Offcourse they were selling then, while they are buying now. It was 35%(sep 10) and now 49%(sep13). They used the market conditions and are increasing the stake at cheap rates. They may go for another 5 or 10% hike by jun 15"

Big issue of Wanbury is the still pending  winding up petition filed by Hutton Group  .This company need to shell out $2.1 million and interest  for repayment in 2015.How this loss making company can pay back this amount by next year is a question mark.Since the conversion price is more than 3 times of the current market price no chance for conversion of these bonds .
Earlier bond holders filed one winding up petition and the news below.
Hutton Group Files Winding-up Petitions against 2 Cos
------------------------------------------------
British Virgin Islands-based finance company Hutton Group has filed winding-up petitions against drug maker Wanbury and export house Faze Three for non-payment of bond dues,according to people familiar with the matter.Wanbury and Faze Three had raised 2.7 million and $2.14 million,respectively,from HGL through the issue of foreign currency convertible bonds (FCCBs).However,both companies failed to redeem the bonds,forcing Hutton to file the petitions in the Bombay High Court.According to the petitions,which were reviewed by ET,Wanburys bond matured on April 2012 while Faze Threes expired in October 2011.Both companies did not respond to ETs emailed query on the development.On Friday,Wanbury reached a settlement with bondholders while Faze Three,which exports textile to multinational retailers Wal-Mart,Sears and JC Penny,referred to BIFR.Wanbury has agreed to pay the face value of the bond along with 10% premium and 6% interest.The company will pay the dues in installments within four years.The offshore lender is being represented by Nishit Dhruva of MDP & Partners.Wanbury is the second pharmaceutical firm after Wockhardt to default on its FCCB dues.Earlier this year,Chennai-based Orchid Chemicals had to sell its key business to Hospira to pay off foreign dues worth $167

Generally in an acquisition the cost of funds depends upon the debt eq...This is the info i got.
Annual Revenue Estimate
Employees
20 to 49
So expected turnover is between Rs. 15 to Rs. 30 crores.If you take a EV/Sales of around 2x the deal price should be between 30 crores to 50 crores. Assuming a 25 crore turnover with a 20 percent net margin (which will come gradually) it would mean an incremental profits of Rs. 3 - Rs. 6 crores annually or an EPS increment of Rs. 2 or Rs. 3. So I am betting that this acquisition will be part financed by cash and debt to make the deal financial prudent (Debt is much cheaper for a company with ROE of 50 percent). So expect a price increase of Rs. 40 to Rs. 60. So I am betting that the price will stabilise at around Rs. 650 now in the short term.
In the long term this company seems to be very strong in specific areas in the high school sector so a lot of synergies.

space programme
Starting from the very first home built Aryabhata satellite, launched from Russia in April 1975, we have come a long way
Mangalyaan, formally known as the Mars Orbiter Mission or MOM, is an absolutely glorious success, accomplished with clockwork precision. Prior to this was Chandrayaan, where our spacecraft circumnavigated the moon and the instruments that were put in it detected, among other things, traces of water in our moon.
These are two success stories that have made India sit on the high table of technologically advanced nations. Starting from the very first home built Aryabhata satellite, launched from the Volgograd launch station in Russia in April 1975, we have come a long way, and during these 40 years, we have launched over 50 such spacecrafts. Of these, over 35 satellites were launched by us from India for other countries including France, Germany, Canada, Israel and Singapore. As Dr Ajay Lele of the Institute for Defence Studies and Analysis, Delhi, points out, success of MOM will boost such commercial ventures for our Indian Space Research Organization or ISRO. And within India, ISRO has offered contracts to private and public sector companies, big and small, for its specific needs, thus promoting local technology development and employment opportunities.
When Doubting Thomases both from within and outside India talked about the needs and the costs involved in such space efforts, ISRO has been able to respond with each one of its satellites and their uses, not only to the hi-tech watchers, but how these have been used for helping the Aam Admi through remote sensing to weather forecasts, agricultural and fisheries production analysis, and to the school and college children through its distance education programmes through EduSat. Capacity building, and self reliance in high technologies have grown through such ISRO programmes, not just in defence and communications but also in everyday life — thus becoming a space technology-capable country.
There is another angle to this — advancing science and technology and engaging and enticing youngsters in schools and colleges and their parents, and promoting their career options. Recall that ISRO and the Space Commission have started doing this by broadcasting the inserting of the spacecraft into the orbit of Mars using Edusat TV. They have also started the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology at Valiamala, near Thiruvananthapuram, equipping undergraduate and postgraduate students in space education and research, along the lines of the IITs and IISERs.
This is also an appropriate moment for ISRO to organise regular sessions in schools across the country. These should be informal, in all languages, explaining how every aspect of space launch is an application of the law of sciences. Having parents present in such lecture- demonstrations would be valuable, since they too would like to know and to send their children to careers in science and technology.
Such lectures should be in everyday language, given by all, including the big bosses of ISRO and Space Commission, give away models, tools and kits, freebies like T-shirts, and offer field trips and to launch pads. They should start at the middle/ high school level and explain simple concepts such as 1) why do spacecraft and even planets take not a circular but elliptical path? Note Kepler in 1571 discovered this and how Newton’s laws explain this, 2) why did our Polar satellite Launch vehicle (PSLV) make Mangalyaan go around the earth for three weeks before it was allowed to escape the earth? Could we not have made and used a better launch vehicle? 3) Why was Chandrayaan looking for water in the moon and Mangalyaan for methane? 4) How does one detect these from space without taking samples from the moon or Mars, as students do by handling samples in science classes? Note how the French astronomer camped near Guntur on a total solar eclipse day (August 18, 1868) discovered helium gas in our sun, sitting and watching and analysing the light rays coming from the eclipsed sun.
These are simple questions and answers for secondary school children. As such sessions and interactions grow, more complex ideas can be discussed and answered, with students from higher classes, colleges and technology institutes.
MOM has shown us “yes, we can”. And fresh on its success, the time is ripe. After all, every mom teaches her children and cares for their future, assisting them in every way. So why should ISRO’s MOM not do so for all children across India?
Finally, Weekend Business Standard of September 27 reports on the offer made by Mr Leland Melsin of “Spaceship Earth Grants” (or SEG) of California, USA, who operates a privately operated sub-orbital spacecraft.
He wants people to apply for a spaceflight by writing a short summary of how they will use the experience to better themselves, their community or our planet. This should be followed by a 90 second video. SEG will award one spaceflight for every 50,000 applicants. So, hurry before the deadline date of December 31, by accessing www.spaceshipearthgrants.com.
Good Luck !!

Fox News Freaks Out Over Obama Digreddit
The folks over at Fox News were shocked—shocked!—to hear President Obama taking a dig at them on Thursday.
The full joke went, "While good, affordable health care might seem like a fanged threat to the freedom of the American people on Fox News, it’s working pretty well in the real world."
Granted, Obama takes digs at Fox News all the time , but no matter: multiple shows took the time to hit back at the president.
There was Greta Van Susteren, who opined that Obama was not acting "presidential" and needed to be "tougher" and stop blaming Fox News for his problems.
On Bill O'Reilly's show, Laura Ingraham fumed that Obama was employing a "classic Alinskyite tactic" because "liberalism, Obama-style, is failing."
"The Five" was also ticked off. "He bashes FNC more than ISIS, and we don't behead anybody!" Greg Gutfeld said .

Banks are struggling with cybersecurity. That doesnt bode well for other industries.By Andrea Peterson October 3 Follow @kansasalps
(Andrew Burton/Getty Images)
Banks are supposed to be among the most secure places on earth, guarded against physical attacks and cyber intrusions by extensive security measures.
But after JPMorgan Chase, the country's largest bank, said this week that more than 80 million customers were affected by a breach of its computer system, security experts warn that Wall Street remains vulnerable to cyberattacks and other industries may be even worse off. The JPMorgan attack affected significantly more people than many experts initially expected, making it one of the largest breaches of a financial institution in recent history.
"As you'd expect, banks face a lot of scrutiny in terms of regulation -- and they do spend a lot of money on security," says Ben Johnson, an expert at cybersecurity firm Bit9+CarbonBlack.
"Credit cards and retailers are obviously one huge target right now," he said, "but banks have all sorts of financial and personal information" that make them attractive to hackers.
JPMorgan said that  76 million households and 7 million small businesses were affected by the cyberattack, which was first reported in August. There was no indication that hackers were able to take customers account information, including PINs or Social Security numbers, the company said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday. However, hackers did get their hands on  customer names, addresses, phone numbers and e-mail addresses  -- plus internal bank information “relating to such user,” according to the filing.
There have been a series of huge breaches over the past year, mostly thanks to attacks on major retailers in which malware has been used to compromise their payment system. Last year, Target said data about up to 110 million of its customers had been compromised in a cyberattack. Last month, Home Depot said a  breach  at its U.S. and Canadian stores over a six-month period may have put an estimated 56 million payment cards at risk.
But banks typically hold more sensitive information about customers than retailers and can sometimes face technical challenges to keeping their information safe, security experts say.
"Many banks have been around a long time, and thus have older systems," says Johnson. "There's also a lot of mergers and acquisitions that can bring in different systems which can be a huge challenge from an information security standpoint."
Banks also must fend off not only cybercriminals interested in making money by selling consumers information, but also more advanced actors who might wish to disrupt financial industries or conduct economic espionage.
Hackers infiltrated JPMorgan in June and then made several additional attempts to collect more data before the bank discovered the breach, The Washington Post has reported.
While the details are starting to emerge about JPMorgan breach, they don't appear to be the only ones in trouble. As the news about JPMorgan was starting to break in late August, the FBI released statement saying they were working with the Secret Service to determine the scope of cyberattacks reported against "several American financial institutions."
In July, Bloomberg News reported a financial industry group, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, had called for a cyberwar council to fight such attacks and hired former National Security Agency director Gen. Keith B. Alexander, retired, to assist them on cybersecurity. In April, JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon told shareholders the company faced a " likely never-ending battle" to stay ahead of "increasingly complex and more dangerous" cyberattacks, Bloomberg said.
Even with all of its challenges and setbacks, Johnson says the financial industry is one of the best prepared to weather cyberattacks -- and its apparent recent failures is a bad sign for other industries.
"We are not winning the war, as a society," he says.

The whole truth about whole milkBy Roberto A. Ferdman October 3 Follow @robferdman
Milk labels are confusing. (Simon Dawson/Bloomberg News)
Whole milk isn't made wholly of fat, or largely of fat, or even substantially of fat. In fact, it doesn't contain much fat all.
Whole milk is actually only about 3.5 percent fat.
The reason it's called "whole milk" has less to do with its fat content, than the fact that it's comparatively unadulterated. As the Dairy Council of California puts it , whole milk is "the way it comes from the cow before processing."
While that's not entirely true, it does capture the gist of the justification. Whole milk is whole because it is — for lack of a better word — intact. "2 percent," "1 percent," and "nonfat milk" are not intact, because they've been stripped of some of their dairy fat, which makes them less creamy (and caloric).
The Food and Drug Administration allows milk sellers to call different varieties of milk by a range of names. Whole milk is, for instance, also allowed to be called, simply, "milk."
Still, milk sellers have largely preferred to call and advertise milk as "whole milk," for unclear reasons.
Which is all fine and well. Except it isn't, because it's confusing.
Calling whole milk, "whole milk" conjures up rivers of cream. Whole milk doesn't come with that much extra fat. It has less than twice the amount of fat that 2 percent milk has, which isn't much to begin with -- less than 5 grams per cup. It's not even that much more caloric; it only has about 30 calories more per cup than 2 percent milk.
If the milk man is going to call reduced-fat milk "2 percent milk" and low fat milk "1 percent milk," he probably should call whole milk by its fat content — 3.5 percent — and not its relativistic name.
For that very reason, many grocers have mandated that skim milk labels include the word "nonfat." Otherwise, it might be time to consider switching 2 percent milk to "half milk," 1 percent milk to "a little-less-than-a-third milk," and nonfat milk to "zero milk."
Alas, poor whole milk has been reeling for decades. America's long-held anti-fat health narrative has left the country's marginally fatter milk to contemplate its doom. Whole milk sales fell below 14 billion pounds last year, a more than 61 percent drop since 1975, when they topped 36 billion pounds, according to data from the USDA. Over that same period, 2 percent milk sales have more than doubled, and 1 percent and nonfat milk sales have nearly tripled.
Americans have been drinking less milk , in general, for quite some time. But it wouldn't surprise me if whole milk's precipitous fall has, at least in part, come as a result of its misleading name.

Marriott Illegally Blocked People s Internet Access And Charged Them Insteadreddit
Hotels, beware: Blocking guests' access to Wi-Fi in order to force them to pay for your own costly Internet service is not a very nice thing to do. And, it turns out, it's not legal either.
The Federal Communications Commission announced Friday that it was fining Marriott International $600,000 for unlawfully blocking customers' Wi-Fi access in a conference room at the Gaylord Opryland Hotel in Nashville, which is operated by the company.
According to a statement from the FCC, Marriott workers were using "Wi-Fi blocking technology" called jammers to prevent people at the hotel from using the Internet via their own personal Wi-Fi networks they established with smartphones or mobile Wi-Fi devices. Meanwhile, the hotel was charging $250 to $1,000 per device to connect to its wireless network in its conference facility.
"It is unacceptable for any hotel to intentionally disable personal hotspots while also charging customers and small businesses high fees to use the hotel's own Wi-Fi network," said FCC Enforcement Bureau Chief Travis LeBlanc in a statement. "This practice puts customers in the untenable position of either paying twice for the same service or forgoing Internet access altogether."
How does a hotel block Wi-Fi in the first place? The FCC defines Wi-Fi jammers as "illegal radio frequency transmitters that are designed to block, jam, or otherwise interfere with authorized radio communications." Marriott was using these jammers to block people's personal Wi-Fi hotspots.
Though the FCC is telling Marriott to stop the Wi-Fi blocking, the hotel chain maintains that what it was doing wasn't illegal.
"Like many other institutions and companies in a wide variety of industries, including hospitals and universities, the Gaylord Opryland protected its Wi-Fi network by using FCC-authorized equipment provided by well-known, reputable manufacturers," a Marriott spokesperson said in a statement emailed to The Huffington Post. "We believe that the Opryland's actions were lawful."

Hey  didnt you tell me that the Pirates would win the World Series Yes  but I didnt say when.By Andrew Gelman October 4 Follow @statmodeling
In a post entitled, “Failed Prophecy and Sunk Costs,” sociologist Jay Livingston discusses the evasive answers given by several economists who, four years ago, warned that high inflation was coming and then recently reaffirmed their beliefs; “Fed Critics Say ’10 Letter Warning Inflation Still Right,” in the words of the headline of the Bloomberg News article by Caleb Melby, Laura Marcinek and Danielle Burger.
Of all the quotes, my favorite is from John Taylor, professor of economics at Stanford University, who said that “the risk of inflation” has happened.
Not actual inflation, though, as Livingston points out:
Many of the statements seem completely reasonable, for example Taylor also writes, “This is the slowest recovery we’ve ever had. Working-age employment is lower now than at the end of the recession.”
These economists have a good case to make, but what’s frustrating to me is that they can’t admit they were wrong on any little bit. Why not, for example, say that they still think the economy is weak and that they still think it would’ve performed better if high-income taxes had been cut and if the Fed had performed less intervention in the economy, while still admitting they were wrong about “currency debasement and inflation”?
Livingston understands this behavior in terms of incentives:
I [Livingston] don’t know why I assume that high-level economists would be more likely than some ordinary people to change their ideas to adjust for new facts. Fifty years ago, in The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, Thomas Kuhn showed that even in areas like chemistry and physics, scientists cling to their paradigms even in the face of accumulated anomalous facts. Why should big-shot economists be any different? It also occurs to me that it’s the most eminent in a profession who will be more resistant to change. After all, it’s the people at the top who have the greatest amount invested in their ideas – publications, reputations, consultantships, and of course ego. Economists call these “sunk costs.”
I’d think these people would also have incentives to not say things that are evidentially foolish — a wrong prediction in 2010 is bad, but refusing to admit the facts in 2014 seems much worse to me —but I think that just means that I don’t have a good sense of the costs and benefits to the economists in question. Apparently, the cost of being wrong is less than the cost of admitting that you were wrong.
Livingston also understands the never-admit-you-were-wrong behavior in light of classic psychology research from the 1950s:
That’s the curious thing about cognitive dissonance. The goal is to reduce the dissonance, and it really doesn’t matter how. Of course, you could change your ideas, but letting go of long and deeply held ideas when the facts no longer co-operate is difficult. Apparently it’s easier to change the facts (by denial, equivocation, etc.). Or, equally effective in reducing the dissonance, you can convince others that you are right. That validation is just as effective as a friendly set of facts, especially if it comes from powerful and important people and comes with rewards both social and financial.

Parents of former Army Ranger plead for Islamic State to free their hostageBy Adam Goldman October 4 Follow @adamgoldmanwp

The parents of an American aid worker taken hostage by the Islamic State released a video Saturday pleading with their son’s captors to show mercy and free the young man.
Peter Kassig’s family said he was in the region doing humanitarian work when he disappeared a year ago near the city of Raqqa in eastern Syria.
“We implore those who are holding you to show mercy and use their power to let you go,” Kassig’s mother, Paula said, while holding a picture of their 26-year-old son.
The Islamic State revealed publicly for the first time in a separate video Friday that it was holding Kassig, a former U.S. Army Ranger who served in Iraq in 2007. In the same video, a militant dubbed “Jihadi John,” beheaded an British hostage named Alan Henning , a taxi driver from Manchester. He then threatened to kill Kassig, a Muslim convert, because of U.S. bombing of Islamic State targets in Syria.
This undated photo shows former Army Ranger Peter Kassig standing in front of a truck filled with supplies for Syrian refugees. A video purportedly produced by militants in Syria released Friday shows Kassig, of Indianapolis, kneeling on the ground as a masked militant says he will be killed next by Islamic State militants. (AP Photo/Courtesy Kassig Family)
Henning was the fourth western hostage the Islamic State has executed in a series of gruesome videos. In three earlier ones, the same militant decapitated American journalists Steven Sotloff and James Foley as well as British humanitarian aid worker David Haines. The group is holding at least three other westerners, including British journalist John Cantlie and two women, one of whom is an American.
Kassig’s family said the United States’ decision to attack the Islamic State is beyond their control and more violence was a not a solution.
“We asked our government to change its actions, but like our son, we have no more control over the U.S. government than you have over the break of dawn,” Ed Kassig said. “We implore his captors to show mercy and use their power to let our son go.”
Kassig is a native of Indiana who founded SERA (Special Emergency Response and Assistance), a non-governmental organization to provide aid to Syrians fleeing the civil war in their country.
Beginning in 2012, Kassig delivered food and medical supplies and provided care to civilian casualties inside Syria, the family said.

From the CDC  on how Ebola can be transmittedBy Eugene Volokh October 4 Follow @volokhc
As has often been reported, Ebola apparently can’t be spread through the air simply by suspended particles remaining in the air after a cough or sneeze. But if infected sweat, mucus or saliva gets on doorknobs or countertops, the Ebola virus can be spread “for several hours” by someone touching the surface and then touching their eyes, nose, mouth or an open cut. Presumably it can be spread by handshaking as well, if the infected person had gotten his saliva or mucus on his hands. Not terribly reassuring, sad to say. Here’s the CDC Q&A .
Q&As on Transmission
Ebola has been detected in blood and many body fluids. Body fluids include saliva, mucus, vomit, feces, sweat, tears, breast milk, urine and semen.
Can Ebola spread by coughing? By sneezing?
Unlike respiratory illnesses like measles or chickenpox, which can be transmitted by virus particles that remain suspended in the air after an infected person coughs or sneezes, Ebola is transmitted by direct contact with body fluids of a person who has symptoms of Ebola disease. Although coughing and sneezing are not common symptoms of Ebola, if a symptomatic patient with Ebola coughs or sneezes on someone, and saliva or mucus come into contact with that person’s eyes, nose or mouth, these fluids may transmit the disease.
What does “direct contact” mean?
Direct contact means that body fluids (blood, saliva, mucus, vomit, urine, or feces) from an infected person (alive or dead) have touched someone’s eyes, nose or mouth or an open cut, wound or abrasion.
How long does Ebola live outside the body?
Ebola is killed with hospital-grade disinfectants (such as household bleach). Ebola dried on surfaces such as doorknobs and countertops can survive for several hours; however, virus in body fluids (such as blood) can survive up to several days at room temperature …
If someone survives Ebola, can he or she still spread the virus?
Once someone recovers from Ebola, they can no longer spread the virus. However, Ebola virus has been found in semen for up to 3 months. People who recover from Ebola are advised to abstain from sex or use condoms for 3 months.
Can Ebola be spread through mosquitoes?
There is no evidence that mosquitoes or other insects can transmit Ebola virus. Only mammals (for example, humans, bats, monkeys and apes) have shown the ability to spread and become infected with Ebola virus.
Thanks to InstaPundit for the pointer.
UPDATE: I’ve revised the first sentence to expressly note what the quoted CDC text notes, which is that Ebola apparently can’t be spread through the air simply by suspended particles remaining in the air after a cough or sneeze. (I had originally just said it “can’t be spread through the air by coughing or sneezing.”) As later passages in the post make clear, it can be spread through the air if someone sneezes or coughs on someone else, or if infected saliva or mucus is deposited on a surface, and is then picked up by someone else during the virus’s survival window.

JFE may hike stake in JSW by another 5%JFE may hike stake in JSW by another 5%
Joydeep Ghosh, Sachin Mampatta & Rajesh Bhayani | Mumbai. 6 October Oct 06, 2014 12:16 AM IST
JFE Steel Corporation, Japan's second largest steelmaker, is planning to increase its stake in JSW Steel by another five per cent. Market sources said that the deal was expected to be struck at over Rs 1,600 a share - a premium of 35 per cent over its Friday closing of Rs 1,177. In 2010, JFE had bought 14.9 per cent in the company for Rs 4,800 crore. It had acquired an additional 1.18 per cent in the first quarter of 2013. Promotor Sajjan Jindal and group own 38 per cent in the company. A number of Japanese steel companies such as Daido Steel, Nippon Steel and Sumimoto Metal Corporation have interest in Indian steel firms.
Rs 39,000-cr festive bonanza for CFI?
The five-day holiday may well mark a windfall for the consolidated fund of India (CFI), as the deadline for Sahara investors to apply for refund expires on September 30. Before the deadline was announced in August, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) identified genuine investors whose total repayments came to Rs 1.08 crore. A Sebi spokesperson did not reply to a query on how many investors have come forward but the figure isn't expected to rise significantly over the last one month. This would mean the CFI could get Rs 39,000 crore (Rs 24,000 crore plus interest). In the absence of finding genuine investors, the full proceeds of the fund are to go the CFI - not a bad gift in the festive season.
IEX stake sale gathers steam
Financial Technologies (FTIL)'s 25 per cent stake sale in Indian Energy Exchange (IEX) has attracted two private equity companies - Multiples Alternate Asset Management, a private equity fund launched by Renuka Ramnath, and Aditya Birla Private Equity Fund. IEX is a leading exchange for power trading set up by FTIL, which has been asked to exit by the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission. This was followed by the commodity regulator Forward Market Commission's ruling that FTIL is not fit-and-proper. FTIL was given an extension to sell its stake by October 31. The exchange's investment advisor, Axis Bank, is expected to soon announce the name of the final bidders and valuation.

Global Banks Join Hands to Set Up One-stop Bond Shop: ReportDDA Housing Scheme: Draw to be Held on Tuesday
A group of 12 global banks are working together to set up a one-stop bond shop for buyers and sellers of corporate bonds, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.
The initiative, called "Neptune," will not be for executing trades, rather it will link up banks and investors in the market and potentially some of the existing trading platforms they use, the newspaper reported.
The banks, which include BNP Paribas SA, Credit Suisse Group AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, HSBC Holdings and JP Morgan Chase & Co, are set to pay 30,000 pounds($47,934) each for the first phase of consultancy work, the WSJ said.
AXA Investment Managers and Schroders Plc also are involved in the discussions, the report said citing executives at those firms, alongside a dozen or so other money managers.
Bond liquidity has all but dried up for corporate issues after new regulations and capital requirements forced Wall Street banks to slash their inventories of fixed-income products following the financial crisis.
The lack of liquidity also means funds may have trouble selling bonds in the event interest rates rise and the investors who have sunk about $1.2 trillion in net deposits into long-term bond funds since the end of 2004 head for the exits.
Neptune is the latest in a string of attempts to make corporate-bond trading more efficient. Investors have complained about a growing disparity between trading volumes in new and old bonds, the report said.
JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Credit Suisse, BNP Paribas and HSBC did not immediately respond to emails seeking comments on the report.

Suspended spinner Saeed Ajmal is doing everything to correct his action but it is an “uphill task” for him to make it to the Pakistan team for the World Cup, said PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan.
“I have just spoken to Ajmal before I came here. He is trying very hard. There are a team of experts working with him headed by Saqlain, but the point is he himself admitted that ‘Sir mujhe maloom hain ki galti kahaan huyi hain aur main usse theek karne ki koshish bhi kar raha hoon’ (Sir. I know where I have made a mistake and I am trying hard to rectify that),” Khan told PTI during an interaction at the Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi.
“I have been told that he has been able to bring his flexion angle (elbow use) down considerably but it is still above permissible limit,” he added.
“Ajmal is confident but it indeed is an uphill task. It’s not only doosra or faster ball that is in question but his entire action and it is being changed. When you ask me what are his chances of playing, I would say it is 50-50 as of now,” said the career diplomat, who is on a visit to Asian countries to seek resumption of cricketing ties in Pakistan.
Khan was hopeful that he would be able to convince cricket boards to send their A and junior teams to Pakistan.
“I would be meeting ICC chief Mr N. Srinivasan in Dubai 3-4 days time. People over here know my track record in promoting relationships through cricket. India playing Pakistan in India is not a problem. But the problem is India’s senior team travelling to Pakistan, which is not possible due to security concerns,” he said.
“We will be playing India next year in UAE. Post 2015, there can be an assessment of security situation and see if we can persuade bigger teams to come,” Khan explained.
“We are resigned to the fate that no senior team will travel to Pakistan as of now. What we want is the tours of A teams, U-19 teams and school teams so that cricketing ties at junior level,” said Khan, who is leaving for Dhaka today, followed by Colombo to speak to cricket board officials of both countries.

State-owned  Coal India has awarded contracts for construction of two washeries as part of efforts to augment its capacity to crush coal and ensure better quality of the dry fuel.
The government had earlier said that comprehensive measures for enhancing domestic coal output were being put in place along with stringent mechanism for quality control and environmental protection, which includes supply of crushed coal and setting up of washeries.
"CIL (Coal India Ltd) has initiated action through global tenders to establish 16 coal washeries with an aggregate capacity of 100.6 Mty... Construction job of three washeries are in progress and the same for two washeries have been awarded," Coal India said in a report.
It added: "Jobs of other washeries are in different stages of evaluation." Of the 16 coal washeries, six are coking coal with a capacity of 18.6 million tonnes per year and 10 non-coking coal washeries with a capacity of 82 million tonnes per year, it said.
At present, CIL operates 17 coal washeries with a total capacity of 39.4 million tonnes per year. Out of these, 13 are coking coal washeries with a total capacity of 24.90 million tonnes, while four are non-coking coal washeries with a total capacity of 14.50 million tonnes, it added.
The Standing Committee on Coal and Steel had earlier pulled up Coal India for delays in setting up of washeries and had desired that the coal PSU prepare an action plan to expedite the work of commissioning of washeries. The committee had also observed that the washeries were not set up despite the Ministry of Environment and Forests restricting the use of coal containing more than 34 percent ash content in power stations located 1,000 km away from pit heads.
Coal India stock price
On November 24, 2014, Coal India closed at Rs 347.40, up Rs 0.30, or 0.09 percent. The 52-week high of the share was Rs 423.85 and the 52-week low was Rs 240.50.
The company's trailing 12-month (TTM) EPS was at Rs 21.06 per share as per the quarter ended September 2014. The stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio was 16.5. The latest book value of the company is Rs 26.04 per share. At current value, the price-to-book value of the company is 13.34.

Dhoni to become co-owner of Chennai s football franchiseDhoni to become co-owner of Chennai's football franchise
BS Reporter | Chennai Oct 07, 2014 12:42 AM IST
After cricketers Sourav Ganguly, Sachin Tendulkar and Virat Kohli, now the Indian cricket team’s captain, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, has shown an interest in football. Dhoni on Monday became the co-owner of Chennaiyin FC, one of the eight franchise of Indian Super League (ISL). The team was originally bid by actor Abhishek Bachchan and Vita Dani, belonging to the Asian Paints family, who are the co-owners.
Dhoni played football and was a goalkeeper in his team before he started playing cricket. It may be noted that Dhoni heads the Chennai Super Kings, an IPL team that is owned by India Cements.
ISL’s aim is to help India, currently 145th in FIFA’s world rankings, qualify for the 2026 World Cup, the organisers said in October. Based in Chennai, Chennaiyin FC will begin playing this month during the inaugural season of ISL.
The 28-member team of the Chennaiyin FC includes 12 foreign nationals from Brazil, France, Spain, Italy, Colombia, Sweden and Brazil. Italian World Cup winner Marco Materazzi was hired as player-manager. Chennaiyin FC will start their ISL journey on October 16.
Earlier, Tendulkar become the co-owner of the ISL franchise Kerala Blasters. Kohli, through his company, invested in the FC Goa franchise of the Hero Indian Super League.
The other notable group from Tamil Nadu that has shown an interest in ISL is the Sun Group — which controls SpiceJet Ltd and Sun TV Network Ltd. It has bought the rights to the team from Bengaluru, formerly known as Bangalore. The group is also the owner of IPL Franchise.
The eight teams going head to head this ISL season are Atletico Kolkata, Chennaiyin FC, Delhi Dynamos FC, FC Goa, FC Pune City, Kerala Blasters FC, Mumbai City FC and Northeast United FC.
The most expensive city to be won was the Kolkata team, which was won for approximately Rs 18 crore. The base price of each team was set at Rs 12 crore.
India cricketing legend Sachin Tendulkar, along with PVP Ventures, had won the bidding for the Kochi franchise. Another former Indian cricketer, Sourav Ganguly, along with a group of Indian businessmen and La Liga side Atlético Madrid, had won the bidding for the Kolkata franchise.

RCom: Some deleveraging done  more neededRCom: Some deleveraging done, more needed
Ram Prasad Sahu & Sounak Mitra |  Oct 07, 2014 10:48 PM IST
The Street’s concern on Reliance Communications (RCom)’s debt and weak operating metrics is weighing on the stock. The company’s shares have declined 37 per cent through the past year, underperforming the company’s larger peers (6-21 per cent gain), as well as the broader markets (up 33 per cent).
While the company has been losing subscribers and revenue market share, investors’ key concern remains the debt on its books. As of the June 2014 quarter, the company had net debt of Rs 40,222 crore. For 2013-14, the net debt-to-earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) ratio was 5.2, compared with 2.3-2.4 for Bharti and Idea Cellular. This has been a key problem, as the company’s profits are barely enough (interest coverage ratio at 0.9 times) to pay for interest costs (Rs 3,191 crore in 2013-14).
The deleveraging process, however, is picking up. Recently, the company raised Rs 6,100 crore through a qualified institutional placement and warrant issuance to promoters. Following this, the net debt stands at Rs 35,500 crore; this should help save Rs 600 crore in annual interest costs. Through the next year, RCom might reduce its debt to Rs 25,000 crore through securitisation of tower proceeds, stake sale in Global Cloud Xchange (formerly Reliance Globalcom) and monetisation of real estate. At the company’s recent annual general meeting, Reliance Group chief Anil Ambani indicated debt would be cut to less than Rs 20,000 crore through the next two years.
IIFL analysts say the company can raise Rs 5,500 crore from the stake sale, Rs 4,000 crore from tower-related deals and Rs 3,000 crore from real estate deals. If these materialise, the company’s net debt-to-Ebitda ratio will to a manageable 2.9 by 2015-16.
Another area in which the Street wants the company to see traction is operating metrics. For the June quarter, both voice traffic (up 0.8 per cent sequentially) and voice revenue per minute (up 0.3 paise sequentially) were below those of Bharti Airtel and Idea Cellular (rise of two-five per cent and by one paisa, respectively). This is reflected on voice revenues, which have stood at Rs 3,380-3,430 through the past five quarters, underperforming competition.
At 6.7 per cent, RCom’s revenue market share has fallen to about half since FY08. In the June quarter this year, the company’s market share dropped 50-90 basis points. At 110 million, its subscriber base has seen a fall of 12 per cent on an annual basis.
Despite large presence in the data segment, the company’s data revenue gas been confined to Rs 1,000-1,100 crore through the past eight quarters. The surge in data volumes is expected to help the company, as data accounts for 24 per cent of its revenue (the highest in the sector). The recent price increases will only aid data revenue and profits.
The company has indicated it has slowed the fall in growth of CDMA voice revenue by introducing dual-band (CDMA and GSM) smartphones. RCom expects this segment (30 per cent of revenue) to aid its growth.
On the operational front, the key is the company’s ability to increase revenue/minute, with minimum negative elasticity on voice usage. Deutsche Bank analysts believe the company will post 3.5 per cent/year growth in revenue/minute through FY14-17, driven by rate increases and an increase in data revenue. This should help the company improve its wireless Ebitda margins from 30.5 per cent in FY14 to 32 per cent by FY17. Also, unlike rivals, the company’s cash outgo in the coming auction is minimal.
The risk, however, is the pricing strategy adopted by Reliance Jio, as well as the impact of this on the sector. While the impact will not be RCom-specific, any pricing war will have a negative impact on the company’s financials.
The multiple deals RCom has signed with Reliance Jio for sharing infrastructure will essentially benefit RCom through the next few years. One of the deals, which allows Reliance Jio to use RCom’s mobile towers, will get fetch RCom about Rs 12,000 crore as rental through the next few years.
At the current price of Rs 96.1, the stock is trading at 14 times its FY16 earnings per share. Though the debt-reduction plan and an improvement in operating metrics should aid profitability and boost profits, most analysts continue to have a ‘sell’ rating on the stock, with target prices of about Rs 100. As of now, progress on asset monetisation and reduction in debt are the biggest triggers for the stock.

Bitcoin s price in dollars falls nearly 20 p...Bitcoin's price in dollars takes another wild swing, falls nearly 20%
New York Times Oct 6, 2014, 03.25PM IST
( In August, a flash crash…)
By Sydney Ember
The price of Bitcoin fell nearly 20 percent this weekend to its lowest level of the year, prompting worries of a crash.
"As the price is going down, some of us are under immense psychological stress," one user posted on Reddit on Sunday. "Please share how you cope with it."
On Sunday afternoon, Bitcoin was trading at about $300, up from a low of $286, according to CoinDesk, a virtual currency website.
Some contend that Bitcoin's price is irrelevant and that it does not reflect the virtual currency's true value. Bitcoin is still most popular among speculators and technology enthusiasts and has yet to find a general use that will push it into the mainstream and help stabilize its price, they say.
Bitcoin's recent price decline can appear jarring, but it is nothing new. Indeed, some say the wild price swings have hindered the virtual currency's widespread adoption.
Since it was introduced in 2009 by an anonymous programmer, or group of programmers, the price of Bitcoin has fluctuated unpredictably. After reaching its peak of about $1,150 late last year, the price has been in a prolonged slide. In August, a flash crash briefly set the currency world on edge, as the price dipped on one exchange to just over $300 from nearly $500. Bitcoin ended that day down about 12 percent.
"For anyone complaining about the current price of Bitcoin, remember it has more than doubled over the last 12 months," Roger Ver, a Bitcoin enthusiast and investor, said in a Twitter message on Sunday.
But even those most confident in Bitcoin are having trouble explaining the recent decline.
One reason for the drop could be uncertainty over potential regulations. In July, New York became the first state to propose regulations for Bitcoin companies. The comment period for the regulations, which were introduced by the Department of Financial Services, is set to end on Oct. 21.
Bitcoin has attracted the attention of a number of other regulatory agencies in the United States, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Internal Revenue Service.
The increase in the number of merchants now accepting Bitcoin could also be affecting the price. These merchants, including Overstock and Dell, use third-party payment processors like Coinbase to immediately convert Bitcoin to dollars. This means there are more Bitcoins in circulation, which could be helping to drive down the price.
Some say simply that the market has been distracted with other events, including the Alibaba Group's initial public offering and the recent surge in the United States dollar.
  Against this backdrop, there have been questions about whether Bitcoin can become more than a commodity. For that to happen, however, developers must find a way to harness its underlying technology to enable tasks that were previously difficult, expensive or impossible. These include cross-border transfers like remittances, which under the current financial system can be subject to high fees and long delays. Once Bitcoin finds a general use, the price is likely to stabilize, they say.
"Right now, Bitcoin is in this transition stage where it's a commodity trying to become a currency," said Rafael Corrales, a partner at the venture capital firm Charles River Ventures who has followed Bitcoin. "When Bitcoin becomes a currency, it realizes its potential.

Government seeks AG s opinion in coal blocks...Government seeks Attorney General's opinion on need for ordinance on coal blocks

Attorney General
(The issues that need to be…)
NEW DELHI: The Coal Ministry has sought the opinion of Attorney General on whether the government needs to bring out an ordinance to deal with the issues arising from the Supreme Court decision to deallocate coal mines .
The issues that need to be resolved by the government in the coal mine case include forfeiting of bank guarantees and title deeds of the land mines purchased by the companies, sources said.
The Coal Ministry, they said, is seeking "advice of Attorney General on the issue of Bank Guarantee forfeited/ imposed on the allocatee companies, the cancellation of mining leases, the right and title of the land purchased by the allocatee companies".
Depending on the advice of the Attorney General of India , they said, the ministry will take a view on the Ordinance so as to deal with the implications of the Supreme Court's order in the coal case.
In a major blow to the corporate sector, the Supreme Court had last month quashed allocation of 214 out of 218 coal blocks alloted to various companies since 1993 terming the method as "fatally flawed" and allowed the Centre to take over operation of 42 such blocks which are functional.
The apex court said the beneficiaries of the illegal process "must suffer" the consequences and refused to show sympathy to private companies which submitted that Rs 2.87 lakh crore have been invested in 157 coal block and Rs 4 lakh crores in end-use plants.
It, however, saved from the "guillotine" four allocations one each to SAIL and NTPC and two blocks to Sasan Power Ltd owned by Anil Ambani's Reliance Power and also gave six months breathing time to rest of them to wind up their operations by March 31, 2015.

I m proud Congressman  not endorsing BJP: TharoorShashi Tharoor slammed for ‘praising’ Modi
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  Thiruvananthapuram, October 06, 2014
First Published: 15:14 IST(6/10/2014) | Last Updated: 23:51 IST(6/10/2014)
Comments
The Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee on Monday expressed serious reservations over party MP Shashi Tharoor praising Prime Minister Narendra Modi and accepting his invitation to join ‘Swachh Bharat’ campaign.
KPCC vice-president and spokesman MM Hassan said his stand was against party ideology and policies. “Tharoor should stop praising Modi. The party state unit would not hesitate in taking action against him. The party has strong reservations against his stand and it would inform the high command about this,” Hassan said.
Even actor Kamal Hassan said there was nothing new in Modi’s campaign. But Tharoor’s didn’t even show the actor’s concern. It is not acceptable to us,” he said.
Another leader M Liju has also expressed dismay over “Tharoor becoming part of Modi’s communal agenda”.
This is the latest incident where the party has distanced from Tharoor. During the IPL controversy and death of his wife Sunanda Pushkar the party state unit had left him high and dry.
Tharoor had commented that he was honoured by the invitation from the Prime Minister and thanked him making him an active partner in the campaign.
However reacting to party state leaders’ outbursts Tharoor tweeted saying it was wrong to dub him a BJP sympathiser.
“Being receptive to specific statements or actions of BJP leaders does not remotely imply acceptance of the party’s core Hindutva agenda. The PM pitched his appeal as a non-political one and I received it in that spirit. I am a proud Congressman and a proud Indian. In short: not pro-BJP, just pro-India,” he tweeted.

Haryana Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda has dismissed allegations by Prime Minister Narendra Modi as mere election propaganda. He said that he was ready to quit politics if his involvement was proved in land deals between Congress President Sonia Gandhi's son-in-law Robert Vadra and DLF. He said, 'Haryana government has nothing to with it. It is a propaganda against us. If anyone can prove that there is even one inch of government land, I will quit.'

Here's how Twitter brings Bangalore police and people closer

Bangalore: Perhaps, the Bangalore City Police is the most interactive police force in the entire India, today. It has not been like this till recently. Then, what has changed in the last few months?
The answer is M N Reddi, the new police commissioner of Bangalore. After the unceremonious exit of Raghavendra Auradkar as Commissioner of Police in last July, M N Reddi took charge as the chief of India's third most important city Bangalore's police force.
M N Reddi, a 1984 batch Indian Police Service (IPS) officer, who knows the importance of social media, embraced it with open arms soon after he assumed the coveted office. His official twitter handle has almost 10,000 followers and it is growing everyday.
Perhaps, the Bangalore City Police is the most interactive police force in the entire India, today. It has not been like this till recently. Then, what has changed in the last few months?
#twitter #bangalore police #m n reddi #social networking
Thanks to all the friends following me on Twitter and encouraging BLR police. Request all to popularize @cpblr
What makes Reddi special is his zeal and enthusiasm. India's IT city Bangalore's police force did not have a twitter account till he became the Commissioner of Police in last July. It really was an embarrassing thing for the IT city. Various departments of Karnataka government are yet to understand and adapt the new medium - Internet and social media.
Commissioner of Police Reddi directly engages the tweeple in conversation. Anybody can send him a query or a request by tweeting him. He answers to almost all genuine questions and requests. He also directs his subordinates to take action or act upon certain things based on the comments he receives via twitter. It has now become very easy to draw the attention of city's top cop towards any grievances.
He has also made all top police officers in Bangalore, Additional Commissioners of Police, Joint Commissioners of Police and Deputy Commissioners of Police to have their own official twitter handles. He closely monitors their twitter handles and issues instructions by tweeting them.
Just to test the speed of response, CNN-IBN sent a few questions to M N Reddi's twitter handle. He immediately replied to all the tweets and even directed his top officials to act on them immediately.
M N Reddi's twitter handle is active 24/7 like the police force he commands! He has brought the much maligned and not so friendly police department closer to the public and made it accountable and transparent by using the latest technology, the social media.
Known as a tough cop M N Reddi has handled various important responsibilities across Karnataka and even outside the state. M N Reddi or Malgaveri Narayan Reddy is a native of neighbouring Andhra Pradesh and has done M.A and Ph.D.
Since the top cop in Bangalore himself is active on twitter and using it to make the policing effective, the entire force is on its toes. They closely follow every move of their boss on twitter! M N Reddi is reaching out to the common people through twitter. Like a true general, he is leading from the front on social media. Hope, the Police Commissioners of other major cities like Delhi and Mumbai also learn a few twitter tricks from their Bangalore counterpart!!
However i have imposed Sec 144 in 1km radius around the High Court as well as around P'agrahara Jail for tomorrow as a precaution (3/3)
— M N Reddi, IPS (@CPBlr) October 6, 2014
All arrangements are made to make sure that law and order is maintained. We don't expect any untoward incidents(2/2)

First Take: It's Splitsville for HP, but will it work?
Jon Swartz , USA TODAY 8:40 a.m. EDT October 6, 2014
HP has been contemplating big strategic changes for several years.

SAN MATEO, Calif. – Hewlett-Packard is calling it Splitsville in its latest stab to turn things around. But will it get its stuff together this time?
Taking a page from a now-familiar corporate play book, HP plans to split in half, separating its PC and printer businesses from its hardware and services operations. The long-contemplated move was announced Monday.
Such a move at the 75-year-old company would be yet another breakup or spin-off in tech, underscoring the idea that companies with a narrower focus fare better financially and on Wall Street.
Last week, eBay said it intends to spin off its PayPal payments-processing unit.
HP stock up 4.7%: Investors love split strategy
HP has flirted with the notion of breaking off its sprawling PC operation. In 2012, under CEO Meg Whitman, it reorganized to combine the PC business with its more profitable printer operation. She will be chairman of the PC/printer business and CEO of the separate enterprise company, the Journal reported.
In 2011, it hinted at splintering its PC business. But after the ouster of then-CEO Léo Apotheker, HP reversed course two months later and said it would hold on to the business.
Breaking the company in two, while radical, may be the best recourse for a tech pioneer scrambling to keep up with smaller, more nimble competitors in cloud computing and data storage while at the same time feeling the heat from PC rivals. Last year, HP lost its place as the largest PC maker by shipments, slipping behind China's Lenovo Group, according to industry research firm IDC.
Layoffs — and HP has had thousands recently — can only go so far in reducing costs.
HP has also been contemplating big strategic changes, such as a possible merger with data-storage giant EMC.
Something drastic had to be done to reverse HP's fading fortunes. By cutting itself in half, perhaps it will make itself whole again.

Many people did not want 12 Years A Slave made: SteveMcQueen'12 Years a Slave' is based on the memoirs of Solomon Northrup.
Los Angeles | Posted: October 6, 2014 5:02 pm
British directer Steve McQueen says the story of his Oscar-winning film ’12 Years A Slave’ almost did not make it to the big screen as a lot of people did not want it to be made.
The slavery drama, based on the memoirs of Solomon Northrup, a free man who was sold into slavery and fought his way back, won the best picture Oscar this year. McQueen said a lot of people did not want it to be made, reported FT Weekend.
“A lot of people didn’t want the movie made. Yes, because people want to close their eyes on some subjects. They want to keep on going, they don’t want to look behind them,” McQueen said.
But the director of films like ‘Hunger’ and ‘Shame’, says it was important to make the movie in Hollywood. McQueen feels the subject was not closely examined.
“I don’t think people had looked into the subject matter very much, that relationship between slave and slave-owner. That is what I wanted to do. It is such a huge part of history, and there was a certain kind of examination or reflection it hadn’t been given. It is very, very important to look back in order to move forward.”

India and Pakistan did not exchange sweets along the Wagah border in Punjab on the occasion of Eid on Monday after the Pakistan Rangers violated the ceasefire along the international border in Jammu district killing five civilians and injuring 29.
In one of the worst ceasefire violations, Pakistani Rangers resorted to firing and shelling of mortars on 10 border outposts and civilian areas along the international border in Arnia belt of Jammu district on Sunday night.
Read: India asks Pak to stop ceasefire violations at the border
During a late evening flag meeting between the sector commanders of the Border Security Force and Pakistan Rangers on Sunday, the Rangers refused to fix any time for the ceremony to be held on Monday, PTI quoted unnamed official sources as saying.
"The Pakistan side refused the exchange of sweets on Eid today. They cited no reasons but it is understood that the prevailing tension along Jammu and Kashmir border due to unprovoked firing incidents from the other side is the reason," the sources said.
The BSF too did not make any movement along the Wagah border and the border gates remained shut on Monday.
The exchange of sweets between the border guarding troops of the two countries is an old and traditional gesture which is aimed to show goodwill. The same drill is held during Diwali and Independence day of both the countries.
Senior commanders from both the sides exchange sweets in their official uniforms along the Wagah land border which is also frequented by locals and tourists from both sides.
PTI also reported that the evening retreat and lowering of flag ceremony is expected to take place as scheduled.

The NBA has re-upped with ESPN and TNT on a new nine-year television contract, two people with knowledge of the situation confirmed to USA TODAY Sports. The people spoke on the condition of anonymity because the terms of the deal had not been announced.
According to the New York Times, the deal that will begin in the 2016-17 season is worth a whopping $24 billion – nearly three times that of the league's current contract.
Despite months of speculation that Fox Sports One could secure part of the NBA package, the ESPN/TNT deal was done before ESPN and TNT's exclusive negotiation window with the league had ended.
With the NBA's salary cap having already raised approximately $5 million from the 2013-14 season to the coming 2014-15 campaign, that trend is certainly going to continue.
It has already had a substantive effect within the league, as best evidenced by LeBron James' decision to sign a two-year contract with the Cleveland Cavaliers during the summer rather than a long-term deal in order to survey this growing financial landscape.

John O'Keefe, May-Britt Moser and Edvard I. Moser won the 2014 Nobel Prize for medicine, the awarding committee said Monday.
The Nobel committee said the trio's research has helped explain how the brain creates "a map of the space surrounding us and how we can navigate our way through a complex environment" that is akin to an "inner GPS."
O'Keefe is an American-born scientist who works in the United Kingdom at University College London. He is also a British citizen.
May-Britt Moser and Edvard Moser are from Norway and are attached to the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim.
The 2014 Nobel Prize announcements ranging from economics to literature started Monday and run to Oct. 13.

What did Congress do in 60 years to bring back black money, asks Venkaiah Naidu

Hyderabad: Taking exception to Congress president Sonia Gandhi's reported attack on NDA government on the issue of black money, Union Minister M Venkaiah Naidu asked what her party did on the matter when it was in power.
"I am putting a straight question to the Congress president. If it is so easy and simple to bring back the black money in 60 days of coming to power, what is it you have done in the 60 years, when you have been in power. Absolute power. You have no answer. Your government is responsible for all the ills that are plaguing the nation. This government is trying its best to set right the matters," Naidu said.
Asked about opposition's criticism of the live telecast of RSS Chief Mohan Bhagwat's address on Doordarshan, he said the criticism is "absurd" and complimented the national broadcaster for showing the address live. "RSS chief's Vijaya Dasami address, which is historic, has been live telecast by many channels, including Doordarshan. I don't know why people are making controversy. There are people who are making live telecast of so many things. Then, a patriotic organisation, a nationalistic organisation, chief of RSS addressed a historic Dasara rally. It is telecast live," he said.
Union Minister M Venkaiah Naidu said that the UPA government is responsible for all the ills that are plaguing the nation.

"Doordarshan has done a good thing. I compliment them, they have not been doing for a variety of reasons. I saw absurd and meaningless criticism by some people," the senior BJP leader said. Asked about reports of BJP being in touch with Tamil superstar Rajinikanth for his joining the party, he said it is being reported in newspapers.
"We are in touch saying, participate in 'Swachh Bharat Abhiyan'," he said. Talking about the cleanliness campaign, he said icons in different fields like cinema and sports are being roped in to participate in the mission.

Delhi: Employer asked to pay compensation of over Rs 60 K to minor maid10
0
New Delhi: Upholding an order of the Child Welfare Committee (CWC), a Delhi court has asked an employer to pay a compensation of Rs 60,840 to a minor maid for making her work for eight months without wages.
"I have no hesitation in holding that the Child Welfare Committee was well within its powers to award compensation to the child victim even if it had misspelled the said term of 'compensation' as minimum wages and thus, no illegality or infirmity can be found in or inferred from the impugned order on this score alone," Additional Sessions Judge Lokesh Kumar Sharma said.
While dismissing the appeal of MC Pandey, a Vasant Kunj resident, the court directed him to hand over a demand draft of Rs 30,000 to the child victim on November 24, 2014. The rest of the compensation amount will be paid in due course.
While dismissing the appeal of MC Pandey, a Vasant Kunj resident, the court directed him to hand over a demand draft of Rs 30,000 to the child victim on November 24, 2014.
#delhi #delhi high court #juvenile justice act #compensation
Pandey had filed an appeal against the order of CWC, which directed the employer to pay Rs 60,840 by way of demand draft in favour of the minor child, who was employed as a domestic help. CWC had also ordered registration of an FIR against him for offences under Juvenile Justice (JJ) Act.
Pandey had contended that CWC, constituted under the JJ Act, was not a competent authority and did not have jurisdiction under Minimum Wages Act to issue directions to pay salary.
Citing a Delhi High Court verdict, the judge said, "The Child Welfare Committee has all the powers to summon the employer and also to direct him to pay wages and impose fine or direct the employer to pay compensation to a child victim, where severe injury was caused to the minor during the course of employment."
The court also held that CWC was well within its rights and powers to facilitate the registration of FIR in the present case and "no illegality or infirmity can be pointed out on this account".
According to the prosecution, the 12-year-old girl was allegedly employed by Pandey at his residence at Vasant Kunj as a domestic servant for a period of about eight months from February 2013 to September 2013  but no wages were paid to her. It was alleged that the accused and his wife used to beat her up on finding faults in her work.
On a written complaint of the victim's father, an FIR was registered against Pandey under section 26 of the JJ Act (exploitation of juvenile or child employee) at the behest of CWC.

HSBC sees several positives for market; overweight on IndiaHSBC sees several positives for market; overweight on India
PTI
Tweet
New Delhi, Oct 6:  
Global brokerage HSBC today said it is “overweight” on India and the government’s reform momentum is likely to drive positive news flow for the market that would help in sustaining the current market momentum.
It said sticky inflation level, however, remains a cause for “concern”. Inflation has seen some moderation in the recent past, falling from double-digit figures in 2013 to 7.8 per cent year-on-year in August.
“We are overweight on India. We see several positives for the market, including structural reforms, supportive monetary policy, a decline in the cost of equity and a favourable corporate earnings outlook,” HSBC said, adding that “this should help sustain the current market momentum”.
Meanwhile, several reform initiatives are lined up — including FDI in railway infrastructure, defence and insurance; and energy sector reforms.
India is also considering ‘big ticket’ divestments in government-owned companies, which should help lower its budget deficit.
Though at this stage, elevated equity valuations are a concern, the consensus is currently expecting earnings growth to come in at 15.3 per cent for 2014 and 16 per cent for 2015.
On September 26, Standard & Poor’s improved India’s outlook to stable from negative saying the new political formation at the Centre has capacity to push reforms and put the country back on high growth trajectory.
After taking over as Prime Minister in May, Modi has launched host of initiatives, including ‘Make in India’ campaign to ease business environment and fetch FDI.
Moreover, a decline in bond yields expected over the next two years could drive the cost of equity lower.
HSBC’s rates strategist Himanshu Malik expects that the high inflation premium priced into India rates could soon change as the central bank switches to a medium—term inflation target of 2—6 per cent.
This, in turn, could trigger a fall in 10—year Indian government bond yields to 7.5 per cent over the next 12 months and to 6—6.5 per cent within 2—3 years, he said.
“We believe this will be positive for Indian equities as it will lower the cost of equity for investors,” the report said.

Business confidence at a high: surveysTweet
New Delhi, Oct 6:  
Indicating a positive business sentiment, the Confederation of India Industry and the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry on Monday said that there is improvement in confidence level among members of corporate India.
Companies expect the overall economic situation to improve in the near term, according to two separate surveys on business confidence done by the two chambers.
According to the CII, Business Confidence Index for July-September quarter this year has shot up to 57.4, up from 53.7 in April-June quarter and 49.9 in January-March quarter. The number 50 is the dividing line on the index between positive and weak business confidence.
On the other hand, the overall Business Confidence Index in the FICCI survey stood at 72.7, which is the highest in 15 quarters. The index value in the previous survey by FICCI was 69.0.
Sales rise
A significant 77 per cent of the respondents of the CII survey expected their sales to increase in the July-September quarter, much higher than 50 per cent respondents in the previous quarter.
In the FICCI survey, 34 per cent of the participants anticipated better investment prospects over the next two quarters, compared with 21 per cent a year ago.
However, in the FICCI survey, the companies did not see much change in the employment outlook; with a majority 64 per cent not expecting to hire more over the next six months.
New investment
CII said that the revival in domestic and global demand has resulted in a majority (46 per cent) of the surveyed businesses contemplating new investment in the July-September quarter, whereas only 10 per cent expected a contraction.

MTS slashes mobile internet ratesMTS slashes mobile internet rates
PTI
Tweet
New Delhi, Oct 6:  
Triggering a price war in the mobile Internet segment, telecom operator MTS India today launched new schemes with a price reduction of about 33 per cent in its high-speed service offerings.
“We have lowered the price barrier for first time data customers with as much as 33 per cent reduction in dongle prices. We have also rolled out a range of monthly data plans to suit the needs of customers across categories,” MTS India Chief Marketing and Brand Officer Leonid Musatov said in a statement.
The company said its new postpaid customers now need to pay Rs 999 to get an MBlaze Ultra Wi-Fi dongle which was earlier available for Rs 1,499.
MTS said its dongle is now priced at almost half of what is offered by competitors. The statement mentioned that services will be offered at broadband speed of up to 9.8 megabit per second.
The company has reduced rates of its MBlaze Ultra Wi—fi dongle loaded with 10 GB mobile broadband to Rs 1,749 from Rs 2,299 for new customers.
MTS gives its customer option to carry forward unused mobile broadband capacity to next month’s against recharge of a minimum amount.
The company also announced new schemes under its festive offers which charges mobile broadband usage at less price as compared to its previous offerings.
For pre-paid customers, it announced new scheme to offer 5 GB mobile broadband usage for Rs 499, 7 GB for Rs 699 and continued its offer of 20 GB for Rs 999.
Earlier, the company had a scheme under which it offered 4 GB for Rs 599 and 8 GB for Rs 798.
For post-paid customers, MTS has reduced monthly price of 10 GB mobile broadband usage capacity to Rs 550 from Rs 875 and launched a new scheme which offers 14 GB mobile broadband.
However, the company has halved the benefit under Rs 999 scheme for post-paid customers. Under the plan, postpaid customers will get only 20 GB usage limit as compared to 40 GB earlier.
“This is a festive offer but will remain in existence for at least a quarter. After which we will again evaluate it,” Musatov said.
The move to reduce mobile Internet rates by MTS is contrary to the trend of rise in prices by other telecom operators. In June—September period, leading incumbent operators had increased their mobile Internet rates.

Big Billion Day: Flipkart fizzles outBig Billion Day: Flipkart fizzles out
Anisha Dutta |  Oct 06, 2014 04:45 PM IST
Mirroring the buzz generated by the ‘Black Friday sale’ in the US, Flipkart on Monday started its 'Big Billion Day' sale boasting steep discounts with sale prices starting at just one rupee. The same day its e-commerce competitor Snapdeal ran an ad mocking it with the tagline “For others it’s a big day. For us, today’s no different.”  
 
Flipkart has been promoting the big sale since Amazon's CEO Jeff Bezoz visited India. The site has created  a huge buzz on its Steal Deals section, while other sections have catchy names like 'Limited Time' and 'Limited Stock', and 'Save More'.
 
The most talked about deal till now has been the Nokia Lumia 525 sale. The product had a 90% discount and was gone within minutes. While many users complained the sale was a a hoax, some claimed to have bagged the coveted deal:
 
— Ms. Starry Eyed (@Priyaa_G) October 6, 2014
Many users  complained about the elusiveness of most products and the claim the site made of products being 'out of stock' right after they had paid for the item. Issues such as these, not to mention sluggish servers, also led many users to shop at Snapdeal instead.
 
A website titled ‘ missionsharingknowledge.com ’ claimed that the price of most items on ‘sale’ today were actually increased over the past few days and then shown to be on discount while remaining even more expensive than its original selling price.
 
“One of the best selling perfumes, Calvin Klein Be Eau de Toilette, had its price hovering around Rs.1650 for the last 3 months, suddenly it has shot up by around Rs.300 and is now available at Rs.1920,” the website pointed out, with a price graph as evidence.
 
Many users, mostly frustrated by the offers and their inability to buy the items they wanted, took to micro-blogging website Twitter to rant, while a small minority had positive reviews. With #BigBillionDay and #CheckSnapDealToday trending on top, the sale was certainly the most discussed topic today:
Flipkart should have just kept this Big Billion Sale on April Fools day instead.

KRBL`s revenues may increase to Rs 39 bn by FY16: CRISILLike this story, share it with millions of investors on M3
KRBL`s revenues may increase to Rs 39 bn by FY16: CRISIL
CRISIL Research expects revenues of KRBL to increase at a two-year CAGR of 16% to Rs 39 bn by FY16 driven by 13% growth in volumes and 3.5% growth in realisations. PAT is expected to record higher growth of 18%, says the report.
Post your opinion here
 
CRISIL Research's repport on KRBL
FY14 was an outstanding year for the basmati rice industry; prices increased 25-30% and demand was strong. KRBL, India's leading exporter of branded basmati rice and an established player in the domestic market, recorded robust growth. Going forward, we expect growth momentum to continue driven by 12-13% volume growth and steady realisations. While the balance sheet of most peers' deteriorated over the past five-six years, KRBL's efficient working capital management resulted in superior balance sheet. A well-known brand, relatively superior financial performance (high RoE) and experienced management further strengthen the company. We maintain our fundamental grade of 3/5. However, the competitive and commoditised nature of the basmati rice industry could hinder KRBL's future prospects.
We expect revenues to increase at a two-year CAGR of 16% to Rs 39 bn by FY16 driven by 13% growth in volumes and 3.5% growth in realisations. PAT is expected to record higher growth of 18%. We expect RoE to remain healthy at 24% in FY16. We continue to value KRBL by the P/E multiple method and have revised our fair value to Rs 147 per share from Rs 64. Apart from revision in earnings estimates due to better-than-expected performance, we have raised the P/E multiple to 10x from 5x factoring in superior balance sheet and expected healthy return ratios. At the current market price, our valuation grade is 5/5.

CRISIL assigns Apollo Hospitals` valuation grade to 3/5
CRISIL Research has assigned Apollo Hospitals Enterprises' valuation grade to 3/5. However maintained the fundamental grade of 5/5 to the company.
Post your opinion here
CRISIL Research's repport on Apollo Hospitals Enterprises
In a bid to consolidate its presence in the retail pharmacy space, Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Ltd (Apollo) has entered into a MoU with Hetero Med Solutions Ltd (Hetero) to acquire 320 retail pharmacy stores at Rs 1,460 mn on slump sale basis. The acquisition is at an implied EV/store of Rs 4.6 mn and EV/sales of 0.9x, which is much below the earlier reported transaction valuation of Rs 15 mn and 2.0x in the pharmacy space. Hetero operates retail pharmacy stores in Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Telangana. We expect synergy benefits for Apollo through this deal. However, Hetero's turnaround is a key monitorable as it has been making losses at the operating level. Given Apollo's strong balance sheet, we rule out funding problems; we expect the transaction to be funded through a mix of debt and internal accruals. We maintain our fundamental grade of 5/5 for Apollo.
Factoring in the acquisition of Hetero's pharmacy chain, we have raised our revenue estimates by 2% for FY15 and 4% for FY16. We have retained our earnings estimates as we expect EBITDA margin generated at Hetero's network to be offset by interest cost. We maintain our DCF-based fair value of Rs 1,195 per share. At this value, the implied EV/EBITDA multiples are 23.7x FY15E and 19.8x FY16E EBITDA. At the current market price, our valuation grade is 3/5.

CRISIL upgrades Supreme Inds` fundamental grade to 5/5
CRISIL Research has upgraded The Supreme Industries' fundamental grade to 5/5 from 4/5, in its research report dated September 23, 2014.
Post your opinion here
CRISIL Research's repport on Supreme Industries
CRISIL Research has upgraded The Supreme Industries Ltd's (Supreme's) CRISIL IER fundamental grade to 5/5 (pronounced ‘five on five') from 4/5. The grade indicates that the company's fundamentals are `excellent' relative to other listed equity securities in India. Our fair value of the stock is Rs 620 per share. At the current market price of Rs 650 per share, our valuation grade is 3/5 indicating that the current market price is aligned with our fair value. The grades are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold the securities to which it relates (or any other securities), or a comment on the graded instrument's future market price or its suitability for a particular investor.
Supreme was able to pass on the increase in raw material prices across segments despite muted demand in FY14 which, we believe, is a proof of its strong brand equity and has alleviated our concern about margin pressure in the future due to increase in raw material prices. Additionally, strengths such as a diversified product portfolio, pan India presence through a wide distribution network, stringent working capital management and focus on new product development have enabled Supreme to entrench its dominance in the plastic processing industry. With its fundamental strengths and a strong management team, Supreme is one of the best placed to benefit from a pick-up in demand for plastic following economic revival. These factors have led to the upgrade.
Strong cash flow from operations, stress-free balance sheet and consistently healthy return ratios support the upgrade. On most occasions, Supreme's operating cash flow has been greater than PAT and has met its capital requirements. Its average net debt:equity has been 0.5x for the past three years. Further, the company has consistently maintained healthy return ratios – its average RoE over the past three years has been ~35%.
Financial outlook
CRISIL Research expects revenues to grow at a two-year CAGR of 14% to Rs 50.9 bn by FY16. The core business revenues are expected to grow at a two-year CAGR of 14% driven by the plastic piping segment. Sale of commercial real estate is expected to contribute Rs 1.1 bn in FY15 and Rs 950 mn in FY16. EBITDA margin is expected to decline from 14.9% in FY14 to 14.3% in FY16 as the company is likely to exhaust the industrial subsidy. PAT is expected to grow at a two-year CAGR of 20% to Rs 4.1 bn by FY16. Supreme's RoE is expected to remain healthy and vary in the range of 29-33% over FY14-16.
Valuation
CRISIL Research has used the discounted cash flow method to arrive at a fair value of Rs 620 per share for Supreme. This fair value includes Rs 9 from commercial real estate and Rs 13 from Supreme's 29.88% share in associate Supreme Petrochem Ltd. The implied P/E multiples are 20.8x FY15E EPS and 19.3x FY16E EPS.

Power players of the future
Hewlett-Packard to split into two public companies1
“There's still lots of opportunities in other adjacencies, where we don't chase the market leaders,” said Whitman, who will be CEO of HP Enterprise, the business that will sell computer servers and networking gear and data storage to businesses.
Whitman said HP's balance sheet had improved markedly over the past few years, allowing the company to come to the decision to split up from a position of strength.
“This would not have been possible three years ago,” she said, referring to a proposal to spin off PCs in 2011.
Some analysts expressed skepticism about the latest move.
Barclays analysts noted that the sudden announcement in 2011 was disruptive to HP's sales, its sales force and demand.
“If the (latest) decision by HP isn't well communicated or is not well executed, the negative share shifts could be material,” they said in a note.
Analysts at Bernstein Research also warned of “material negative synergies” and one-time costs associated with the spinoff, largely in purchasing but also in distribution. The separation, they said, was fueled by weakness, not strength.
A spinoff of the PC business was last proposed in 2011 by then-Chief Executive Leo Apotheker. HP later ditched the plan - and Apotheker, replacing him with Whitman.
HP said it planned to cut 5,000 more jobs as part of its multi-year restructuring, raising the total under Whitman to 55,000. The company currently has more than 300,000 employees.
The separation will result in a fundamental reshaping of one of technology's most important pioneers, which is on track to generate $112 billion in revenue in the fiscal year this month.
While there were skeptics, many investors and analysts had called for a break-up of HP or a sale of the PC business so that HP could focus on the more profitable side of its operations.
“Shareholders will now be able to invest in the respective asset groups without the fear of cross-subsidies and inefficiencies that invariably plague large business conglomerates,” Ralph Whitworth, former HP chairman and founder of Relational Investors LLC, said in a statement.
Relational owns a 1.49 percent stake in HP.
HP is the latest in a line of companies to spin off operations in an attempt to become more agile and capitalize on faster-growing businesses.
Online auction company eBay Inc, which was formerly run by Whitman, said last week it would spin off electronic payment service PayPal.
“We like the spin and believe it could create additional value over time,” UBS analyst Steven Milunovich, wrote. “In our view, focus is more important than synergies, and it is hard to be good at both consumer and enterprise computing.”
HP's printing and PC business will be led by Dion Weisler, currently an executive in that division. Whitman will be chairman of HP Inc.
Goldman Sachs & Co served as financial adviser to HP. Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz was legal adviser.
 

Advice from a Tiananmen activist to Hong KongHan Dongfang (middle) in Tiananmen Square in 1989.(Han Dongfang personal archives)
Q: Do you think the Chinese government is like that right now?
HD: Some of them, yes. I believe so, I am afraid. Especially the people who are in charge of analyzing Hong Kong.
Q: The protesters are running into problems of disunity, exhaustion, attacks by thugs, and anger from local residents. In 1989, how did you deal with this?
HD: Once you enter this kind phase where maintaining this level of excitement becomes one of the goals, that is poisoning. It sounds strange, how can you not maintain high spirit of the movement? But once this becomes the goal, that’s dangerous. In our labor work, we don’t maintain high spirit for the sake of it. Once we have the negotiating opportunity we immediately grab it.
  It’s the arrogance of power. You think you have force therefore you become lazy.  
Q: How would you compare the protesters in Hong Kong today to Beijing in 1989?
HD: At that time [in 1989] students came from different universities and each university you had some sort of election and you had leaders. And when you make a decision, people know how the decision is made and [if some] are against it, they can follow the procedure to overturn it, but here you don’t have this. At least from what I can see.
Q: Does that mean you are worried about the protests escalating too far?
HD: Street protests have their own rhythm. No one can plan, no one can completely control and direct it, and as I said before there is no democratic process for people to follow here. You just need a small number of people that can be a trigger point.

Q: Are you worried about the government using force to put down protests?
HD: If people are powerful [and] have weapons—it’s easy for people who have those things to look down on others like you’re nothing, a piece of shit. It’s easy for those people to forget how to be rational. Sometimes these people, at some point, they just can’t wait for the moment that they have the excuse to use force. It’s not only about the communist Chinese government. To my understanding it’s human. The street protesters, when they see this, they are psychologically provoked. And for both sides, the irrational part becomes the winning element.
Q: Do you think the People’s Liberation Army, which already has between 8,000 and 10,000 troops stationed in Hong Kong, could come out to put down the protests?
  I do believe the mainstream within the Chinese Communist Party did learn the lesson 25 years ago.   HD: I don’t believe that. People do learn and sometimes when we talk about those people and we don’t like how they did something many years ago, we tend to emotionally say, “These stupid people, they never learn.” Let’s put some basic faith in humanity.
Twenty five years ago, the PLA ran into a protest. At that time, China was different from today. You don’t compare. Sometimes when you tell people that it’s different, it sounds like you are complimenting the Chinese government. But sometimes you don’t compliment or criticize. There are other things to say.
I do believe the mainstream within the Chinese Communist Party did learn the lesson 25 years ago. And I do believe that most of them don’t want to send the PLA to Hong Kong to deal with this. It’s suicidal. I don’t even believe that if the similar thing happened in China in Beijing again, that they would send PLA tanks again. PLA tanks in Hong Kong streets? I don’t believe so.

Excise department are independent organization and it does not work under any company. Hence, this incidence is nothing to do with promoters.
When IT department, excise department and sales tax department have doubt that company might have shown less income and hence paid less tax then they put that company in their scrutiny list and then they make surprise inspection and in that process they take all the required documents and hard drive with them to inspect all the documents and match with the returns filed with them.
During my audit period i have seen many times that most of time they do it deliberately to take out some money from the companies as a bribe.

Medtronic sticks by Covidien deal but will use debt  not cash0
Medtronic in June announced plans to buy Ireland's Covidien for cash and stock worth $43 billion. The company said Friday that using debt made the transaction more expensive, but the deal would still add to cash earnings in fiscal year 2016 and increase them “significantly” after that.
Reuters reported this week that the company was likely to try to renegotiate the structure of the deal.
Medtronic said Friday that it still planned to create an Irish holding company, Medtronic Plc, with executive offices in Ireland and operational headquarters in Minnesota. It expects the deal to close in late 2014 or early 2015.

Equities closed a fifth straight week of advances Friday, boosted by accommodative actions from central banks in China and Europe. That factor could continue boosting markets as sources told Reuters that the Chinese leadership and central bank were ready to cut interest rates again and loosen lending restrictions. Such policy changes in the world's second-biggest economy could spur more market gains.
"The carry-over effect from China, taken with the fact that the U.S. is pretty healthy, and you have a market with a bias to trend higher, especially on the cyclical front," said Mike Gibbs, who helps oversee more than $500 billion as co-head of the equity advisory group at Raymond James in Memphis.
Cyclical stocks - tied to the pace of economic growth - led gains, with the S&P consumer discretionary sector <.SPLRCD> up 0.6 percent. Financials <.SPSY> rose 0.4 percent.
The weakest group was telecom <.SPLRCL>, down 1.6 percent. AT&T  fell 1.6 percent to $34.70 while Verizon  lost 1.7 percent at $49.35 after Citigroup downgraded the stock to "neutral." Both stocks limited the Dow's advance.
RenaissanceRe Holdings Ltd  agreed to buy Platinum Underwriters Holdings Ltd  for $1.9 billion.
BioMarin Pharmaceuticals Inc  said it would buy Dutch drug developer Prosensa Holding NV  for about $840 million including milestone payments.
Prosensa soared 61 percent to $18.43 while Platinum was up 21 percent at $74.05.
Cimatron Ltd  jumped 43 percent to $8.70 on its heaviest ever one-day volume after 3D Systems Corp  agreed to buy the company for $97 million. Shares of 3D jumped 7.5 percent to $37.80.
At 11:07 a.m. (1607 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> rose 10.53 points, or 0.06 percent, to 17,820.59, the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 4.77 points, or 0.23 percent, to 2,068.27 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 25.32 points, or 0.54 percent, to 4,738.29.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 1,787 to 1,108, for a 1.61-to-1 ratio on the upside; on the Nasdaq, 1,795 issues rose and 754 fell for a 2.38-to-1 ratio.

iBall Windows Slide WQ32 review: Workable Windows 8.1 tablet optioniBall Windows Slide WQ32 is priced Rs 16,999
Written by Nandagopal Rajan | Posted: October 5, 2014 12:17 pm | Updated: October 5, 2014 12:41 pm
There has been a literal flurry of affordable Windows 8.1 tablets in the market, thanks to the push from Microsoft and Intel. Most of them try and sell themselves as affordable replacements for the laptop and not as standalone tablets. But how easy is it using one of these tablets, without a keyboard to work on? I lived with the new iBall Windows Slide – WQ32 tablet for a week. Here is what I thought.
Specs: 8-inch (1280x800p) IPS display | Intel Atom 1.83 GHz Z3735D processor  | 2GB RAM | 16 GB internal memory + 64GB external | 5MP rear camera, 2MP front | 3G, Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth 4, Micro HDMI | 14Wh Polymer Battery | Windows 8.1
Price: Rs 16,999
Design: This iBall Slide has a regular run-of-the-mill design. Without the Windows home button you would not be able to differentiate this from an Android tablet. The micro-US and micro-HDMI ports are on top, the power and volume keys on the right and the flap covering the SIM and micro-DS card slots just under it. The bezel is quite wide on all sides. Thankfully, the body does not feel like its made of plastic.
Screen: The WQ32 has a HD screen, which you are tempted to think will be an issue with Windows 8. But this one is quite good. The tiles appear sharp even when you have pinched all of them into the screen. However, it reflects a bit of light and that can be irritating at times. Also, this isn’t the best screen to use under the sun. The big negative with the screen is the touch, which is not the greatest around. Certainly not at this price point.
Performance: Performance didn’t seem to be much of an issue with this tablet. It is fast and sprightly and up to all tasks you set it. Multi-tasking is easy as with Windows 8.1 you can just swipe from the left edge to go back to the last running app. Not once did the tab hesitate as I cycled through multiple apps. The tablet also does not heat up when in use, even for long hours.
Software: This is the tricky part for me. Windows 8.1, despite having been designed for a mobile world, does not adapt itself according to the scenario. For instance, in a vertical orientation the tiles are spread wide to your right. There has to be a better way to lay out the tiles, automatically, when you change the orientation. On the other hand, the OS is perfect when you have a wider screen to play with. The other issue is with the desktop mode. It is as if you are programmed to use that of Windows only with a keyboard. I was lost and didn’t know what I could do with the desktop when using continued…

Protesters interrupt St. Louis Symphony with Requiem for Mike BrownBy Robert Samuels October 5 Follow @newsbysamuels
Ferguson, Mo. — Protesters rallying over the slaying of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown left the streets on Saturday night, put on sports coats and fancy dresses and sat in on the St. Louis Symphony.
During the intermission of a performance of Brahms Requiem, the 23 protesters sitting in various parts of the auditorium stood up and sang , “Requiem for Mike Brown.”
“Justice for Mike Brown is Justice for us All,
Which side are you on friend? Which side are you on?”
As they began to sing, protests unfurled banners from the balcony that encouraged symphony patrons to “join the movement.”
The group was surprised by the response, said Derek Laney, an organizer for Missourians Organizing for Reform and Empowerment. Instead of being ushered out in handcuffs by police, some patrons of the symphony — and some symphony members themselves — applauded the tuneful message. The group left on their own after about a minute and a half of singing, while they chanted “Blacks Lives Matter.”
“It went to show that there are people among that crowd who think that the protests matter and that it’s not okay to just kill black children, and they’d be receptive to hear that message,” Laney said. “It was a perfect moment. As we left, people were smiling and reaching out to shake our hands.”
Music has been an integral part of protests in Ferguson, and in St. Louis, with the airwaves featuring hip-hop songs aplenty mourning the loss of Brown at the hands of a white police officer, Darren Wilson.
But a flash mob at the symphony was an attempt to “speak to a segment of the population that has the luxury of being comfortable,” Laney said. “You have to make a choice for just staying in your comfort zones or will you speak out for something that’s important? It’s not all right to just ignore it.”
The protesters, who were remarkably on pitch as seen on video footage posted late Saturday night, only practiced the song a few times hours before the demonstration. The demonstration was yet another example of protesters in and around Ferguson trying to expand their base in anticipation of “national mobilization” effort scheduled in the St. Louis suburb next week.

Three freshman senators  same mistakeBy Jennifer Rubin October 5 Follow @JRubinBlogger
In a telling report for CNN, Peter Hamby illustrates Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) difficulties with appealing to two groups with conflicting views on key issues. He recounts an incident when a young woman at College of Charleston asked Paul a question:
Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., center, rides an elevator after leaving the Senate floor on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, Sept. 25, 2013, before Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas wound up his lengthy speech in opposition to President Barack Obama’s health care law.  (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)
A number of social conservatives — plenty of them in Iowa — have condemned the morning-after pill as an on-demand abortion drug, sometimes confusing the contraceptive with RU-486, which can be used to induce abortion.
Noticeably uncomfortable with the question, Paul first gave a terse answer: “I am not opposed to birth control,” he said. After a pause, he elaborated. “That’s basically what Plan B is. Plan B is taking two birth control pills in the morning and two in the evening, and I am not opposed to that.”
Rand Paul: ‘I am not opposed to birth control.’
Awkward. ( Conservatives don’t all agree Plan B is merely pregnancy prevent.)
Then came a gay marriage  question. First, he took a libertarian tone: “I don’t want my guns registered in Washington or my marriage. Founding Fathers all got married by going down to the local courthouse. [They did?] It is a local issue and always has been.. Society’s changing. I mean, people change their minds all the time on this issue, and even within the Republican Party, there are people whose child turns out to be gay and they’re like, oh well maybe I want to rethink this issue. So it’s been rethought. The President’s rethought the issue. So I mean, a lot of people have rethought the issue.” Then it got really confusing:
It sounded, for a moment, as if Paul was hinting that he, too, could change his thinking about marriage.
“The bottom line is, I’m old fashioned, I’m a traditionalist,” he said. “I believe in old-fashioned traditional marriage. But, I don’t really think the government needs to be too involved with this, and I think that the Republican Party can have people on both sides of the issue.”
“You could rethink it at some point, too?” I asked him.
He shrugged, and gave me a half-grimace. It wasn’t a yes or a no, but it revealed Paul’s complicated dance as he tries to color outside the lines of the Republican Party.
It is really not complicated when you simply explain to audiences of all stripes what you are for and what you are against, rather than trying to convince them you are whatever they want you to be. Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) is pro-gay marriage, but also pro-life — as many especially younger conservatives are.
On foreign policy, many of Rand Paul’s potential rivals refuse to adopt his habit of stroking isolationists. No, the U.S. did not cause the rise of the Islamic State by meddling; it facilitated its rise by withdrawing. To a person all of his potential rivals support aid for Israel now and none would suggest it is really fine to eliminate it, so long as all foreign aid goes away.
The problem really is not about marching to your own drum. It is about having confidence in one’s convictions and being willing to disappoint some people some of the time.
It is not only Rand Paul who has this problem. We have written about Sen. Ted Cruz’s difficulty in assuming a hawkish posture, but then voting against use of force against the Islamic State, refusing to clearly acknowledge ground forces would be needed, and throwing up a lot of dust “nation building” (when most everyone who was instrumental in the successful surge knows you need our people on the ground to assist Sunni’s in rising up against extremists).
And Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) has taken heat for backing away from immigration reform (from pro-immigration reformers) and for opposing use of force against Syria in 2013 (from hawks.) As Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) put it indelicately, “He’s a good guy, but after doing immigration with him — we don’t need another young guy not quite ready. He’s no [President Barack] Obama by any means, but he’s so afraid of the right, and I’ve let that go.”
The problem is especially acute when the incumbent president is viewed as a lightweight — unable to govern, incompetent and lacking credibility. Voters will be looking for for mature leadership and frankness. These three freshmen senators, desperately grasping for the brass ring, aren’t looking like an appealing antidote to Obama right now.
All three of these potential presidential contenders are hugely ambitious and lightly credentialed. They have people around them itching to be on a presidential campaign. But they don’t have governing experience. They have not learned that not every difference of opinion can be massaged or avoided. If you try, you wind up looking uncomfortable and insincere. But mostly you appear “not quite ready” for prime time.

Boys to men: Why young male stars are stripping to show theyre seriousBy Caitlin Moore October 6 Follow thecaitlinshow
It’s a tawdry showbiz ritual: The ingenue, angling to lose the child-star image, decides to relaunch herself as a serious grown-up artist. . . by stripping to her undies for a sexy photo shoot.
It’s trite, and it’s a little sad. But at least it’s not a sexist tradition anymore! Because now the boys — ahem, men — are baring the flesh, too.

Nick Jonas made waves last week for his “shocking” (NSFW) photos gracing the latest issue of Flaunt magazine. The former teen-idol lead singer of the Jonas Brothers family band, now 22, seems to have traded his old squeaky-clean image (he dated Miley Cyrus when she was still Hannah Montana) for a pair of boxer briefs and an ab roller. The hand that once wore a purity ring is now seductively pulling down his jeans as the other caresses his own precariously clothed bottom. With both a new TV series (“Kingdom”) and an upcoming solo album to promote, he’s deploying toned pecs, a happy trail and a saucy crotch grab in the Marky Mark-inspired photo shoot.

Hey, it worked for Zac Efron. The Disney Channel phenom, launched to fame with “High School Musical,” made a point of hiking up his shirt to show off well-groomed abs on a 2007 Rolling Stone cover — forcing his proudly post-pubescent body into the spotlight, as if to literally prove he’s an adult. Maybe it’s a coincidence, but it got him out of the rut of teen roles and into some grown-and-sexy romantic leads, not to mention an edgy indie flick where an Academy Award-winning actress peed on him .
Daniel Radcliffe, while still stuck behind the boyish spectacles in the wildly popular “Harry Potter” series, took to London’s West End in 2007 to perform in the play “Equus” — which called for onstage nudity and simulated sex. “He’s proved he’s not Harry Potter, he’s Daniel Radcliffe,” his director Thea Sharrock said when the production moved to New York. Mission accomplished!
The Internet collectively lost its mind when promotional photos for “Equus” showed a half-clothed Daniel Radcliffe caressing a horse. (Peter Thompson Associates, Uli Weber/AP)
But going overtly sexual hasn’t always worked for the young women: Witness Jessica Biel, who nearly got kicked off of the family show “Seventh Heaven” after posing topless for Gear magazine when she was only 17; or Hilary Duff, whose post-”Lizzie McGuire” career never really took off despite (or because of?) saucy photos in Maxim . And the track record seems spotty for the fellows, too. After the first “Twilight” film, young Taylor Lautner lost his shirt, grew some muscles and gained a serious fan-girl following — but by getting typecast as hardbodied eye candy in every subsequent film, he hasn’t put himself much closer to an Oscar.
Justin Bieber hasn’t quite found a look that works for him. The oversized hoodie, sideswept bangs and baseball cap were perfect for a 15-year-old boy crooning to a captivated audience of 12-year-old girls. But ever since a major image-shedding haircut at 16 and the release of the bass-thumping and sexy music video-strutting “Boyfriend” at 18, you’d be hard-pressed to find a picture of the Biebs wearing a shirt (or a modicum of dignity.) His music matured  – and his criminal record grew — but all of that was wrapped up in a tight bow of inked biceps and a wisp of facial hair.
Obviously, the thinking seems to be: If fans and audiences see stars as mature, so will studio executives and record producers. It’s hard to think of a female teen star other than Taylor Swift who has made the leap without revamping her image. So now that the guys are getting in on the act? Well, it isn’t the gender equity we’ve been searching for in the entertainment industry, but eh, it’s a start.

Investor wealth zooms over Rs 23 lakh cr so far in 2014Investor wealth surges by over Rs 23 lakh crore so far in 2014
PTI     Mumbai   Last Updated: October 7, 2014  | 09:28 IST
The 30-share BSE Sensex gained 25.49 per cent from December 31 to October 1 (Photo: Reuters)
Stock market investors have become richer by over Rs 23.33 lakh crore so far this year, as 25.49 per cent rally in the benchmark Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) Sensex has helped the total valuation of all the BSE listed firms reach close to Rs 94 lakh crore.
In contrast, investors' wealth had surged by over Rs 1 lakh crore to Rs 70,44,431 crore in 2013.
At present, the total market capitalisation (m-cap) of BSE listed companies stands at Rs 93,77,672 crore, about Rs 6.22 lakh short of the Rs 100 lakh crore milestone.
The 30-share BSE barometer gained 25.49 per cent from December 31 to October 1 and touched its life-time high of 27,319.85 on September 8.
Positive investor sentiment following the formation of new government at the Centre and strong foreign fund inflows have been driving the domestic equity markets , experts said.
"The undercurrent of the stock market is bullish although stocks are currently in the consolidation phase and buying may resume in the days to come," said an equities expert.
Traders have maintained that the surge in investor wealth is also due to continued rise in listed firms. The total number of listed companies stands at 5,485.
Sensex blue-chip companies whose market valuation is more than Rs 1 lakh crore include TCS, ONGC, RIL, ITC, Infosys, Coal India, HDFC Bank, SBI, Sun Pharma, ICICI Bank, HDFC, Bharti Airtel, HUL, Wipro, Tata Motors, L&T and NTPC.
Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), the outsourcing giant, is the most valued domestic company with a market cap of Rs 5,43,684.13 crore.
Domestic markets have seen smart gains this year helped by robust foreign fund inflows.
Since the beginning of 2014, foreign investors have infused a net of Rs 83,438 crore (US $14 billion) in the stock markets, while they have invested a net of Rs 1.18 lakh crore into the debt market (US $19.6 billion).

Navy tests out automated patrol boatsYes, that’s a unmanned boat with a .50 caliber machine gun cruising around a river in Virginia. (John F. Williams/U.S. Navy/AP)
1. Who is steering these things?
The 11-meter boat is outfitted with sensors to detect its surroundings, and software to help it determine what to do with that information. The software was based on the technology the Mars Rover uses. It’s similar in concept to how Google’s self-driving cars make themselves aware of their environment. The autonomous swarmboats could be part of the Navy’s fleet within a year .
The boat’s sensors detect what is nearby. (U.S. Navy Research)
 2. Why do we need swarming boats?
The Office of Naval Research is developing the boats to better automate ship defense. One sailor could control a fleet of patrol boats, and order them to surround a suspicious vessel. Here’s how Rear Admiral Matthew Klunder, the chief of Naval research, describes swarming:
We’re talking about multiple, multiple vessels that can be in a defensive posture and then when called upon can become offensive, surround an adversary — let them know that you are coming no closer to our ship. But of course if an adversary or threat decides to come closer we can give them another warning or potentially we can say ‘You’ve come too close, we are now going to destroy your vessel.’
3. Will these unmanned boats — guided by a computer program — decide when and where to shoot?
No. The Office of Naval Research says a human will always be in the loop for designating a target and deciding to shoot. A sailor could pinpoint the target and say when lethal force could be used. This is similar to how a guided missile works. A pilot picks the target, and then the missile determines its path.
But there’s a lot more to be resolved before such a system is ready. A spokesman told Breaking Defense that in its recent demonstration of the technology, it didn’t “study the specifics of how the human-in-the-loop works for rules of engagement.”
4. How do the swarming boats know where their potential enemy is located?
At the August test in the James River, a helicopter overhead helped in designating the target.
(U.S. Navy Research)
5. So how many boats will be swarming, and what kind of boat might they protect?
During the Navy’s test, 13 boats surrounded a high-value ship. When the suspicious boat arrived, five of them broke off to swarm it. The boats would likely defend a cargo ship or aircraft carrier. The demonstration tried to replicate traveling through a strait.
6. Should Somali pirates be worried?
Maybe. Automation makes everything cheaper, so defending cargo ships will be even easier. The shipping industry might try to acquire similar technology. One person controlling a fleet of automated patrol boats is a lot more cost-effective than paying eight captains to pilot eight different patrol boats.
7. What if I want to learn more?
Here’s a video from the Navy that shows the swarmboats in action.
The Office of Naval Research released details of the August test of autonomous "swarmboats” patrol vessels. These are unmanned boats designed to better automate ship defense. (YouTube/Office of Naval Research)

Chandigarh is facing immense burden on its infrastructure: First Indian chiefarchitectSharma said that Chandigarh was the greatest experiment in the contemporary history of planning.
Written by Khushboo Sandhu | Chandigarh | Posted: October 6, 2014 5:15 pm
The first Indian chief architect of the city, M N Sharma, stated that Chandigarh is facing immense burden on its infrastructure and defacement of its buildings, and governments which are violating laws.
Talking to Chandigarh Newsline, Sharma, who was part of the team of Le Corbusier, the creator of the city, says, “There isn’t enough water supply, electricity or essential services like education and health facilities. People from the adjoining areas are also depending on the city for their basic needs. While land is being sold in Punjab and Haryana for residential complexes, there is little emphasis being given on the development of infrastructure for the residents.”
Sharma added that it is the officials who are violating norms with impunity, and those who have to enforce laws, are not following these. Sharma opined that the first one to throw stones at Chandigarh was Mohali, thereby violating the
periphery  act.
“The governor of Punjab cannot go against the Punjab government. Zoning regulations are not followed. Advertisement Control Act has been given a go-by. Now, New Chandigarh is being built. There would be additional burden on Chandigarh. So much liberty is being taken with the prevailing laws. When there is lawlessness, planning is affected,” said Sharma.
The city is at crossroads on the need for maintaining its heritage and moving forward. Talking about the clamour in the city for need-based changes by the residents, Sharma says that these are “greed-based changes”. The former chief architect adds, “Certain restrictions would have to be imposed. In a two-storeyed house that was allotted several years ago, if six families are staying now, there is no scope for further expansion. There is also a need for restricting the number of vehicles to the available space for parking.” He added that a plan should be made about commercial areas by the administration.
Sharma said that Chandigarh was the greatest experiment in the contemporary history of planning. However, at present, the defacement of buildings was going unchecked. The concrete in Sector 17 has been painted. There are hoardings present at most places.
“How do these go unnoticed? There is enough enforcement staff. Still all additions and alterations go unchecked. There is need to have deterrent so that no one will ever violate rules again,” says Sharma.

Stock markets gain  investor wealth zooms over Rs 23 lakh crore thisyearBIndian markets have seen smart gains this year helped by robust foreign fund inflows. (Reuters)

Stock market investors have become richer by over Rs 23.33 lakh crore so far this year, as 25.49 per cent rally in the benchmark Sensex has helped the total valuation of all the BSE listed firms reach close to Rs 94 lakh crore.
In contrast, investors’ wealth had surged by over Rs 1 lakh crore to Rs 70,44,431 crore in 2013.
At present, the total market capitalisation (m-cap) of BSE listed companies stands at Rs 93,77,672 crore, about Rs 6.22 lakh short of the Rs 100 lakh crore milestone.
The Sensex has gained 25.49 per cent from December 31 to October 1 and touched its life-time high of 27,319.85 on September 8.
Positive investor sentiment following the formation of new government at the Centre and strong foreign fund inflows have been driving the domestic equity markets, experts said.
“The undercurrent of the stock market is bullish although stocks are currently in the consolidation phase and buying may resume in the days to come,” said an equities expert.
Marketmen have maintained that the surge in investor wealth is also due to continued rise in listed firms. The total number of listed companies stands at 5,485.
Sensex blue-chip companies whose market valuation is more than Rs 1 lakh crore include TCS, ONGC, RIL, ITC, Infosys, Coal India, HDFC Bank, SBI, Sun Pharma, ICICI Bank, HDFC, Bharti Airtel, HUL, Wipro, Tata Motors, L&T and NTPC.
Outsourcing giant TCS is the most valued Indian company with a market cap of Rs 5,43,684.13 crore.
Indian markets have seen smart gains this year helped by robust foreign fund inflows.
Since the beginning of this year, foreign investors have infused a net of Rs 83,438 crore (USD 14 billion) in the stock markets, while they have invested a net of Rs 1.18 lakh crore into the debt market (USD 19.6 billion).

Russian theatre director Yuri Lyubimov dies at97Press Trust of India | New York | Posted: October 6, 2014 5:11 pm
Russian director Yuri Lyubimov, who founded Moscow’s renowned Taganka Theatre, has died. He was 97.
Lyubimov died peacefully in his sleep on Sunday morning, three days after he went into hospital, his wife Katalin informed, reported the New York Times.
Besides his wife, survivors include a son, Peter, and several grandchildren.
Lyubimov founded the Taganka Theatre in 1964. He staged adaptations of John Reed’s ’10 Days That Shook the World’ about the Bolshevik Revolution and dozens of works of literature that did not obviously lend themselves to a theatrical treatment.
He also staged plays that were implicitly, and sometimes not so implicitly, critical of the Soviet system.
Some of his productions were banned outright, others had to be rewritten to remove what the authorities considered subversive content, others were merely criticised from on high.
The theatre became more popular after actor Vladimir Vysotsky, whose politically charged ballads had earned him a devoted following, joined the troupe.
Lyubimov was stripped of his citizenship, his apartment was seized and he was removed from his post at the Taganka after he went to London to stage a version of ‘Crime and Punishment’ and openly criticised the Soviet leadership in newspaper interviews.
He spent five years in exile, navigating the globe as a theatre and opera director, to much acclaim. He was invited back to Moscow in 1988 to help stage a production of ‘Boris Godunov’. The next year he was officially welcomed home, given his citizenship back and restored to his post at the Taganka.
The director remained there until he abruptly resigned during a tour of the Czech Republic in 2011, complaining that his actors cared more about money than art when they refused to participate in a rehearsal until they were paid.
He, however, continued to direct elsewhere, and his adaptation of the Dostoyevsky novel ‘The Possessed’ was presented as part of a celebration of his 95th birthday.

Five workouts for killer abs  a slimmeryouExpress News Service | Posted: October 6, 2014 5:05 pm

1. The basic ab crunch: Lie on a mat. Bend your knees in a way that your feet touches the ground. Place your hands behind head. Your shoulder blades, legs are on floor. Now slowly come up, hold it for a while and go back
2. With weights: Sit on the mat with your knees bent at an angle that your heels touch the floor. Take and dumble. Now while holding the dumble with both hands, shoft your torso to the left. The dumble should touch the floor. Repeat the same movement with right side.
3. For working out lower abs: Lie down on the floor. Lift up your legs. Bend your knees so that your feet are still in the air. Move your knees closer to the chin. Repeat this movement a couple of times. If you want to make this more challenging. Put your hands behind your head, lift your upper body and knees simultaneously and then crunch slowly.
4. Lie down on your tummy on a mat. Lift up your upper body and bring your elbows together. Put your feet together and lift the knees together. Slowly lift your feet up. Hold it for ten seconds and then you can slowly come down.

We worked on 10,000 successful people to identify the mantra for real success. And what we found was amazing. We found that they have more internal freedom as the Gang of 5 internal villains are not very strong in them.

When this LFEAD in us is right-sized, the hero gets an opportunity to express and design success. We now have the freedom to evolve from a loser to a successful person. This is the success mantra.
Even successful people suffer when these villains in them are blown out of proportion. I spoke to the world number 1 archer Deepika Kumari’s coach on her failure to perform in the London Olympics and then going on to win a medal just after two months in the World Archery Championships. The difference was the level of fear, answered Deepika’s coach. The pressure of the London Olympics took over Deepika and the fear to perform broke her.
Master blaster Sachin Tendulkar also suffered because of LFEAD when he was on the way to his hundredth century. It took him more than one year to get his hundredth century. The attachment to the hundredth century was so high that it was not allowing Sachin to deal with the ball as per the merit of the ball. Concern for the future forced his attention away from the present.

I met many people who want to be entrepreneurs and have wonderful ideas but are not able to quit their job to take the entrepreneurial plunge because they have created their comfort zones and they are not willing to come out of the comfort zone because of fear of failure.
I also spoke to many brilliant students who fail to crack in IITs and IIMs. The reason for many is again the fear of failure. Fear is so high that if they are not able to answer the first few questions they actually break down because the internal communication channel forces them to ask “What-if” questions. The dominant question that holds them is “What will happen if I fail”? Doesn’t this question trouble you very often?
Do not ever ask “What-if” questions. What-if questions pushes you and me to our mental boxes, created by our past conditioning and future concerns forcing us to not give our best or even fail. Now our attention is not in the present, and we create a hypothetical scenario for ourselves like – ‘what will happen if I fail, what will happen if others laugh at me, what will happen if I die’ continued…

Wiz Khalifa seen partying with models innightclubPress Trust of India | New York | Posted: October 6, 2014 5:21 pm
Newly-single rapper Wiz Khalifa partied the night away with a bunch of models at a nightclub.
The 27-year-old singer recently split from his wife Amber Rose, 30, and it appears he has wasted no time in enjoying single life, as he was seen mixing with a number of beautiful women at Finale, reported New York Post.
“He was surrounded by models. Wiz was making the rounds, jumping from girl to girl. He also was interacting with the crowd, ­giving shout-outs,” an eyewitness said.
The star, who has a son, Sebastian Taylor Thomaz, with Amber, also entertained the crowd by performing songs from his mix tape ’28 Grams’.
Amber filed for a divorce from Wiz on September 23, citing “irreconcilable differences”.

John OKeefe  Edvard Moser  May-Britt Moser win Nobel prize inMedicineProfessor Ole Kiehn, right, annouces at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm the winners of the 2014 Nobel Prize in medicine. (Source: AP)

British-American researcher John O’Keefe along with a Norwegian couple, Edvard Moser and May-Britt Moser, on Monday won the Nobel Medicine Prize for discovering how the brain navigates.
They won the coveted prize for discovering an “inner GPS” which makes it possible to orient ourselves in space, the jury said.
“The discoveries of John O’Keefe, May-Britt Moser and Edvard Moser have solved a problem that has occupied philosophers and scientists for centuries,” it said.

“How does the brain create a map of the space surrounding us and how can we navigate our way through a complex environment?”
In 1971, O’Keefe discovered the first component of this positioning system, finding a type of rat nerve cell in an area of the brain called the hippocampus that was specifically activated when the animal was at a given location in the lab.
This led to the creation of a map of the room in the rat’s brain.
More than three decades later, in 2005, a married couple, May-Britt and Edvard Moser, discovered another key component of the brain’s positioning system.
They identified a type of nerve cell that generates a coordinate system and allows for precise positioning and pathfinding.
The work has potential benefits in neuro-medicine, especially in Alzheimer’s, where the positioning circuits of the brain are frequently damaged at an early stage of the disease.
This is an undated photo issued by University College London (UCL) of professor John O’Keefe. (Source: AP)
“Knowledge about the brain’s positioning system may, therefore, help us understand the mechanism underpinning the devastating spatial memory loss that affects people with this disease,” the jury said.
The winners will share the prize sum of eight million Swedish kronor (USD 1.1 million). Half will go to O’Keefe, and the other half jointly to the Mosers.
Last year, the honour went to James Rothman, Randy Schekman and Thomas Suedhof, all of the United States, for their work on how the cell organises its transport system.
In line with tradition, the laureates will receive their prize at a formal ceremony in Stockholm on December 10, the anniversary of prize founder Alfred Nobel’s death in 1896.

This is the post-Murdoch-takeover-offer era at Time Warner.
Jeffrey Bewkes, Time Warner's CEO, rebuffed Rupert Murdoch's summer offer of $85 a share — an offer many observers believed would have gone to $90 a share — by setting a near-term goal for moving the share price to $100 and positioning this 25% jump as something of a casual layup.
In fact, the fast way to $100 a share is the kind of deep cost-cutting that this relatively complaisant company has never been known for. This includes, as an order of magnitude, what knowledgeable insiders report is a call to slice $100 million out of CNN's annual budget of nearly $750 million.
Wolff: What next for CNN?
In one view, this is an assault on CNN's long-established and fundamental ways of gathering news — its global footprint strategy. In another view, it is the start of a broader transformation of Time Warner's vast, complex and internecine bureaucracy.
In either case, these are tasks and challenges — rethinking news and reforming its own systems — quite at odds with the company's entrenched nature, instincts and management style.

Indeed, Bewkes' approach in his eight years as Time Warner's CEO has been to stay resolutely out of the weeds of trying to reform what was once the world's largest, and is arguably still the most fractious, media company. This has been his unique talent, to stay out of reach of the tar baby, to manage the mess by navigating around it, and then selling off the most troublesome and recalcitrant pieces — the music company, the cable company, AOL and the Time Inc. magazines.
Each of those units presented intractable management problems. The Bewkes solution was to wash his hands of them.
But now Murdoch has in effect handed these same sort of problems back to Bewkes. By not offloading the mess to Murdoch, Bewkes, in order to quickly reach $100 a share, has to actually change the place.
It is hard to get more down in the muck than at CNN, a particular bureaucratic knot within Time Warner's larger bureaucratic morass, ever resistant to efforts to make it more competitive in a changing cable news world.
CNN, like most of Time Warner's businesses, has a classic legacy problem. Its former success and vaunted brand puts the premium on maintaining what it is, making it unyielding to any plan to make it something else. In fact, CNN continues to make a lot of money: $350 million last year. And Bewkes, by most reports, has been mostly satisfied with CNN's earning power and careful not to tamper with it. Pay no attention to the fact that Fox News makes three times that.
The network's long drift into prime-time irrelevance has been, according to insiders, less a financial issue (CNN receives high cable fees precisely because it is not Fox — it's the necessary counterpoint) than an issue of tortuously bad press. The blowback, not the ratings, have embarrassed Bewkes.
In 2012, Bewkes reluctantly pushed out CNN's longtime president, Jim Walton, and then, after a belabored search, hired Jeff Zucker, NBC's former chief, to overhaul the news network.
But in Time Warner fashion, CNN remains part of a legacy corporate structure that locks it into the Turner fiefdom — that self-protecting holdover of the Ted Turner era still located in Atlanta. Almost immediately, Zucker incurred the enmity of the Atlanta brass by moving pivotal parts of the CNN operation to New York. Atlanta's reflexive and continuing obstruction of Zucker included blocking the selection of his choice for deputy, Gary Ginsberg, not least of all because Ginsberg, an executive in Bewkes' inner circle, might have increased Zucker's leverage. Bewkes, in turn, moved out Turner chief Phil Kent, replacing him with Time Warner CFO John Martin.
Wolff: The rise and fall of Time Warner
While Zucker and Martin had previously been collegial — even, according to some, allies — they almost immediately became the top two contenders to replace the 62-year-old Bewkes on his retirement. (While Bewkes may be able to extend his retirement past 65, he will surely have to have a successor in place by then.)
The nature of the bureaucratic battle is clear: Martin is the financial engineer who may know little about the true nature of the television business but can cut costs; Zucker, if he can move the ratings needle, might then represent the triumph of showmanship and programming, and be the favorite to run a major media company.
Right now, Martin has the upper hand, helped by the Murdoch challenge and Bewkes' need to demonstrate quick results. Martin's program, something of a desperate one, is called "Turner 2020" and is meant to slash across all the Turner properties as well as CNN. And yet, in the bureaucratic rules of war, Martin's public slashing exposes him, thereby giving Zucker someone to blame for what most people see as the inevitability of CNN's continuing decline. Hence, Bewkes' sudden need to actually change the company, and upset everybody's apple cart, may well be a gift to Zucker, one of the most practiced survivors in the television business.
All of this backstabbing, strategic upending and certain low-grade civil war — already the traditional television side, Zucker's side, has largely thrown over the once ascendant digital side, run out of Atlanta — is exactly what Bewkes has for so long so adroitly steered clear of, always careful not to provoke the beast. And, indeed, there are people around Bewkes who believe he has so little appetite for such a fight that he will revert to type and sell CNN.
Meanwhile, Murdoch, seldom at a loss for how to deal with bureaucratic intransigence and intrigue, waits.

RBI should raise rates to contain inflation: IMFRBI should raise rates to contain inflation: IMF
PTI
Tweet
New Delhi, Oct 6:  
The Reserve Bank may consider raising interest rates to bring down the persistently high inflation on a durable basis, suggested IMF working paper.
“Given elevated and persistent inflation,... the RBI may also need to raise rates to tackle inflation durably, particularly if faced with a persistent and sizable supply— side food price shock putting pressure on broad-based inflation,” said the paper titled — ‘Food inflation in India: The role for monetary policy’
Food and fuel inflation in India has remained high for several years, the paper said adding to durably reduce the current high inflation, the monetary policy stance needs to remain tight for a considerable length of time.
It suggested that the government should pursue structural reforms to push growth to potential levels instead of relying fully on monetary policy to promote growth.
RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan has been pursuing hawkish monetary policy stance to keep inflation under check. It has not reduced rates in four consecutive policies despite pressure from the industry and the Finance Ministry to cut rates to boost growth.
The government is in touch with the RBI to set up a new structure to deal with monetary policy issues, including targeting of inflation, in line with the recommendations of the Urjit Patel committee.
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had said in his Budget speech on July 10: “It is also essential to have a modern monetary policy framework to meet the challenge of an increasingly complex economy. Government will, in close consultation with the RBI, put in place such a framework“.
The Committee had suggested that the RBI should target to bring down retail inflation to 8 per cent by January 2015 and 6 per cent by January 2016.
“At the current juncture, with food inflation remaining persistently high for five years, monetary policy needs to remain tight to control generalised inflation,” the paper said.
The WPI inflation dropped to a 5-year low of 3.74 per cent in August, while the retail inflation stood at 7.8 per cent.
The paper said since inflation is mostly backward looking, monetary policy has to maintain a tight stance for a prolonged period of time.

Tech in a bubble? Unease builds over good times
Some well-known venture capitalists have been warning that the good times for tech start-ups can't last. USA Today interviews workers at tech companies in downtown San Francisco about whether tech is in a bubble, and what may be different from 1999. Laura Mandaro

SAN FRANCISCO — If you listen carefully around these parts, you'll hear the buzzing. Can the good times last?
The Bay Area's high-tech economy is soaring. There are half-a-billion-dollar venture rounds (Airbnb) and  $18 billion valuations (Uber). Second-quarter  venture-capital investments totaled $13.8 billion, the most since the fourth quarter of 2000, according to Dow Jones VentureSource.
The war for talent has led one company, real estate search engine 42Floors, to offer employees paid vacations, or "pre-cations," before a job begins. Hitting a San Francisco Giants game for team bonding meetings is commonplace. The city's rents are skyrocketing, and its restaurants are packed.
"I do think that we're probably in a bit of a bubble," says William Taylor, 43, who works in human resources at Adobe. "There's been a huge influx of VC capital over the last couple of years. It kind of feels like the early 2000s all over again."
Taylor's unscientific metric for gauging whether the times are getting too frothy is the "long lines at some pizza joint or (a place selling) the new brownie of the year," he says. "I judge by the lines."
Few here like to use the B-word: bubble. That's partly because suggesting that things could come crashing down is like whispering divorce at a wedding. But it's also because you don't know a boom is a bubble until you hear the pop.
Nevertheless, stratospheric valuations and fizzy perk-filled times have caused a cautionary ripple across Silicon Valley.

First to go public with concern was Benchmark Capital's Bill Gurley , who a few weeks ago told The Wall Street Journal, "The venture capital community or start-up community is taking on an excessive amount of risk right now … unprecedented since '99" — an ominous date around these parts, because it marked the  peak of the dot-com bubble.
Union Square Ventures' Fred Wilson applauded Gurley's comments, noting in a blog post that "we have multiple portfolio companies burning multiple millions of dollars a month" and adding that he has been aggressive about urging his CEOs to cut back on spending and double down on their business models.
Then came an 18-tweet blitzkrieg from Valley investor and Netscape founder Marc Andreessen of Andreessen Horowitz. He thanked Gurley and Wilson for the "vivid alarm," then picked up a virtual megaphone.
"When market turns, M&A mostly stops," he tweeted, a reference to big buying sprees such as Facebook's $19 billion acquisition of WhatsApp and Microsoft's recently announced $2.5 billion deal for Minecraft. "(Then) nobody will want to buy your cash-incinerating start-up. There will be no Plan B. VAPORIZE."
3/New founders in last 10 years have ONLY been in environment where money is always easy to raise at higher valuations. THAT WILL NOT LAST.
— Marc Andreessen (@pmarca) September 25, 2014
That all-caps prediction sounds about right to Luke Stebner, 27, a front-end developer at Scribd, who is particularly flummoxed by the $1 billion purchase by Amazon of Twitch.tv , an online forum for video gamers to watch fellow players in action.
"I think there's a ton of money being thrown around and not really anything to back it up," he says, adding that the frenzy has brought more workers to the area competing for fewer apartments at higher prices.

PRESSURES COME FROM OUTSIDE
Those sentiments aside, conversations with a range of tech investors, workers and observers offer a more nuanced view of both the exuberance and risks inherent in the new tech frenzy.
"This is a very different environment than 15 years ago. I don't see many companies with sock puppets," says longtime Silicon Valley futurist Paul Saffo, laughing at the reminder of one of the bigger dot-com flame-outs, Pets.com.
"The old bubble burst because there was nothing inside," he says. "The issue here is risk from outside forces, particularly global events."
“From the people I talk to, I sense a general unease in the Silicon Valley financial community. The thought is this runway has two more years, then it's tough sledding.”
Paul Saffo, futurist
Saffo points to everything from the Ebola crisis to a newly frosty geopolitical relationship with Russia as market depressants that could crash the tech party.
"This current optimism is swimming against the global economy," he says. "From the people I talk to, I sense a general unease in the Silicon Valley financial community. The thought is this runway has two more years, then it's tough sledding."
That said, tech founders with solid fundamentals should stay the course, says Ben Ling, a partner at Khosla Ventures.
"The thing that is different this time is that we are seeing a lot of companies actually creating value with real revenue and real customers," he says. "But VCs are urging entrepreneurs to get back to basics and don't overspend."
That's often easier said than done, he says, because in the past few years, big investment money has been there for the taking. That in turn has made some founders less frugal than they otherwise would be.
Ling's advice: don't get locked into long leases, hire too many people or spend too much on marketing. "A lot of these (new founders) grew up in an era where they think the money will just keep coming, and that can lead to a bad outcome," he says.
If times are destined to get tougher, the best way for investors to mitigate their risk is to focus not on sexy companies but sound ones, says Howard Hartenbaum of August Capital.
"I don't think there's a real danger point for companies showing good judgment," he says. "Markets go up and down, and strong CEOs understand that for a company to raise more funding, all they really have to do is show an increasingly stronger business at each junction."
MAKING THE MOST OF HER MONEY
That approach dovetails with Amanda Kahlow's strategy to keep her company afloat. As CEO of 6Sense, a predictive sales intelligence company for B-to-B enterprises, Kahlow spent six years developing her product and  received $12 million in funding last year.
Kahlow says she has no interest in raising more money at the moment. "I want to see how far we can go (with this round)," she says. Overall, "I don't think we are seeing as much of the waste, in terms of spending on big parties or business models that aren't sustainable."
Kahlow does, however, sport one hallmark of that crazy dot-com time. Standing by her side is dog Calvin, whom she calls the company's "chief happiness officer." But that furry token is a far cry from the often irrational business plans that came with that first tech bacchanalia.
“The old paradigm was almost a joke, VCs were almost like drive-in windows where you'd tell them your idea and pick up some cash.”
Peter Sealey
Longtime marketing chief Peter Sealey remembers those days all too well. He had plunged into his own dot-com adventure in 2000, gathering a small team to make a go of AllPizza.com, an attempt to aggregate and automate the pizza-ordering service. The company burned through early investment and shut down.
"The old paradigm was almost a joke, VCs were almost like drive-in windows where you'd tell them your idea and pick up some cash," says Sealey, former marketing director at Coca-Cola and Columbia Pictures.
For Sealey, the B-word isn't applicable this time around.
"The good news is today you need to develop your business plan, show retention, continuity and sales and have an operational business before you get a dime," he says. "We got back to the fundamentals."

Ferguson remains on edge as 4-day protest looms

FERGUSON, Mo. — Protesters in this small Midwest city measure time by counting the number of days Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson has remained free since killing Michael Brown.
Here, after 58 days,  almost everyone is waiting for a grand jury to decide whether Wilson, who shot the unarmed black 18-year-old on Aug. 9, will face charges. Businesses have put off repairing looter damage and instead have covered shattered glass with wooden boards.
Demonstrators continue to call for an arrest of the white officer and say anything short of a murder charge will bring chaos. Meanwhile, city officials and police are prepared for the worst as they brace for four days of protest events starting Friday.
Michael Brown Sr., one of his attorneys and community leaders, held a news conference Sunday urging authorities to arrest Wilson.
"We are praying and waiting, crying and waiting, talking and waiting," said Angela Whitman, 44, who started protesting shortly after the shooting. "If we do not get an indictment and there is no conviction, they are talking about burning our whole state down. They are talking about a whole state that they are going to take control of and just start burning stuff down. Why do we have to go through all that? This is simply about what's right and what's wrong."
Along West Florissant Avenue, a main thoroughfare where thousands of protesters once gathered, the streets are calm. Tents selling "Don't Shoot" T-shirts and voter registration booths have replaced armored police trucks and tear-gassed confrontations. QuikTrip, a convenience store that was burned shortly after Brown's death, sits in ruins. Once ground zero for police-protester clashes, the store is surrounded by a fence adorned in colorful ribbons with messages including "Let Justice Roll Down" and "Peace & Love."
Still, many people remain on edge.
Dozens continue to protest daily outside the Ferguson Police station. On Saturday night, during an intermission of the St. Louis Symphony and Chorus' performance of Brahms' Requiem, several dozen people unfurled banners from the balcony — one said "Requiem for Mike Brown 1996-2014" — chanted and sang about "justice for Mike Brown." They left peacefully, and the performance resumed.
The anger and passion that led thousands to take to the streets in the days after Brown's death hasn't gone away, said Whitman, a disc jockey who lives 2 miles away in Berkeley. Instead, she and others are watching the news closely. That includes a report about a tweet that said, "I know someone sitting on the grand jury of this case There isn't enough at this point to warrant an arrest."
Edward Magee, spokesman for St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch, said his office is investigating the tweet. Grand jury proceedings are supposed to be secret.
McCulloch had said the grand jury's decision would probably come in October, but Magee told USA TODAY that the date has been pushed back.
"Evidence is being presented to the grand jury when they are all available to meet," Magee said. "We have a very rough estimate of them being completed in mid-November."
That timeline has frustrated Monique Abby, a Ferguson resident who is an attorney. "The community does not have a sense of closure when things are continually pushed back," she said. "It feels like it's going to get a lot worse before it gets better."
Mayor James Knowles III, 35, said, "Either way, somebody is going to be upset — one side or another. We are obviously preparing for all worst-case scenarios."
That worst-case scenario is why Dan Nguyen, a cashier at Northland Chop Suey, takes restaurant orders in the shadows of boarded-up windows and doors. The store hasn't replaced the glass that was smashed because looters could be back if Wilson isn't charged, he said.
"I don't know what to think," said Nguyen, 49. "I hope it's over. But here, at nighttime, you don't see anybody around here anymore. People are afraid to come out. Even our business is slow."
Knowles understands the fears.
"People are not ready to replace their glass yet, and the city of Ferguson is not pressuring them to do that yet," the mayor said. "We don't want people to incur costs that they might again have to incur if there is unrest again."
The question of what might happen if there is no indictment dominates conversations at coffee shops, on street corners and at church services.
The Rev. Darral Johnson, 58, worries that if there are no charges, demonstrations may turn violent. He said he and other clergy members have worked to calm people and keep things from escalating.
"We have been fighting against groups that wanted violence," he said as he stood protesting outside the Ferguson Police Station. "We have been constantly saying, 'No, no, no.' I don't see how we are going to be able to say 'No, no, no' and there's no indictment."
Dhoruba Shakur, 24, of St. Louis, said even if Wilson is indicted, the protests will continue.
"Darren Wilson getting indicted would be a win for us, and that would definitely get more people to join in the fight with us on the ground," he said. "But in the endgame, Darren Wilson being arrested for a crime committed in Ferguson, Mo., is not going to do anything for the systemic issues that everybody deals with in America."
Protesters have organized four days of activities in Ferguson and surrounding areas over the Columbus Day weekend. Starting Friday,  they say they expect thousands of people to take part in marches, rallies and a yet-to-be-detailed act of civil disobedience.
The Rev. Nelson Pierce, 36, with People Improving Communities through Organizing National Network, is helping coordinate some of the weekend's faith-based events.
"It's about saying that this is not a uniquely Ferguson or St. Louis County incident," said Pierce, of Cincinnati. "These things are happening all over the country."

John O'Keefe, May-Britt Moser and Edvard I. Moser won the 2014 Nobel Prize for medicine, the awarding committee said Monday.
The Nobel committee said the trio's research has helped explain how the brain creates "a map of the space surrounding us and how we can navigate our way through a complex environment" that is akin to an "inner GPS."
O'Keefe is an American-born scientist who works in the United Kingdom at University College London. He is also a British citizen.
May-Britt Moser and Edvard Moser are from Norway and are attached to the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim.
The 2014 Nobel Prize announcements ranging from economics to literature started Monday and run to Oct. 13.
Each prize is worth about $1.1 million. The awards will be handed out on Dec. 10, the anniversary of the 1896 death of prize creator Alfred Nobel.

Congress moves EC against Modi's AIR address
In a new initiative to reach out to the maximum populace, Modi connected with people over radio with the programme, giving a pep talk on shedding despondency and use of skills for the country's betterment and prosperity.
Post your opinion here
 
The Congress on Monday lodged a complaint with the Election Commission of India against Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 'Mann Ki Baat' programme on All India Radio which was aired on Friday, October 3. The Congress alleged that it was a violation of model code of conduct as two states - Haryana and Maharashtra - go to polls on October 15.
In a new initiative to reach out to the maximum populace, Modi connected with people over radio with the programme, giving a pep talk on shedding despondency and use of skills for the country's betterment and prosperity.
He impressed upon the people to generate confidence among themselves, including the specially-abled children who are a responsibility of the society, and advocated the need for use of khadi products as a homage to Mahatma Gandhi.
He promised to make the radio broadcast a regular affair and invited ideas from the citizens while noting that he was encouraged by the number of suggestions he had received since it was announced that he would be addressing the nation over radio.
In his 15-minute address that coincided with Dussehra, he sought to motivate people to recognise their capabilities and use them.
"You know, our scientists have undertaken the Mars mission successfully at minimum expenses. There is nothing lacking in our capabilities. We only have forgotten our
strengths. We have forgotten ourselves as if we have become despondents. My brothers and sisters, this cannot be," he said.
Contending that "the 125 crore Indians are blessed with immense skill and strength", he said, "All we need to do is to understand our strengths."
He also referred to Mahatma Gandhi, whose birth anniversary was celebrated a day before, and impressed upon people to use at least one khadi product, be it a handkerchief or even a bedsheet.
"If you buy khadi, you light the lamp of prosperity in the house of a poor person," he said.

As the stand-off between India and Pakistan intensifies in Jammu and Kashmir, the countries have called off sweet sharing tradition along the Attari border on Eid. This cancellation comes after heavy shelling and firing from across the border has left five villagers dead and 29 injured in Jammu and Kashmir.
Defence Minister Arun Jaitley deplored the ceasefire violations by Pakistan and said the Indian armed forces were "fully ready" and are responding to each of these provocations from across the border.
"Armed forces fully ready to respond to each of these Pakistani provocations," said Jaitley
Earlier, Home Minister Rajnath Singh asked Pakistan to stop ceasefire violations. "Pakistan should stop ceasefire violations now and understand the reality that times have changed in India," Singh said.
Meanwhile, Border Security Force officials said that they will take up the matter in the next meeting between both sides.
Congress and BJP condemned the ceasefire violations by Pakistan and said it was a "serious" issue.
"Whatever Pakistan is doing is certainly a serious matter. And we want to tell Pakistan that indulging in such activities is not good for that country," BJP leader Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said.
Condemning Pakistan's actions, former External Affairs Minister Salman Khurshid said it is despicable that such incidents have occurred on Eid. "There cannot be anything worse than this," the Congress leader said.
Five villagers were killed and 29 injured in heavy mortar shelling and firing by Pakistani troops targeting hamlets and outposts along the International Border in Jammu district since Sunday night in one of the worst ceasefire violations.
This was the 11th ceasefire violations along Indo-Pak border in Jammu and Kashmir during last four days.
On October 3, Pakistani troops and Rangers violated ceasefire in Gulmarg sector of Kashmir Valley and in Poonch and Jammu sectors in which a girl was killed and six persons were injured.

CRISIL maintains Spice Mobility`s fundamental grade to 2/5
CRISIL Research has maintain the fundamental grade of 2/5 to Spice Mobility. However, assigned valuation grade of 4/5 to the company.
Post your opinion here
CRISIL Research's repport on Spice Mobility
Spice Mobility's (Spice's) Q4FY14 (financial year-ending June) revenues were in line but earnings were lower than CRISIL Research's expectations. Consolidated revenues grew 15.4% q-o-q and 21.5% y-o-y to Rs 5,413 mn led by 30.1% y-o-y growth in the mobile devices segment's revenues. The company reported operating profit of Rs 11 mn, compared with an operating loss of Rs 102 mn in Q3FY14, owing to higher average selling price (ASP) of Spice's branded handsets and closing down of unprofitable retail stores. The company's adjusted net loss stood at Rs 40 mn in Q4FY14, compared to a net loss of Rs 187 mn in Q3FY14. Going ahead, we expect the devices segment to fuel top-line growth on the back of its repositioning in the fast growth sub-Rs 10k smartphones segment, new product launches and branding initiatives. However, high competition in the mobile handset industry and low profitability of the retail business are key risks. We maintain the fundamental grade of 2/5.
After reporting an operating loss in the previous quarter, Spice reported an EBITDA of Rs 11 mn in Q4FY14 with EBITDA margin of 0.2%. The company has closed down ~190 nonprofitable retail outlets over the past two quarters, which has helped in reducing losses in the retail business. Gross margin in the devices segment also expanded as higher share of smartphones translated into higher ASP for Spice's branded handsets. However, the VAS business' EBITDA margin declined due to weak domestic demand, which was a drag on the overall EBITDA. After a challenging FY14, when the company's EBITDA margin declined to 0.9%, we expect margins to improve in FY15 led by improved profitability of the retail business and higher share of smartphones.
We maintain our earnings estimates for FY15 and FY16. We continue to value Spice by the discounted cash flow (DCF) method and reiterate our fair value of Rs 37. At the current market price of Rs 33, our valuation grade is 4/5.

Poor And Middle Class Giving More To Charity  Wealthy Donating LessWealthy Have Gotten Less Generous As Poor Give More To Charity
 | By                                                                DAVID CRARY
reddit
NEW YORK (AP) — Even as the income gap widens, the wealthiest Americans are giving a smaller share of their income to charity, while poor and middle-income people are donating a larger share, according to an extensive analysis of IRS data conducted by the Chronicle of Philanthropy.
The Chronicle, a leading source of news coverage of the nonprofit world, said in a report being released Monday that Americans who earned $200,000 or more reduced the share of their income they gave to charity by 4.6 percent from 2006 to 2012. Those earning less than $100,000 donated 4.5 percent more of their income, the report said.
The Chronicle's analysis was based on tax returns filed by Americans who itemize their deductions, including their charitable gifts. Rankings were compiled for states and metropolitan areas based on the ratio of contributions to adjusted gross income.
According to the report, changes in giving patterns were most pronounced in major cities, where the percentage of income that residents donated dropped markedly between 2006 and 2012. In Philadelphia and Buffalo, New York, the share of income given to charity fell by more than 10 percent; there was a 9 percent drop in Los Angeles, Minneapolis-St. Paul and Washington, D.C.
Tami Phillips of the Midnight Mission, a Los Angeles charity serving homeless people, credited gifts from low- and moderate-income people, for helping sustain its programs during the recession.
"It hits closer to home," said Phillips. "Any day, they too could become homeless."
The Chronicle's editor, Stacy Palmer, noted that wealthy donors, overall, were more oriented toward support of the arts and higher education than lower-income donors, and less oriented toward support of social-service charities.
At the state level, residents of Utah were the nation's most generous, donating $65.60 to charity for every $1,000 they earned. One factor is Utah's large presence of Mormons, whose church practices call for them to give at least 10 percent of their income to charity.
Mississippi, Alabama and Tennessee — also with high proportions of loyal churchgoers — were next in the rankings.
At the bottom of the list was New Hampshire, where residents gave $17.40 for every $1,000 they earned. Its neighbors, Maine and Vermont, were the next lowest.
Palmer suggested that the low rankings for northern New England stemmed in part from low rates of church attendance, but also from residents' "independent streak" and a tradition of self-reliance.
Nevada was the state with the fastest-growing rate of donations as a share of income, jumping nearly 13 percent from 2006 to 2012. Its major metropolis, Las Vegas, was the fastest-growing city in terms of generosity, rising 21 places since 2006 in a ranking of the country's 50 largest urban areas.
North Dakota experienced the biggest decline in giving. Residents reduced the share of income they donated by nearly 16 percent, contributing $24 for every $1,000 earned on average. The Chronicle said that dip could have serious implications, given the increasing demand for social services as newcomers stream in to take advantage of the state's oil boom.
Among the 50 largest cities, Salt Lake City had the most generous residents, giving away 5.4 percent of their incomes. It was followed by Memphis, Tennessee; Birmingham, Alabama; Atlanta, and Nashville, Tennessee.
In sixth place was Jacksonville, Florida — which trailed only Las Vegas for the biggest growth rate in giving between 2006 and 2012.
The report detailed how Jacksonville donors had rallied behind a campaign to improve the region's public schools via a Quality Education for All fund launched in 2005 with a goal of raising $50 million. The effort has borne fruit, with Duval County's graduation rate rising from 53.5 percent in 2008 to 72 percent in 2013, and a new campaign is underway focusing on 37 of the district's historically lowest-performing schools.
The cities where residents gave the smallest share of their income to charity were Hartford, Connecticut; Providence, Rhode Island, and San Jose, California.

I dont know whether DK takes stake in Lactose, which can be the case but I feel Lactose gives oppertunity to have one like Caplin Point Lab.....who missed Caplin Lab.
If everything falls in place, then Lactose will be tauted as another MNC if Kerry or Sanofi takes over.
Buy Sterling Holiday and Resort. Looks excellent to me perticularly after Thomas& Cook has takenover it and moreover when a business tycoon from USA, Donald Trump has shown interest in investing in India in Realty and Hotel space.
I have recomended Sterling Holidat some days back on its board.
If u have any question go there and ask because I feel bad discussing it here as we are doing now, like discussing Lactose on Mold Tek board.

Roy demands restoration of access to special facilities in TiharRoy demands restoration of access to special facilities in Tihar
Press Trust of India | New Delhi Oct 06, 2014 04:45 PM IST
Jailed chief of Sahara group Subrata Roy has sought immediate restoration of all the facilities like use of an air-conditioned office, phone, internet and video-conferencing in the Tihar prison to complete negotiations for sale of his luxury hotels abroad.
In a letter to Tihar authorities, Roy said 80% of the negotiations were over to sell his hotels in London and New York and withdrawal of the facilities on September 30 may result in lapse of the deal.
The Sahara Chief has also sought special security, saying he faces threat inside jail premises.
On October 1, Roy was sent back to his cell in Tihar at the end of the period granted by the Supreme Court for stay at the air-conditioned facility in the complex to negotiate sale of his overseas hotels.
"Subrata Roy in a letter has requested continuation of special services provided to him. He has been sent back to the cell on October 1 as the period granted by the Supreme Court to stay in the air-conditioned facility ended," senior jail officials told PTI.
They said the facility can be further extended only after directions from the court.

Basic steps into your footcare routineStory
The guide: Toe the Fine Line
Your feet bear the brunt of your weight, and they are susceptible to everything from calluses to athlete's foot, so why don't you pamper them every once in a while?
   Edition: Sep 14, 2014
Your feet, understandably, are the most neglected part of your body. Located way down there, they don't even complain much - except when pinched harshly by the occasional sneaker. Your feet bear the brunt of your weight, and they are susceptible to everything from calluses to athlete's foot, so why don't you pamper them every once in a while? But hey, before you start panicking and rush to a podiatrist, try incorporating a few basic steps into your footcare routine.
SOLE COMFORT
To remove calluses, soak your feet in warm water for 10-15 minutes to soften the skin. Scrub the rough spots gently with a pumice stone. As rough spots on the soles are caused by concentrated pressure, it may take a few sessions of gentle rubbing before the calluses eventually decide to disappear.
Bye bye, stinky feet
After a shower, pat the spaces between the toenails dry and apply peppermint or eucalyptus lotion. This could keep shoe stink, which creeps up on you during long hours at work, at bay. Alternatively, for sweaty feet, use an anti-fungal powder before slipping on your socks. Exfoliate at least twice a week with a grainy body scrub.
NAIL IT
Women are most likely to notice your hands and fingernails, but that's no reason to neglect the toenails. Clumsy trimming can result in hangnails as well as ingrown toenails. Get yourself a nail nipper with a curved handle and a cutting jaw. Start from the middle and trim the nails in a straight line, leaving thin, white tips. Trimming them into rounded shapes, as you would do for fingernails , is not recommended because it increases chances of ingrown toenails.
File away
Once trimmed, use an emery board to file your toenails - making sure you move the instrument in the same direction.

Monsanto India looks to grow biz by three times in next 5 years: CEOSuprotip Ghosh      Follow @suprotip    Last Updated: September 23, 2014  | 11:11 IST
Monsanto India CEO Shilpa Divekar Nirula
Shilpa Divekar Nirula took over the mantle of CEO at Monsanto India last month. Passionate about agriculture, Nirula is presiding over a company that is transforming from just being a seeds and biotechnology company into one which will provide farmers with services including weather information, farming and seed support. In her first interview after becoming CEO, she tells Suprotip Ghosh about Monsanto's plans.
 
Q- What are the plans for Monsanto in India in the medium to long term?
A- We are transforming into a solutions company. This means that here's my farmer; I will look at one of the needs of my farmer, I may not be the sole provider of those needs. As a company, Monsanto will provide some aspect of those solutions including agronomic advice. But then how do we partner and collaborate with a whole host of others, so that if we can address a farmer, we sort of give the correct inputs collectively so that he can achieve his objectives. This is directionally where we look to go as a company.
 
Q- So from a biotechnology company you are going to become a solutions and services company?
A- We already have one million farmers with whom we have been working. We will reach out to them. There is the issue of reading and language skills, we don't want to lose out on farmers who may not necessarily be able to read very fluently. It is very fascinating in terms of what is possible.
 
Q- In the next three to five years, what are the concrete goals you have in mind?
A- There are three or four spaces. Very clearly, we will continue to focus on our core, which is very clearly our seed business - cotton, corn and vegetables. We do a lot of R&D, which is focussed on developing germplasm, which is the seed required for Indian conditions. India has seven to eight different agronomic zones, and each of those has different climatic conditions, soil patterns, farmers are different, so they tend to differ. So how can we continue to  develop the seed that are needed. The third area will be the whole services space. How we can evolve to become a solutions company to the farmers. As we go ahead, we will seek to partner with various companies who are participating  in agriculture in very different ways.  It could  be a weather services company, for example. There may be opportunities to combine some of the opportunities with insurance - farmers are exposed to a lot of weather risk, for instance, and we are very open to collaboration  and partnerships.
 
Q- Would you consider collaborating with insurance companies?
A- We are open to collaboration and partnerships and it has played out quite well in the cotton technology business. And that will form the central pillar of what we will do in the country.
 
Q- What kind of growth targets do you have?
A- Like every company we have our cycles of what we can achieve and therefore plan. I think we could over the next five years look at growing the Indian business at least three times the current size. That is only possible if we bring what is the most relevant to the Indian farmer. And we are completely focussed on that.
 
Q- Can you be more specific as to which areas these are?
A- Water is a huge challenge in the country; agriculture is the biggest user of water, and many parts of India are already below the threshold of how much the water table has shrunk, for example. That's another area of focus as we develop our seeds for Indian conditions. As we work in partnerships  along with state governments. We would like to work on how farmers would do agriculture more sustainably. A day will come when it might be impossible to grow anything on that land. It doesn't end without tying up the whole chain together. But if you want to talk to farmers and say ok, you are growing a crop which is using a lot of water, and I want you to switch to something else, as a government, or a state government, he would say, who's going to buy my produce? That is the biggest concern - that today I am growing a crop and someone's going to come and buy my produce. Tomorrow I may grow a crop and no one might be interested. So we are increasingly thinking about how can we actually bring those linkages. A big area of opportunity is to see how this can become a more integrated chain. A seed company, starting with the farmer from the seed it will plant to the output and seeing who needs that output. It isn't really easy in the first year, but you will have to hang on in there.
 
Q- Does this mean, for instance, there will be ketchup companies setting up factories in places where there is tomato produced?
A- I think there will be people seeking to find a place where they can create established capacity, so that the produce is available closer. If you look at corn today, it is all over, and there is a lot of quality degradation as it is transported over long distances. We see more and more capacity coming up in starch, or poultry and there is a real opportunity to build these in the hubs where some of the actual production is happening so that the time it needs to travel to get to the point where it is going to get processed reduces.
Q- You mentioned getting closer to the farmer. How do you want to achieve that in terms of the services play?
A- There is an opportunity to get more information out to our farmers. So that they can use the resources that they have to get far better yields or say costs. I think there is an opportunity there. I think farming is the riskiest profession in the country today. You saw what has happened in the monsoon and the peak planting season. It causes a lot of angst among farmers because it will decide on whether they would earn any money which will last them the rest of the year. Crop insurance in the country is very limited, it is largely linked to loans so there is always an insurance cover. Weather insurance penetration to the so-called non-loanee farmers is less than four per cent. This element of 'secure' has a lot of opportunity.
 
Q- What is the workaround for water problems?
A- We are working on drought-tolerant seeds. Depending on where it is in the various stages of R&D, we will bring it to market.

Winner: Kevin P. D'SA, CFO and ED, Bajaj Auto
Under Kevin P. D'Sa's stewardship, Bajaj Auto has remained highly profitable. The company's return on equity in 2012/13 was 44 per cent, outperforming peers. This has a lot to do with the way Bajaj Auto has kept its expenses and costs under control.

"Our concept is clear. Develop very good engines and build a brand around it. The rest can be outsourced. So when you outsource, the entire capital expenditure and the fixed cost goes outside the company," explains D'Sa. The strategy has paid off for Bajaj Auto.

Fund managers  faith in new govt restoredStory
Ready to Accelerate
Fund managers are brimming with confidence in the future, finds the seventh edition of the BT-Morningstar Asset Allocation Survey.

They were cautiously optimistic in the last survey, conducted soon after the new government was sworn in. The latest edition of the Business Today-Morningstar Asset Allocation Survey shows fund managers' faith in the new government has been reinforced. The optimism remains while the wariness has disappeared. Most of them are gung ho about the stock market.
In June, Tushar Pradhan, Chief Investment Officer at HBSC Mutual Fund, had said he would not invest more than 10 per cent of his money in equities. Today, he is willing to take a 25 per cent exposure, despite the fact that the Bombay Stock Exchange's benchmark Sensex is at an all-time high of over 27,000 points and could well undergo a correction soon. "The intent of the government is clear, which gives me confidence that it will take the right steps," he says. "I am bullish on the market."
MODI IN US: PM outlines dream for India in the Big Apple
Any correction too is likely to be small, fund managers feel. "Even a correction at this level will not be more than five to seven per cent," says Nirmal Jain, Chairman, India Infoline Group. "Today, the risk-return is in favour of reward." Pradhan explains why. "For the last five years, market returns have not matched earnings' growth. They have been around seven to eight per cent on a compounded basis. What we are now witnessing is the Sensex catching up." Jain has been advising his clients, mostly high net worth individuals, to invest 70 per cent of their portfolio in equities and the remaining in debt and other asset classes. Only a year ago, he was suggesting just 10 per cent investment in equities.
Motilal Oswal, Chairman and Managing Director, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, was always optimistic about the stock market. He is even more so now. "I would invest all my money in the equities' market if my time horizon was three to five years," he says. "If it is shorter, say one to two years, I would invest around 40 per cent." Overall, the survey finds 73 per cent of fund managers bullish, with the rest defensive. Eighty per cent see the Sensex hovering between 28,000 and 30,000 points in the next six months. And no one expects it to fall - if at all it does - below 26,000 points. Eighty-three per cent see average earnings per share (EPS) of Sensex stocks increasing, while the rest expect it to remain constant at a growth of 15-18 per cent. No one expects it to fall.
The June survey showed two thirds of fund managers expected the average price to earnings (P/E) ratio to hover between 16 and 18 times forward earnings over the next six months; this one has 55 per cent doing so. Not one fund manager believes the P/E ratio will cross 20, which means they do not think stocks are overpriced. Last time eight per cent did think it would. In the last survey, 25 per cent said they would invest more than 50 per cent of their portfolio in mid- and small-cap stocks. In a distinct shift to large caps, the figure has fallen to nine per cent in this survey. But a sizeable number, 64 per cent, are still ready to put 30 to 50 per cent of their funds in mid- and small-cap stocks, against 42 per cent last time.
What explains the optimism under the new government?
Inflation has moderated, quelling fears of interest rates being hiked. The rupee has stabilised; both current account and fiscal deficits seem to be under control. Global crude oil prices are also down. Gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the first quarter of 2014/15 was 5.7 per cent against 4.9 per cent in 2013/14. The survey shows 75 per cent expect GDP growth to remain in the 5.5 to six per cent band over the next six months, compared to only 42 per cent in the last survey. No fund manager believes growth will fall below five per cent. And 17 per cent expect it to be above six per cent, while no one did so in the last survey. "It's not just the change of government. The market has rallied because the worst seems to be over for India in terms of economic growth," says Jain of India Infoline.
The overwhelming majority of respondents, 82 per cent, maintain business sentiment has improved, while the rest expect it to have stayed the same. No one thinks it has worsened. Two-thirds say they would bet on growth stocks - it was 55 per cent last time - while the remaining are still betting on value which they seem to be finding even at current Sensex levels. In the last survey, given the uncertain climate, 82 per cent were ready to invest in public-sector units; in this one more than half say they will not look at PSUs as a sector.
As a sectoral theme, more than half say they will look at infrastructure, power and oil and gas sectors as a whole, no matter whether the companies concerned are in the public or private sector. The survey also shows fund managers prefer bank, finance and discretionary consumer - including automobile - stocks, while they are wary of metals, real estate and the fast-moving consumer goods sectors as a whole.
Fund managers also expect inflation to keep cooling off over the coming year. Two-thirds expect wholesale price index (WPI) inflation to stay between four and five per cent, while the remaining puts the figure at five to six per cent. Likewise, three-fourths of the respondents see consumer price index (CPI) inflation between six and seven per cent. WPI inflation dropped to a five-year low of 3.74 per cent in August from 5.19 per cent in July, while CPI inflation stood at 7.8 per cent against 7.96 per cent in July.
And with inflation fears abating, 83 per cent expect the Reserve Bank of India to reduce interest rates in the near future. About half of them expect the repo rate - the rate at which the RBI borrows from banks, which is currently eight per cent - to drop to 7-7.5 per cent. The other half expects it to be between 7.5 and eight per cent. In the last survey, the sentiment was much the same, though only 18 per cent expected policy rates would drop to 7-7.5 per cent while 73 per cent expected them at 7.5 to eight per cent.
FULL COVERAGE: Narendra Modi in US
This hope of interest rates dropping is reflected in 70 per cent of the fund managers surveyed saying they were increasing their exposure to lower-rated debt instruments. The strategy is that when the rates go down, debt funds will make capital gains as a fall in yields will increase bond prices. No fund manager is willing to reduce his exposure to lower-rated paper in the coming year. In the next six months 58 per cent of fund managers say they will increase their holding in government securities while 33 per cent want to increase their exposure to corporate bonds.
But US interest rates remain a worry. If they rise, as they are expected to, the US will attract funds from across the globe. "The rise in US rates will see an outflow of money from all markets. India will also be impacted. That's the biggest concern," says HSBC's Pradhan. Forty per cent of fund managers feel the hike will take place in the next six to nine months, while another 40 per cent have set a time frame of nine to 12 months. The remaining see interest rates rising in three to six months. The flip side is that there is little danger of the rupee sliding - fund managers expect the rupee to stabilise at the current level of around Rs 61 against the US dollar. Two-thirds of the fund managers expect the rupee to hover between 60 and 62, while the rest believe it will strengthen to 58-60 against the dollar.
Easing geopolitical tension has seen Brent oil prices fall and 67 per cent of fund managers expect them to continue hovering between $90 and $100 a barrel. Gold has lost its glitter - half of respondents say they will be selling gold while no fund manager is willing to buy gold. But the equities market is the big white hope "The best is yet to come," says Jain of India Infoline.

The success mantra of India s best CFOStory
Prudence Prevails
Keep debt low and do not take high financial risks - these are the success mantras of Saumen Chakraborty, the overall winner of this year's BT-YES Bank Best CFOs Survey.
'It is important to understand the customer better and deliver products in the most cost-effective manner,' says Saumen Chakraborty, president, CFO and global head of IT and business process excellence, Dr Reddy's Labs. Photo: A . Prabhakar Rao
BT-Yes Bank Best CFOs Survey
Not many people know that Saumen Chakraborty is good at blowing the conch shell and has even won some contests during Durga Puja festivals. Durga Puja is around the corner and this year the Chief Financial Officer at drug maker Dr Reddy's Laboratories has another reason to toot his horn - he has topped the latest Business Today-YES Bank Best CFO Survey .
Chakraborty, 52, works from his fourth-floor cabin at the company's new and tastefully designed all-glass corporate office on Jubilee Hills road in Hyderabad. When BT meets with him, he is peering into a tablet computer and a book is lying on his table. Thomas H. Davenport's Big Data @Work is about how companies can analyse and use the huge amount of information and leverage it to the advantage of their organisations. Looking up from the tablet's screen, he says: "People in finance are good with numbers but today you need to be able to connect the dots, be good at pattern recognition, generate new insights, come up with hypothesis, test it and help the management take a better and more informed decision."
A physics topper in college, Chakraborty graduated from the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, in 1984, the year Dr Reddy's was founded, and joined the drug maker in 2002. While it is still early days for Indian companies to talk about using big data, he is already looking to beef up his 200-strong finance team's skills in areas such as analytics and statistical modelling. He understands the spin-off benefits big data can provide to a pharmaceutical company: Imagine integrating data on doctors' prescription behaviour, diseases and drug supply with data on internal productivity. This, with better planning and an integrated supply chain could help improve sales and margins. "It is important to understand the customer better and deliver products in the most cost-effective manner," says Chakraborty.
But this is all for the long term. How does he intend to keep the company's finances healthy in the next few years?
Chakraborty says the company is making investments to develop products and expand manufacturing capacity. It spends about nine per cent of its revenue on research and development. The focus is on developing certain molecules that are difficult to make and face limited competition. "Our per-product development cost has gone up but rewards will also be accordingly higher. With all of these, we are hopeful of sustaining the wealth creation," he says.

Alok Dalal, analyst at brokerage Motilal Oswal, says Dr Reddy's has carefully managed its finances and has adequate funding in place for capital expenditure as well as research programmes. "Their costs have been under control. They have managed the currency [volatility] well and they were adequately hedged with respect to cash flows and balance-sheet hedging," he says.
Chakraborty says the drug maker will keep its debt levels low. In the BT-YES Bank survey, Dr Reddy's scored high on creating wealth as well as managing debt. Its net debt is 10 per cent of total shareholder equity. It reported a healthy 18 per cent return on equity, a key metric of profitability, in 2012/13. Chakraborty says the company is not taking high financial risks and would not like to be a high-debt company because the pharmaceutical sector already has a lot of operational and regulatory risks.
What if the company needs to borrow money for an acquisition? Chakraborty says the company will ensure net debt is no more than 50 per cent of total equity. The company has "the flexibility to go for a billion-dollar acquisition", he says, considering it has cash, cash equivalent and investments of about Rs 3,350 crore as of March 31. But he adds: "There has to be a good acquisition rationale and not just adding to the top line."
G.V. Prasad, Co-chairman, MD and CEO of Dr Reddy's, says a key challenge in the next three to five years will be to finance the company's business expansion and acquisitions in a capital-efficient manner. "The same Rs 100 should give you more growth," he explains.
What are the risks Dr Reddy's should watch out for?
There are risks the company has to knowingly take at times. For instance, it may decide to launch a generic drug after receiving approval from the US Food and Drug Administration even when it is involved in litigation with the innovator company. Prasad says the company has so far managed to safeguard itself from operational risks. It has also fixed a certain percentage of its operating profit as the permissible risk appetite, and has set up a board sub-committee to keep track of these risks every quarter. The biggest risk, however, is related to regulatory compliance. "While we have taken a lot of measures to build a culture and a robust process to effectively mitigate these risks, it will still be on top of the mind because if you falter here, the effects could be devastating," says Chakraborty.
Currency volatility is another risk the company must prepare for, says Dalal of Motilal Oswal. He expects foreign-exchange volatility over the next two to three months depending on government policies. Any further gain in the rupee versus the US dollar could pose a challenge because the company gets a large part of its revenue from exports, he says.
Chakraborty is aware of this risk as well and says the company hedges all balance-sheet items completely. The drug maker also hedges 40 to 60 per cent of its forecasted net cash flow over next 18 months. But, hedging for him is not a profit-making tool. "We are not in the business of speculation and making money from it," he says. "Hedging to us is only to mitigate risks to our main business, which is developing products and selling them to make money."

Your personal finance queries answeredResolving Financial Dilemmas
TAXATION
Q- I and my wife filed our IT returns online. Both acknowledgements, duly signed by us, were sent to the IT Department in the same envelope but my wife did not receive a confirmation. As a result, I had to resend the acknowledgement by post for my wife. My CA said that one can send only a single acknowledgement in a cover. Please clarify. -Veer Agnihotri, Mumbai
A- You can send multiple ITR V in one envelope, so that may not be the reason for your wife not receiving the confirmation. There may have been some other point that may have escaped your attention, so you should re-check the returns for any mistakes or omissions.
Q- Is interest earned on bank FD worth Rs 90,000 per annum tax-free or is it taxable for an unemployed housewife? -Asha Sharma, Pune
A- Interest on fixed deposit in taxable but as per tax laws the basic exemption from tax to all residents (other than senior citizen) is Rs 2 lakh. Hence, there will be no tax if your income is below Rs 2 lakh even if the interest on fixed deposit is fully taxable.
Q- I have taken a housing loan and am paying the EMIs from my savings account. However, the property has been purchased in my wife's name. Can I avail of tax benefits on the principal and interest payments for the loan? -Saroj Sinha, Thane
A- No, you are not in a position to claim the tax benefit since you are not the owner of house property. However, if you have given money to your wife for buying the property for initial down payment as well as all EMIs than you can claim under clubbing of income from spouse/wife. As per tax laws the ownership will be deemed on the basis of contribution in purchase cost and tax benefit can be allowed after possession.
Q- I am a sub-agent for a fixed deposit broker. My commission income exceeded Rs 5,000 this year and the broker has deducted 10% tax at source. Is he justified in doing so? -Ketan Sharma, Delhi
A- Yes, the broker can deduct a TDS of 10% is if the commission during a financial year exceeds Rs 5,000. In case you do not provide your permanent account number, the TDS can be deducted at 20%. You can claim the refund of TDS by filing income tax return if your income is taxable at lower rate
INVESTING
Q- I am a 26-year-old engineer and recently received a bonus of Rs 50,000. I wish to invest the money in mutual funds, but I have been told that lump sum investments in mutual funds should be avoided. I will need the corpus in about four years. I have a medium-risk appetite. Where should I invest the money? -Harsh Patel, e-mail
A- Investing a lump sum in equity mutual funds is not advisable as it doesn't offer you a spread of investing at various points in the market. If the market goes down post the period of lump sum investment you tend to lose from this strategy. Mutual fund houses offer this option called as Systematic Transfer Plan (STP) where you can move the entire lump sum amount into a liquid fund of a particular fund house and invest into the equity scheme of the same fund house on a weekly/monthly basis. This way, a pre-determined amount would be transferred internally from liquid to equity every week/month. Since your risk appetite is medium, you can consider directing the equity into a large-cap fund with a good performance track record which invests predominantly into bluechip companies with good business models. You can consider funds like the ICICI Prudential Focused Blue Chip, Birla Sunlife Frontline Equity and HDFC Top 200. You can also consider balanced funds like HDFC Prudence and ICICI Prudential Balanced.
Q- I have started working recently and wish to invest Rs 5,000 a month in mutual funds. However, my father thinks that it is smarter to first start with recurring deposits and then move to mutual funds in order to first learn the art of saving. What are the considerations that I should keep in mind before choosing one of the two options? -Ravi Goenka, Delhi
A- Although recurring deposit is a good investment tool, in the long run it does not help you beat inflation. Also, any interest earned from this avenue would be taxable as per your tax slab thereby reducing your net yield. I would suggest you invest in a combination of RDs and SIPs in equity mutual funds as this will give you a first-hand learning experience. For mutual funds, you can consider investing the amount in a couple of equity mutual funds. Any long-term capital gains arising from these funds would be tax free in nature which will help you earn a better return and will eventually lead to long-term asset creation which should be the objective of each individual investor. Mutual fund investments are subject to market risks and any investment done in equity should be with a horizon of at least three to five years. An individual should diversify his risk by investing in a couple of funds based on his risk appetite; one being a largecap fund which invests in bluechip companies with proven track record and a mid-cap fund which invests into companies with emerging business models and are next potential blue-chip companies.
INSURANCE
Q- My parents are 64 and 60 years old and my dad suffers from polio and diabetes. I can pay a premium of up to Rs 12,000 per year. Which mediclaim policy will suit me and my parents? -RKumar, via email
A- A Under a family floater plan, the premium depends on the age and health status of the eldest member of the family. Hence, a family floater will not be a cost-effective option for you as your father is 64 years old and ailing from diabetes and polio. Since your needs are different as a group, we advise you to consider an individual policy for your father and a family floater plan for you and your mother. This will help manage the premium cost.
Q- My son has a mediclaim from New India Assurance, which covers both me and my wife. The premium is Rs 20,000 per annum. I underwent a cataract operation in June 2010. I wrote a letter to the TPA and the company claiming a refund of the cost, but did not receive a reply. The office says that a cataract operation is not covered for the first two years of the policy. Is this policy applicable if we do not stay with our son? Will the premium reduce if we continue with the policy? -Chandra Bhushan, Mumbai
A- All health insurance policies come with a waiting period for certain pre-defined ailments that are covered only on the completion of waiting period. Cataract is usually covered after a waiting period of 2-3 years, depending on the plan you choose. Regarding the continuation of the coverage if you do not reside with your son, we recommend you to check the policy documents to ensure your policy coverage is not affected by residential location. Please note there are a few policies that charge differential premium with respect to the location while many other insurers don't. As the health insurance policy covers you and your son, we assume that it is a family floater plan. The premium of a family floater health insurance plan always depends on the age and health status of the eldest member of the family. The premium amount does not reduce over time but continuing such a policy certainly gives you benefits like no-claim bonus, free health checkups etc.
Q- I have owned a credit card for the past nine years, but have barely used it during this time. A few months ago, I was surprised to find that my daily limit for the credit card has been reduced substantially. Does this impact my credit score? Is a person's credit limit indicative of their credit appetite ? -Balram Bansode, Mumbai
A- The banks set limits based on many factors, namely: your disposable income, your transaction history, years of association with the bank, credit profile, bank policy and your current economic environment etc. The credit limit reduction initiatives are undertaken by banks under multiple circumstances. One of these is also to contain the transaction fraud risks associated with dormant cards. Generally, in such cases when it's a non-derogatory reduction, the banks will be glad to re-consider your credit limits when you present your repayment capacity in terms of income stability, etc. From a financial discipline perspective, it is not recommended that you hold credit cards that are dormant for a very long time. This is however not viewed as an adverse occurrence comparable to repayment defaults.
LOANS
Q- Three years ago I started repaying my education loan of Rs 8 lakh. My father wants to prepay the loan for me. However, I heard from a friend that prepaying a loan can negatively impact my credit score. Is this true? In such a case, should I prepay the loan? Roshan Ilahi , Mumbai
A- Pre-payment of loan does not imply any drop in ability or intention of disciplined debt servicing. Hence, generally, the credit score is unlikely to be negatively impacted by loan prepayment. Reduction in unsecured debt may actually influence your credit profile positively.

Amazon to sell packaged food and beverages in IndiaAmazon to sell packaged food and beverages in India
Reuters   October 02, 2014
Comments
Online retailer Amazon.com Inc plans to sell packaged food and beverages in India from mid-October, the Economic Times reported, citing a person familiar with the matter.
Amazon, which has already started accepting bookings for Coco-Cola Zero - the beverage's low-calorie variant, will eventually start selling fresh food in India, the ET said.
Amazon is already in talks with brands like Kelloggs and Cornitos, the paper said.
Amazon India did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Amazon, which opened its Indian website last June, has drawn up the battle lines by slashing prices, launching same-day delivery, adding new product categories and embarking on a high-voltage advertisement campaign.
In July, Amazon said it will invest a further $2 billion in India after the country's largest e-tailer Flipkart attracted $1 billion of fresh funds, raising the stakes in a nascent but fast-growing e-commerce sector.

Appointment of A Subramanian as India adviser hits Modi hurdleAppointment of A Subramanian as India adviser hits Modi hurdle

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has not decided whether to appoint US-based economist Arvind Subramanian as the government's chief economic adviser, a senior government source told Reuters, in a delay that may impact policy and budget preparations.
Subramanian, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, was informally recommended to the post by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley more than a month ago but Modi still wants to discuss the appointment, the source said.
Jaitley was admitted to a private hospital in New Delhi on Sept. 1 for gastric bypass surgery to treat a long-standing diabetic condition. He was re-admitted to hospital last week and has yet to be discharged.
"It was still under consultation between the finance minister and the prime minister. Then the finance minister got sick," the source said.
Nationalist leader Modi has unleashed a slew of measures aimed at making India a more attractive place to do business, but has disappointed some backers who had hoped he would take more decisive action to promote a recovery.
Other senior advisory positions remain unfilled, including in the prime minister's office, leading some of Modi's reform-minded followers to worry about a lack of economic heavyweights in the administration.
The post of chief economic adviser is a high-profile position that was last filled by another internationally renowned academic long based in the United States, former International Monetary Fund chief economist Raghuram Rajan, who is now India's central bank governor.
Traditionally, the chief adviser is responsible for producing the annual Economic Survey - a document on the state of economy that underpins the drafting of the budget - and a mid-year economic update that is presented to parliament.
Jaitley's first full-year budget is due in February.
The government is also discussing whether to change the remit of the economic adviser to include wider responsibilities, another source said.
Last month, Modi closed the Planning Commission, a lingering vestige of India's early attempt to mimic the Soviet command economy. Now the government is considering whether to make the role of economic adviser part of an institution to replace the Planning Commission, the second source said.
"There is a consensus that we need economic advisers in the finance ministry and the government. The appointment of chief economic adviser is also linked to the restructured planning commission itself that could be manned by a few advisers," the second source said. He said a decision was imminent.
Subramanian was educated in India and Britain and went on to serve at the IMF and at the forerunner to the World Trade Organization, before taking senior academic posts at Harvard and Johns Hopkins universities in the United States.
Recently, he criticised the Indian government's decision to derail a WTO deal struck last year to streamline trade procedures by tying it to a separate controversy over food subsidies.
He also criticised Jaitley's maiden budget in July for being too optimistic in its revenue forecasts, saying it had failed to come clean on its fiscal accounting, and that it lacked timelines for passing crucial tax and subsidy reforms.

24 hours with an Arctic diverAs told to Alanna Petroff
About
Thomas
Nearly every week, Thomas Anthony Rolfe puts on 100 pounds of gear and dives into Canada’s freezing waters for hours at a time.
Luckily, he gets paid handsomely for it.
Rolfe, 29, has worked as a commercial diver for Northern Underwater Systems in Edmonton, Canada for three years now. His company regularly flies him and his three teammates to different parts of the country to build, repair, inspect and occasionally demolish underwater structures for customers that operate everything from oil pipelines to power plants.
The job is dangerous: the weather can be punishing, it’s often difficult to see in the murky waters, and there’s the constant threat of malfunctioning equipment and loss of air supply. But it pays well, with full-time workers like Rolfe making around $91,000 a year.
This summer, Rolfe was sent to Yellowknife, the capital of Canada’s Northwest Territories, to complete a number of jobs, including an inspection of an underwater pipeline that supplies tap water to the city.
Here are journal entries from a day in his life:
6:00 AM
I wake up in my hotel room.
I’m not much of a breakfast guy, but I always have coffee. This morning I grab a granola bar, too.
Before leaving the hotel, the team packs up our lunch from the hotel fridge.
7:00 AM
My three teammates, Jesse, Jason and Andy and I pick up our rented pontoon boat. Then we go to the “dive shop” to get our diving gear ready and place it on the boat.
We drive over to the lake, get everything we need on the boat and launch the boat into the water.
It’s about 50 degrees Fahrenheit outside with high winds, rain and choppy water, so it’s difficult to operate the boat. The weather is awful, but I’ve experienced far worse. In the winter, the temperature can regularly fall below 40 degrees.
The weather today: Windy and rainy.
 
The weather in winter: Sub-freezing.
9:00 AM
We sail over to the pump house to meet our City of Yellowknife contact and discuss our assignment for the day.
Yellowknife pumps fresh water from a nearby river and we have to check that the pipe isn’t punctured and sucking in water from the local lake.
9:15 AM
The first diver on our team, Andy, puts on his gear.
The gear includes fins for swimming and a “dry suit,” which looks like a giant onesie. Each guy has to buy a dry suit for themselves. Mine cost $1,535, which is middle-of-the-range.
On top of that is a weighted vest, with 40 to 50 pounds of lead.  The vest includes a harness and “umbilical cord” system. The umbilical cord is your lifeline: It pumps air to breath underwater, lets you speak with your team on the boat and it also has a depth gauge and a video line so your teammates can see what you’re seeing.
On top of all that, there’s a helmet that weighs 30-40 pounds.
Here’s what the gear looks like when it’s all laid out:
 
Here’s what it looks like when it’s on:
9:30 AM
We begin the first dive. The water here isn’t too deep.
The diver – Andy – crawls along the lakebed floor checking for cracks in the pipeline. It’s pretty simple to check for problems with your hands since it’s a nice smooth, wrapped pipe.
(You’re usually completely blind when you’re diving due to the lack of visibility. When I get one foot of visibility in the water during a dive, that’s a really good day.)
On the boat, a teammate holds the umbilical cord to make sure the diver is moving well and the cord doesn’t get caught in the engine’s propeller.
I’m in charge of controlling the radio panel where we monitor the diver’s air supply, breathing and communications. If the diver sees something while he’s underwater, he’ll let us know.
11:30 AM
After a two-hour dive, Andy comes up to the surface.
Since the gear is so heavy, divers generally climb up the umbilical cord to get to the boat, instead of swimming up.
This is what divers often looks like after working underwater:
We use GPS to mark our position in the lake so we can come back after lunch. Then we sail over to a cove to hide from the wind and rain.
12:00 PM
Quick lunch break.
We’re lucky enough to have a portable barbecue on the boat so we can make burgers. I also brought a salad bag.
After lunch, we go back out to the spot we marked using the GPS.
12:30 PM
The second crew member – Jesse – puts on his gear and starts his dive.
Since he has to go down to a depth of 60 feet, his dive is limited to 50 minutes. When you’re down really deep in the water, nitrogen bubbles can start to build up in your blood, which can be dangerous.
We always have to be watching for any hazards when divers go down. Equipment problems could spring up and there’s also the danger of getting tangled in seaweed and muck at the bottom of lakes.
One time I had chunks of steel fall on my airline during a dive.
1:20 PM
I get ready to go under.
1:30 PM
I begin my dive. It takes less than 30 seconds for me to drop to the bottom of the lake and visibility was great. I can see about 10 feet ahead of me.
I crawl along the pipe and don’t find any problems. It’s just me and the occasional fish down there.
After covering about 1 kilometer, I climb the umbilical cord to return to the surface.
2:30 PM
Once I’m done my dive, our supervisor Jason enters the water. It’s shallower now so he can take his time on the bottom.
Jesse manned his umbilical cord, Andy drove the boat and I was in charge of the watching the panel again.
It’s easy to get bored when you’re on the surface. But you have to stay alert for any emergencies and you can’t slack off.
This is me manning the umbilical cord on a different day.
4:30 PM
After two hours, the final diver exits the water.
None of us discovered any issues with the pipe. But if we did, there’s no quick fix. You can’t just throw some tape on it and hope for the best. We would have had to develop a plan with the city.
We’ve covered 3.7 miles of pipeline over the course of the day, but we still have more to cover tomorrow. We mark our position again with GPS so we can come back to the same spot tomorrow to finish off this job.
5:30 PM
We take our boat out of the water and hoist it onto a trailer.
6:30 PM
We drive our boat back to where we picked it up.
Then we drive to the “dive shop” to unload our wet dive gear and hang up our dry suits to dry.
7:30 PM
We get back to the hotel and just hang out. I make myself a chicken salad for dinner and watch a bit of TV.
I also text with my wife, Christine, so she knows where I am.
Christine will text me throughout the day with updates of our kids and pictures of them.
We have a 7-year-old daughter and a new baby son. I miss them when I’m working. Especially when I'm away for weeks at a time.
12:00 AM
I go to bed around midnight, knowing we’ll be back at the lake tomorrow to finish our job.

Gay Artist Will Spend 15 Days In A Glass Box To Explore The Meaning Of GrindrPrevious Story

Gay Artist Dries Verhoeve Will Spend 15 Days In A Glass Box To Explore The Meaning Of Grindr
reddit
The gay geosocial app Grindr was introduced in 2009, and has since spread to over 192 countries, making it the most popular gay app in the world.
The benefits of the technology are undeniable; aside from the obvious -- sex, and fast -- the app helped usher out antiquated views of moralized sexuality, thus opening up a liberated space for proudly sexual beings to be just that. However, there is an equally vocalized downside to hookup sites like Grindr in their tendency to replace intimacy with pure physicality, leaving many feeling unfulfilled.
Dries Verhoeve n is a 38-year-old Dutch artist and gay man who has felt, like many people, both the positive and negative effects of Grindr culture. In a performance titled "Wanna Play," Verhoeven aims to explore the potential powers and dangers of a site like Grindr, putting his life on display in the process.
The artist has erected a glass-walled container in the center of a popular Berlin square and will live in this 2.5 by 14-meter space for 15 days. Throughout this time, Verhoeven will be able to communicate with the outside world solely through Grindr and other similar apps. Everything that goes on in the glass house will be projected on a large screen at the back of the structure, as well as on a live stream on the the project website , though the faces of all Grindr participants will be blurred for privacy's sake. Verhoeven has five smart phones by his person inside the glass box, and whatever happens on those phones will be projected as well.
But before you get all excited, we should add, there's not going to be any sex.
What happens when one replaces the hunt for sex with the search for friendship and intimacy? That's exactly what Verhoeven aims to find out. " I will contact men in my vicinity and attempt to induce them into visiting me to satisfy my nonsexual needs, " he explains in a statement. "In return, I offer the same. I will play chess with them, have breakfast, make pancakes, trim nails, we’ll shave one another or read to one another from our favorite books."
Through his unorthodox performance, Verhoeven hopes to push the boundaries of Grindr -- testing its potential not only in the realm of sex but of personal connection. Furthermore the performance will experiment with bringing both the goings on of the internet, and of gay dating, into public view.
"Grindr brought me more sex than ever before, but the app was untouched by any form of intimacy, we maintained a silent agreement that we could enact our porno fantasies on one another," Verhoeven says. "I felt like a superficial illustration of myself, a man that could fulfill many sexual fantasies, but who rarely went to the movies with a stranger. I hadn’t brought anyone home to the family for Christmas in years. Grindr kept me from dealing with my single life. A feeble surrogate, but good enough not to feel lonely."
"My dystopia was more about sex date apps coming to monopolize the daily lives of gay men. That our search for a deeper form of contact could only take place through this medium, like a darkroom in which men weren’t looking for sex, but were veiling their desire for love. I think something has gone wrong when gays trust each other enough to admit their desire to have a fist up their butts, but can no longer dare to invite one another to dinner."

UPDATE: Grindr provided the following comment to the Huffington Post:
While Grindr supports the arts, what Dries Verhoeven is doing by luring Grindr users under false pretenses is entrapment. This is an invasion of user privacy and a potential safety issue. We encourage other users to report his profile by using the 'flag' function on our app, so we can take action to ban the user. Together, we will work to keep these users out of our Grindr community.
UPDATE: On October 5 HAU announced via Facebook that, after numerous complaints from the public regarding the morality and legality of the performance, it would be terminated after only five days. Learn more about the decision on Hyperallergic .

The Innovative  All of the Above  Approach to Job Creationreddit
With second quarter numbers squarely in the books, we're seeing evidence of the economy's slow but sure recovery. And while a healthy 4.6 percent annual rate increase of the GDP means that the U.S. could see the strongest stretch of economic growth since 2004, job creation remains largely inconsistent.
For six years now, political leaders from both parties have produced a litany of proposals to jump start not only employment in America, but investment in critical industries.  Consider the calls for expanding domestic energy production, the federal investments made in research and development and shovel-ready infrastructure projects, and an emphasis on education programs that train workers for jobs of the future.   The truth is, in today's competitive global economy there is no silver-bullet to create jobs.  We need an "all of the above" approach to grow the economy in a lasting and meaningful way.
One of the already existing strategies that merits increased support is the EB-5 foreign investor visa program -- a program designed to attract foreign direct investment in job creating businesses and projects while encouraging immigration of entrepreneurs from around the world at no cost to the U.S. taxpayers.
The EB-5 program was authorized by Congress in 1990 , with bipartisan support, and has grown exponentially in the last few years. Today, EB-5 investments contribute much-needed capital to many of the industries targeted by policymakers as those primed for growth -- health care, alternative energy, science and technology fields -- as well as those that really needed a post-recession lift, like commercial real estate development.
In upstate New York, EB-5 investments helped get the award-winning Gates Vascular Institute up and running -- supporting thousands of jobs in the Buffalo area -- while EB-5 funds in Arizona were critical in launching the Green Valley Hospital, set to open early next year. SolarMax, a large solar panel manufacturing and installation facility currently revitalizing the economy in Riverside County, California, used EB-5 capital to get started; as did the first new ethanol facility in North Dakota.
In Philadelphia, $18.5 million in EB-5 capital supported development at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, a site that once housed numerous military facilities. After rehabilitating the site for commercial tenants, the Navy Yard is now an important regional employment center home to 130 companies and 10,000 employees. Similar developments in California funded by EB-5 turned a defunct military base into a thriving regional airport and business distribution center.
Unfortunately, much of the good EB-5 contributes to our economy is overshadowed by persistent misunderstandings about the program, and the bad acts of a few.
In the last year, a handful of high-profile cases of fraudsters manipulating the program for their own gain have come to light. As the Executive Director of the Association to Invest in the USA (IIUSA), the leading trade association of EB-5 Regional Centers, I have stood shoulder to shoulder with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) to take action against such criminals and strengthen the oversight provisions governing EB-5.  As an example of this ongoing effort, IIUSA filed an amicus brief supporting SEC action in one case and is advocating for a number of measures included in congressional immigration reform bills that would protect the integrity of the program.
But the misdeeds of a few should not be used to color an entire industry. The fact is, the positive impact of EB-5 investments is felt in communities across the country that have seen new business and economic development projects get off the ground as a direct result.
Indeed, a comprehensive economic impact study found that investments made in FY2012 through EB-5 contributed $3.39 billion to U.S. GDP and supported over 42,000 U.S. jobs overall.
Under the program, foreign nationals who invest between $500,000 and $1,000,000 dollars in approved U.S. businesses are eligible for permanent residency if their investment creates or saves at least 10 American jobs within two years.  By law, there can be no guaranteed return for an EB-5 investment.  Investors must accept the same risk that exists with investments in stocks or equity funds.  And, the legally required job creation must be demonstrated to receive the immigration benefit.  As part of the application and review process, EB-5 investors must show that their investment funds were earned lawfully and they are subject to the same background checks and national security screenings as applicants in any other visa category.
More than 20 countries, including Australia, Spain, and the United Kingdom, use similar programs to attract foreign investments -- but most do not require the level of risk or proof of job creation that the U.S. program requires.
The fact that the EB-5 program has grown exponentially in the last few years -- even with more stringent risk requirements than similar programs in other countries -- says a lot about the global desire to be part of the American dream.
It also speaks to global confidence in the American economy and in the American legal and regulatory system.  Investors must accept risk and do their own due diligence, but they also need to know that there is a system in place to protect them or seek redress.  A silver lining in recent enforcement actions is the strong signal sent to the marketplace that U.S. enforcement agencies will take action if anti-fraud and securities laws are broken.
As the EB-5 program realizes its potential, oversight by enforcement agencies and administration of the program must come of age as well.  In the last year, USCIS has added expertise to evaluate proposed EB-5 projects and job creation data and beefed up interagency collaboration, particularly when it comes to background checks and national security screenings.  Additional measures aimed at strengthening program oversight were passed as part of the Senate immigration bill, and are included in several House of Representatives proposals.
Congressional Districts across the country are seeing the benefit of EB-5 investments in their communities and should pass these reforms to permanently authorize the EB-5 program.  With job growth continuing to fluctuate and the competition for investment dollars increasing, we need EB-5 on the list of strategies to help keep our economy growing.

In talks to take part in a funding round
Yahoo is reportedly planning to invest in the popular messaging app Snapchat that allows users to send messages that disappear after a few seconds after being opened.
CNET reports that the investment round would value Snapchat at 10 billion dollars, though it remains unclear as to how much Yahoo would invest.
The news of Yahoo's investment plans come while investors anticipate Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer's next moves following increased scrutiny of the company over the Alibaba IPO.
Yahoo received a bonus of over 8 billion dollars for selling 6 percent of its stake in the Chinese company.
The report adds that the possible investment in Snapchat also comes as Yahoo reportedly boosts its internal efforts at building a mobile messaging service.

Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos joins long list of global CEOs to call on ModiAmazon CEO Jeff Bezos joins long list of global CEOs to call on Modi
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  new delhi, October 03, 2014

Jeffrey P. Bezos, CEO of Amazon.com, on Friday met Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “Jeffrey P Bezos, president, chairman and CEO of Amazon.com, called on Prime Minister, Narendra Modi today,” an official release said. It, however, did not give any details of the meeting.
According to sources, the meeting was not pre-scheduled. Bezos, who was on his second visit, has left India.
His meeting with Modi and industry chambers comes at a time, when the e-commerce sector is expanding aggressively in India with a number of homegrown and global companies announcing expansion plans.
Amazon, the world’s largest e-tailer, has announced plans to invest $2 billion in the country.
With 243 million Internet users, the e-commerce segment, currently estimated at $10 billion, is growing at 38% year-on-year according to analysts.
In an interview to HT earlier in the week, Bezos had said, “Every country that we do business in is unique in its own ways. India is very, very unusual...One thing that is super unsual about India is that there are so many small and medium businesses.”
A host of global CEOs including Mitsubishi Corp president Ken Kobayashi, Uniqlo chairman Tadashi Yanai, General Motors CEO Mary Barra, Suzuki Motor Corp chairman Osamu Suzuki, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella have met Modi recently.
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is also likely to call on him later this month.
During his recent trip to US, Modi also met heads of top US firms such as PepsiCo, Google, IBM, Boeing and Black Rock.
Modi’s meeting with Bezos assumes significance in the backdrop of the government’s  stand on allowing foreign direct investment (FDI) in multi-brand retail. “If the FDI rules (in India) change may be we will be doing many more things for small manufacturers,” Bezos had told HT earlier.

National pundits make fun of the Nats Game 2 crowd— dckerwin (@dckerwin) October 5, 2014
Game 2 of the Nats-Giants series was the longest in MLB playoff history.
This was both a good and a bad thing. Good, because everyone kind of goes to the ballpark hoping to see history, and this certainly qualified.
But bad because the game started in the afternoon and ended after midnight. Over more than six hours, the temperatures dropped significantly, and the winds blew, and the concession stands mostly closed down, and so some people left. I had friends and loved ones at the game; they communicated their noticeable discomfort, no matter what your weather app said about the temperatures.
Now, there are clearly two schools of thought about all of this. There is the absolutist version, in which no accomplishment in recorded time is more important than staying more than six hours in a baseball stadium for what ultimately would prove to be a rather disheartening and difficult-to-stomach loss.
And then there is the more flexible philosophy, which might acknowledge that some people came in summer clothes to the game, and some people brought small children, and many people no doubt had to work on Sunday (yes, people work on Sunday), and others had similar such intrusions from real life.
Do I think it looks better when a stadium is full? Obviously. Does a full stadium with pulsating energy help the home team? I guess it probably doesn’t hurt. Would I 1 million percent have been flying out the center field gate with my 7-year old daughter after four or five hours? Duh.
But we’re on the Internet right now, you and I, and the Internet does not allow for subtlety or flexibilitude, and so this was the reaction to some of the empty blue seats visible on the television and also on in-stadium photographs: BOOOOOOOOO. Also BAHAHAHAHAHAHA. Also WHAT LOOOSERS. Also WE WOULD NEVER DO THAT IN THIS AMAZING PLACE IN WHICH I HAPPEN TO LIVE/ONCE LIVED/ASPIRE TO LIVE.
Are there folks who left early wishing they had stayed for more sadness? Not likely. But laugh away, superior Internet people.

Push to capital raising: Centre may further dilute norms to list abroadPush to capital raising: Centre may further dilute norms to list abroad
Jayshree P Upadhyay | Mumbai Oct 06, 2014 12:23 AM IST
The government is planning to further dilute the norms for Indian companies listing abroad.
The tweaks planned by the finance ministry might do away with the requirement of complying with the domestic disclosure norms prescribed by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi).
Under the current framework, unlisted Indian entities wanting to list aboard have to meet the regulatory requirements of both the Indian securities regulator, Sebi, and the regulatory authority of the country they opt for listing.
Market experts have said the regulatory overload was proving a major block for the proposal to allow Indian companies to tap foreign markets for equity capital raising, without the pre-condition of domestic listing.
In September 2013, the Centre had allowed unlisted Indian companies to list abroad without having to do an initial public offering (IPO) in India. The move, however, has remained a non-starter, as the requirements prescribed by domestic authorities have been stringent.
According to people in the know, the government is planning to give a further fillip to the American depository receipt (ADR) and global depository receipt (GDR) framework, to ease the requirements for listing aboard.
"To make the scheme a success, we will consult market players on the persisting concerns. We have already made accommodations for some of their basic apprehensions," said a senior finance ministry official.
The ministry is keen on dropping the requirement of having to comply with Sebi disclosure requirements, which market players had said was a major irritant.
Sebi had earlier expressed displeasure with the government proposal on allowing Indian companies to list abroad without having to list here. The rationale behind mandating companies to meet the domestic disclosure requirements was to avoid regulatory arbitrage, Sebi had said.
Earlier this year, a panel headed by former Sebi member M S Sahoo had made recommendations for liberalised depository receipts (DRs). In its recommendations on ADRs/GDRs, the committee had recommended local companies be allowed to issue DRs on all varieties of securities such as debt, equity and mutual fund units. Besides, it recommended issue of both sponsored and unsponsored DRs.
Market players say a major concern remains around taxation issues, yet to be ironed out by the government and revenue department.
"Absence of any issue of ADR should not be a concern. What is material is the availability of ADR facility which brings in competitive pressure on the onshore market. The state should neither promote not discourage ADRs. It should not provide any tax incentive. It must, however, provide a neutral and clear taxation regime," said Sahoo, now secretary of the Institute of Company Secretaries of India.
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, in his Budget speech, had announced the government would liberalise the framework for depository receipts, both domestic and overseas. The ministry had proposed allowing issuance of DRs on all permissible securities but the Central Board of Direct Taxes has not yet made enabling provisions to recognise the new asset classes in the Income Tax Act.
"The revenue department has raised concerns over possible loss of revenue. We are in dialogue to streamline the issues," said the ministry official.
Sebi has sent a detailed note to the finance ministry, pressing for levy of a securities transaction tax in lieu of long-term capital gains on Indian depository receipts (IDRs). If the short-term capital gains for IDRs are to stay, then the taxation should be at minimal rates.
Currently, both short-term and long-term capital gains taxes are imposed on IDRs, unlike on Indian shares, which are taxable only if capital gains are made within a year.

Modi urges EC to probe approval for Vadra land deal in HaryanaModi urges EC to probe approval for Vadra land deal
Agencies  Hisar, October 06, 2014
First Published: 12:23 IST(6/10/2014) | Last Updated: 18:34 IST(6/10/2014)
Prime Minister Narendra Modi Monday urged the Election Commission to look into Haryana government's approval of a land deal involving Sonia Gandhi's son-in-law Robert Vadra.
Addressing an election rally in Hisar Modi said, "They (Hooda government) know that after the elections,
the son-in-law (Vadra) will not get any clearances for illegal deals. So, in between the election process, they have dared to take such a decision,"
"I think Hooda was pressurised from the top (Congress leadership) to take such a decision," he added.
Watch: Modi hints at Vadra deals in Haryana election speech
The Election Commission, the prime minister hoped, would take "serious note" of the state government's decision.  "I hope they will take appropriate action for any violation of the Model Code of Conduct," he said.
"Despite the model code being imposed for the state elections, chief minister Bhupinder Hooda cleared land deal for the 'damaad' ( Robert Vadra) yesterday. The EC should take serious note of this."
"They knew they cannot do anything after the polls, so that is why they approved the land sale deal in a hurry," he added.
Modi's attack on Vadra came on a day The Indian Express  reported that Hooda government officially legitimised the land deal between Vadra and real estate major DLF.
The land deal in Shikhopur village of Gurgaon had been cancelled by Haryana's former director general, Consolidation, Ashok Khemka.
"It is clear from this decision of the shameless Hooda government that both he and the Congress party have already accepted defeat in Haryana," Modi said in his speech.
The prime minister also launched a scathing attack on dynastic politics, saying Haryana had not seen a government in which political families had looked beyond themselves and their family members.
"We want to make Haryana free from this 'parivaar-vaad' (dynastic politics). In the last 25 years, have you seen a government in Haryana which worked for the welfare of people," he asked.
"In Haryana, the government works only for the chief minister and his family members. All political leaders have been running their shops in Haryana for themselves and their families," Modi said.
Modi also took a dig at jailed former chief minister Om Prakash Chautala's Indian National Lok Dal saying that he "did not need the support of people in jail" to succeed.
Referring to Chautala's statement at a recent rally that he  would take oath as the state chief minister from jail, Modi said, "Some people are spreading lies. Some are dreaming of taking oath from jail, showing old photos with them taken in a certain program."

India's steel demand expected to grow 3.4% this year: WSA
World Steel Association (WSA), in its short-range demand outlook, has pegged demand growth for the next year even higher at 6 percent, a significant rise as compared to 1.8 percent in 2013.

Domestic steel makers, who are facing subdued offtake, have something to cheer about now as a premier global industry association has projected India's steel demand to grow at 3.4 percent during the current year.
World Steel Association (WSA), in its short-range demand outlook, has pegged demand growth for the next year even higher at 6 percent, a significant rise as compared to 1.8 percent in 2013.
"India's outlook is improving following the election of a new government which is promising pro-business reforms. In 2014, India's steel demand is expected to grow by 3.4 percent to 76.2 million tonnes in 2014, following a growth of 1.8 percent in 2013," WSA said today.
"In 2015, structural reforms and improving confidence will support a further six per cent growth in steel demand but elevated inflation and fiscal consolidation remain key downside risks to the outlook," it added.
In its April outlook, WSA had projected 3.3 percent growth in steel demand for India in 2014.
Moody's Investor Service had in August said steel consumption in India would pick up once the government's infrastructure spending policies are put in place.
Continuing with subdued consumption trend for the last couple of years, India's steel consumption grew by just 0.3 percent to 31.17 million tonnes (MT) during the April-August period of 2014-15.
AS Firoz, Chief Economist, Joint Plant Committee (JPC), a body under the Steel Industry, recently said consumption of steel would certainly rise in India as a lot of infrastructure projects are already in the pipeline and that was why his assessment of three percent growth was "not a tall order".
"Besides, the automotive sector is reviving which will certainly pull the demand up. Capital goods sector and lot of machinery sector have also potential to do well. So, all these will pull demand," he had said.
Construction sector accounts for around 60 percent of the country's total steel consumption while automobile sector consumes 15 percent. Both sectors have been plagued by a slowdown in the economy.
WSA forecasts that the global apparent steel use would, however, nearly be halved at two per cent in the current year from 3.8 percent growth recorded last year mainly due to slowdown in Chinese demand. The growth rate for next year would remain static at two percent in 2015 to reach at 1,594 MT.

Thiruvananthapuram: Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee Vice President MM Hassan has said that MP Shashi Tharoor has to stop his comments praising Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
"He has been continuously appreciating Modi and there is nothing which the PM has done to be appreciated. Modi is a person who is opposite to the secular and democratic values that Congress upholds. The Congress workers are surprised and angry about the comments made by him. Disciplinary action against Tharoor will be discussed once the KPCC president is back in Trivandrum," he said.
Shashi Tharoor has slammed the charge of pro-BJP leanings. He said in a statement, "I am astonished that anyone would suggest that I am pro-BJP. Being receptive to specific statements or actions of BJP leaders does not remotely imply acceptance of the party's core Hindutva agenda. I am a proud Congressman and a proud Indian. In short: not pro-BJP, just pro-India!"

The world's first 'online murder' may happen by the end of year

London: The world's first 'online murder' via a hacked internet-connected device could happen by the end of this year, experts have warned.
The European Union's law enforcement agency Europol has cautioned that governments are ill-prepared to combat the looming threat of "online murder" as cyber criminals exploit internet technology to target victims.
In an alarming assessment of the physical danger posed by online crime, Europol said it expected a rise in "injury and possible deaths" caused by computer attacks on critical safety equipment.
A Europol report suggests crooks could also use the web to carry out new forms of extortion and blackmail, such as locking people out of their homes or cars before payment of a ransom.
#online murder #europol #internet
The Europol threat assessment published last week cited a report by US security firm IID which predicted that the first murder via 'hacked internet-connected device' would happen by the end of 2014, 'The Independent' reported.
The opportunities for tampering with devices come amid predictions that tens of billions of devices will be connected to the internet within the next couple of decades, according to experts.
The Europol report suggests crooks could also use the web to carry out new forms of extortion and blackmail, such as locking people out of their homes or cars before payment of a ransom.
"The IoE [Internet of Everything] represents a whole new attack vector that we believe criminals will already be looking for ways to exploit," according to the Europol threat assessment.
"The IoE is inevitable. We must expect a rapidly growing number of devices to be rendered 'smart' and thence to become interconnected. Unfortunately, we feel that it is equally inevitable that many of these devices will leave vulnerabilities via which access to networks can be gained by criminals," the report said.
"There's already this huge quasi-underground market where you can buy and sell vulnerabilities that have been discovered," said Rod Rasmussen, the president of IID.
Rasmussen said that while the first reported murder was yet to happen, "death by internet" was already a reality from online extortion and blackmail that has led to suicide.
He said if his firm's prediction of an online murder did not come to pass in 2014, it would likely happen within the next few years.

Chopper deal: Gautam Khaitan sent to judicial custodyChopper deal: Gautam Khaitan sent to judicial custody
Press Trust of India | New Delhi Oct 06, 2014 03:55 PM IST
Businessman Gautam Khaitan, who was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in connection with alleged kickbacks in the Rs 3,600-crore AgustaWestland chopper deal case, has been sent to judicial custody till tomorrow by a Delhi court.
Metropolitan Magistrate Snigdha Sarvaria had yesterday sent Khaitan in two-day judicial custody after ED submitted that he was not required for further custodial interrogation.
Khaitan was produced before the court after expiry of his five-day ED custody.
ED had earlier alleged in the court that Rs 360 crore was paid as kickbacks in the entire deal.
Khaitan has filed a bail application, through advocate Pramod Kumar Dubey, on which the chief metropolitan magistrate had issued notice to ED to give its response by tomorrow.
The bail plea would also be taken up for hearing tomorrow when Khaitan would be produced in court.
In the bail plea, Khaitan said he should be enlarged on bail as he has always cooperated during the investigation and there was no apprehension that he would flee from justice.
ED submitted that Khaitan was on board of Chandigarh-based company Aeromatrix which was allegedly a front firm for the financial dealings in the chopper deal.
Khaitan's counsel, however, had told the court that his client was nowhere connected with the day-to-day affairs of the firm and he had resigned from the post way back in October 2010.
Khaitan was arrested under provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) by ED which had lodged a case in July this year against Khaitan, former IAF chief S P Tyagi and 19 others in the VVIP chopper deal case to probe alleged kickbacks.

Samsung to invest $14.7 bn in new S.Korea chip facilitySamsung to invest $14.7 billion in new S.Korea chip facility
Se Young Lee     Seoul   Last Updated: October 6, 2014  | 16:47 IST

Samsung Electronics plans to invest $14.7 billion to construct a new chip production plant in South Korea, a major bet on its semiconductor business amid a smartphone earnings slump.
Samsung, the world's biggest memory chip maker, said the new plant will help boost its competitiveness in the semiconductor industry, in which it is showing steady growth due to increased demand from mobile devices.
The plant will make either logic or memory chips, Samsung said, adding that a final decision on products had not been made yet. The firm said its chip production capacity was expected to increase by a "low double digit percentage".
The plant will be located in Pyeongtaek, a city roughly 75 kilometres south of the South Korean capital and construction is scheduled to be completed by the second half of 2017.
The chip business is likely to be a lone bright spot in what is otherwise expected to be a poor third quarter for the technology giant.
Profits for the company's key smartphone business are slipping rapidly as Apple grabs the lion's share of profits at the high end of the market and Chinese makers of cheap and feature-rich smartphones, like Lenovo Group and Xiaomi, erode margins at the low end.
The mean forecast from a Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S survey of 42 analysts calls for the firm's July-September operating profit to come in at US $5.6 trillion won, its weakest performance since the fourth quarter of 2011.
Some analysts forecast that the chip division could deliver stronger operating profit than the handsets division in the third quarter for the first time in more than three years.
Market conditions for the memory market have remained favourable amid stronger-than-anticipated demand from personal computer and servers. Industry players like Samsung have also be managed their capacity expansion carefully, keeping supply tight.

Hewlett-Packard says to split in two | Shar...Hewlett-Packard to split into two companies
Hewlett-Packard to split into two companies
The split will be through a tax-free distribution of shares to stockholders next year, the company said in a statement on Monday.
ET SPECIAL:
Hewlett-Packard Co said it would split into two listed companies, separating its computer and printer businesses from its faster-growing corporate hardware and services operations.
HP said its shareholders would own a stake in both businesses through a tax-free transaction next year.
Shares of the company, which has struggled to adapt to the new era of mobile and online computing, rose 6.3 percent to $37.40 in premarket trading on Monday.
Each of the two businesses contribute about half of HP's current revenue and profit.
The move will result in a monumental reshaping of one of technology's most important pioneers, which still has more than 300,000 employees and is on track to book $112 billion in revenue this fiscal year.
The printing and personal computing business, to be known as HP Inc, will be led by Dion Weisler, currently an executive in that division.
HP's current chief executive, Meg Whitman, will lead the new Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, which will house the corporate hardware and services operations. She will also be chairman of HP Inc.
Current HP lead independent director Patricia Russo will be chairman of the enterprise company.
Founded by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard in a Palo Alto, California garage in 1939, HP was one of the companies that shaped Silicon Valley and the PC revolution.
Lately, however, it has struggled to adapt to the shift towards mobile computing, and it has been overshadowed by younger rivals.
The announcement on Monday confirmed a report of the split in the Wall Street Journal on Sunday.
HP is the latest in a line of companies, often under shareholder pressure, to spin off operations in an attempt to become more agile and to capitalize on faster-growing businesses.
Last week online auction company eBay Inc said it would spin off electronic payment service PayPal.
Up to Friday's close, HP's stock had risen nearly 26 percent this year.

Mumbai:
Stock market investors have become richer by over Rs 23.33 lakh crore so far this year, as 25.49 per cent rally in the benchmark Sensex has helped the total valuation of all the BSE listed firms reach close to Rs 94 lakh crore.
In contrast, investors' wealth had surged by over Rs 1 lakh crore to Rs 70,44,431 crore in 2013.
At present, the total market capitalisation (m-cap) of BSE listed companies stands at Rs 93,77,672 crore, about Rs 6.22 lakh short of the Rs 100 lakh crore milestone.
The Sensex has gained 25.49 per cent from December 31 to October 1 and touched its life-time high of 27,319.85 on September 8.
Positive investor sentiment following the formation of new government at the Centre and strong foreign fund inflows have been driving the domestic equity markets, experts said.
"The undercurrent of the stock market is bullish although stocks are currently in the consolidation phase and buying may resume in the days to come," said an equities expert.

7 companies with good chances at big profits7 companies with good chances at big profits

USA TODAY
Companies start revealing their third-quarter profit growth in just a few days. But savvy investors already know which stocks have the best chance for big-time profit growth.
There are seven stocks in the Standard & Poor’s 500 including real-estate firm Host Hotels & Resorts (HST) , energy company Tesoro (TSO) and biotech Gilead Sciences (GILD) that Wall Street analysts are expecting to deliver 100% or greater profit growth for the third quarter, according to a USA TODAY analysis of data from S&P Capital IQ.
Hopes are high for these companies’ profit growth. If analysts are right, these companies will absolutely blow away the 6.8% profit growth expected from the S&P 500 during the quarter, S&P Capital IQ says.
When it comes to great profit growth expectations, no other company can match up to hotel property management firm Host Hotels. The company has been on the vanguard of the industry’s move to reduce their business of owning hotels and shift more to a business model of managing franchisees and collecting lucrative license fees. The strategy is paying off big-time this quarter with profit growth. Analysts are calling for the company to post adjusted profit of 9 cents a share, up 800% from the same period last year.
Another company expected to report eye-popping earnings growth is Gilead Sciences. The biotech firm with breakthrough treatments for everything from liver disease to hypertension is expected to deliver adjusted quarterly profit of $1.89 a share. If the analysts are right, that would be profit growth of 263%. That might seem to be an impossible hurdle until you realize the company actually delivered even-higher 372% profit growth in the second quarter.
Perhaps more surprisingly is the huge expectation for Tesoro, an energy firm. Despite falling oil prices, analysts are still incredibly optimistic for what the company can deliver in terms of earnings growth for the quarter. Analysts see the company earning an adjusted 44 cents a share during the quarter, up 295% from the same-year-ago period.
But with great expectations comes great responsibility. With expectations for these companies so high already, it makes it that much higher to beat views. And during earnings season, investors are usually most impressed with the companies that manage to do better than expected, even though not much was expected.
Keep in mind, too, that these expectations are disseminated and priced into investors’ valuations of the stocks. High hopes for future profits often create high valuations. All but one of the stocks, Health Care REIT (HCN) are rated “outperform” by the average Wall Street analysts.
But five of the seven stocks already have “dangerously” high prices, according to New Constructs , a stock research firm that compares stocks’ current value with the current value of future cash flows. The two stocks with lukewarm “neutral” ratings are Gilead and Marathon Petroleum (MPC) .
It won’t be long before investors see if these companies can meet — or better yet beat — the sky-high expectations set for them.
Below are the seven stocks in the S&P 500 that are expected to deliver 100% or greater adjusted earnings growth:

Mercedes to make CLA-Class sedan at Chakan
Rutam Vora

Production likely to begin from first quarter of 2015 at Chakan unit
Ahmedabad, Oct 6:  
Luxury car maker Mercedes-Benz India is planning to locally produce one of its global hotcake models – CLA Class Sedan at its Chakan facility near Pune. The CLA Class Sedan, which will be the sixth model from Mercedes-Benz India’s stable to be manufactured locally, is slated to be launched in India by the first quarter of 2015.
On the sidelines of a launch in Ahmedabad on Monday, Boris Fitz, vice-president – Sales and Network Development, Mercedes-Benz India Pvt Ltd confirmed that Mercedes’s CLA Class Sedan will be manufactured locally. However, it is not yet clear as to when the production will begin.
The localisation is believed to help company reduce costs and give a competitive price to the new model. However, the prices were not revealed at present. The model is believed to compete with Audi's A3 sedan in India.
Currently, Mercedes makes five models, three sedans – S-Class, E-Class, C-Class and two SUV models GL-Class and the M-Class locally. The A-Class, B-Class, CLS-Class and SLK-Class are Completely Built Imported units.
Mercedes is sourcing about 40 per cent of its required parts for the five models from Indian suppliers. This includes engine, transmission, wiring, and paint among others.
Notably, at the 12th Auto Expo held in New Delhi earlier this year, Mercedes-Benz had showcased the CLA 45 AMG, which had received good amount of attention from car enthusiasts.
The German car maker has already initiated expansion at its Chakan facility to double the capacity from the existing 10,000 units per year. “We had invested Rs 600 crore for setting up this plant. The doubling of the capacity will be done with an additional investment of Rs 250 crore at the same site,” said Boris Fitz, vice-president – Sales and Network Development, Mercedes-Benz India Pvt Ltd.
According to Fitz, the luxury car segment in the country has witnessed increased interest from young buyers. “We are experiencing more demand for our luxury compact cars A and B Class from young customers including women. Also SUVs like GL, GLA and M-Class are high in demand from the next generation customers. These segments are growing faster than the traditional sedan segments,” said Fitz, who was in town for launch of GLA-Class SUV in the state.
Out of the total car sales of 7,529 units during January-September 2014 period, about 20 per cent is compact cars (A-Class and B-Class), while 25 per cent is SUVs. The SUV segment has witnessed 100 per cent sales growth against last year, while overall sales have increased by 16 per cent against last year.
Mercedes-Benz has so far received 600 bookings from across the country for its recently-launched SUV GLA-Class.
“Out of 600 bookings nationally, about 70 are from Gujarat. The state is a big market for Mercedes. Gujarat contributes nearly 7.5 per cent to national sales,” said Sanjay Thakker, chairman, Benchmark Cars – a Mercedes dealer in Ahmedabad. Mercedes has four showrooms across Gujarat, while nationally it has 65 outlets spread across 36 cities.

I am at a level where I can win an Olympic gold  says YogeshwarDuttPress Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: October 6, 2014 6:00 pm
Happy to have ended India’s 28-year-long wait for a wrestling gold at the recent Asian Games, star grappler Yogeshwar Dutt is now aiming for a yellow metal at next year’s World Championships and thereby earn an automatic berth in the 2016 Rio Olympics.
“Next year my main target will be the World Wrestling Championships. I have got medals in all, important tournaments except World Championships, so I would like to win a medal there and preferably a gold,” Yogeshwar told PTI in an interview.
“World Championships will be the platform to qualify for the 2016 Rio Olympics and if I win a medal there that would automatically guarantee a berth in the Olympic Games,” he added.
To be held in Las Vegas in September next year, the World Wrestling Championships will serve as the first qualifying event for the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. In this event, the largest number of athletes will earn a spot in the Olympics.
Yogeshwar has won gold in all three tournaments – International wrestling tournament in Sassari city, Italy, Commonwealth Games in Glasgow and Asiad in Incheon — after moving to a higher weight category of 65kg freestyle. He said the new weight division has suited him well.
“I have performed very well in this weight category. I am at a level now where I can say that I am among the best wrestlers in world in this division. I am at a level where I can win an Olympic gold.
“This category is suiting me well. In Italy, I defeated the world champion, while in CWG none of my bouts lasted more than two minutes. In Asian Games also I did well,” said
Yogeshwar, adding, “I am happy to have won a gold for my country after 28 years. It was a long wait.”
The London Olympic bronze medallist admitted that he had faced some tough competition at the Asian Games.
“The bouts in Asian Games were very difficult. The grapplers of the Asian region are of the level of World and Olympics. I faced tough competition from North Korea, China and Tajikistan. Against the Chinese grappler in the semifinal round, the bout was a very closely-fought one,” explained Yogeshwar.
The 31-year-old Yogeshwar said that the recent Games has boosted his confidence.
“These Games have boosted my confidence. I am now more confident of performing well at the Olympics,” he insisted. “Competition would only increase in the Olympics with wrestlers coming from Europe and USA also. But a lot of Olympic champions are from the Asian region and thus, these Games have helped me judge where I stand.”
Talking about Indian wrestlers’ overall performance in the Asian Games, Yogeshwar said they fell short by at least two medals.
“The other countries are also improving. Competition has increased. We continued…
I am at a level now where I can say that I am among the best wrestlers in world in this division

Global semiconductor sales to touch all-time high of $338 billion: Gartner

Gartner
MUMBAI: Worldwide semiconductor revenue is on pace to reach $338 billion this year, clipping at 7.2 per cent growth over last year and up from the previous forecast of 6.7 per cent, says Gartner.
"Semiconductor revenue set an all-time record in the third quarter of 2014, fuelled by a strong electronics build for the holiday season," said Gartner research Director Jon Erensen said in a report.
"Get ready for a flood of new product launches, ranging from simple low-cost tablets to high-end ultramobiles and smartphones. Demand for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus has been robust, but there is concern for other types of devices planned for the holidays," he added.
While some products may not sell in the holiday season, Gartner remains bullish on 2014 consumer demand and forecasts 2014 production of smartphones and ultramobiles to rise 27 per cent and 18.9 per cent, respectively.
The semiconductor market is expected to grow 5.8 per cent in 2015, with high inventories in the first quarter of 2015 emerging as the largest concern.

Hong Kong protests dwindle as exhaustion set...Hong Kong protests dwindle as exhaustion sets in
By AFP | 6 Oct, 2014, 05.56PM IST
University leaders and other movement supporters have been trying to persuade the remaining students that they should beat a tactical retreat.

HONG KONG: Hong Kong protesters were under pressure Monday to end their pro-democracy campaign as their numbers dwindled after a chaotic week of mass rallies, and frustration grew over disruption and traffic gridlock.
The demonstrations that had drawn tens of thousands evaporated Sunday night in the face of a warning from Hong Kong's embattled leader Leung Chun-ying to leave the streets and allow government offices to reopen.
Crowds ebbed to just a few hundred weary activists at their main site in the harbourside Admiralty district but were beginning to gradually pick up again as people left work and headed back to the streets late Monday.
Student leaders denied their campaign for free elections had lost momentum, saying they were dug in and would remain until the government agrees to conditions for talks on political reform.
But Leung issued another warning to disperse, saying they should leave the flashpoint district of Mongkok on the Kowloon peninsula, which has seen ugly scuffles with triad mobs, "as soon as possible".
"To prevent violent crime and to reduce the amount of injuries, police will take action at the right time," Leung said in a televised address, describing the area as "high risk".
The protesters and their well-organised campaign have enjoyed strong public support, with sympathy soaring after police used tear gas on the crowds. But after shutting down parts of the city for more than a week, irritation has grown.
Highways were jammed with traffic and subway trains were packed Monday as frustrated commuters tried to find their way to and from work, battling cancelled bus routes and road diversions.
"They have to let the cars through as soon as possible -- they are blocking the way," 25-year-old Michael Lau told AFP as he travelled on the city's iconic tram network.
A four-day environment symposium gathering 11 Nobel winners that was due to open on Wednesday has been scrapped "due to the sustained disruptions in the city," the organisers said Monday.
However, secondary schools closures in affected areas, which had been a particular headache for families, were lifted and the government said primary schools would reopen on Tuesday.

Tharoor in trouble  clarifies he is not endorsing BJPShashi Tharoor slammed for ‘praising’ Modi

The Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee on Monday expressed serious reservations over party MP Shashi Tharoor praising Prime Minister Narendra Modi and accepting his invitation to join ‘Swachh Bharat’ campaign.
KPCC vice-president and spokesman MM Hassan said his stand was against party ideology and policies. “Tharoor should stop praising Modi. The party state unit would not hesitate in taking action against him. The party has strong reservations against his stand and it would inform the high command about this,” Hassan said.
Even actor Kamal Hassan said there was nothing new in Modi’s campaign. But Tharoor’s didn’t even show the actor’s concern. It is not acceptable to us,” he said.
Another leader M Liju has also expressed dismay over “Tharoor becoming part of Modi’s communal agenda”.
This is the latest incident where the party has distanced from Tharoor. During the IPL controversy and death of his wife Sunanda Pushkar the party state unit had left him high and dry.
Tharoor had commented that he was honoured by the invitation from the Prime Minister and thanked him making him an active partner in the campaign.
However reacting to party state leaders’ outbursts Tharoor tweeted saying it was wrong to dub him a BJP sympathiser.
“Being receptive to specific statements or actions of BJP leaders does not remotely imply acceptance of the party’s core Hindutva agenda. The PM pitched his appeal as a non-political one and I received it in that spirit. I am a proud Congressman and a proud Indian. In short: not pro-BJP, just pro-India,” he tweeted.

Flipkart hosts day-long sale  website crashes‘Marked up’ prices, server crash spoil Flipkart party

The great deals and discounts that e-commerce majors such as Flipkart, Snapdeal, Amazon and others are announcing in full-page advertisements every day this festive season may not all be for real.
India’s biggest e-commmerce company, Flipkart, in particular earned the ire of disgruntled shoppers by offering some supposedly discounted items at prices higher than what rivals such as Amazon and Snapdeal were offering.
For instance, a MacBookAir 13” was priced at Rs. 56,490 on Flipkart but Snapdeal sold it for Rs. 49,999.
In other instances, the company allegedly marked up the retail prices of some products and then offered “discounts” that brought the selling prices close to market rates.
“But the digital customer is smart. With so many social sites, it will be difficult to pull a wool over their eyes. They will see through any such attempt,” said Sandeep Komaravelly, senior VP (marketing) at rival Snapdeal.com.
To be fair, this practice of ramping up prices and then offering a “discount” was not true for all products, since a few discounts were genuine and lapped up by the customers.
Flipkart’s big festive season sale, The Big Billion Day, overburdened its servers, which crashed within two hours of the sale opening, angering shoppers further. “The traffic was heavy but our server did not crash,” a Flipkart spokesperson said, but refused to give any details.
Shoppers took to Twitter, Facebook and blogging to attack the company’s pricing.
A Twitter user, @Surnell, posted screenshots of what purported to show Flipkart raising prices of a product in the run-up to the sale only to slap a discount on Monday.

“We got a billion hits on our site today and achieved our 24 hour sales target of $100 million (Rs 600 crore) in gross merchandise value (industry lingo for sales) in just 10 hours.
We are truly humbled by the immense faith our customers have shown in us,” Flipkart’s promoters Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal said in a statement on Monday evening.
Underlining the fierce battle for customers among e-commerce companies, Amazon, the world’s largest online retailer, bought the domain name “bigbillionday.com” (Flipkart’s name for its sale), which redirects customers to amazon.com and trolls Flipkart.
Monday’s sale brought hordes of shoppers not only to Flipkart but to other retailers as well. “We have seen a 30% jump today and over the last week, the traffic has been 10% higher than what we get very month,” Snapdeal’s Komaravelly.
Amazon spokesperson said, “Today, on the last day of our ‘Mission to Mars’ campaign, we have witnessed a 100% increase in sales since yesterday.
It is our biggest day ever and we believe it is owed to the introduction of Dhamaka deals every hour through the day  and ensuring the availability of the deals advertised.”
Amazon will hold week three of the “Online Shopping Dhamaka” festive celebrations followed by the “Diwali Dhamaka Week” starting October 10.

Congress moves EC against Modi's AIR address, alleges violation of model code of conduct

New Delhi: The Congress on Monday lodged a complaint with the Election Commission of India against Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 'Mann Ki Baat' programme on All India Radio which was aired on Friday, October 3. The Congress alleged that it was a violation of model code of conduct as two states - Haryana and Maharashtra - go to polls on October 15.
In a new initiative to reach out to the maximum populace, Modi connected with people over radio with the programme, giving a pep talk on shedding despondency and use of skills for the country's betterment and prosperity.
He impressed upon the people to generate confidence among themselves, including the specially-abled children who are a responsibility of the society, and advocated the need for use of khadi products as a homage to Mahatma Gandhi.
In the address, PM Narendra Modi gave a pep talk on shedding despondency and use of skills for the country's betterment and prosperity.
#narendra modi #air #radio #mann ki baat
He promised to make the radio broadcast a regular affair and invited ideas from the citizens while noting that he was encouraged by the number of suggestions he had received since it was announced that he would be addressing the nation over radio.
In his 15-minute address that coincided with Dussehra, he sought to motivate people to recognise their capabilities and use them.
"You know, our scientists have undertaken the Mars mission successfully at minimum expenses. There is nothing lacking in our capabilities. We only have forgotten our
strengths. We have forgotten ourselves as if we have become despondents. My brothers and sisters, this cannot be," he said.
Contending that "the 125 crore Indians are blessed with immense skill and strength", he said, "All we need to do is to understand our strengths."
He also referred to Mahatma Gandhi, whose birth anniversary was celebrated a day before, and impressed upon people to use at least one khadi product, be it a handkerchief or even a bedsheet.
"If you buy khadi, you light the lamp of prosperity in the house of a poor person," he said.

What did Congress do in 60 years to bring back black money, asks Venkaiah Naidu

Hyderabad: Taking exception to Congress president Sonia Gandhi's reported attack on NDA government on the issue of black money, Union Minister M Venkaiah Naidu asked what her party did on the matter when it was in power.
"I am putting a straight question to the Congress president. If it is so easy and simple to bring back the black money in 60 days of coming to power, what is it you have done in the 60 years, when you have been in power. Absolute power. You have no answer. Your government is responsible for all the ills that are plaguing the nation. This government is trying its best to set right the matters," Naidu said.
Asked about opposition's criticism of the live telecast of RSS Chief Mohan Bhagwat's address on Doordarshan, he said the criticism is "absurd" and complimented the national broadcaster for showing the address live. "RSS chief's Vijaya Dasami address, which is historic, has been live telecast by many channels, including Doordarshan. I don't know why people are making controversy. There are people who are making live telecast of so many things. Then, a patriotic organisation, a nationalistic organisation, chief of RSS addressed a historic Dasara rally. It is telecast live," he said.
Union Minister M Venkaiah Naidu said that the UPA government is responsible for all the ills that are plaguing the nation.
#upa #nda #bjp #congress
"Doordarshan has done a good thing. I compliment them, they have not been doing for a variety of reasons. I saw absurd and meaningless criticism by some people," the senior BJP leader said. Asked about reports of BJP being in touch with Tamil superstar Rajinikanth for his joining the party, he said it is being reported in newspapers.
"We are in touch saying, participate in 'Swachh Bharat Abhiyan'," he said. Talking about the cleanliness campaign, he said icons in different fields like cinema and sports are being roped in to participate in the mission.

Government committed on rehabilitation of Kashmiri Pandits: Jitendra Singh15
0
New Delhi: The Centre is committed toward rehabilitation of displaced Kashmiri Pandits in the Valley and will try to do away all their security concerns to ensure their safe return, Minister of State in Prime Minister's Office Jitendra Singh said on Monday.
He was speaking after meeting a delegation of Kashmiri Pandits, who submitted a charter of their demands to the Minister for their rehabilitation in the Valley. "Kashmiri Pandits have been connected with their homeland through tradition and culture of Kashmir. I have kept their memorandum. We will go through it. The Government will fulfil all condition for their return raised by them. Government is committed towards their rehabilitation," Singh said.
He also appreciated the delegation for offering help to the flood-affected people of Jammu and Kashmir. "The Kashmiri Pandits community has been nationalist and devoted to the cause of the nation. It is a matter of happiness and satisfaction that despite being displaced they have commitment and love towards their homeland.
"Kashmiri Pandits have been connected with their homeland through tradition and culture of Kashmir. I have kept their memorandum. We will go through it," Singh said.
#kashmiri pandits #jitendra singh #tracking the modi government #pmo
"The state has been affected by the floods and they have come here to offer help to their fellow Kashmiris whose lives have been devastated by the floods," said Singh, a Lok Sabha MP from Udhampur constituency of Jammu and Kashmir. Singh, who is also MoS for Personnel, Public Grievances and Pension, said the central government has been doing all its bid to ensure rehabilitation of flood-affected people in Jammu and Kashmir.
The unprecedented floods early last month caused by heavy downpour wreaked havoc in J&K, which claimed the lives of at least 277 people and rendered thousand of other homeless. It has also caused extensive damage to rail, road and other basic infrastructure of the state.
"We have been demanding a separate homeland for the Kashmiri Pandits. We should be given separate homeland. The Government should try to make conducive atmosphere for our return. They should engage us in their consultation to ensure rehabilitation of Kashmiri Pandits," Kashmiri Samiti Delhi president Vijay Raina said after meeting the Minister. He also demanded economic rehabilitation package for over-aged youths (18 to 37 years) as they have lost precious years of their working life and opportunities due to mass exodus of Kashmiri Pandits at the onset of militancy in J&K 1990.
"We hope that Prime Minister Narendra Modi will look into our demands and take all steps to ensure their rehabilitation," Rakesh Razdan, vice president of Kashmiri Samiti Delhi said.

Srinagar: Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah did not celebrate Eid-ul Azha and instead donated blood at a government hospital as mark of solidarity with the flood-affected people of the state.
Abdullah, who offered Eid Prayers at Hazratbal, rushed straight to SMHS Hospital in Karan Nagar area of the city to donate blood, an official spokesman said.
He asked people to donate blood at the donation camps and save precious lives. Abdullah said that donation of blood on Eid is all the more important to seek munificence of the Almighty.
Abdullah, who offered Eid Prayers at Hazratbal, rushed straight to SMHS Hospital in Karan Nagar area of the city to donate blood, an official spokesman said.

The Chief Minister then drove to airport from where he took off to Jammu to meet the victims of cross border firing that took place in Arnia sector, the spokesman said. He said the CM is also scheduled to visit villages affected by the firing incident.
Abdullah, in his message on Eid-ul-Azha, appealed to the people to celebrate the holy occasion with simplicity keeping in mind the plight of sufferers of devastating floods which claimed precious human lives, inflicted unprecedented losses to economy and damaged public infrastructure, in the state.
He sought wholehearted support to flood survivors and prayed for the well-being of the people and the state. "Let us dedicate this year's Eid-ul-Azha to the flood sufferers and extend all help to them for their rehabilitation and welfare," he said, adding that supporting the needy and sufferers of calamities is the essence of holy occasions like Eid.

Leverage "human touch" to differentiate: Dipak C JainE Kumar Sharma      Follow @EKumarSharma    Last Updated: October 6, 2014  | 19:12 IST
Dipak C. Jain, marketing guru and former dean of Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management
Dipak C. Jain, marketing guru and former dean of Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management and INSEAD, the leading B-school in France, sees niche specialisations emerging in business management . He foresees growth for every sector where there is "human touch" because "human touch cannot be outsourced."
Currently the director of Sasin Graduate Institute of Business Administration in Bangkok, Thailand, he spoke to Business Today over phone on what is engaging his attention at the moment. He says, "the competitive pressure is so huge today that in my research I see that you don't have the luxury to wait to launch a new product because things like buyer behaviour for instance are changing all the time. Therefore companies need to be proactive rather than reactive." What this means, he says, is that companies need to be constantly innovating and focusing on the service component. "Products can very soon become like commodities with many making similar offerings. So how you create differentiation becomes important and here I think service is going to play a crucial role."
 
In terms of sectors where he sees more action, he says, "since people are living longer this means there will be more demand for tourism, which means airlines have a bright future because people will travel. Then, there will be need for hospitality, media and entertainment and of course for those who offer healthcare and wealthcare because as you live longer you also need to plan and manage your wealth".
In healthcare, he says, the focus will be more on consumer wellness and "here it will be more about ways to keep people healthy, important in times where people retire early."
 
In terms of areas of interest and specialisations in business management that he sees emerging and ones that will be in demand, he says: "my view is in future, we will see more action in functional areas of specialisation like MBA in healthcare marketing, or real estate , technology and innovation and of course, entrepreneurship. People will seek specialisations in these areas as they look today for finance, marketing, operations and HR (human resources)."
 
In terms of perceptions about India, where there is scope for improvement, he says that "our problem is (lack of) consistency at all levels." Second, "we tend to have a more outcome-centric mindset than being process-centric." This means the focus is more on getting a work done. In order to ensure there is focus on process and on the right way of doing it, he feels, there should be clear and severe penalties that can act as deterrents.
Jain also serves as an Independent Director on boards of leading companies such as John Deere & Company and Reliance Industries.

6 Pakistani men held off JamnagarcoastPrint
Written by Ujjwala Nayudu | Ahmedabad | Posted: October 6, 2014 6:31 pm
A Pakistani boat was apprehended off Jamnagar coast late on Sunday evening and six Pakistani crew members were held by the Indian Coast Guard.
The arrested crew members are suspected by security agencies to have been using fishing as a cover to enter Indian waters.
The Pakistani boat ‘Al-Rahimo’ had left Karachi five days ago and was found near the Indian maritime border on Sunday. The boat was carrying 150 kilograms of fish.
A senior officer from the Indian Coast Guard confirmed to the Indian Express, “The Pakistani boat has been apprehended six kilomtres inside the IMB. Unlike the fishermen who go astray in the water these fishermen were suspicious. They had more than 100 kilograms of fish which they claim they had caught in the initial three days; then it is highly suspicious that they were still sailing close to Indian waters. We suspect that they were using the fish stock as a cover.”
All the six crew members are natives of Karachi and the boat was also made in Karachi for fishing. The seized boat will be brought to Okha post on Monday morning at around 11am.  The Pakistan Maritime Agency had apprehended 55 Indian fishermen two weeks back and seized eight Indian boats that had left from Okha and Porbandar for fishing.
The Indian Coast Guard will interrogate the Pakistani crew along with the Central Intelligence Bureau, Indian Navy, Customs, the DRI and marine police of State Police.

Sunil Narine is  was and will always be an integral part of KKR: GautamGambhirPress Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: October 6, 2014 6:27 pm
Gautam Gambhir is confident that his Kolkata Knight Riders teammate Sunil Narine will return to action as a “better bowler and stronger human being” after he was reported twice for a suspect bowling action in the CLT20.
Narine was reported twice for a suspect action in the recently concluded T20 event and therefore was not allowed to play in the final on Saturday. The doubts over his action led to his withdrawal from West Indies’ tour of India .
KKR captain Gambhir, however, backed his main bowler saying he will do bigger things after the comeback.
“He (Narine) is, was and will always be an integral part of KKR and the entire squad will stand behind him and I hope he can come back as a stronger human being and can achieve much bigger heights than he has achieved in the past,” Gambhir was quoted as saying by ‘ESPNcricinfo’.
The southpaw said he was shocked to know about Narine’s action being reported.
“The only thing I can say at the moment is it’s a tough time for him, but he’s a strong character. I had a long chat with him after the game (against Dolphins on Sep 29) and I told him he needed to get this monkey off his back because he himself doesn’t know if there’s anything wrong with his action,” said Gambhir.
“The good thing is now he will get to know whether there is actually a problem in his action. If there is any, he will try to sort that out and come back a stronger human being and a stronger character as well. He could take all that pressure and be a much better bowler as well.
“Sometimes when these things start playing in your mind, what will happen if I bowl this delivery, what will people be talking, etc. Once he gets this off his back I am 100 percent sure he will be a much better bowler.”
Gambhir hoped the authorities are not singling out certain bowlers. Top Pakistan spinner Saeed Ajmal was also reported for suspect action recently.
“Hopefully they are not targeting certain bowlers and they should not be targeting certain bowlers,” he said
“Sometimes the biggest challenge in these things is to be consistent and that’s where I think it can get unfair. Till the time you are fair I am fine with it, whether it has to do with actions, batsmen, bowlers or xyz. For me consistency is very important in any sport,” added Gambhir.
The only thing I can say at the moment is it's a tough time for him, but he's a strong character

LoC killings in Jammu sour Eid sweets exchange at Attari-WagahJCPPrint
Written by Navjeevan Gopal | Amritsar | Posted: October 6, 2014 6:26 pm | Updated: October 8, 2014 2:54 pm
Amid ceasefire violation by Pakistan Rangers and the death of civilians in Jammu, no sweets were exchanged between the Rangers and the Border Security Force (BSF) at Attari-Wagah Joint Check Post (JCP) on Monday.
BSF Deputy Inspector General at Amritsar sector M F Farooqui said the Rangers conveyed their decision to not offer sweets to the BSF on Bakrid during a flag meeting of company commanders of both sides on Sunday evening.
The BSF and the rangers exchange pleasantries and sweets on a number of occasions and festivals.
“During a flag meeting held on Sunday evening, the Rangers conveyed that they will not offer  Eid  sweets to BSF on Monday. We reciprocated with matching magnitude and did not offer any sweets to them either. On Eid, it is the Pakistani side that offers sweets first,” Farooqui said.
ALSO READ:   Seven killed in Pakistan shelling, trouble spreads to LoC 
While the Rangers are the first to offer sweets on Eid twice a year, the BSF offers sweets and gifts on Diwali and Republic Day. Both Pakistan and India also offer sweets to each other during their respective Independence Day celebrations. As a routine practice, a flag meeting is held on the eve of exchanging pleasantries and sweets wherein, among other things, ranks of officers coming for the exchange from both sides are matched.
“The Rangers did not cite any reasons for not offering Eid sweets to BSF in Sunday’s flag meeting. They only said that there was an order from higher authorities to not offer sweets to BSF this time,” said BSF (Punjab Frontier) inspector general Ashok Kumar.
The exchange of Eid sweets did not take place at Hussainiwala border in Ferozepur district either.
The development is unusual given that the tradition has been on for a long time and even the killings of five Army soldiers at LoC in August 2013 had not affected it.
“The exchange of sweets is part of bilateral relations between the two nations. It is an agreed upon official activity to maintain harmony and cordial relations with each other. It is not that we exchange sweets out of any affection,” DIG Farooqui told The Indian Express. “We will lodge our protest with the Rangers on this,” he added.
BSF IG Ashok Kumar said that it was likely that the prevailing scenario at LoC in Jammu led to the Pakistan decision. “It might have looked unusual to exchange sweets at a time when there was so much tension at border,” Kumar said.
Farooqui said that whether the BSF would offer sweets to the Rangers or not on Diwali would depend on how they react to the protest BSF will lodge. “If the response from Pakistani side is not good, we will have to think twice on whether to offer them Diwali sweets or not,” Farooqui added.

Nothing moves as per plans at Le CorbusierCentreThe Le Corbusier Centre in Sector 19, Chandigarh.
Written by Ifrah Mufti | New Delhi | Posted: October 6, 2014 6:24 pm
Plans to provide facilities for researchers from India and abroad, a cafeteria for visitors and an audiovisual room at the Le Corbusier Centre, Sector 19, have been gathering dust for the past few years.
The new director of the centre, Mukesh Singh, who had joined last year, said that he has already written to the administration, and the plans are in the pipeline. “The administration has been conducting meetings for the upgradation of the centre with the chief architect and the Chandigarh College of Architecture. First meeting was held in January, where the UT advisor had approved of all the plans, and the next meeting was held in March, which I could not attend,” added Singh.
Admitting the fact that as per the plans, nothing has been done practically in the past one year, Singh further said, “It is the administration which has to take the step. I can only remind them, which I have been doing since long. I have already written to the CEO of the STEPS Society and Director (Tourism) to start the process.”
Singh also informed that there are many shops lying vacant at the centre, one of which could be utilised as a theatre room to showcase documentaries and short films made on Le Corbusier and his life. “So many other activities can be organised at the centre like special exhibitions such that the residents frequently visit here. The Le Corbusier Foundation, Paris, is organising an exhibition on Le Corbusier soon. I, on behalf of our centre here, have proposed to be a part of it.”
As the city would commemorate the 127th birth anniversary of Le Corbusier on October 6, the director of the centre informed that the celebrations, which are usually held at a large scale, have been postponed due to the Dussehra vacation.
Vijay Kumar, UT Tourism Officer, said, “We have postponed the celebrations to October 11. Since the Chandigarh College of Architecture organises the function on October 6, most of their students are out on vacation, which is why, the preparations for the day are under a planning stage. We are thinking of conducting a lecture on Le Corbusier
this time.”

Over 150 artists came together to paint unique aspects of Telangana
The conference room at Taramati Baradari has a strong smell of paint. Pieces of fibre glass splattered with paint — some dry, some still moist — lie unattended. Artists at work have no time to spare for requests to pose for photos but no one is complaining. After all, the deadline of the Telangana art camp involving more than 150 artists whose works will be displayed at the historic Taramati Baradari was looming large over them.
The participating artists turn nostalgic. While some appreciate the effort behind the sho, some others revel in the chance to see some celebrated artists at work, others are pleased with the amount of brainstorming that went into finishing each canvas. “There was so much exchange of ideas, we all came out united. The effort is to create a united forum for Telangana artists and the art,” explains Bharath.
The works range from rocks, local deities to market scenes from local and rural Telangana regions. A few artists have also highlighted the ‘Irani café’ culture. Artist Akshay’s work doesn’t just show an Irani Café, it also highlights the culture. “A table can be occupied by a group of friends or a group of strangers. No one insists on sitting and the cups and saucers are always white. This is one of the urban cultures and no can deny it,” explains the artist. When Irani chai is discussed can M.F. Hussain be left behind? One artist has done a caricature of the celebrated artist as his tribute to art and culture from the city.
“Art@Telangana is an initiative by a group of individuals with the vision to bring the artists and artistic traditions from Telangana into the forefront. Under this initiative a coffee table book and a website will be launched. Our vision is to create a platform that endeavours to internationally showcase the works of eminent and budding artists alike from the region. 
Historically Telangana has had a rich tradition of art. Ramappa Temple built by the Kakatiyas is a symphony in stone. Buddhist sculptures of Nagarjuna Konda are revered as art pieces worldwide.
The Deccan miniature paintings reflect the affluence of this land. Painters like Deuskar, P. T Reddy, Sayyad Ahmed, Sayyad Bin Muhammad, Kumarila Swamy, K. Rajayya, Kondapalli Sheshagiri Rao, Badri Narayan, Vasudev Kapatral and sculptors like Osman Siddiqui’s art works are timeless,” explains Laxma Goud one of the heads behind the massive art camp.

Equities closed a fifth straight week of advances Friday, boosted by accommodative actions from central banks in China and Europe. That factor could continue boosting markets as sources told Reuters that the Chinese leadership and central bank were ready to cut interest rates again and loosen lending restrictions. Such policy changes in the world's second-biggest economy could spur more market gains.
"The carry-over effect from China, taken with the fact that the U.S. is pretty healthy, and you have a market with a bias to trend higher, especially on the cyclical front," said Mike Gibbs, who helps oversee more than $500 billion as co-head of the equity advisory group at Raymond James in Memphis.
Cyclical stocks - tied to the pace of economic growth - led gains, with the S&P consumer discretionary sector <.SPLRCD> up 0.6 percent. Financials <.SPSY> rose 0.4 percent.
The weakest group was telecom <.SPLRCL>, down 1.6 percent. AT&T  fell 1.6 percent to $34.70 while Verizon  lost 1.7 percent at $49.35 after Citigroup downgraded the stock to "neutral." Both stocks limited the Dow's advance.
RenaissanceRe Holdings Ltd  agreed to buy Platinum Underwriters Holdings Ltd  for $1.9 billion.
BioMarin Pharmaceuticals Inc  said it would buy Dutch drug developer Prosensa Holding NV  for about $840 million including milestone payments.
Prosensa soared 61 percent to $18.43 while Platinum was up 21 percent at $74.05.
Cimatron Ltd  jumped 43 percent to $8.70 on its heaviest ever one-day volume after 3D Systems Corp  agreed to buy the company for $97 million. Shares of 3D jumped 7.5 percent to $37.80.
At 11:07 a.m. (1607 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> rose 10.53 points, or 0.06 percent, to 17,820.59, the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 4.77 points, or 0.23 percent, to 2,068.27 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 25.32 points, or 0.54 percent, to 4,738.29.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 1,787 to 1,108, for a 1.61-to-1 ratio on the upside; on the Nasdaq, 1,795 issues rose and 754 fell for a 2.38-to-1 ratio.
The S&P 500 posted 57 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 74 new highs and 36 new lows.

Classic Book Covers Reimagined For 2014reddit
An artist based in Bucharest, Romania, is redesigning the covers of classic novels so that they more closely align with our modern-day tech obsessions. The results are covers that draw on social media, video games and gadgets, pairing Flappy Bird with To Kill A Mockingbird and Snapchat with The Picture of Dorian Gray.
The artist, Julien Britnic , has been focusing specifically on Penguin classics for the past two months. That explains the name of the Tumblr where his posts appear: Pop Goes the Penguin .
"I try to criticize some modern aspects of contemporary lifestyle by using the classic novel format," Britnic told The Huffington Post via Skype. "I have a love and hate relationship with pop culture. You really love something, but you see some not-positive sides of it."
While he's covered many of the bestsellers, Britnic said he still has plans for quite a few more. For now, here are some of our favorites.

Gadkari tells journalists to accept "packages"Gadkari tells scribes to accept "packages"
PTI
Nitin Gadkari
Mumbai, Oct 6:  
The Union Minister, Nitin Gadkari has courted a controversy asking journalists to “keep the packages (money) they get during the election season”.
“In the next 10-12 days, you journalists will have ‘Laxmi darshan’,” Gadkari said at a poll rally in Sawantwadi in coastal Konkan on Saturday.
“Be it reporters or editors, there are separate packages for reporters, newspapers and their owners,” Gadkari said.
“Diwali has come. I have one request, keep whatever you get. Eat whatever you can,” he said.
The state secretariat and legislature journalists association flayed Gadkari’s remarks.
“Gadkari’s comments are highly objectionable,” president of Mantralaya Vidhimandal Vartahar Sangh, Pravin Puro said here.
“Gadkari has said journalists accept ‘packages’ (for election coverage). Due to such statements, the image of journalists gets dented,” Puro said.

What are the best places to trade in an old phone for an iPhone 6By Hayley Tsukayama October 3 Follow @htsuka
(Photo by David Paul Morris/Bloomberg)
Now that the initial burst of orders for Apple's iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus is starting to fade away, some stores are actually able to hold the new phones in stock. Sadly, a lot of the best trade-in deals have already expired. But if you're looking to pick up a new iPhone and want to get some cash (or at least store credit?) for your old one, here's a quick rundown of places that are still willing to give you special deals if you buy an iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus.
Wal-Mart: America's largest retailer is kicking off its iPhone 6 trade-in program on Friday, in more than 3,000 of its stores across the country. If your phone (iPhone or Android) is in particularly good condition, you can even get double its trade-in value -- for a limited time -- to use toward a new iPhone on AT&T, Verizon or Sprint on a two-year plan.
The doubling deal, which runs from Oct. 5 to Oct. 18, only works if your phone has a trade-in value of $200 or less, as determined by your local Walmart. A normal iPhone 5s, for example, would have a value of $100, which would then get you $200 in store credit toward the newest model.
AT&T: AT&T  will still give you up to $300 in trade-in value for your old iPhone toward an iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus as long as you act before Oct. 31. The carrier will offer you $300 promo card for an iPhone 5s, $200 for an iPhone 5 or 5c and $100 for an iPhone 4 or 4S. You can choose to put the new phone on a traditional 2-year plan, unlocked, or AT&T Next plan -- the carrier's option for those who want to upgrade their devices more frequently than every two years.
Verizon: Verizon is still offering an  iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus trade-in deal, promising to give you a $300 gift card for your old iPhone 5s, and $200 for iPhone 5c, iPhone 4 or iPhone 4S. The offer stands through Oct. 15, and is also good for new iPhones that are unlocked, on a two-year contract or on its fast-upgrade plan, Verizon Edge.
Sprint: Playing some hardball, Sprint is offering a great deal to people who want to switch carriers. Per Sprint's press release, the carrier will actually buy out their family's plans from other carriers, and give them a Visa Prepaid Card worth up to $350 per line. The deal only applies to "customers who bring their number from another carrier and activate an iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus on the Sprint Simply Unlimited Plan." It only works, though, at Sprint stores and by calling Sprint's sales team, and only through Oct. 31. Plus, prepaid cards may take up to 12 weeks to arrive, so budget that in.
T-Mobile: In a move that shouldn't surprise anyone, T-Mobile is also aggressively targeting its competitors with its trade-in deal. T-Mobile promises "over $350" for an eligible iPhone 5s, and also promises to match any trade-in value you may get from AT&T, Verizon or Sprint.
"If you do find a better trade-in value from AT&T, Verizon, or Sprint, we will beat it and pay out the difference," the company promises on its trade-in page. "Plus, for a limited time we'll give you $50, so you can trade up to the new device you want today." T-Mobile hasn't given an end date for this promo, but said that it's for a "limited time."
eBay: If you're looking to sell your phone on eBay, the online retailer is still offering a pretty good deal, promising that it will give you a $100 coupon for your phone even if you can't sell it. It's also boasting that phones are trending up to $400 on the site -- that plum price is for a 64 GB iPhone 5s in "excellent" condition -- and claims that, overall, is up to $200 better than the average price sellers are getting from other trade-in programs. This deal ends on Oct. 24, and you only have 14 days to redeem your $100 coupon if you phone doesn't sell.
Other options: There's also the basic DIY option, which is to clean up your phone yourself and get the cash for it from a reseller such as Gazelle or take your chances on the open market at s Craigslist. Before you do that, be sure to deactivate the "Find my iPhone" service and wipe the data from your phone. It's also always a good idea to pop out your SIM card. The same instructions go for any Android or Windows phones you may want to trade in, though you'll probably want to encrypt data on those phones before you delete them.
There are also a ton of retailers who have trade-in programs -- Target, GameStop, RadioShack, Best Buy and Apple itself to name a few -- so even if you missed the best iPhone trade-in deals, you should still be able to get something for your old phone.

Poet Billy Collins on life  death and poetryBy Lillian Cunningham October 3 Follow @lily_cunningham
Former U.S. poet laureate Billy Collins tells The Post's Lillian Cunningham a story about running into a former student, and what he learned about teaching. (Cameron Blake, Lillian Cunningham, Julio Negron and Jayne Orenstein/The Washington Post)
Despite his stature as former U.S. poet laureate and his achievement of the nearly impossible — great commercial success as a living poet — Billy Collins cringes at the idea of being a leader. "Leadership to me suggests that there’s a place to lead the person to," he says. "Whereas poetry is actually the home of ambiguity, ambivalence and uncertainty."
Collins, 73, nevertheless agreed to join our On Leadership series (perhaps from the same place of curiosity and playful humor that infuses so many of his poems). The author of collections like Aimless Love and Taking Off Emily Dickinson's Clothes talks to us about why poetry and leadership feel fundamentally incompatible to him, the responsibility an artist has to be true to his vision of the world, and how gratitude can be one of our most powerful emotions.
"With poetry," Collins says, "you don’t have to go through a windshield to realize that life is precious."
The conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity. You can also listen to the podcast with Billy Collins .
Q. What does the word “leadership” mean to you?
A. My association with leadership is not very positive, really. The first thing I think of — sadly, I might add — is the whole motivational speaker phenomenon, where people are made to feel better about themselves and to turn into leaders, which means to give them self confidence, right? In that way, it’s really connected to the self-esteem craze, which I think has infiltrated teaching and had a terrible effect on it.
The great writer Wilfrid Sheed said that when he was growing up, low self-esteem had another name. It was called “humility.” It was actually a virtue and not a psychological impairment.
Q. Do you think poets can be leaders? Or is the term wildly ill fitting?
A. I think poetry takes place in a quieter place. Leadership to me has kind of a public ring to it.
Poetry can do a lot of things to people. I mean it can improve your imagination. It can take you to new places. It can give you this incredible form of verbal pleasure. But leadership to me suggests that there’s a place to lead the person to, that there’s a mission or a goal involved. I don’t think poets are that purpose driven. A poem actually can have either no point or a very nuanced point.
It also depends to some extent on how the poem is taken in by the reader or the listener. I think if a poet wanted to lead, he or she would want the message to be unequivocally clear and free of ambiguity. Whereas poetry is actually the home of ambiguity, ambivalence and uncertainty.
Q. A lot of business leaders and politicians and heads of non-profits talk about their responsibility to citizens or their responsibility to improving society. Do you think artists have a responsibility?
A. If an artist is driven primarily by social responsibility, I think the art probably suffers because, again, just as leadership has a rather defined end point or purpose, social responsibility would seem to have a very clear moral context.
I don’t want to sound like an aesthete, but one has to be true to the art. And that means being true to the tradition of the art, but also being true to your own artistic vision. That’s a little high sounding, but I think writing and creating are expressions of an epistemological position — that is, how you look at the world, that slant you look at it from. And that’s all I feel I am in a palpable way responsible to: using that slant to get at some truth or a little smidgen of beauty.
It’s a matter of being true to your imagination, and being true to your vision, and true to the material you’re working with, whether it’s a violin or the dictionary of the English language. You have to listen to all the other violinists who have ever played, and read all of the poetry you can consume. That’s my sense of responsibility. It’s an artistic responsibility, not so much a political one, not so much a financial one or a responsibility based on commodity. It can’t be commodified.
Q. What are some of the ways you would describe your character? And has the way you think about yourself changed over the years?
A. I was introduced at a reading by a colleague of mine some years ago. She said that when she first knew me, I was a professor who happened to be a poet, and I’ve turned into a poet who happens to be a professor.
That’s exactly how my life professionally has moved. I basically went to college, to graduate school. Then, as you know, if you stay in graduate school long enough, they give you a Ph.D. and tell you you can’t go to school anymore, much to my disappointment. I would have just stayed in graduate school forever. I started teaching in the City University of New York, primarily. And the poetry emerged quite later. I didn’t get a real book published until I was over 40.
So, that’s the big change in my sense of myself. I was kind of doing the poetry as a sideline or I was doing it somewhat covertly. I also just couldn’t figure out how to do it well. It took me a while.
Q. What about some of the traits you associate with yourself? Would you describe yourself as funny? Disciplined? What are some of your own personal adjectives?
A. I think I started out — as a writer anyway, and maybe as a person — being more like my father. Then at some point, I allowed my mother to come into this. My father was funny, sarcastic, cynical, jokey, very social, kind of glib, loved one-liners. I started out imitating that. Even in my social life and in the poems I was writing, I was sort of a smart ass.
My mother had a sense of humor, but it was quite submerged, and therefore, in a way, deeper than my father’s. But my mother was heartfelt, a moral guide, emotionally expansive, giving. I guess my father would be the head and my mother would be the heart, if we want to simplify it in that way.
Now I think I’ve managed to get to the point where I have my mother's and father’s traits kind of shuffled together — in the way I live, the way my personality is, and also in the persona that directs my poems.
Q. Do you think the public image of you aligns pretty closely with how you see yourself?
A. One is misunderstood even if no one outside of your family and a few friends know you. I mean we’re all misunderstood, or imperfectly understood. And once you become something of a public figure or you have an audience, you develop that odd sensation of having all these people who know you and yet you’ve never met them. Then you’re misunderstood more broadly.
A lot of people send me their poems, and I don’t know why they send them to me. These poems are nothing like my poems, and I can’t believe they think I’d feel some cousinship with them.
I have a public figure who reads poems in public places, and then I have me, the composer of poems — and that takes place in a very private place. Well, it could be on a subway, but it’s private in that I’m locked into a world of composing poems. I’m writing for one particular reader, and the exchange, I hope, is very intimate. So, to then stand up in front of a few hundred people and read is a very different experience. It’s almost as if this one reader you’re thinking of has suddenly multiplied by 500, and they’re all sitting there in these rows. I mean, I love doing both, but they call on very disparate parts of one’s life, one’s personality.
Q. Can you share any parables from your own life, where some incident stuck with you and taught you a lesson?
A. I think a lot of things in my life you could draw the negative — like an anti-parable, what not to do. But I’ll tell you an anecdote about teaching, which has been very central to my life.
In my poetry class, I’ve always had students memorize something, a few things. I feel that if they’ve forgotten everything I’ve said, if they haven’t written anything down all semester and just stared out the window, at least they’ll come away with a poem memorized.
So one day, years ago, I was on the subway in New York, and a guy across the aisle kept kind of looking at me and finally he came over and said he recognized me as his teacher. I’d taught him about 10 years before that, or more. He’d since become an oncologist, and I congratulated him on his success. Then he said, “You made us memorize a poem.” And I said, “Yes.” And he said, “I’d like to say that poem for you.”
And it was a little poem by Emily Dickinson that he’d carried in his head, and maybe in his heart, for all those years. Over the roar of the 6 train, he yelled that poem in my ear, and I think it was probably the most satisfying pedagogical experience I’ve ever had.
Q. Which poem was it?
A. You know, I forget, to be perfectly honest. But I’ll never forget him doing it.
Q. Why do you think that moment has stuck with you so strongly?
A. Well, because teaching is a very mysterious process. You’re throwing information, in a sense, into the dark. I mean, you spend an hour talking to this group of increasingly younger people and you walk out of there and you think sometimes you’ve had a good class, and other times it’s not been that great. But no matter what it is to you, you’re not sure how it’s being taken or what effect you’ve had.
Yet in that case, it was a clear demonstration that something had been learned. Also, I just loved the idea that this man had become a specialist in medicine and, through all his studies in medical school, this little poem by Emily Dickinson was not eradicated. It stuck with him.
Now that I start thinking about it, one of the reasons I became a poet was probably — not probably, was definitely — the fact that my mother knew a lot of poetry that she had memorized as a schoolgirl in a very rural environment in Ontario, Canada. When I was growing up, I would hear lines of Shakespeare or other poets that she would braid into her conversation. She would never say, “It’s poetry time,” and recite. Lines from the poem were braided into her talk. So before I even knew what poetry was, I heard poetry in my house. I knew as a toddler that my mother had two very different ways of talking. It was like AM and FM, and poetry was FM. And when she was on FM, so to speak, it sounded better.
Charles Wright , who is our current poet laureate, defined poetry as language that means more and sounds better. And when she would speak in poetry, it had a different sound to it, more melodious. Her expression would change, and you could see that she was pleased. She was happy to say these words. If I were in therapy — well, who needs a therapist? I’m making these connections on my own — that’s why I was so moved by that guy’s poem on the subway. It was my mother.
That’s where all of psychoanalysis ends up, anyway.
Q. At its best, what do you think poetry does?
A. Well, it gives pleasure. It’s easy to come out very high sounding about poetry, but if it doesn’t give pleasure, I don’t think it should be read. In Wordsworth’s preface to " Lyrical Ballads, 1798 ,” where he outlines his aesthetic and describes this very new kind of poetry at the time, he mentions the word “pleasure” over 50 times. That’s essential, I think. If it gives pleasure, then other things can happen. If it doesn’t give pleasure, then that’s a deal breaker and you just stop reading the poem.
Certainly one thing a poem can do is give you an imaginative pleasure by taking you places very suddenly that prose can’t take you, because poetry enjoys the broadest and deepest and highest and most thrilling level of imaginative freedom of any of the written arts.
Another thing poetry can do is connect you with the history of human emotion. That’s why at critical points in our lives, at funerals or weddings or other rituals, often a poem is read. The poem shows us that these emotions, love and grief, have been going on through the centuries; and that the emotion we’re feeling today is not just our emotion, it’s the human emotion.
Poetry is the only history we have of human emotions. Most history books, what we call history books, are stories of battles and treaties, negotiations and beheadings and coronations. But poetry is the only reminder of this very essential part of being human, which is one’s emotional life and all the dimensions it entails.
Q. Here’s a question I would love to ask just because I have absolutely no clue as to how you would answer it: What would you consider the bravest moment in your life?
A. I think I’m still looking forward to that.
The word just doesn’t resonate with me. I’ve done things that made me, and would make most people, nervous. And I’ve gotten over that, but I don’t know if that’s bravery. I think that’s just coping or managing. I read the elegy I wrote for 9/11 to a joint session of Congress. That was unnerving, but I don’t think it was necessarily brave to do that. I think if you asked me what was the most cowardly, I’d have the same reaction. I just don’t know if my life has taken me to such extremes that I would describe it in those very dramatic terms. I try to keep it in the middle of the channel.
Q. Then here’s a question that we ask everyone in this series, and you can interpret it in whatever way you want. What do you believe?
A. What do I believe? Well, it varies. I’ll tell you what I believe right now. I believe in a creator. Him, her, it — some creationable force. I arrive at that, as most people do, through the argument from design. Is it Spinoza who uses the image of the clock? That’s a very mechanistic view of the universe, but it’s the sense that you couldn’t throw the parts of a clock up in the air and hope to have them come down in the right order.
But, I don’t believe in an afterlife. So I believe in a creator who provides all this, right? And then, the creator says to you, “You want more than this? You want immortality? Well, come on. Isn’t this enough that I’ve provided for you here?”
Q. That reminds me a little bit of an old interview with you that I read. The person asked you what makes a good poet, and one of the things you said was that it takes an attitude of never getting used to being alive, of continuing to have a sense of wonder for the world around of you.
A. I think that’s very important. We think of the emotions that poetry conveys as being certainly love and certainly grief, but there’s this undercurrent that rises to the surface often, and it’s the emotion of gratitude. It sounds very corny, but it’s the gratitude to be alive.
It’s very easy to lose that, very easy to fall into a silent and unaware presumptuousness, where you think: “Well of course I’m here. I mean, how else would it be?”
Sometimes that is interrupted by an accident, a disease, a car crash — in more dramatic terms, 9/11 — and it brings people up short, it bring life into focus. After 9/11, you heard quite often about couples who said, “We were going to get married next year, but we decided to get married in a couple of weeks.”
Well, poetry has been telling people that message for thousands of years. And with poetry, you don’t have to go through a windshield to realize that life is precious. Poetry keeps tapping you on the shoulder with that same message.
Q. What’s the best piece of advice anyone’s ever given you?
A. My father always had a lot of good advice — like keep your money in a money clip and not in a wallet, so you can get it out faster. He said, “It’s not how much money you have, it’s how much money you spend. That’s the important thing.”
But he also said, “Give everybody a chance. Give everybody the benefit of the doubt. Then if you get burned by that innocent or positive attitude, well then you know. You’ve learned something.” So I try to start everything with some kind of optimism, unless proven otherwise. But if you disappoint me, then you’ve had it.

Great Drives: AlbaniaTrekking to Ethiopia’s clifftop churches
By that time we were the veterans of several mountain tracks and, in our four-wheel drive, we’d become accustomed to a bit of wheelspin, bump and slide. But for this stretch we hadn’t noticed anything untoward. “It really depends what kind of vehicle . . . ” one of us started to say. At which point our interlocutor (by now identifiably German) seemed to fall apart. “This shit road is fucking shit!” he declared, eyes watering. He only had a limited vocabulary of swear words in English and they were already in danger of overheating.
Anyway, we calmed him down enough to extract his story. He’d set out that morning, with his wife, in his VW, having first checked (a) with the map and (b) with the locals that the road to Përmet was passable for a two-wheel drive. They said it was. But now, several hours later, he was so appalled by the road surface that he had parked up and was trying to decide whether to keep going or to turn back.
We tried to be sympathetic. It was true: Albanians are massively optimistic when it comes to the passability of anything that isn’t a forest or a canyon, and they’d drive to Heaven if there was a suitable gap in the clouds. They are also massively helpful if you get stuck, so we suggested to our German friend that he walk up a bit further to reassure himself, and then give it a go.
And then we bumped away down the hill, leaving him there. About five minutes later, we passed his VW, parked on a rare piece of flat ground. It was, fair to say, probably a bit too lovingly looked-after for the conditions. More importantly, however, it was also empty; either his wife had gone for a long lie-down after all the in-car profanity, or else she’d taken the footpath back down the mountain, with the intention of catching the first flight home.
As a tourist venturing into Albania , you do take your life a bit in your hands – but not perhaps for the reasons most people might think. I didn’t meet any contract killers, and nobody offered me money for my organs. No, it is the hardtop roads, with their kidney-stone-popping potholes, and the drivers who screech along them under the influence of rakia and machismo, that are the lethal forces at work. Which is why I was doing all my driving off-road and uphill, south and east of Tirana, with a new British-run outfit called Drive Albania.
This is spectacular high country, riven by limestone canyons, at times soaring and majestic like the Atlas Mountains, at times bony and threadbare like the Anatolian plateau, at times bucolic and terraced with fruit trees like Alpine France, at times steeply plunging into sea like the Amalfi coast. The human imprint is interesting too, with most of the historic towns being uphill and inland, dating from the time when the lowland areas had a serious problem with malaria.
. . .
Our plan was to leave behind the ribbons of asphalt in their tangle of ugly new buildings, and escape to timeless rural Albania. We’d be like hikers-with-horsepower, and the access granted us by four-wheel drive meant that we’d descend, at day’s end, to cultural towns with good restaurants and civilised places to stay. A perfect compromise.

Donkeys are still a common form of transport
I was the first guest to sample Drive Albania’s southern itinerary, a seven-day circuit that starts and finishes in the capital Tirana, with half-board accommodation in towns including Korça, Berat, and Gjirokastra, but spending most of the day taking scenic “short cuts”. The guide drives the main road sections; the clients drive the hills.
Albania’s long period of communist isolation has given way to a catch-up capitalism, producing massive inequality between town and country. In practical terms that means that an Albanian’s choice of transport seems to be either a Mercedes or a donkey.
It was the world of the donkey that we set out to see. In our Land Rover Discovery, we climbed into the mountains to find old churches, precipitous villages that could have been Moroccan kasbahs, and shepherds doing what they’d always done, surrounded by bears and eagles. In the stone village of Benjë, for example, we were invited in for figs and rakia by a woman whose son had just come down off the high ground after a two-week stint looking after 100 sheep. Between mouthfuls of his first hot meal, he told us, with regret, how he’d lost one of his charges to the wolves.
In the village of Leusa, a skiddy drive up a rough track from Përmet, we found the late 13th-century Byzantine church of St Mary snuggling among oak and beech. Every inch of its interior was tattooed with gloriously colourful frescoes but bats were roosting in its vaulted ceiling and the door had recently been broken down by thieves. It was only a matter of time before the weather got through the roof.
By contrast, the Bektashi shrine we stumbled across amid the clouds on the high pass beside 2,416m Mount Tomorr turned out to be soulless, concrete and new. Albania is 70 per cent Muslim, largely thanks to the legacy of the Ottoman Empire, but theirs is a particularly low-key and liberal manifest­ation of Islam and Bektashism, in particular, is a Sufi sect that is outlawed by more hardcore nations for being too soft. Adherents are permitted to drink alcohol, for example, and are only obliged to pray once a day.
This dilution of religion, be it Christian or Muslim, is typically Albanian laisser-faire; after a long period of darkness, people here are out to enjoy life, if they can. There was certainly little sign of any asceticism when we descended into the valleys in the evenings.
Korça turned out to be a civilised university city that has suffered from emigration (an estimated 7m Albanians live and work overseas), but which seemed undaunted by being a shadow of its former self; in the evening the remaining population turned out in their best clothes for the xhiro (the Albanian equivalent of the passagiata), sashaying up and down by the cathedral.
Our plan was to leave the asphalt and escape to rural Albania. We’d be like hikers-with-horsepower
In Unesco-recognised Berat we stayed in a district called Mangalemi, a network of old Ottoman houses piled up the side of a hill below the country’s largest castle, a 4th-century creation that is still home to more than 800 people. And in Gjirokastra, once a big trading centre and also Unesco-listed, we went to meet Nesip Skenduli, owner of one of the town’s large number of mostly tumbledown, big gabled mansions, who only manages to keep his roof on by selling entrance tickets by day, and letting backpackers sleep in its decaying rooms by night.
In all these places the restaurants were good, the food at incredibly low prices (a coffee for 30p; a meal for £2) and the accommodation clean and straightforward.
But the best bits were always uphill. There’s nothing quite like the moment when you engage your vehicle’s low-range gears and feel the resulting rubble-­scattering surge. Fortunately, we never took any inadvertent short cuts, or encountered anything that the Land Rover couldn’t handle – unlike that stressed-out German.
Each time we breasted a high pass or squeaked past a dizzying drop-off, I found myself recalling that early encounter on the mountainside, and wondering whether he pressed on upwards, or turned round and went back. And whether his life would ever be the same again.

Douglas Coupland: Future selfiesWhy a house-price bubble means trouble
Selfies are mirrors we can freeze. A bunch of selfies is a contact sheet containing nothing but flattering choices. Selfies allow us to see how others look at themselves in a mirror making their modelling face when nobody’s around … except these days, everybody’s around everywhere all the time. And don’t we all know the blushy face and pretend-humble tone of voice used by selfie takers when we call out someone on posting a selfie? “This picture there? Oh, ha ha, you know, it’s just a casual shot I had in my camera. I shouldn’t have put such a casual shot up on Facebook. I do look good in it, though, don’t I?”
Selfies are the second cousin of the air guitar.
Selfies are the proud parents of the dick pic.
Selfies are, in some complex way, responsible for the word “frenemy”.
I sometimes wonder what selfies would look like in North Korea.
Selfies are theoretically about control – or, if you’re theoretically minded, they’re about the illusion of self-control. With a selfie some people believe you’re buying into a collective unspoken notion that everybody needs to look fresh and flirty and young for ever. You’re turning yourself into a product. You’re abdicating power of your sexuality. Or maybe you’re overthinking it – maybe you’re just in love with yourself.
I believe that it’s the unanticipated side effects of technology that directly or indirectly define the textures and flavours of our eras. Look at what Google has already done to the 21st century. So when smartphones entered the world in 2002, I think that if you gathered a group of smart media-savvy people in a room with coffee and good sandwiches, before the end of the day, the selfie could easily have been forecast as an inevitable smartphone side effect. There’s actually nothing about selfies that feels like a surprise in any way. The only thing that is surprising is the number of years it took us to isolate and name the phenomenon. I do note, however, that once the selfie phenomenon was named and shamed, selfies exploded even further, possibly occupying all of those optical-fibre lanes of the internet that were once occupied by Nigerian princes and ads for penis enlargement procedures.
I remember the analogue era as that wicker basket next to the landline phone filled with bad party shots and unflattering posed shots taken on windy days. But somewhere around 1999 those photos vanished and, while we live in a world of endless images, the images we see are almost never concretised on to paper. Perhaps that’s what bugs us about selfies, which are, technically, self-portraiture – it’s their fleetingness. We never get a chance to frame them and put them on our walls; they barely even stick to the walls of Facebook, let alone over the fireplace.
Will there be even more selfies in the future? Yes! Billions more, but the next selfie wave is going to be the 3D selfie, one in which one scans oneself and then prints out one’s 3D effigies in MakerBots at the mall or, as 3D printers become insanely cheaper (which is happening as I type these words), at home on the kitchen counter for $1.95. There still won’t be many printed photos in our future – nobody, in the end, seems to want them – but prepare to be inundated by small MakerBot plastic busts everywhere you look, modified and unmodified: him, her, me, them, them-with-devil-horns, her-with-three-eyes, you with a fork stuck into your forehead. It’s going to be fun, yet the weird thing about a printed-out bust is that it’s not quite the third dimension, and it’s not quite the second dimension either. It’s like photography posing as sculpture – a 2½th dimension.
The key word there is posing – the next wave of 2½D selfies will, with even more effectiveness, allow all of us to pose and put forth a model of who we think we are, as opposed to who we actually are. And what’s wrong with that? Artists have been doing it for thousands of years – and in the 21st century, with all of this kick-ass new technology we’re all, if nothing else, artists.

From chocolate boy to  Haider   Shahid Kapoor has finally arrivedPrint
When Shahid was chosen to play 'Haider', few would have expected him to carry off this role with elan.
Written by Sonal Gera , Edited by Sarika Sharma | New Delhi | Posted: October 6, 2014 1:16 pm | Updated: October 7, 2014 12:11 am
‘Once upon a Friday in 2003, there came a movie ‘Ishq Vishk’ and gave the Indian film industry another chocolate boy by the name of Shahid Kapoor . And a Thursday in 2014 gave it an actor.’
The chocolate boy, then, went on to bag awards for his debut flick and people compared him with the evergreen chocolate hero of the industry – Shah Rukh Khan. He, actually, did resemble King Khan in his looks, acting and especially the choice of movies. But barring ‘Shikhar’ with Ajay Devgn, none of them acclaimed critical respect, leave alone audience’s love.
Through many duds and few hits like Sooraj Barjatya’s ‘Vivaah’, Imtiaz Ali’s ‘Jab We Met’ and Vishal Bharadwaj’s ‘Kaminey’, Shahid Kapoor managed to hold his fort in the Indian film industry.
Last year’s ‘R Rajkumar’ brought a much needed respite to this actor’s career and a lot was pinned on the recently released ‘Haider’.
One word for ‘Haider’ – One can be disappointed with the kind of cinema that’s running nowadays in India; depressed too. And then one day, ‘Haider’, with all its darkness and craft, arrives on the screen. ‘Haider’ happens to complete Vishal Bharadwaj’s Shakespearen trilogy. The adaptation of Shakespeare’s play ‘Hamlet’, ‘Haider’ needed a nuanced actor to portray ‘the most confused character of modern literature’.
Vishal Bharadwaj calls Shahid ‘the most talented actor of his times’, and adds that he needs to tap that talent. It’s quite coincidental that he is the only filmmaker who has been able to do this, till now.
When Shahid was chosen to play ‘Haider’, few would have expected him to carry off this role with elan. But to many’s surprise, the actor has nailed his part and how! In Irrfan Khan’s words, Shahid Kapoor doesn’t emerge as an actor in ‘Haider’; he erupts with a tremendous force. Shahid’s co-star in the movie took to Twitter to express this.
@shahidkapoor in haider doesn’t emerge as n actor he rather erupts with tremendous force. A new chapter begins from here onwards .
— IrrfanK (@irrfan_k) September 29, 2014
‘Haider’, which released this Thursday, has taken the whole industry by storm. Filmstars, filmmakers and critics can’t stop raving about the movie and about Shahid Kapoor, who plays the titular role in the movie. These celebrities are taking to Twitter to appreciate what the talented actor has achieved with this role. Farhan Akhtar was the first one to tweet his IIFA co-host ‘Pappu’. And ‘Pappu’ thanked his ‘Raju’.
I’m loving the music of Haider. Vishal B & Gulzar Saab in their element. All the best to the team & to my dearest Pappu @shahidkapoor

A magnificent start to the work weekA somewhat subjective rating of the day’s weather, on a scale of 1 to 10.
9
After crisp start, it doesn’t get much finer.
Express Forecast
Today: Mostly sunny. Highs 69-74.
Tonight: Mostly cloudy, slight shower chance. Lows: 50-55.
Tomorrow: Mostly cloudy, shower chance. High 69-74,
FORECAST IN DETAIL
We begin the week with a spectacular day.  After a short interruption from the beautiful weather on Tuesday, it comes back for a curtain call Wednesday and Thursday.  Friday – perhaps into part of Saturday – may turn more unsettled but Sunday – right now – looks solid.
Today (Monday): It’s certainly chilly for the early risers – with temperatures ranging from the high 30s into the 40s.  But temperature rally through the morning, warming into 60s thanks to the sunshine.  Afternoon highs reach the low 70s, when some high cirrus clouds may build in. Winds are from the south at 10-15 mph.  Confidence : Medium-High
Tonight: Clouds lower and thicken but rain chances are pretty low – only around 20 percent.  Overnight lows range from 50-55 with light winds from the south.  Confidence:  Medium-High
For related traffic news, check out Dr. Gridlock . Keep reading for the forecast through the weekend…
Tomorrow (Tuesday): More cloudy than not, but temperatures remain pleasant.  I can’t rule out a shower, with the best chance in the morning and in our far western areas.  Highs reach the low-to-mid 70s. Confidence:  Medium-High
Tomorrow night: Showers are likely as a cold front pushes through the region, mainly between early evening and pre-dawn.  Lows range from the mid-to-upper 50s.   Confidence:  Medium

A LOOK AHEAD
High pressure and quiet weather fill Wednesday and Thursday- which could match Monday for nicest days of the week.  Under partly to mostly sunny skies, highs both days are near 70, with overnight lows in the 40s to near 50 (downtown).  Confidence:  Medium-High
Friday and Saturday may both be on the damp side thanks to a front, which had been stalled to our south, lifting northward.  Showers are possible – especially late Friday afternoon into early Saturday morning (when lows are in the low-to-mid 50s)   Saturday afternoon could get some partial clearing, with highs in the mid-to-upper 60s. Confidence: Medium
Assuming the front gets out of the way Sunday, it should be a pretty nice day, with highs in the mid-60s.  Confidence:  Medium

Death of youth escalates tension in communally sensitive old AhmedabadPrint
Express News Service | Ahmedabad | Posted: October 6, 2014 4:07 pm
A day after violent clash between police and local residents in the communally sensitive Shahpur locality in Ahmedabad, the death of a 22-year-old youth has escalated tension in the area on Monday. The youngster had reportedly sustained bullet injuries during the clash and was admitted in VS hospital. He was on the ventilator and succumbed to his injuries early in the morning.
According to police Ashraf Pathan, a resident of Shahpur, sustained bullet injuries during the clash on Sunday late in the evening. Police said that it was a private firing in which the country-made pistol was used. Police have said that the bullet that was used is also made of aluminium and not of standard copper which is used by the police. However, Pathan’s family has said otherwise and demanded forensic test.
Senior police officials said that the funeral procession of Pathan will be taken out in the evening for which heavy police bandobast have been placed across Kalupur, Relief road, Shahpur and Mirzapura areas. Since the morning the local market remained closed till noon. Meanwhile, a camera person of a local TV channel was roughed up by the security personnel at VS hospital where Ashraf died.
On Sunday evening a major clash had erupted between police and locals at Rangila Chowky near Patharwali Masjid when a team of Detection of Crime Branch (DCB) officials went to nab a suspected involved in animal slaughtering case. The police action was protested by the locals who pelted stones at the policemen in which many sustained injuries. The violent mob snatched a service revolver from a sub-inspector who was also beaten up. On Friday night as well a police team was attacked after it apprehended a group of eight persons for ferrying calves in Mirzapur.

Sharply marked borders—lines that separate two abruptly different styles of life—have always puzzled me. Why should they exist? Diffuse borders seem to be more natural.
This is the case of urban landscapes giving way to the countryside. Buildings become more distant from each other and green spaces become longer and more frequent. In the absence of signs you cannot define where the city ends and the countryside begins. This happens in some borders between countries as well, between Canada and the United States and between some countries in Europe, for example. Maybe there are marked differences between, say, Switzerland and Austria, but standing in their common borders it is almost impossible to tell which country you’re in. If you come from Austria, everything begins to look more Swiss as you approach the border, and the other way around if you come from Switzerland. Even Northern Italy looks a little Swiss, or Austrian.
Then there are sharply marked borders, which appear unexpectedly without any warning of an approaching transition, and not only between countries. I remember, for example, 14th Street NW in Washington, D.C. in the 1980s. At the time, the street marked the border between the perfectly safe downtown area and the dangerous zone that bordered the Capitol. Yet approaching 14th street from the downtown side did not lead you into a progressively dangerous area. Conversely, approaching it from the Capitol side did not take you into an increasingly safer zone. It was not like that. It was an abrupt border between two homogeneous areas, uniformly safe on the one side, unvaryingly dangerous on the other, without any gradation.
I always wondered why metastasis did not exist in this environment. Why did danger respect a geographic line and not spread on the other side of it? And, also, why didn’t security invade the other side of the line? There are many examples of these kind of urban borders in which a wrong turn from a safe street suddenly puts you in an extremely unsafe place.
This is the kind of border that exists between Mexico and the United States.
If we could understand why this border is so sharply marked, we would understand why some countries develop and become rich while others remain poor and violent. We would know which are the elements that give shape to the bordering societies, and which others are just accessory—making for a difference but not a sharp break.
Nogales: a city in two countries
Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson addressed this issue in their recent bestseller Why Nations Fail. They start with a comparison between Nogales, Arizona, and Nogales, Sonora—two halves of the same city, one in the United States and the other in Mexico. The income of the average household in the Arizona half is $30,000 a year, that of the other half is $10,000 a year.
North of the border, “people can go about their daily activities without fear for life or safety and not constantly afraid of theft, expropriation, or other things that might jeopardize their investments in their businesses and houses.” Also on the northern side, people take for granted the provision of “electricity, telephones, a sewage system, public health, a road network linking them to other cities in the area and to the rest of the United States, and, last but not least, law and order.”
In contrast, “Most adults in Sonora do not have a high school degree and many teenagers are not in school. Mothers have to worry about high rates of infant mortality…Roads are in bad condition…Law and order is in worse condition. Crime is high and opening a business is a risky activity. Residents of Nogales, Sonora, live with politicians’ corruption and ineptitude everyday.” The border is so marked that you can walk thousands of miles to the south and you will find social conditions similar to those of Nogales, Sonora, while you only have to walk a few meters north to find the totally different conditions of Nogales, Arizona. The border does not connect. It separates two completely different societies.
The differences that set the two Nogales apart are the more striking because, as the authors note, the backgrounds of people on both sides are similar—“they share ancestors, enjoy the same food and the same music, and, we would hazard to say, have the same ‘culture.’” Yet, the differences exist, and not just with Nogales, Sonora, but with all other countries south of the border.
Acemoglu and Robinson attribute the differences to the access that the northern Nogales citizens’ have to the United States economic and political institutions while “those of Nogales, Sonora are not so lucky. They live in a different world shaped by different institutions.”
This idea, that countries develop or not in accordance with the quality of their institutions is not new. Douglas North won a Nobel Prize in 1993, two decades before Acemoglu and Robinson wrote their book, arguing that economic development comes to societies that put in place inclusive institutions—that is, institutions that promote the well-being of all members of society rather than that of only a small group. But the idea is much older than North. The interconnection between institutions and behavior has been recognized for centuries and has been the main axis of the development of political science. It was just the economists who didn’t know that.
In any case, the institutional explanation is the most commonly accepted in the academic and not-so-academic circles concerned with development. Multilateral institutions like the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank and similar concerns dedicate much of their efforts to create institutions in the developing countries, believing that, in this way, people will learn to behave in ways that promote their own development.
But this theory, unfortunately, is empty.
How institutions become a lie
Saying that the behavior of societies depends on the shape of its institutions does not answer why some countries develop while others do not. It only changes the question into, “Why did the former create better institutions of higher quality than the latter?” The emptiness of this theory is easily perceived by looking at the response of the Middle Eastern societies to the attempts to help their development by introducing modern institutions in their midst. Institutions are routines that societies establish to deal with challenges—how to decide on who will govern the country, how to deal with crimes, how to organize production and apportion wealth, in accordance with existing values and behavior. If values and behavior in a society are like those of Sicily, it will develop a Cosa Nostra—an old and very strong institution with very clear rules and procedures—and not a Westminster-like parliamentary regime. Certainly, institutions determine behavior, but most importantly, values and behavior create institutions.
The idea that just changing institutions can change behavior gives the impression that if only the Sicilians copied the British institutions they would begin behaving like Londoners and the mafia would disappear. Also, that if only the Mexicans and other Latin Americans copied the United States’ institutions they would start developing fast. This impression is false because it ignores the fact that there has never been a lack of well-designed institutions in Latin America, including excellent constitutions and many good secondary laws. Moreover, the American constitution was one of the models used by Latin American countries to design their own institutional setting.
The problem is that by imposing a set of institutions that did not correspond with the values and behavior of the people they were imposed on, a deep gap developed between these two dimensions of the Latin Americans’ lives. They created two kinds of institutions—the imaginary ones, which are written in the books of laws, and the real ones, which are not written anywhere but rule their lives.
Thus, the written laws and constitutions are not applied, or are applied only to the weak while the powerful live on privileges that exist well beyond the rule of law. In this way, formal institutions became a lie. People accept the lie and conduct their lives in accordance with other, unwritten institutions that have framed their lives for centuries on end. What frames their behavior is a set of under-the-table institutions, not officially recognized but effectively functional in their channeling of their societies’ activities.
There is one similitude and two differences between the people living across the border from each other in Nogales. The similitude is that both sets of people live under institutions that they choose to guide their behavior and their judgment of the behavior of others. One difference is that in the case of the north, people live according to the official institutions they say guide their life, while in the south they pay only lip service to the official institutions while they frame their actions through a different, hidden but effective institutional setting. The other difference is that the southern behavior and values that shape the real southern institutions are not conducive to progress, while the behavior and values of the northern people are conducive to it. The problem is in the real behavior and values, not in the institutions, which are only consequences of them.
That is, the difference is much deeper than the institutions. It is inside the people.
The power of the people
Just changing the diagnosis in this way turns around the perception of the problem of Nogales, Sonora, and the whole of Latin America. It is not that their institutions are too weak. The real, though hidden Latin American institutions are too strongly embedded in the behavior of the Latin American population. They are as strong as those in the northern part of Nogales and they are manifest in the daily lives of Latin Americans.
Latin Americans have had plenty of time in their two centuries of independence to change their institutions to become more inclusive, or efficient, or whatever they could have wanted to have done. In fact, they have changed their institutions to accommodate their own changes and those of the external world. But these changes have been functional predominantly in the under-the-table set. The difference between that effective set and the official ones has remained in place and in many cases it has just increased as societies evolved from agrarian and rural to urban and industrial.
Changing this state of affairs would not be easy. Just imposing new institutions on top of Latin American societies would only increase the number of false institutions that are there only to be paid lip service. What needs to be changed to spur development is the values and behavior of the individuals. If you don’t do this, the individuals will continue to bypass the formal institutions.
And, if you don’t do this, the border will remain sharp, separating two parts of the continent with different values and behavior, and with widely different results for their efforts to develop.

Hewlett-Packard Plans to Split PC  Printer BusinessesKotak Expects Major Global Cooperation Boost from ING Deal
Hewlett-Packard Co said it would split into two listed companies, separating its computer and printer businesses from its faster-growing corporate hardware and services operations, and eliminate another 5,000 jobs as part of its turnaround plan.
HP said its shareholders would own a stake in both businesses through a tax-free transaction next year, the details of which still needed to be worked out. (Read: Can Hewlett-Packard Survive the Tablet Trend? )
Each business contributes about half of HP's revenue and profit.
Shares of the 75-year-old company, which has struggled to adapt to the new era of mobile and online computing, were up 4 percent at $36.60 in early trading on Monday.
A spinoff of the PC business was last proposed in 2011 by then-Chief Executive Leo Apotheker as the company struggled in the highly competitive PC market. HP later ditched the plan - and Apotheker, replacing him with current CEO Meg Whitman. (Also read: HP Faces Uphill Battle With Newly Minted PC Unit )
"Make no mistake, one HP was the right thing to do to begin the turnaround of this company," Whitman said on a conference call. "But now ... this is definitely the right tactic."
HP said it planned to cut 5,000 more jobs as part of its multi-year restructuring, raising the total under Whitman to 55,000. The company currently has more than 300,000 employees.
The separation will result in a fundamental reshaping of one of technology's most important pioneers, which is on track to generate $112 billion in revenue in the fiscal year this month.
Many investors and analysts had called for a break-up of the company, or a sale of the PC business, so that HP could focus on the more profitable operations that sell computer servers and networking gear and data storage to businesses.
"Shareholders will now be able to invest in the respective asset groups without the fear of cross-subsidies and inefficiencies that invariably plague large business conglomerates," Ralph Whitworth, former HP chairman and founder of Relational Investors LLC, said in a statement.
Relational owns a 1.49 percent stake in HP, which has a market value of almost $70 billion.
HP is the latest in a line of companies, often under shareholder pressure, to spin off operations in an attempt to become more agile and capitalize on faster-growing businesses.
Online auction company eBay Inc, which was formerly run by Whitman, said last week it would spin off electronic payment service PayPal.
Whitman to lead enterprise
Whitman will lead the new Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, which will house the corporate hardware and services operations.
Current lead independent director Patricia Russo will be chairman of the enterprise company.
HP's printing and personal computing business, to be known as HP Inc, will be led by Dion Weisler, currently an executive in that division. Whitman will be chairman of HP Inc.
Founded by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard in a Palo Alto, California garage in 1939, HP was one of the companies that shaped Silicon Valley and the PC revolution. (Read: Hewlett-Packard's Rise, Fall and Future )

Maruti Suzuki targets  loyal customers  to push Ciaz salesMaruti Suzuki targets 'loyal customers' to push Ciaz sales
K Rajani Kanth | Hyderabad Oct 06, 2014 04:58 PM IST
Maruti Suzuki India Limited, the country's top car maker, is planning to tap into its 'loyal' customer base to accelerate sales of its newly-launched mid-sized sedan Ciaz, according to Partho Banerjee, vice-president (dealer development).
"We have more than 1.5 million loyal customers who are looking to upgrade from the A3-segment (compact sedan in which it has Swift Dzire) to the A3+ segment (Ciaz). Ciaz, the first authentic sedan coming out of our stable, is going to fulfil their expectations," he told mediapersons.
Launching Ciaz in the Hyderabad market on Monday, Banerjee said the new mid-sized sedan was positioned to take on competition like Honda City and Hyundai Verna, head on. The market size of the A3+ segment is estimated to be 16,000 units a month. The segment accounts for between 17% and 18% of the total A3 market in India.
Ciaz is powered by K14B VVT petrol and DDiS200 diesel engines. The petrol variants of Ciaz are priced between Rs 7.34 lakh and Rs 8.97 lakh (ex-showroom, Hyderabad), while the diesel variants are tagged between Rs 8.41 lakh and Rs 10.20 lakh. Ciaz is also offered with two automatic transmission petrol variants for between Rs 9.03 lakh and Rs 9.73 lakh.
"We will see how the market responds and then take a call on whether to roll out automatic transmission diesel variants," he said, adding that Ciaz had already crossed 10,000 pre-bookings. "Ciaz has a delivery waiting period of eight to 12 months. Our intention, however, is to serve our customers as quickly as possible."
On the company's focus on the rural markets, where over 50% of its 1,400 sales outlets are located, Banerjee said the upcountry markets were the ones that were giving Maruti Suzuki the growth. "Our objective is to move closer to the customers and serve them. So, we plan to open sales points in rural areas where there is a potential of selling even 10 cars," he said.

How 24 people can drive the same car in one dayBy Matt McFarland October 6 Follow @mattmcfarland
During one Saturday in 2014, 24 different people drive a shared car in Vancouver. (Video courtesy Car2Go)
Cars are lazy. Most spend the overwhelming majority of their time doing nothing, sitting parked in streets, driveways or garages. According to some estimates, cars are parked for 96 or 96.5 percent of their time.
Car ownership is baked into our culture, but does it really make sense to have such an expensive asset that is used so rarely?
Let’s compare the typical car with a vehicle in the sharing economy. The video above shows the busiest Car2Go in North America from April 5. The Vancouver car was driven by 24 people on that Saturday, with an average trip of four miles and 25 minutes. The car isn’t used from about 2 a.m. to 9 a.m., but otherwise it rarely goes an hour without making a trip. (The busiest period occurs about 24 seconds into the clip.)

Monica Lewinsky turn up... in actor Alan Cummings celeb-packed social circleBy Emily Heil October 6 Follow @emilyaheil
Monica Lewinsky (Mark Seliger exclusively for Vanity Fair.)
It seems Monica Lewinsky is having more fun than we might have imagined. In June, the former scandal star penned a Vanity Fair essay that had us just a teeny bit worried on that front. Yes, she wrote, she was dating, but she’d been gun-shy about guys, unable to find a conventional job, and fearful of paparazzi flare-ups.
So we were relieved to read a mention of Lewinsky in the New York Times’s profile of actor Alan Cumming indicating that Lewinsky’s life isn’t all fearful self-Googling. She’s one of the players in “The Good Wife” star’s “starry social circle,” according to the piece, which finds her a regular guest at Cumming’s dressing room-slash-hangout space for his Broadway turn as the emcee in “Cabaret. ” (On a recent stop, shes wearing “a black tank top and a dark tie-dye skirt” to see her pal, whom she met 15 years ago through Harpar’s Bazar editor Gllenda Bailey.)
In addition to members of the cast and crew, other visitors to the space, dubbed “Club Cumming” (really, there’s a neon sign to that effect), have included James Franco, Cate Blanchett and Woody Harrelson, the NYT reports.

The White House had a bad week. So SNL mercilessly made fun of it.By Jaime Fuller October 6 Follow @j_fuller
This weekend's episode of Saturday Night Live began by making fun of President Obama and the buckets of bad press that have poured on the White House this fall. In a spoof of Obama's "60 Minutes" interview from last week, the president revealed that the Islamic State's expertise with LinkedIn, Tindr and hashtags were central to their success.
The Secret Service troubles weren't ignored; Obama left the interview because an agent informed him that a man with a sharpened screwdriver was waiting for him in the Oval Office. They thought it might have been urgent, as he rushed across the White House lawn to get inside.

Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine goes to John O Keefe  May-Britt Moser  Edvard I Mosel6

Stockholm: The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2014 was awarded with one half to John O'Keefe and the other half jointly to May-Britt Moser and Edvard I Moser for their discoveries of cells that constitute a positioning system in the brain.
This "inner GPS" helps explain how the brain creates "a map of the space surrounding us and how we can navigate our way through a complex environment," the Nobel Assembly said.
O'Keefe, of University College London, discovered the first component of this positioning system in 1971 when he found that a certain type of nerve cell was always activated when a rat was at a certain place in a room.
The trio has been awarded for their discoveries of cells that constitute a positioning system in the brain.
#nobel prize #medicine #physiology #john okeefe
Thirty-four years later May-Britt and Edvard Moser, of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim, identified another type of nerve cell that generates a coordinate system for precise path-finding, the assembly said.
It said that knowledge about the brain's positioning system may "help us understand the mechanism underpinning the devastating spatial memory loss" that affects people with Alzheimer's disease.
The Nobel awards in physics, chemistry, literature and peace will be announced later this week. The economics prize will be announced next Monday.

Vadodara pond housing rare turtles filled with mud  authoritiesdenyPrint
Express News Service | Vadodara | Posted: October 6, 2014 6:39 pm | Updated: October 6, 2014 6:42 pm
A pond in Kisanwadi area in Vadodara became a center of controversy on Sunday after locals raised an alarm over the sudden filling up of the water body to bring it to ‘land level’. The pond is home to decades old rare species of turtles protected under the Schedule I of Wildlife Protection Act.
While dumpers bearing the Vadodara Mahanagar Seva Sadan (VMSS) logos went about the work, corporation officials denied having any knowledge of the pond being packed with mud. Municipal Commissioner Manish Bharadwaj has initiated an inquiry into the incident.
The filling up of an unnamed pond in Kisanwadi on Sunday brew up a storm with animal activists rushing in to rescue several gigantic soft shell turtles belonging to the Trianyx Gangeticus family, that inhabit the pond. According to activists, the filling up of the pond is “illegal” as it is the natural habitat of the turtles that are a protected species under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act. About 60 turtles live in this pond, activist say. Neha Patel, a city-based animal activist said, “I rushed here the moment I got a call .
This pond seems like an extension of an original historic well and there is evidence to show that it cannot be just another piece of private land as it is centuries old. This sudden dumping of sand into the pond without a thought for the protected species of turtles residing inside has been undertaken on a weekend to avoid any official procedure.” According to Patel, contractors working on the pond said that the land is a private property of an influential person from Vadodara. Activists also raised query on the presence of dumpers with the VMSS logo at the site.
Municipal Commissioner Manish Bharadwaj denied that any activity to fill up a city pond had been undertaken by the corporation. Bharadwaj, who rushed his officials to inspect the site has ordered the work to be stopped and initiated an inquiry into the incident. “We have sent our officers to the site and we are examining the documents of the land. If it is, it should be part of some town planning scheme.  I have asked my officers to get complete information about this and get back to me,” he said.

#BigBillionDay gets Flipkart millions of unhappycustomersPrint
The Big Billion Day sale seems to have earned Flipkart more angry customers than satisfied ones.
Written by Debashis Sarkar | New Delhi | Posted: October 6, 2014 6:38 pm | Updated: October 6, 2014 9:58 pm
Amidst lot of hype, fanfare and not to forget the full page advertisements on leading newspapers across India, Flipkart introduced “The Big Billion Day” sale on Monday. The e-commerce giant offered products in almost every categories at throwaway prices like a hand blender at Re 1 or a 2 TB portable hard drive at just Rs 600 — though we couldn’t find both online. To make the sale even more irresistible, customer could even avail an extra 10 per cent discount by using a Citi bank or Standard Chartered credit card to shop.
The mega sale started at 8 am and within minutes most of the attractive deals where out of stock. Customers who logged in after 10 am was desperately trying to figure out what exactly Flipkart was offering on its Big Billion Day as most products were sold out. Around noon, Flipkart’s servers gave away to the huge demand and services were disrupted for a short while.
Flipkart’s #BigBillionDay hash tag on Twitter was trending in the morning but soon several other hashtags, critising the sale, like #Flopkart, #Failkart, #Fraudkart, etc started to catch up, as disappointed buyers took to Twitter to express their dissatisfaction. Later in the day, it seemed Flipkart had earned more angry customers than satisfied ones from “The Big Billion Day” sale initiative.
However, Flipkart founders Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal feels that “The Big Billion Sale” was a great success. “The Big Billion Day is an unprecedented day for us as this is the biggest sale ever in India. We are delighted by the overwhelming response from our customers since 8 am today. With a range of exciting offers on quality products at disruptive prices available throughout the sale period, we have created history in Indian e-commerce,” said the founders in a statement.
Previously, Chinese mobile manufacturer Xiaomi made headlines through its flash sales on Flipkart. Which again attracted a lot of criticism, as it simply failed to sell enough, and resulting in a large segment of Indian buyers swearing never to try buying a Xiaomi phone in future. For many, “The Big Billion Day” sale was a redux of the Xiaomi shopping experience.
Flipkart’s sale got over (products going out of stock) before buyers could even actually realise, a classic example being the Samsung Tab 2 which was being offered for Rs 1,399. “The Big Billion Day” must have surely helped in clearing stocks but this would have been far better if Flipkart had clearly mentioned this as a limited flash sale to at least check the public relation nightmare.
Also, visitors complained about prices being marked up before sale as several products were available at lesser prices on rival websites like Snapdeal and Amazon without any offer.

Sania happy with tennis teams show at Asian GamesUpdated: October 6, 2014 23:19 IST
Sania’s sacrifice pays off

TOPICS
Summer Asian Games
Three-time Grand Slam winner Sania Mirza says it took a small sacrifice to play for India at the recent Asian Games. She had to skip the Wuhan Open, which meant losing 900 ranking points.
“But, at the end of it all, I am glad that we (tennis players) contributed to the medals tally. There is no better feeling than representing your country in such a prestigious event,” remarked Sania after her return home on Monday with a mixed doubles gold and bronze in the women’s doubles event.
“I was aware that if I skipped the Wuhan Open, it would mean losing points after having qualified for the challenging WTA Tour finals featuring the top eight players in the world — in both singles and doubles.
“Yet, I was confident of staying in that elite group and I have been proved right,” said a smiling Sania as she looked back at a satisfying last three months, having won the US Open mixed doubles title, Tokyo Open women’s doubles title, two medals at the Asian Games and last weekend’s runner-up finish in the Beijing Open. Significantly, Sania also officially announced that she would be partnering Chinese Su-Wei Hsieh on the women’s doubles circuit from next January.
“It was a call that Cara Black and I had to take. I feel that by playing in a couple of tournaments with Hsieh, we can adjust to the demands of the circuit.
“Being a top doubles player herself, Hsieh should be aware of the challenges ahead. The ultimate goal is to win another Grand Slam title,” Sania said.
Biggest challenge
What was the biggest challenge to be continuously at her peak?
“I just try to stay positive without thinking too much about the results. If you are in a position to give more than 100 per cent, the results are bound to follow.
“It is difficult to predict what will be the outcome of the WTA Tour finals, more so because it is a knockout format. Let us just wait and see how things shape up,” said Sania.
Reflecting on the Asian Games, where she had to strike up combinations in women’s doubles and mixed doubles, Sania recalled that being the senior player she had to take the lead.
“It was all about ensuring the mood was upbeat and not to invite pressure by thinking too much. The focus was just on training hard and playing to our potential,” she said.
“I feel that Saketh (Myneni) is a better player than his current ranking indicates. His forehand is brilliant, and I told him in a lighter vein that if he doesn’t break into the top 50 within a year, he would face the music,” Sania said.
About her goals, she said: “Another Grand Slam title and then the journey to the 2016 Rio Olympics. That is one medal I would love to win before I think of quitting the sport. I think I have the game and the grit to keep going. All I need is a little bit of luck to stay free from injuries,” Sania signed off.

Maruti Suzuki launches Ciaz sedan at Rs 6.99lakhFirst shown as a concept model in the 2014 Delhi Auto Expo earlier in 2014, the Ciaz has replaced the aging SX4 in Maruti Suzuki’s portfolio in India.
Express News Service | New Delhi | Posted: October 6, 2014 6:54 pm
Maruti Suzuki launched the much awaited Ciaz sedan on Monday with introductory prices of the car ranging between Rs 6.99 lakh to Rs 9.80 lakh, ex-showroom Delhi. First shown as a concept model in the 2014 Delhi Auto Expo earlier in 2014, the Ciaz has replaced the aging SX4 in Maruti Suzuki’s portfolio in India.
The Ciaz will be offered in a choice of two engine options across a total of eight variants, namely- VXi, VXi+, ZXi and ZXi Optional for the petrol variants; and VDi, VDi+, ZDi, and ZDi Optional in the diesel variants. The petrol variants of the Maruti Suzuki Ciaz feature the company’s K-Series 1.4 litre four-cylinder naturally aspirated petrol engine that develops 92.5PS of max power @ 6,000 rpm and 130Nm of peak torque @ 4,000 rpm. This engine comes mated to a 5-speed manual gearbox while a 4-speed automatic transmission is also on offer. Although, the automatic gearbox can only be had in VXi+ or ZXi trim. The ARAI certified fuel economy is 20.73 km/l for the manual car, whereas, the automatic version has a slightly lower figure of 19.12 km/l.
The diesel variants are powered by the Fiat derived 1.3 litre four-cylinder turbocharged MultiJet diesel engine that develops 90PS of peak power @ 4,000 rpm and 200Nm of maximum torque @ 1,750 rpm. In the Ciaz, Maruti claims this engine to return an ARAI certified fuel efficiency of 26.21 km/l, thereby, making it India’s most fuel efficient car! Unlike the petrol, the diesel engine variants will only be offered with a 5-speed manual gearbox.
Speaking of the features, the base -VXi / VDi variants are decently equipped and come fitted with central locking, a driver information display, projector lamps, fog lamps, keyless entry, electrically adjustable ORVMs, a double din stereo, rear air-conditioning vents, tilt adjustable steering, front and rear armrests, front and rear cup holders, power steering, all four power windows and rear defogger. The subsequent VXi+ / VDi+ variants get anti-lock brakes, steering mounted audio controls, driver airbag, and reverse parking sensors in addition.
Further up the range, the ZXi / ZDi variants feature alloy wheels, climate control, rear sun blind, illuminated foot well with adjustable lighting, dual airbags, reverse camera, height adjustable driver’s seat, and electrically folding ORVMs.
The top of the line ZXi (O) / ZDi (O) come with start/stop button, leather upholstery, a touchscreen infotainment system with voice recognition, electronic brake force distribution and 16 inch alloy wheels. The ZXi (O) and ZDi (O) variants, however, will be made available in early 2015.
The Maruti Suzuki Ciaz is also claimed to be the most spacious car in its segment as it has the longest wheelbase amongst its competition. The Ciaz will be taking the fight against the Honda City, which is by and large the favorite in the segment.

SP convention to go hi-tech with LED screens  webcast beaming documentary onMulayamPrint
Posters of SP leaders line Gandhi Bridge at Ambedkar Park in Lucknow on Sunday. (Source: Express photo by: Pramod Singh)
Written by Mohd Faisal Fareed | Lucknow | Posted: October 6, 2014 6:51 pm | Updated: October 6, 2014 6:54 pm
The three-day national convention of Samajwadi Party in Lucknow will be high on technology and grandeur with the party planning to set up giant LED screens across the city that will beam a documentary on party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav’s political journey. The SP leadership has also planned to webcast the entire convention on party’s website to boost the morale of the cadres. Mobile vans with screens for digital video display will also be used so that the story of Mulayam’s life is seen by the city’s residents.
The convention will be held from October 8 to 10 at Lucknow’s Janeshwar Mishra Park.
Sources said Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav has personally asked his team to make the documentary with video recordings of Mulayam’s political meetings which he addressed during his early political career. Special video footage of Kranti Rath on which Mulayam toured the state in 1987 too has been arranged from the archives and will be telecast during the convention.
The documentary will show how Mulayam went on to become the chief minister of UP for the first time in 1989, and him sharing the stage with then Janata Dal stalwarts like Choudhary Devi Lal, former Prime Ministers V P Singh and Chandrashekhar.
Old footage of Mulayam when he was member of Dalit Mazdoor Kisan Party and later Janata Dal is also being digitised so that it could be shown during the event.
The party said that Mulayam’s documentary will help inspire SP workers “as many have forgotten the hardships faced by the Netaji while building the party from scratch”.
During the earlier national conventions of the party, stalwarts like Janeshwar Mishra, Brijbhushan Tiwari, Mohan Singh used to share the dais with Mulayam and other SP leaders to present a big socialist family. However, with their demise, party sources said, the onus is on Mulayam this time to inspire the cadres by highlighting his early days of political struggle.
The party convention has always remained an affair controlled by Mulayam where political and economic resolutions prepared by Mulayam’s cousin and Rajya Sabha MP Ramgopal Yadav and speeches by leaders depicting their loyalty towards Mulayam are constant features.
Meanwhile, SP workers are excited about the event and have painted Lucknow in party colour with hoardings installed in every nook and corner. Each hoarding prominently carries the pictures of SP workers to showcase their loyalty to the leadership. At the venue, two separate water-proof enclosures have been set up — one where the dais has been erected and the other where party leaders and workers will have food.
The menu include items from south India, Maharashtra etc. Almost every hotel in Lucknow has been booked for the party leaders’ stay. Senior SP leaders have been given separate responsibility for managing continued…

Music director Koti’s son Roshan is set for his debut
Roshan was a picture of excitement and nervous energy a few hours before his first media appearance. “After I play a song, I think there will be a question-answer session but I am concentrating more on my music,” says Roshan . The 22-year old debutant music director is the youngest of the three children born to music director Koti. As an eight-year-old, he would play drums in school and later in college, he was part of a rock band. At home his father taught him keyboard, programming and technology and he eventually graduated from the Sound and Audio Engineering Institute in New York.
He elaborates, “Dad did teach me a lot, but over there I learnt electronic music production, 5.1 sound, stereo mixing, balancing etc. I studied till V std at Chettinad Vidyasharam in Chennai and after that moved to Hyderabad. I passed out from St Mary’s college. During morning hours I would hang around on my own and discuss music and during nights I would implement it in the studio.”
The young man loves the drums, guitar and keyboard and is very fond of the world music, hip hop and R&B. He recollects Koti buying him every new instrument that came to the market and the amount of music his father had collected for him. He reveals, “If any new keyboard gets released in the market, he would go to any length to get it — be it from USA or Singapore.”
Of his famous grandfather Salur Rajeswara Rao, he says, “I have faint memories of my grandfather. He passed away when I was six-years-old. I now realise his greatness when people keep talking about him. But for me my dad is my hero; he is a dad at home and Hitler at studio, I am just a worker at his studio.”
Ask him why he didn’t take to acting like his brother Rajeev, Roshan says, “I was never interested in movies though my grandmother keeps saying that I should join the movies. I’m more inclined towards music and I think this is what I am cut out for. Music has no language, anything that sounds good is a big hit. My career will revolve around movie music and all one needs to do is be original. That would be possible only when you don’t get influenced and do not allowing anyone to interfere in your work.”

Avid travellers are in a foul mood. Many of them complain that it is no longer possible to get "the cheapest" air ticket. It really doesn`t matter when you book; it all boils down to your luck, they say. The old theory of getting the best rate if a ticket is booked well in advance doesn`t hold true anymore, most of them swear. These days your best fare remains the best only till you run into a fellow traveller at the airport, who managed to get tickets much cheaper, despite booking much later.

Facebook may be eyeing your health data. Should you trust itBy Brian Fung October 3 Follow @b_fung
(REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Files)
Reuters is reporting that Facebook may enter  the health care space — a step that many have been expecting since the company bought the fitness-tracking app Moves earlier this year.
The plans, which are still being developed, would establish online support groups to connect people with similar lifestyles and ailments, according to Reuters. Facebook would also develop a series of apps, some of which would presumably monitor your workout and other aspects of your health.
Online support groups for diseases like Parkinson's and celiac have been around almost since the dawn of the Internet itself. Facebook, too, has all manner of user-created communities to address health care issues. But Facebook may be betting that by creating its own official versions, the company can keep users more engaged with the site and perhaps even improve health outcomes in a small but measurable way.
There's also a lot of money floating around the healthcare industry — an estimated $3 trillion worth — and no doubt Facebook hopes to capture a slice of that market. Health records are so valuable, security experts say, that hackers will pay up to 20 times more for a person's medical record on the black market than for a stolen credit card number.
All this raises questions about the security of your health data as it's increasingly held not by medical professionals like doctors and hospitals, but by tech companies. Moves is one example. Apple's HealthKit , with its ability to collect and centralize health information across apps, is another. Some lawmakers have urged tech companies to prevent the sale of personal health information to third parties and to require that users explicitly opt-in to any information sharing.
"Including provisions like these in privacy policies should be a no-brainer for tech companies," Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) told The Washington Post last month.
There are important distinctions between the kind of health data these companies dabble in and the kind your doctor holds. The former isn't held to the same legal standards as the latter. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, restricts how patients data can be used. But those regulations typically doesn't apply to casual health trackers on smartphones, for example, because consumers are often the ones generating the data — and by using these services, they've often already agreed to share their data. There are effectively "zero" protections for consumers who give up that data, Deborah Peel, executive director of the Austin-based nonprofit Patient Privacy Rights, told my colleague Andrea Peterson in May.
"This is really, really a privacy nightmare," Peel said.
Facebook won't be selling its users' health data to pharmaceutical marketers, according to Reuters. Still, consumers may find themselves torn between their appetite for new, tech-enabled health care services and giving even more data to a company that has been criticized for its privacy practices in the past.
According to Reuters, Facebook is aware of the potential concerns. Its solution? Scrub the health services of Facebook branding:
The company is considering rolling out its first health application quietly and under a different name, a source said. Market research commissioned by Facebook found that many of its users were unaware that photo-service Instagram is Facebook-owned, the source said.
A spokesperson for Facebook declined to comment, saying the company doesn't respond to rumor and speculation.

How to Be Good at Failurereddit
This past year has taught me a lot about failure. By all accounts, it's been successful year. My business grew from zero to over 200 stores, we've been featured multiple times on national television and we just raised $500,000 in investment. At the same time, there isn't a day that goes by when I don't get rejected, by everyone from potential customers to buyers at national grocery stores.
When you shoot for the moon, you're going to get battered by rejection long before you reach any stars. I've found that the key to continuing the journey is to not let failing make you feel like a failure. This is where optimism comes in.
Research has long shown that optimists are more successful than pessimists. People who see the glass half full make more money, have happier marriages and live longer than the cynics of the world. Optimism is a particularly important skill for entrepreneurs.
Starting a new venture is like riding the world's wildest rollercoaster. One minute you're on top of the world; the next you're so deep in a hole that you don't know if you'll ever again see the light. Optimists bask in the glory at the top of the mountain and assume that the valleys will pass. Pessimists are more likely to dismiss their success as a fluke and blame themselves when bad things happen.
My company, Kuli Kuli , had a rollercoaster ride recently when we were featured on MSNBC's Morning Joe show with only two days advance notice. We'd decided to test out a new product, our Moringa Superfood Powder, the week before to see how it sold online before releasing it into stores. The day we were featured on Morning Joe, we received over $30,000 in orders, most of them for our new moringa powder. At the time, we had 50 powder units in stock and were doing all of our order fulfillment ourselves.
The glory of being on national television faded quickly when I began receiving tons of angry emails from customers accustomed to Amazon-style two-day shipping. We source all of our moringa from women's cooperatives in Ghana. Getting those moringa leaves off the tree and into our jars took longer than usual, given the large order and lack of advance notice. Add to that the fact that we're a small team unaccustomed to fulfilling thousands of orders ourselves.
The pessimist might have said that we were over our head and should stop making big television appearances until we had our act together. But the optimist in me insisted that this was a learning opportunity. We worked closely with our suppliers to ensure that we would always have enough moringa in stock to meet demand. We also found an incredible fulfillment house that employs people with autism to fulfill our online orders -- enabling us to respond quickly to large orders and keeping in line with our social mission.
Failing is absolutely the best way to learn. So much so that startup geeks call it "pivoting." In order to turn a bad situation into a "pivot," you need to catch yourself in a moment of despondency and re-focus that negative energy into realizing what you can learn from the situation.
Re-focusing your mind on the sunny side of things isn't easy, especially when your prospects look bleak. But just as you can train your body to adapt to running long distances, you can train your mind towards positivity. For me, that means taking a moment at the end of every day to write down one thing that went well. One experiment showed that just doing this for a week boosted happiness for up to six months.
In a culture so focused on success, it's easy to forget the importance of failure. If you aren't failing, you aren't trying hard enough. Learning how to be optimistic despite setbacks and turn those challenges into learnings is the greatest skill that any entrepreneur can learn.
I'd love to hear in the comments below, what has been your greatest failure?

E-grocer LocalBanya to raise 300 cr  expand ops beyond MumbaiComments
E-commerce wars are hotting up and food and grocery e-tailing seems to be the newest battlefield. While start-up e-grocers are raising more funds, organised brick and mortar retailers are also making plans for big online push.
Mumbai-based online food and grocery retailer LocalBanya plans to raise Rs. 250-300 crore to expand operations beyond Mumbai over the next couple of years.
And it is not alone. Its peers such as BigBasket are also scaling up.
Besides, the big daddies of organised retail — Reliance and Future Group — are also looking at e-commerce for growth. 
The world’s largest e-tailer, Amazon, which sells nutritional products online and recently started selling Coca-Cola’s new product Coke Zero on its Indian marketplace, is also reportedly looking to expand its food and grocery offerings.
“We currently deliver within Mumbai up to Vashi, Thane and Borivali. We are expanding beyond to more suburban areas. Over the next two-three years we plan to start services in 8-10 cities, for which we will need more funds,” Amit Bhartiya, co-founder of LocalBanya, told HT.
The company raised funds from real estate firm Karmvir Avant Group earlier this year.
Bangalore-based BigBasket last month raised Rs. 200 crore from venture funds Helion Ventures and Zodius Capital. Apart from technology upgrade, BigBasket, which currently offers e-grocery services in Bangalore, Mumbai and Hyderabad, aims to use these funds to expand to 10 cities by the end of next year.
According to analysts, these online grocery sites are seeing good demand, especially for nuclear families. LocalBanya, for instance, is servicing around 12,000-13,000 customers per month and the new customer base is growing by 20%, said Bhartiya. “What we have seen is that out of 10 first timers, 7 repeat orders and at least 4-5 of these customers stay and shop with us for beyond 3 months.”
Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Retail has been running a pilot e-commerce project for it’s around 15,000 employees in Reliance Corporate Park in Navi Mumbai for about a year now. The company is likely to use the learnings from the pilot project and it’s expertise in food and grocery retail through it’s Reliance Fresh and Reliance Mart stores to start selling food and grocery online, sources said.
“Having invested in retail talent development and state-of-the art retail infrastructure, we are in a unique position to capitalise on the growing opportunity in India... ,” Ambani had told shareholders at its annual general meeting this year.
“We will further expand the business in existing markets and explore newer markets and channels while leveraging our solid foundation,” Ambani added.
The company, however, remains tight-lipped on how its exactly going to pan out.
While e-commerce penetration in India is currently low, it has huge potential to grow multi-fold, analysts said. “In India, e-tailing has the potential to grow more than hundred-fold to reach a value of $76 billion by 2021. The country’s growing internet-habituated consumer base, which will comprise 180 million broadband users by 2020, will drive the e-tailing story,” according to retail consultancy Technopak.
Future Retail, which runs Big Bazaar hypermarkets, is betting on this growing internet base to push its omni-channel strategy. It is already pushing its electronics chain e-Zone online from this month, with other formats expected to follow over the next few months. Once fully rolled out, a customer can order products in-store, or online across stores and formats and get it delivered home. Its franchisee programme, Big Bazaar Direct, is already operational.
“Today we can’t stock everything in our stores... With the help of technology, we will be able to cater to the customer in a better way,” said Kishore Biyani, CEO of Future Group.
The company opened its first food park in Bangalore recently and has big plans to manufacture and sell branded food products across multiple channels. Biyani expects this to be a big business over the next few years.

Wont utter a word against Sena as tribute to Balasaheb: Modielection
Explaining his silence on the Shiv Sena at his election rallies so far in Maharashtra, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said he would not speak a word against the BJP’s estranged ally as a “tribute” to the late Balasaheb Thackeray.
In his election rallies in Beed, Aurangabad and Mumbai on Saturday, Mr. Modi had attacked the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party but avoided any mention of the Sena.
At the same time, he invoked Maratha warrior Chhatrapati Shivaji multiple times.
Though the BJP broke off its 25-year tie-up with the Sena in Maharashtra, the Sena remains in the NDA government at the Centre.
“This is the first election in Maharashtra to be held in the absence of Balasaheb Thackeray. So I have decided to show my respect for him, I will not speak a word against the Sena,” Mr. Modi said at a meeting in Tasgaon in Sangli district.
Mr. Modi’s strategy could be aimed at weaning away the Sena voters, even as it helps the BJP keep a door open for any post-poll eventuality.

How  Social Shopping  May Impact Holiday SalesYou are here: Home Corporates
Social Networks Make Push as Shopping Destinations
Agence France Presse | Updated On: October 05, 2014 14:07 (IST)
Kotak Expects Major Global Cooperation Boost from ING Deal
Washington: They're not just for sharing any more: Facebook and Twitter are now looking to play a bigger role in shopping.
Both major social networks have unveiled plans to start using "buy" buttons on their sites, which could start having an impact on "social shopping" in the coming holiday season.
The idea of using social networks such as Facebook to promote e-commerce has been around for some time, but so far has failed to deliver much. Facebook had some short-lived programs for "digital gifts" and another programs selling virtual goods via Facebook games.
"Social commerce", stemming from reviews or referrals from social networks, is expected to hit $15 billion by 2015, according to the research firm Invesp.
Some analysts see a natural connection between social networks and shopping since users often discuss products and brands in the messages.
"Sharing is a fairly reliable indicator of what people are going to buy," says Andy Stevens, head of strategy and research for Share This, a company which produces a sharing button for websites and analyses social media trends.
A study by Share This found that among "Millennials" born in the 1980s or 1990s, 55 per cent will click on content shared by their peers, and often use these social media recommendations to decide what to buy.
"People are waking up to the possibility that regular customers are using social networks as part of the decision-making process," Mr Stevens told AFP.
'Untapped potential'
A Harris survey released last month by the marketing firm DigitasLBi found just 5 per cent of Americans have made a purchase on a social media site, but that 20 per cent would consider doing so.
"Our study reveals tremendous untapped potential for growth in social commerce, especially among younger consumers," says DigitasLBi chief executive Tony Weisman.
Mr Weisman said that the amount spent on social shopping could hit $56 billion if 20 per cent of Americans participate. But he noted that concerns holding back social commerce include "security around financial data, privacy, and a seamless buying process".
The survey found 42 per cent were likely to make a purchase on social media if they knew their credit information was secure.
Finding the right strategy
Until recently, social media marketing has been mainly about "softer" strategies such as brand awareness, which are difficult to measure.
Greg Sterling, an analyst at Opus Research, said moving toward social commerce is "a smart thing" for networks like Facebook and Twitter because of the sheer volume of users online, but that marketers need a well-defined strategy.
"Just putting a 'buy' button out there is not going to be effective," he said, unless it is targeted in the right way
"The challenge is building enough context around that 'buy' button."
Mr Sterling said a buy button may be best combined with research on users' browsing habits - an effective if controversial tool.
In a technique called "retargeting", consumers see ads for products or services they have been viewing. Someone researching vacations might see a hotel ad, and one checking out shoes might see footwear from earlier browsing.
"People have a complicated reaction to retargeting," said Mr Sterling. "Some people will be alarmed, others might see it as a welcome personalization."
Mr Sterling said that without this type of tracking ads may be delivered that are irrelevant or inappropriate for different consumers.
And even though retargeting is often criticised, "people do respond to these ads", he said.
Social media will need to be aware of these trends and find ways to deliver ads and purchase opportunities without turning members off, said Sterling, who predicted slow adoption of direct retail sales through Facebook and Twitter.
"I would be surprised if there are a lot of people buying things on Facebook or Twitter in this quarter," he told AFP.
"They are being used as part of a discussion, but I would be surprised to see much sales volume."

Nifty likely to remain in 7840-8160 range in short term(The Nifty is expected to…)
By Mitesh Thacker
The Nifty opened on a subdued note last week and recorded highs of 8030. Since then it started trending down and was moving in a narrow range. Eventually, it closed the truncated week at 7945.55 levels, recording a loss of 23.30 points.
Last week the Nifty traded in a sideways range and found resistance from short-term moving averages . An important point to note on the price chart of Nifty is that it is trading in an upward sloping channel after witnessing election result spike.
Wednesday's price action moving averages have witnessed bearish crossover, indicating short-term weakness in the benchmark index.
Traders should note that as far as the Nifty is sustaining above its support trend line of the channel, till then the trend is likely to remain sideways to positive.
If the Nifty witnesses follow up buying and closes above 8050, then we could see it heading towards 8160 / 8220 levels. A move below the lower support would be viewed by traders as a reversal in the upward trend.
The Nifty is expected to remain in the range of 8050 - 8160 on the upside and 7840 on the downside. It holds an important support at 7840 levels.
Cautious is advised below 7840 levels. If the Nifty closes below 7840, then it can further decline up to the lows of 7745 / 7590 levels.
In a nutshell, the market is trading in a crucial support zone. This week's move is important as it would be an intermediate trend decider for the Nifty.

Indian mkts can double in next four years: JPMorganChristian Preussner
(Our expectations are certainly…)
The Federal Reserve is more likely to increate interest rates in the second half of 2015, said Christian Preussner, executive director and head of international client portfolio management at JPMorgan Asset Management. In an interview with Biswajit Baruah, Preussner spoke about the impact of the US rate hike on India and slowing foreign portfolio flows among other matters. Edited excerpts:
We have seen bouts of volatility in emerging markets, including India, in the recent past as investors are getting increasingly worried about US interest rate hike. What are your expectations?
Our expectations are certainly a bit more conservative. Hence, our forecast is that rate hikes in the US will probably happen in the second half of next year. Then there will be more gradual increase in short-term interest rates there. The reason for saying this is that the inflation rate is still quite low at around 1.9-2%, and from that perspective, the Fed is not overly pressured in taking immediate action. At the same time, the Federal Reserve Bank wants to see a broader continuation of the unemployment rate going down. We would be seeing around 100-basis point rate hike by the end of 2015, and then gradual continuation of hikes into 2016.
How do you see emerging markets like India getting impacted from the Fed rate hike?
If the US is increasing rates, then from net investment perspective, it's more attractive to invest in the US markets. We expect the US GDP growth to be anywhere between 2.5% and 3%. It's definitely an environment where we see high single-digit to low double-digit total returns from US equities going forward. I don't think we are currently getting positive in emerging markets at this point in time. The Indian market has been doing already quite well and still continues to see upside potential.
Foreign portfolio inflows have hit a 7-month low in the last two months. Is this a cause for serious concern for Indian stocks?
The funds coming to India are essentially regional funds and within that India's weightage is 6%, and people are allocating 9-10% weightage to India and that's where most of the flows have to come to India. At this point of time, what is happening is incrementally people are not supporting country-dedicated funds, and within that India-dedicated funds. They are putting more in emerging markets as a theme and so India being overweight is getting the money flow from those types of funds. India is not getting pure India-dedicated money at this point of time. That's where you will see some aberration. But, if you look at the appetite for FIIs to invest, they are waiting for the issuances to come in, and then the flows will automatically happen. I would see it more as an aberration, rather than a worry.
In your global stocks portfolio, how is India positioned?
India is certainly coming out to be 'Overweight' among all the markets. If you look at asset classes which essentially tend to do well during rising US interest rates, it is the higher dividend emerging market equities then pure emerging market equities. If you see India, China, or the Asean region, they all tend to benefit when growth stabilises in the developed markets. The ECB has given a big boost to liquidity by pushing rates to near zero. The US is showing strong strength on the growth side. Japan has been reasonably steady. All this augers well for the emerging market equities because the rise in US interest rates is essentially a response to the growth, and it's not negative. It's essentially in response to the growth being normalised, so you don't require that excess easy monitoring conditions any more.
What kind of returns do you expect from Indian stocks, going forward?
We are talking about the next four years' earnings growth of around 22%. That's a substantial jump from the current 12% or 13%. So, if that is true, we are talking about doubling of markets over the next four years because markets are ultimately a slave of earnings growth. In the interim, there will be news flows, which could keep on impacting the markets, but we are not looking at anything in the short term. We are very confident that the economy is looking to reverse from here and continuously advocating for looking at the markets from three to five-year perspective, because the government itself is now talking about 5-year and 10-year objectives.
 
Which are the sectors you are bullish on?
The sectors we are pondering over are cyclicals; the good companies which are in a position to construct good roads at reasonable cost are going to benefit from the new government policies. Cement is something of a very clean sector which will be a direct beneficiary of the infrastructure development. In the auto segment, the four-wheeler segment is seeing revival, so that is something we are positive on. Within financials, we are concentrating on the private banking side. So these are the things we are positive on.
Pharma and technology stocks have staged a strong comeback in the September quarter. Would you like to advise investors to accumulate these ?
Pharma and IT stocks' valuations are stressed; we are more 'Neutral' on them and have cut our exposure.

Vishal Sikka ropes in former SAP colleague Michael Reh to revive Infosys' Finacle
Neha Alawadhi & Varun Sood, ET Bureau Oct 6, 2014, 04.37PM IST

Finacle
(Reh, who joined Infosys…)
NEW DELHI/BANGALORE: Vishal Sikka has tasked his former colleague from SAP , Michael Reh to help revive the fortunes of Infosys's core banking, Finacle, thereby underlying the significance of the division after the first non-founder CEO said that he aims to double company's investment to revive the struggling solutions vertical.
M Haragopal, senior vice president and head of Finacle, decided to end his over two decade stint with the Bangalore-based company, prompting Sikka to anoint Reh, who joined Infosys on October 1. Reh, formerly EVP for business information and technology at SAP, will continue to be based out of Hamburg, Germany, ET learns.
This change in leadership at Finacle is effective October 20.
"Haragopal...has expressed his desire to move from Infosys to pursue his entrepreneurial ambitions. The management has accepted his request and has appointed Michael Reh as Senior Vice President and the new Global Head of Finacle," Infosys said in an internal email sent to employees on Monday.
An Infosys spokesperson declined to comment, saying: "As a matter of policy we do not comment on the appointments or exits other than Members of the Board or Executive Officers"
Although Infosys does not share revenues generated from its core banking product, over the last three years Finacle has seen revenues dip from from $314 million in 2012 to $297 million by the end of March 2014, estimates advisory firm Nelson Hall. This was mainly on account of poor demand from banks to invest in next generation core banking solutions and company's inability to tap into the large US market, said one former Infosys executive.
For now, Infosys clubs revenues from Finacle along with its clients from the banking, financial services and insurance space, which accounts for a little over 33.5% of company's $8.25 billion revenues.
Last week, Sikka told industry participants at an Infosys customer event in Berlin that among other things, he plans to double investments in Finacle, without sharing details. Some experts, including Rachael Stormonth, senior vice president at Nelson Hall, believe that Infosys may look at expanding Finacle brand to include insurance, something which Mumbai-based TCS has done with its core banking product BaNCS.
For now, Infosys has been successful in selling Finacle to 170 banks in emerging markets, including Asia Pacific, Middle East and Latin America, and has built customer base in Ireland, the Netherlands and the UK. These geographies account for about over 90% of Finacle's revenues while US accounts for remaining 8-9%, according to an executive at banking financial and services space at Infosys. Experts at Forrester and Nelson Hall believe that Sikka could help expand Finacle's reach in the US as there is "pent-up demand" for replacement of core banking systems from both large and small banks.
"Finacle is also one of a small group of solutions that offer more than basic social media support," said Frederic Giron, VP and Research Director, Forrester Research.

Even Mickey Mouse cant ride out Europes ailing economyOctober 6, 2014
American Mickey is giving European Mickey a helping hand.
Walt Disney will bail out Euro Disney, owner of Disnyeland Paris, with €1 billion  ($1.26 billion) that will help free up cash and cut debt at the long-suffering French theme park. Disney will invest €420 million through the issuing of new shares and convert €600 million in debt to equity. It will also defer interest payments owed over the next few years to 2023.
Disney owns 40% of the shares in its European sibling. Saudi prince al-Waleed bin Talal , who has stakes in News Corp, Citigroup, Paris’s Hotel George V, and more—owns 10% but reports say he has not decided whether he will exercise his option to buy new shares.
Investors reacted to the news by sending shares down 15% in early trading. In fact, since the theme park’s shares made their debut, Euro Disney hasn’t been very magical for shareholders:

The Homeland season with no BrodyClaire Danes as Carrie Mathison in “Homeland.” (Joe Alblas/Showtime)
This post discusses the plot of the Oct. 5 episode of “Homeland.”
When Carrie Mathison’s (Claire Danes) co-workers in Afghanistan present her with a birthday cake, she notices that below the blazing candles is a new title for her: “The Drone Queen.” It would be an uneasy sobriquet under any circumstances: We first met Carrie three years ago when she was investigating Sgt. Nicholas Brody (Damian Lewis), an American soldier and prisoner of war who dedicated himself to terrorism after a young boy he’d come to know in captivity was killed in a drone strike. And there is something particularly uneasy about watching Carrie, who used to do her best work on the ground at personal risk to herself, call in strikes from the the sterile chill of an operations center.
“We had an unbelievably rigorous first three months of this season because it is like a pilot,” Meredith Stiehm, an executive producer on “Homeland,” said in August, talking about the show’s reboot in the wake of Brody’s death last season. “We went to this week in Washington talking to these CIA people and asked State Department people, asking them, ‘What’s on your mind?’ And then we debated all five to seven of those countries for quite some time. So it did feel like the process you go through when you’re creating a new show.”
But even though “Homeland” is focused on Pakistan this year, the show feels more like a reset than a whole new program. Drones are still its main concern. It is just the way into the subject that is different.
In its initial iteration, “Homeland” focused on the impact of drone strikes by emphasizing how a Westerner — if one who had converted to Islam and spent years living with the Osama bin Laden-like Abu Nazir (Navid Negahban) — was radicalized by America’s use of the weapons. This time, the show is coming in from a number of new angles.
First, there is Ayaan Ibrahim (Suraj Sharma), a young man who survives a strike that Carrie calls in. The hit was  supposed to take out just the No. 4 figure on the American kill list, but the weapon ended up detonating in the middle of a wedding. Ayaan is the only person pulled out of the rubble, and the look he aims at the cameras in the sky after identifying the bodies of his families is poisonous and grief-stricken.
“Homeland” has been talking for years about how collateral damage from drone strikes can produce new enemies for America. Ayaan’s performance for the cameras is unnerving to Carrie and her colleagues because it is clear he knew to look for them. The American drone teams are no longer anonymous figures raining death down on unsuspecting targets.
Pakistani citizens may not have the technology to shoot drones out of the skies, but they can make clear to drone operators that they know who they are and what they are doing. And they can visit their own kind of horror back on casualty-averse Americans, as they do when Sandy (Corey Stoll), the station chief in Islamabad, has his cover blown. The scene of him being cornered on a street, then dragged from Carrie and Quinn’s (Rupert Friend) car, is among the most effective and unnerving action sequences “Homeland” has ever put on-screen.
The cumulative impact of drone strikes and targeted killing grinds away at American personnel, too, as becomes clear in a young pilot’s tense confrontation with Carrie in a bar.
“You know me as Smash 12. I flew the mission into Pakistan the other night,” the man tells Carrie, before demanding to know how she deals with making calls that lead men like him to kill innocent civilians, as with the guests at the wedding. “Do you ever feel that? Sick to your stomach? … I killed 4 Canadian soldiers in January on bad orders. Dropped a 200-pound bomb on their heads. Monsters. F—— monsters. All of you.”
“It’s a job,” Carrie tells Quinn, who is clearly distressed by the prospect of “checking names off a kill list for a living.” They both know that what they are doing is not just a job. The new “Homeland” is not that new, and it has a major trust deficit to pay off. But it can still be unsettling when it asks whether jobs like this one should even be done at all.
[Correction: The initial version of this post suggested that Ayaan's family had been killed by a drone. In fact, it was a targeted strike. Carrie is responsible for calling in both kinds of operations. The post has been updated to reflect the difference.]

RBI should raise rates to contain inflation:...Arun Jaitley
(The paper suggested that…)
NEW DELHI: The Reserve Bank may consider raising interest rates to bring down the persistently high inflation on a durable basis, suggested IMF working paper.
"Given elevated and persistent inflation,... the RBI may also need to raise rates to tackle inflation durably, particularly if faced with a persistent and sizable supply- side food price shock putting pressure on broad-based inflation," said the paper titled -- 'Food inflation in India: The role for monetary policy'.
Food and fuel inflation in India has remained high for several years, the paper said adding to durably reduce the current high inflation, the monetary policy stance needs to remain tight for a considerable length of time.
It suggested that the government should pursue structural reforms to push growth to potential levels instead of relying fully on monetary policy to promote growth.
RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan has been pursuing hawkish monetary policy stance to keep inflation under check. It has not reduced rates in four consecutive policies despite pressure from the industry and the Finance Ministry to cut rates to boost growth.
The government is in touch with the RBI to set up a new structure to deal with monetary policy issues, including targeting of inflation, in line with the recommendations of the Urjit Patel committee .
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had said in his Budget speech on July 10: "It is also essential to have a modern monetary policy framework to meet the challenge of an increasingly complex economy. Government will, in close consultation with the RBI, put in place such a framework".
The Committee had suggested that the RBI should target to bring down retail inflation to 8 per cent by January 2015 and 6 per cent by January 2016.
"At the current juncture, with food inflation remaining persistently high for five years, monetary policy needs to remain tight to control generalised inflation," the paper said.
The WPI inflation dropped to a 5-year low of 3.74 per cent in August, while the retail inflation stood at 7.8 per cent.
The paper said since inflation is mostly backward looking, monetary policy has to maintain a tight stance for a prolonged period of time.

India  4 other countries to build biggest te...India, four other countries to build world's biggest telescope
By PTI | 6 Oct, 2014, 05.42PM IST
The 30-meter telescope, or TMT, will be established near the summit of the Mauna Kea volcano with a cost of $1.4 billion.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
TOKYO: India along with Japan, the US , China and Canada will start work on the world's biggest telescope on Hawaii Island that will enable to identify an object as small as coin from a distance of 500 kms.
The 30-meter telescope, or TMT, will be established near the summit of the Mauna Kea volcano with a cost of $1.4 billion.
They plan to complete the construction in March 2022. Japan will cover about a quarter of the construction costs.
To mark the start of construction, some 100 astronomers and officials from the five countries were scheduled to attend a ceremony held tomorrow at a location 4,012 meters high on Mount Mauna Kea, Kyodo news agency reported.
The TMT will be larger than Japan's Subaru Telescope, one of the world's biggest, which was also built on the summit of Mauna Kea and started observation in 1999.
The Subaru Telescope's single main mirror measures 8.2 meters in diameter, while the TMT will be composed of 492 hexagonal mirrors, each measuring 72 cm across.
The TMT's light-condensing capabilities will be 13 times greater than the Subaru telescope's, enabling the identification of an object as small as a coin from a distance equivalent to 500 kms, distance between Osaka and Tokyo.
Astronomer Masanori Ie, a professor at the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan who leads the Japanese team on the TMT project, said the new telescope will broaden the understanding of the cosmos.
A telescope with greater light-condensing capabilities can search for stars that are less bright or farther from Earth. The most distant and oldest star observed to date was born some 800 million years after the Big Bang.
The TMT will help astronomers observe stars which were born 200 million to 400 million years after the Big Bang.
The TMT will also have the potential to help identify whether planets outside the solar system have atmospheres that are capable of supporting life.

India and Pakistan did not exchange sweets along the Wagah border in Punjab on the occasion of Eid on Monday after the Pakistan Rangers violated the ceasefire along the international border in Jammu district killing five civilians and injuring 29.
In one of the worst ceasefire violations, Pakistani Rangers resorted to firing and shelling of mortars on 10 border outposts and civilian areas along the international border in Arnia belt of Jammu district on Sunday night.

During a late evening flag meeting between the sector commanders of the Border Security Force and Pakistan Rangers on Sunday, the Rangers refused to fix any time for the ceremony to be held on Monday, PTI quoted unnamed official sources as saying.
"The Pakistan side refused the exchange of sweets on Eid today. They cited no reasons but it is understood that the prevailing tension along Jammu and Kashmir border due to unprovoked firing incidents from the other side is the reason," the sources said.
The BSF too did not make any movement along the Wagah border and the border gates remained shut on Monday.
The exchange of sweets between the border guarding troops of the two countries is an old and traditional gesture which is aimed to show goodwill. The same drill is held during Diwali and Independence day of both the countries.
Senior commanders from both the sides exchange sweets in their official uniforms along the Wagah land border which is also frequented by locals and tourists from both sides.
PTI also reported that the evening retreat and lowering of flag ceremony is expected to take place as scheduled.

HP Splitting Its Business in 2Oct 6, 2014 8:30am
Morning Money Memo …
Hewlett-Packard confirms it is separating its personal computer and printing business from data storage, servers and software. The aim is to boost productivity.
Early on, investors were applauding, pushing up HP’s share price by more than 6 percent early today.
The company has laid off tens of thousands of employees in recent years because of sagging sales as customers turn to mobile devices. The shift has cut demand for HP’s desktop and laptop computers, as well as its printers.
The PC and printer business will use the name HP Inc.
The services business will take the name Hewlett-Packard Enterprise and it will be led the current CEO Meg Whitman.
HP PC and printer chief Dion Weisler will be CEO of HP Inc.
HP’s decision came as several other technology firms either break in two or spin-off parts of their business. Last week, eBay said it planned to make PayPal a stand-alone business.
In 2013, HP lost its place as the largest PC maker as China’s Lenovo gained market share.
Wal-Mart Enters Insurance Arena
Wal-Mart is taking one-stop shopping to another area: health insurance.
The world’s largest retailer plans to work with DirectHealth.com, a health insurance comparison site and agency, to allow shoppers to compare coverage options and enroll in Medicare plans or the public exchange plans created under the Affordable Care Act.
Wal-Mart’s move is another step into insurance marketing as the retailer tries to use its size to expand beyond food and other basics at a time of sluggish traffic and sales. It also could help Wal-Mart compete with drugstore chains such as Walgreen and CVS, which are rapidly adding health care services.
Customers can enroll online, by phone or at 2,700 of Wal-Mart’s more than 4,000 stores, starting Friday. The stores will be staffed with independent insurance agents from DirectHealth.com.
In April, Wal-Mart teamed up with Autoinsurance.com to let shoppers quickly find and buy auto insurance policies online.
Rich Give Less; Other Give More
A new report on charity finds the rich are giving less while poor and middle income Americans dig deeper to help good causes.
An analysis of IRS data by the Chronicle of Philanthropy showed that Americans who earned $200,000 or more reduced the share of their income they gave to charity by 4.6 percent from 2006 to 2012. Those earning less than $100,000 donated 4.5 percent more.
The Chronicle of Philanthropy, a leading source of news coverage of the nonprofit world, said its analysis was based on tax returns filed by Americans who itemize their deductions, including their charitable gifts. According to the report, changes in giving patterns were most pronounced in major cities, where the percentage of income that residents donated dropped sharply.
Metal Pieces Prompt Meat Recall
A Texas company is recalling nearly 91,000 pounds of ground beef products that might be contaminated with pieces of metal, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said.
Corpus Christi-based Sam Kane Beef Processors is recalling the beef products after four consumer complaints about pieces of metal being found. Three of the products – packages of 3, 5 and 10 pounds – were sold by HEB stores, and another was a set of 10-pound packages of formed patties made from Sam Kane Beef Processors “Ground Chuck.”
GM Recalls
More recalls by General Motors: The latest round includes more than 60,000 cars. The recalls are Pontiac G8s from the 2008 through the 2009 model years and 2011-2013 model Chevrolet Caprice PPV left-hand-drive sedans imported from Australia.
GM said the ignition switch key may shift from the “run” position when touched by the driver’s knee. The company said it is aware of one crash related to the problem, but no injuries.
Another recall covers about 10,000 Cadillac CTS-V sedans from the 2004-2007 model years and 2006-2007 model Cadillac STS-Vs. On some vehicles, the fuel pump module electrical terminal may overheat.

Why Hong Kong shouldnt forget Tiananmen: advice from a 1989 activistHan Dongfang (middle) in Tiananmen Square in 1989.(Han Dongfang personal archives)
Q: Do you think the Chinese government is like that right now?
HD: Some of them, yes. I believe so, I am afraid. Especially the people who are in charge of analyzing Hong Kong.
Q: The protesters are running into problems of disunity, exhaustion, attacks by thugs, and anger from local residents. In 1989, how did you deal with this?
HD: Once you enter this kind phase where maintaining this level of excitement becomes one of the goals, that is poisoning. It sounds strange, how can you not maintain high spirit of the movement? But once this becomes the goal, that’s dangerous. In our labor work, we don’t maintain high spirit for the sake of it. Once we have the negotiating opportunity we immediately grab it.
  It’s the arrogance of power. You think you have force therefore you become lazy.  
Q: How would you compare the protesters in Hong Kong today to Beijing in 1989?
HD: At that time [in 1989] students came from different universities and each university you had some sort of election and you had leaders. And when you make a decision, people know how the decision is made and [if some] are against it, they can follow the procedure to overturn it, but here you don’t have this. At least from what I can see.
Q: Does that mean you are worried about the protests escalating too far?
HD: Street protests have their own rhythm. No one can plan, no one can completely control and direct it, and as I said before there is no democratic process for people to follow here. You just need a small number of people that can be a trigger point.

Q: Are you worried about the government using force to put down protests?
HD: If people are powerful [and] have weapons—it’s easy for people who have those things to look down on others like you’re nothing, a piece of shit. It’s easy for those people to forget how to be rational. Sometimes these people, at some point, they just can’t wait for the moment that they have the excuse to use force. It’s not only about the communist Chinese government. To my understanding it’s human. The street protesters, when they see this, they are psychologically provoked. And for both sides, the irrational part becomes the winning element.
Q: Do you think the People’s Liberation Army, which already has between 8,000 and 10,000 troops stationed in Hong Kong, could come out to put down the protests?
  I do believe the mainstream within the Chinese Communist Party did learn the lesson 25 years ago.   HD: I don’t believe that. People do learn and sometimes when we talk about those people and we don’t like how they did something many years ago, we tend to emotionally say, “These stupid people, they never learn.” Let’s put some basic faith in humanity.
Twenty five years ago, the PLA ran into a protest. At that time, China was different from today. You don’t compare. Sometimes when you tell people that it’s different, it sounds like you are complimenting the Chinese government. But sometimes you don’t compliment or criticize. There are other things to say.
I do believe the mainstream within the Chinese Communist Party did learn the lesson 25 years ago. And I do believe that most of them don’t want to send the PLA to Hong Kong to deal with this. It’s suicidal. I don’t even believe that if the similar thing happened in China in Beijing again, that they would send PLA tanks again. PLA tanks in Hong Kong streets? I don’t believe so.

Gone Girl: Lets discuss that endingRosamund Pike appears in a scene from “Gone Girl.” (AP Photo/20th Century Fox, Merrick Morton)
(Obviously, this post includes many spoilers about the “Gone Girl” movie and book.)
So, the “Gone Girl” ending. Let’s discuss.
Given the controversy already surrounding the twisted conclusion in the bestselling book (some love it, some want to set it on fire), author Gillian Flynn did not have an easy task in front of her when she adapted the screenplay . The frenzy increased when Flynn said a few months ago the ending would be completely different — but then later backtracked and explained that was an exaggeration.
Now that the movie is out — and a success at the box office with a $38 million opening weeken d — and the mystery ending is finally revealed, it turns out … yeah, it’s pretty much exactly the same as the book.
Sure, there were a few small differences, but overall, the crazy conclusion remained the same. Even though Amy (Rosamund Pike) framed husband Nick (Ben Affleck) for her murder — revenge for him having an affair, among many other complicated reasons — he does not leave her when she arrives back at home. Just as Nick is about to tell the world about Amy’s socipathic behavior — in the book, he’s writing a tell-all novel; in the movie, he’s prepping for a TV interview — Amy arrives with one more surprise: She’s pregnant.
And just as in the book — that’s how it ends. (The baby was conceived through a very twisted manner: Amy saved Nick’s sperm from when she tricked him into going to a fertility clinic months ago.) Nick knows he has to stay with Amy forever to protect his child from her, and so they stay together as one incredibly messed up family.
On so many levels, this is very frustrating. It’s one thing to read about how Amy is a complete psychopath without consequences. It’s another to actually see on screen when she murders ex-boyfriend Desi (Neil Patrick Harris), who rescued Amy when her runaway plan didn’t work out. She brutally stabs him to death and she faces no punishment.
In fact, the movie version was even a little more infuriating in how she gets away with a cold-blooded murder. In the book, at least Desi’s mother goes to the police, hysterical, saying that Amy killed her son — even though she’s whisked away, there’s the faint hope that maybe the case is re-opened somewhere down the line.
Not so much in the film, as the mother character didn’t exist. Desi is left for dead, as Amy tells police he kidnapped her and she escaped. And since the police look incompetent for trying to pin her murder on Nick (when it turns out she was alive this whole time) they have to believe her story.
Overall, this “happily ever after ending” for the World’s Most Dysfunctional Marriage is a lot more difficult to take when you see Amy’s path of destruction. While Nick was a terrible husband, you can’t help but feel for him the entire film, especially when it’s repeatedly stated that Missouri has the death penalty if he’s convicted of killing Amy. When he’s “saved” after she returns, you’re relieved for a second; but then you really, really want Amy to get the punishment she deserves for pulling off such a scheme.
Alas, that will not happen in any version of Flynn’s story. In the movie and the book, the fact that Nick and Amy stay together (with a baby on the way!) is considered somewhat justified when Amy reminds Nick that after all they’ve been through, he’ll be bored with anyone else if he divorces her.
Maybe true, but he could also be murdered. That’s left unclear — the last line of the movie sees Amy gazing lovingly at Nick as he asks in a chilling voiceover: “What have we done to each other? What will we do?” At least in the book, on the last page, Nick gets a pretty epic zinger. When he dotes on Amy during her pregnancy, she asks why she’s being so nice to him — and he responds, “Because I feel sorry for you … because every morning you have to wake up and be you.”
That remark really gets under Amy’s skin, and it’s somewhat telling that maybe they won’t be able to keep up this horrible charade, especially with a new baby in the house. Unfortunately, in the movie, there’s no such closure — we’re just left with the unsettling feeling that many more terrible things are about to happen.

Hewlett-Packard boosts planned job cuts to 5...Hewlett-Packard to split into two companies
Hewlett-Packard to split into two companies
Hewlett-Packard said Monday its corporate reorganisation would slash a total of 55,000 jobs, at least 5,000 more than its latest estimate.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
Hewlett-Packard Co said it would split into two listed companies, separating its computer and printer businesses from its faster-growing corporate hardware and services operations, and eliminate another 5,000 jobs as part of its turnaround plan.
HP said its shareholders would own a stake in both businesses through a tax-free transaction next year, the details of which still needed to be worked out.
Each business contributes about half of HP's revenue and profit.
Shares of the 75-year-old company, which has struggled to adapt to the new era of mobile and online computing, were up 4 per cent at $36.60 in early trading on Monday.
A spinoff of the PC business was last proposed in 2011 by then-Chief Executive Leo Apotheker as the company struggled in the highly competitive PC market. HP later ditched the plan - and Apotheker, replacing him with current CEO Meg Whitman.
"Make no mistake, one HP was the right thing to do to begin the turnaround of this company," Whitman said on a conference call. "But now ... this is definitely the right tactic."
HP said it planned to cut 5,000 more jobs as part of its multi-year restructuring, raising the total under Whitman to 55,000. The company currently has more than 300,000 employees.
The separation will result in a fundamental reshaping of one of technology's most important pioneers, which is on track to generate $112 billion in revenue in the fiscal year this month.
Many investors and analysts had called for a break-up of the company, or a sale of the PC business, so that HP could focus on the more profitable operations that sell computer servers and networking gear and data storage to businesses.
"Shareholders will now be able to invest in the respective asset groups without the fear of cross-subsidies and inefficiencies that invariably plague large business conglomerates," Ralph Whitworth, former HP chairman and founder of Relational Investors LLC, said in a statement.
Relational owns a 1.49 per cent stake in HP, which has a market value of almost $70 billion.
HP is the latest in a line of companies, often under shareholder pressure, to spin off operations in an attempt to become more agile and capitalize on faster-growing businesses.
Online auction company eBay Inc, which was formerly run by Whitman, said last week it would spin off electronic payment service PayPal.
WHITMAN TO LEAD ENTERPRISE
Whitman will lead the new Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, which will house the corporate hardware and services operations.
Current lead independent director Patricia Russo will be chairman of the enterprise company.
HP's printing and personal computing business, to be known as HP Inc, will be led by Dion Weisler, currently an executive in that division. Whitman will be chairman of HP Inc.
Founded by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard in a Palo Alto, California garage in 1939, HP was one of the companies that shaped Silicon Valley and the PC revolution.
Goldman Sachs & Co served as financial adviser to HP, while Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz served as legal adviser.

Modi and BJP s campaign is like Afzal Khan s army  says Uddhav ThackerayUddhav compares BJP campaign to Afzal Khan's army
IANS  Osmanabad (Maharashtra), October 06, 2014

In the worst-ever attack yet on former ally BJP, Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray on Monday likened the ongoing poll campaign in Maharashtra by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's cabinet to an assault by Bijapur general Afzal Khan's army on Shivaji's dominion in the 17th century.
"What are they up to? First Modi comes to campaign, then his entire cabinet team is campaigning for votes in Maharashtra. They are like the army of Afzal Khan trying to conquer this state," Uddhav thundered at a huge public rally in the temple of town of Tuljapur.
He noted out that besides Modi, the home minister, external affairs minister, chief ministers and other top leaders were campaigning for the Maharashtra assembly elections scheduled for October 15.

The Sena chief alleged that their whole intention is "to break the state into pieces" in the name of bringing progress and development here.
"But, the people of Maharashtra will not tolerate such attempts. They (team Modi) will be made to bite the dust," he asserted to applause from the people.
He pointed out that Afzal Khan too met a similar fate when he tried to break up the Maratha empire of Chhatrapati Shivaji.
"Do you want Maharashtra to be divided into many pieces? Then vote for BJP. Do you?" he asked the gathering, which roared back "no, no."
Modi, during his campaign trail, is noted for his interactive connect with the crowds by asking similar questions and eliciting their responses.
Uddhav recalled his previous rally in Tulzapur in the last week of September when many party activists were reluctant to snap ties with the Bharatiya Janata Party.
"The party workers wanted the Sena flag fluttering in Tuljapur and in Mantralaya (the state government headquarters). But what if the seat went to the BJP quota? The workers were still insistenent," he said.
Just then (September 25), news trickled from Mumbai that the BJP had unilaterally snapped its 25-year-old alliance with the Shiv Sena, he said.
"What BJP?... The breaking of the alliance was probably the will of Goddess Tulja Bhavani. I got this feeling," Uddhav said.
However, he acknowledged that if the late BJP leaders Gopinath Munde and Pramod Mahajan were alive, he would not have allowed the alliance to break.

We've all heard it before: Americans are lousy when it comes to saving for retirement. The justification for the lack of savings ranges from economic hardship to our inability to escape the consumerism that surrounds us on a daily basis. Regardless of the reason, many people refuse to change their financial habits. However, options are available to those who haven't built a large nest egg for retirement.
An unsurprising portion of Americans have nothing saved for their golden years. According to a recent survey by Bankrate , 33% of 30- to 49-year-olds have not saved any money for retirement, while 26% of 50- to 64-year-olds say the same. In fact, 14% of people 65 and older haven't placed any money aside for the future, either. Yet the majority of Americans feel the same or better about their personal finances than they did last year.
How much do you really need to save for retirement? The answer clearly depends on your own situation, but people are typically told they need to save $1 million or more. It's safe to say that many Americans will not accomplish that milestone.
Fortunately, there are effective financial actions you can take to help compensate for a lack of savings. Let's take a look at three alternatives to accumulating a million-dollar nest egg.
1. Delay retirement
The first alternative is the most obvious, but also the riskiest. If your retirement funds are unable to generate sufficient income to replace your day job, maintaining some form of employment in your later years may be the solution for you. Delaying retirement can help improve your finances and secure larger Social Security payments. For example, someone born after 1960 can receive 124% of his or her monthly Social Security benefit by retiring at age 70 instead of age 67. While Social Security benefits could be taken as early as age 62, that person would only receive 70% of his or her monthly benefit.
Although working longer is a dangerous strategy since your future health status and job opportunities are unknown, many Americans appear to be relying on this approach. According to a Gallup poll, 24% of Baby Boomers don't expect to retire until they reach the age of 65, and 39% of Baby Boomers don't expect to retire until they are 66 or older. A separate poll from Wells Fargo reveals that 37% of Americans with incomes between $25,000 and $100,000 say they will never retire and will work until they are either too sick or dead.
Working longer may also reduce health care expenses in retirement. Couples retiring at age 65 are expected to incur $220,000 in medical costs on average during their golden years, according to an analysis by Fidelity Investments. Couples retiring earlier, at age 62, and before Medicare coverage experienced an average of $57,000 in additional costs.
MILLENNALS: Young, broke, and dangerously uninsured
2. Eliminate debt
Naturally, having fewer expenses in retirement reduces the need for income. Instead of focusing on small actions such as skipping daily lattes or canceling extra premium channels, make dramatic changes by reducing the biggest bills first and retiring debt free.
Do you really need that oversized house with the accompanying mortgage? Housing is easily one of the biggest expenses we have in life. If you're looking to give your retirement a financial boost, live in a home that is affordable, not something that looks like it belongs on a magazine cover. You won't miss those empty rooms and you'll sleep better knowing that you have a mortgage-free retirement. Not having a $200,000 mortgage in retirement can save you $1,000 in monthly payments. If you're willing to plan far enough ahead, make extra payments each month on your existing mortgage to pay it off sooner and save money on interest payments.
Brand new cars and auto loans should also be avoided. The average auto loan term increased to 66 months during the first quarter of 2014, according to Experian Automotive. That is the highest level on record and quite the burden for a retiree with little or no savings. Nearly 25% of all new loans originating during the quarter had terms extending out 73 months to 84 months, and the average amount financed for a new vehicle loan reached an all-time high of $27,612. A reliable used car can be found for at least half that price.
DEAR PARENTS: You need to teach your kids about money
3. Pack your bags
Retirement is no time to be feeling extra patriotic. Leaving the comfort zone of America could help stretch retirement dollars further. The world is a big place, so you need to research the possibilities thoroughly, but plenty of publications around the Internet offer good starting points. Live and Invest Overseas recently released its 2014 Retire Overseas Index, naming the best countries for retirement. Based on factors such as economic conditions, tax rates, climate, and safety statistics, Portugal ranked as the top retirement destination, followed by Ecuador and Malaysia.
If leaving the country is too unimaginable, you can still maximize retirement savings by moving to a different state. Bankrate.com recently listed South Dakota, Colorado, Utah, North Dakota, and Wyoming as the best retirement destinations within the United States. Yes, the winters are brutal in some of these places, but weather probably shouldn't be your main concern if you haven't saved enough for retirement.
"While the states that ranked highly may not be thought of as typical retiree havens, seniors should consider more than sunshine when choosing a place for their golden years," said Bankrate.com research and statistics analyst Chris Kahn. "The Dakotas both ranked in our top 10 for the second year in a row due to their low cost of living, low crime rates, good health care quality, low taxes, and excellent satisfaction scores from residents. Of course, the best place to retire will differ drastically depending on the individual."

Stocks closed slightly lower Monday as the major indexes failed to build on Friday's rebound.
Tech stocks led the decline as the Nasdaq composite index dropped 20.82 points, or 0.5%, to 4454.80.
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 17.78 points, or 0.1%, to 16,991.91 and the Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 3.08 points, or 0.2%, to 1964.82.
On Friday -- at the end of a wild week marked by anxiety over Hong Kong protests, slowing global growth and Ebola -- the U.S. stock market staged a strong rally after a report showed a pickup in hiring last month, with the Dow pushing back above the 17,000 level.
But many investors remain uncertain about the outlook for stocks as the Fed nears the end of its stimulus program and considers raising rates.
"The tug of war between the bulls and the bears is ongoing now," said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential Financial.
Some encouraging corporate news helped boost several stocks:
•Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) stock jumped 4.7% to $36.87 on news that HP will split into two : Hewlett Packard Enterpirse, led by HP CEO Meg Whitman, will sell computer servers, data-storage gear, software and other services to corporations. HP Inc. will consist of the PC and printer business and will be led by hardware chief Dion Weisler.

First Take: It's Splitsville for HP, but will it work?
Jon Swartz , USA TODAY 8:40 a.m. EDT October 6, 2014
HP has been contemplating big strategic changes for several years.

SAN MATEO, Calif. – Hewlett-Packard is calling it Splitsville in its latest stab to turn things around. But will it get its stuff together this time?
Taking a page from a now-familiar corporate play book, HP plans to split in half, separating its PC and printer businesses from its hardware and services operations. The long-contemplated move was announced Monday.
Such a move at the 75-year-old company would be yet another breakup or spin-off in tech, underscoring the idea that companies with a narrower focus fare better financially and on Wall Street.
Last week, eBay said it intends to spin off its PayPal payments-processing unit.
HP stock up 4.7%: Investors love split strategy
HP has flirted with the notion of breaking off its sprawling PC operation. In 2012, under CEO Meg Whitman, it reorganized to combine the PC business with its more profitable printer operation. She will be chairman of the PC/printer business and CEO of the separate enterprise company, the Journal reported.
In 2011, it hinted at splintering its PC business. But after the ouster of then-CEO Léo Apotheker, HP reversed course two months later and said it would hold on to the business.
Breaking the company in two, while radical, may be the best recourse for a tech pioneer scrambling to keep up with smaller, more nimble competitors in cloud computing and data storage while at the same time feeling the heat from PC rivals. Last year, HP lost its place as the largest PC maker by shipments, slipping behind China's Lenovo Group, according to industry research firm IDC.
Layoffs — and HP has had thousands recently — can only go so far in reducing costs.
HP has also been contemplating big strategic changes, such as a possible merger with data-storage giant EMC.
Something drastic had to be done to reverse HP's fading fortunes. By cutting itself in half, perhaps it will make itself whole again.

Money was sent to relative of jailed and absconding IM men: NIA6
0
New Delhi: Indian Mujahideen co-founder Riyaz Bhatkal not only used to send funds for terror acts across the country but also regularly provided money to families of the jailed and absconding operatives of the banned outfit, the NIA has told a special court.
This was stated by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in its supplementary charge sheet filed against 20 suspected IM men, including its absconding top leaders Riyaz Bhatkal and Iqbal Bhatkal, in connection with a case of larger conspiracy of the group to carry out terror activities across India.
"Investigation has established that in pursuance of the conspiracy, accused A-10 (Riyaz Bhatkal) regularly sent funds for terrorist activities and also for daily subsistence needs to other IM operatives," the agency said.
In its supplementary charge sheet, the NIA said IM operatives wanted to create a situation in India similar to the one prevailing in Iraq and Syria.
#nia #indian mujahideen #riyaz bhatkal #india
"Money was also regularly sent to the jailed IM operatives and to the families of jailed or absconding IM operatives," it said. The NIA claimed that Pakistan-based Riyaz Bhatkal had earlier asked arrested IM India chief Yasin Bhatkal to establish contacts with Maoists in Nepal for supply of arms for terror activities in India.
"Acting on the directions of Riyaz Bhatkal, accused A-6 (Yasin Bhatkal) tried to establish contact with the Maoists in Nepal for arms supply. Riyaz had also told A-6 (Yasin) that he has been trying to establish some contact for procuring weapons from Kashmir," the agency said.
Out of the 20 accused named by the NIA in its charge sheet, 17 have not been arrested yet while three other suspected IM men Tehsin Akhtar, Haidar Ali and Zia-ur-Rehman are in judicial custody in connection with the case.
The NIA had earlier filed two charge sheets in the case against nine suspected IM operatives, including Yasin Bhatkal and his close aide Asadullah Akhtar alias Haddi, who were both arrested by the agency on August 28, 2013.
All these accused have been chargesheeted for offences punishable under various sections of the IPC, including 120-B (criminal conspiracy), 121 (waging war against the country), 121-A (conspiracy to wage war) and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. In its supplementary charge sheet, the NIA said IM operatives wanted to create a situation in India similar to the one prevailing in Iraq and Syria.
It also claimed some of the suspected IM men had wanted to be sent to Syria with other jihadis. The NIA is probing the alleged roles of 33 suspected IM men in the case out of which 29 have been chargesheeted.

The Boko Haram insurgency  by the numbersComments
By Nathaniel Allen, Peter M. Lewis and Hilary Matfess October 6

The abduction in April of nearly 300 schoolgirls from Chibok, a northeastern Nigerian village, by fighters of the extremist group Boko Haram received wide attention from social media campaigners and the news media .
But events in Nigeria have been overshadowed in recent months by news from Iraq, Gaza and Ukraine. The escalating violence in northern Nigeria has at times been cast as a local curiosity (in the same vein as the Lord’s Resistance Army in central Africa) even by those attempting to encourage greater action against Boko Haram .
In fact, the insurgency in Nigeria’s northeastern states is growing into one of the largest areas of violence in Africa, and a major conflict in global terms. A new dataset compiled at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) that tracks social conflict in Nigeria offers perspective on just how deadly the Boko Haram insurgency has become.
The Nigeria Social Violence Dataset, now publicly available , tallies incidents of deadly social violence in Nigeria since 1998, the eve of the most recent transition to democracy. Drawn from Nigerian and international media reports , the dataset provides dates, locations, protagonists and lines of division in thousands of incidents.
The data makes clear that Boko Haram-related violence is the most lethal conflict that Nigeria has confronted in decades . Since 1998, at least 29,600 Nigerians have been killed in more than 2,300 incidents reflecting a wide range of ethnic, religious, political and economic tensions across large portions of the country. Since July 2009, when the Boko Haram conflict escalated, at least 11,100 people have died on all sides of the insurgency. This accounts for almost 40 percent of the total deaths in our dataset, more than any other source of social violence.
The number of deaths attributable to Boko Haram has been increasing over time, but this increase has been particularly sharp in the past year. (Figure and Data: The Nigeria Social Violence Dataset , SAIS African Studies Program)
The conflict is rapidly intensifying. We estimate that 7,000 people died in incidents related to the insurgency between July 2013 and June 2014, compared with fewer than 1,900 in the preceding year. These deaths account for more than a quarter of all the recorded deaths in the past 15 years. Since January, more than 5,000 people have died, making the past eight months almost as deadly as the preceding five years.
These statistics firmly place the Boko Haram insurgency as one of the most significant conflicts in the world. Nigerian casualties are now running more than double those in Afghanistan, and substantially higher than in Iraq just a few years ago. An estimated 3,120 civilian and military casualties were recorded in Afghanistan last year . In Iraq, 4,207 fatalities were estimated in 2011 in the wake of the surge . The worsening conflict in northern Nigeria already has suffered more casualties this year than the world’s most publicized contemporary wars.
How did things get this bad? The current strife between Boko Haram – an extreme Salafist group with roots in the northeastern city of Maiduguri – and the Nigerian government was sparked in July 2009, when tensions between the sect and authorities reached a breaking point. An uncomfortable modus vivendi in the northeast collapsed when Nigerian security forces staged an offensive that killed at least 700 people across several states. The action included the extra-judicial killing of the group’s leader, Mohammed Yusuf, and deadly, often indiscriminate, attacks on other buildings and settlements associated with Boko Haram.
After a year of regrouping, Boko Haram emerged under the leadership of Abubakar Shekau with a more militant agenda and brutal tactics. Since then, there has been an escalation of attacks by insurgents and a growing response by the Nigerian military. As the violence has concentrated in the northeast, Borno State has become a de facto war zone. The group’s tactics have shifted and diversified from attacks on government installations to bombings, robberies, kidnappings, assaults on churches and mainstream Muslim targets, and most recently the occupation of villages and towns, indicating greater confidence and capacity.
In May 2013, the government declared a state of emergency in the northeastern states of Borno, Yobe and Adamawa. In its current phase since July, the insurgency has mimicked the tactics of ISIS in Iraq and Syria, declaring a local caliphate and shifting approach from guerrilla-style attacks to the conventional capture and consolidation of territory. On Sept. 2, the insurgents seized the strategic town of Bama, located 45 miles away from Maiduguri. Maiduguri itself remains under threat .
The administration of President Goodluck Jonathan has offered assurances that much is being done overtly and behind the scenes to blunt the offensive. Meanwhile, many Nigerians in southern states and quite a number of politicians in the capital of Abuja dismiss Boko Haram as a regional skirmish, rooted in local conditions and confined to their catchment area.
For the moment, Boko Haram is a network with local foundations and goals, but the rising scale of conflict belies the easy dismissals of some observers. This is clearly the most lethal conflict that Nigeria has confronted in decades. It is being fought on a scale that is comparable to serious civil strife in other parts of the world. The levels of casualties, internal displacement, social disruption and government failure are fomenting a widespread crisis, spilling over the borders of neighboring states such as Niger, Cameroon and Chad.

Political rulers, when confronted by an approaching existential threat, might normally be expected to mobilize national resources to aggressively confront the insurgency . Yet Nigeria’s elites seem to be detached, mired in political infighting, or distracted by opportunities to profit from poorly monitored security budgets.
Although the motivations and strategic objectives of Boko Haram remain unclear, the increasing sophistication of the group’s attacks and the acceleration in its lethality underline the importance of a strong, coherent response — and the consequences of Nigeria’s failure to mount such a response.

Jim Bowden  Manny Acta agree that Matt Williams shouldnt have removed Jordan ZimmermannBy Dan Steinberg October 6 Follow @dcsportsbog
(By Ben Margot / AP)
With Game 3 of the Nats-Giants series looming, the single most-discussed moment remains Matt Williams’s decision to remove Jordan Zimmermann in favor of Drew Storen midway through Game 2.
Of course, “midway” in that case meant “with two outs in the top of the ninth,” and two batters later, Zimmermann’s 1-0 masterpiece had dissolved into extra innings. That left an opening for lots of people — including Jim Bowden, Manny Acta, Mark Mulder, Thomas Boswell, Mike Wise, and my uncle — to criticize Williams, and they took advantage of that opening.
Bowden, on SiriusXM’s MLB Network Radio
“I’m leaving Jordan Zimmermann in,” Bowden said. “I’m betting on big boys in big moments, and the stuff that he had, I had no doubt he’s going to finish that game. I had no doubt. And I would rather have him in there than any other pitcher on the entire staff in that moment.
“Again, personal opinion. I understand what Matt Williams did, because Matt Williams managed that inning the way he managed the 162 games to get there, and I understand that. And I’ve heard the philosophy from very good managers who have won World Series, that have told me you don’t change in the postseason, you do what got you there. He had a blueprint, he went with the blueprint, he carried it out.
“Now, my opinion — or the philosophy that I’ve always liked — probably leans more towards the Joe Torre philosophy, which is go with the hot hand and read what’s in front of you, not what’s in the book or the computer that you brought with you. I understand when the game started, you get a man in that situation, you make a pitching change. And I understand his plan going into that inning was to do that.
“But I think there’s times in the game where you’ve got to read what’s in front of you. you’ve got to read the stuff coming out of the pitcher’s arm. You’ve got to read the guy you have on the mound. And it’s the postseason, where it’s not ok if you lost a game. You know, you CAN’T lose a game. So again, the game is filled with opinions; my personal opinion on that was leave him in, he’s got one more batter, and then he’s gone.”
Mark Mulder, on ESPN and Twitter
“I thought it was terrible,” Mulder said. “I didn’t understand it. I second-guessed it from the get-go. First of all, he’s at 100 pitches. He’s retired 57 of the last 62 hitters he’s faced going back to his no-hitter the last day of the season, and he’s retired 20 guys in a row leading up to that walk. No matter what he does there, he is a better option than anyone else Matt Williams is going to bring into that game at that point.”
Taking him out?????? Are you kidding me. Better hope this works.
— Mark Mulder (@markmulder20) October 5, 2014
I told you. That has to be one of the worst decisions I have ever seen.
— Mark Mulder (@markmulder20) October 5, 2014
Retired 20 in a row until a walk. 100 pitches. There is no possible way to justify taking Zimmerman out.
Manny Acta, on ESPN
“Very poor decision,” Acta said. “I mean, this guy was dominating. He was inside of everybody, righties and lefties, and then whenever they were aware of the pitches inside, he’ll drop that slider away to the right-handed hitters. He was dominant.
“And man on first with two outs, it’s not trouble. Trouble is first and second no outs, first and third one out. But a man on first with two outs is not trouble for a guy like him who has been dominant the whole night. He beat those guys inside even when he knew when he was coming for the whole night. Retiring 20 out of the last 21 guys? It was his game to lose.”
Boz
Saturday night at Nationals Park was an almost unique case when the context of the moment was greater, and more important, than the literal description of the baseball situation….
There is strategy and there is theater. As strategy, there is some justification for taking out Zimmermann, who had just thrown his 100th pitch — a ball four to Joe Panik. Perhaps a fresh arm — a right-hander Storen with his 1.18 ERA this season, was a proper by-the-book move.
But, sometimes, there is also context and theater — and even the danger of messing with the lower-case but still haughty baseball gods.
Wise
Jordan Zimmermann had that win, didn’t he? Matt Williams can’t take out a pitcher who retired 20 batters in a row before allowing one measly walk, can he?…The Nationals’ first-year manager botched an opportunity for a much-needed victory in Game 2.
Thom Loverro
Storen wasn’t going to be as good as a ninth inning, 100-pitch Zimmermann who was in complete control. Especially facing Posey, who was just 4 for 18 against Zimmermann, compared to Storen, who in his career against Posey walked him twice and gave up a double in four at bats.
Somebody in the Nationals‘ dugout needed to convince Williams of that — to remind him, like Adam LaRoche said about Zimmermann before the game, that “he is a bulldog out there. No emotion.”…
[Williams] will now be defined by this loss moving forward, instead of his successful rookie managing season that could result in a National League Manager of the Year honor.
Al Sarasevic
Matt Williams made an absolutely horrible decision as the manager of the Washington Nationals Saturday night. And Giants fans will love him for it forever.
His call to pull the unhittable Jordan Zimmermann with two outs in the 9th will go down as one of the all-time bonehead calls in history. Right up there with Custer.

SP convention to go hi-tech with LED screens  webcast beaming documentary on MulayamPrint
Posters of SP leaders line Gandhi Bridge at Ambedkar Park in Lucknow on Sunday. (Source: Express photo by: Pramod Singh)
Written by Mohd Faisal Fareed | Lucknow | Posted: October 6, 2014 6:51 pm | Updated: October 6, 2014 6:54 pm
The three-day national convention of Samajwadi Party in Lucknow will be high on technology and grandeur with the party planning to set up giant LED screens across the city that will beam a documentary on party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav’s political journey. The SP leadership has also planned to webcast the entire convention on party’s website to boost the morale of the cadres. Mobile vans with screens for digital video display will also be used so that the story of Mulayam’s life is seen by the city’s residents.
The convention will be held from October 8 to 10 at Lucknow’s Janeshwar Mishra Park.
Sources said Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav has personally asked his team to make the documentary with video recordings of Mulayam’s political meetings which he addressed during his early political career. Special video footage of Kranti Rath on which Mulayam toured the state in 1987 too has been arranged from the archives and will be telecast during the convention.
The documentary will show how Mulayam went on to become the chief minister of UP for the first time in 1989, and him sharing the stage with then Janata Dal stalwarts like Choudhary Devi Lal, former Prime Ministers V P Singh and Chandrashekhar.
Old footage of Mulayam when he was member of Dalit Mazdoor Kisan Party and later Janata Dal is also being digitised so that it could be shown during the event.
The party said that Mulayam’s documentary will help inspire SP workers “as many have forgotten the hardships faced by the Netaji while building the party from scratch”.
During the earlier national conventions of the party, stalwarts like Janeshwar Mishra, Brijbhushan Tiwari, Mohan Singh used to share the dais with Mulayam and other SP leaders to present a big socialist family. However, with their demise, party sources said, the onus is on Mulayam this time to inspire the cadres by highlighting his early days of political struggle.
The party convention has always remained an affair controlled by Mulayam where political and economic resolutions prepared by Mulayam’s cousin and Rajya Sabha MP Ramgopal Yadav and speeches by leaders depicting their loyalty towards Mulayam are constant features.
Meanwhile, SP workers are excited about the event and have painted Lucknow in party colour with hoardings installed in every nook and corner.

Vadodara pond housing rare turtles filled with mud  authorities denyPrint
Express News Service | Vadodara | Posted: October 6, 2014 6:39 pm | Updated: October 6, 2014 6:42 pm
A pond in Kisanwadi area in Vadodara became a center of controversy on Sunday after locals raised an alarm over the sudden filling up of the water body to bring it to ‘land level’. The pond is home to decades old rare species of turtles protected under the Schedule I of Wildlife Protection Act.
While dumpers bearing the Vadodara Mahanagar Seva Sadan (VMSS) logos went about the work, corporation officials denied having any knowledge of the pond being packed with mud. Municipal Commissioner Manish Bharadwaj has initiated an inquiry into the incident.
The filling up of an unnamed pond in Kisanwadi on Sunday brew up a storm with animal activists rushing in to rescue several gigantic soft shell turtles belonging to the Trianyx Gangeticus family, that inhabit the pond. According to activists, the filling up of the pond is “illegal” as it is the natural habitat of the turtles that are a protected species under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act. About 60 turtles live in this pond, activist say. Neha Patel, a city-based animal activist said, “I rushed here the moment I got a call .
This pond seems like an extension of an original historic well and there is evidence to show that it cannot be just another piece of private land as it is centuries old. This sudden dumping of sand into the pond without a thought for the protected species of turtles residing inside has been undertaken on a weekend to avoid any official procedure.” According to Patel, contractors working on the pond said that the land is a private property of an influential person from Vadodara. Activists also raised query on the presence of dumpers with the VMSS logo at the site.
Municipal Commissioner Manish Bharadwaj denied that any activity to fill up a city pond had been undertaken by the corporation. Bharadwaj, who rushed his officials to inspect the site has ordered the work to be stopped and initiated an inquiry into the incident. “We have sent our officers to the site and we are examining the documents of the land. If it is, it should be part of some town planning scheme.  I have asked my officers to get complete information about this and get back to me,” he said.

Work on Shimoga airport project yet to commenceUpdated: October 6, 2014 19:41 IST
Work on Shimoga airport project yet to commence
Veerendra P. M.
Tweet
The Rs. 194-crore scheme was launched in 2007 during the BJP rule
The work related to Shimoga airport, though commenced with a bang in 2007, has remained suspended for the past two years owing to differences between the partners of the Regional Airport Holdings Ltd. (RAHI), a joint venture company that had bagged the contract, and the delay in clearing the obstacles that have come in the way of ensuring the safe operation of flights.
The land acquired for the project has now become a place to wash clothes and graze the cattle for the residents of Haregatte, Vinayaka Nagar and surrounding villages in the vicinity. Although more than Rs. 15 crore has been spent on the works like levelling the ground and construction of the runway there, the entire area is covered with thick vegetation. K.T. Gangadhar, leader of Raitha Sangha, has said that as the airport-related work has come to a halt, the farmers who had parted with their land for the project would re-commence cultivation there.
When B.S. Yeddyurappa was Chief Minister, the State government had initiated the work on the airport project to upgrade connectivity here and thereby attract industrial investment into the region. Mr. Yeddyurappa had laid the foundation stone for the project in June 2008.
The State government had acquired 662 acres of land for the project and had handed it over to the RAHI. The project was estimated to cost Rs. 194 crore. It was planned to construct a 3.1-km runway, a terminal building and the essential infrastructure to handle the cargo and passengers. According to the terms of the contract, the work related to the project was to be completed within two years. In the first phase, out of the proposed 3.1-km runway, the work of levelling a 0.5-km stretch with boulders and concrete mixture, was completed. After this, differences cropped up between the partners of the contractor, which resulted in the stoppage of the work.
Compound wall
The work on the construction of a compound wall at the project site and providing drinking water connection has remained incomplete. The work of constructing an approach road to the project site from N.R. Pura-Shimoga main road and the construction of terminal building has not yet started.
A team of experts from the Airports Authority of India (AAI), which conducted a survey of the project site in April 2013, had recommended to reduce the height of chimneys of six factories in the industrial estate located adjacent to the project site and to shift a 220-kV electricity line that passes through the project site to ensure safe operation of flights. Since then, there is no progress in the work. The hopes of completing the project were, however, revived after Minister of State for Civil Aviation G.M. Siddeshwara visited the city recently. During his visit, Mr. Siddeshwara had said that the AAI was ready to take over the project and complete it. The work would commence as soon as the State government terminated the agreement it had entered into with the joint venture company and hand over the project to the AAI officially, he had said.
Minister of State for Primary and Secondary Education Kimmane Ratnakar, who is also district in-charge Minister, had said that he would urge the Chief Minister to take a decision in this regard.

Next Round: An awarding Great American Beer Festival
The Great American Beer Festival in Denver is place for brewers to high-five the consumers that helped spread the word of good beer, says Dogfish Head Craft Brewery founder Sam Calagione. VPC

DENVER -- So many beers and too little time. You would think that three consecutive days at the Great American Beer Festival would be enough to taste every beer you would desire.
Not even close. I stalked the Colorado Convention Center from Oct. 2-4 and my taste buds were given a wonderful workout. But I didn't come close to tasting all of the 3,500-plus beers available.
Along the way, a Basil Beer from The Blind Tiger brewpub , out of my hometown Topeka, Kan., enveloped and enlightened my palate. An aged sour ale called Supplication from Russian River Brewing Co., in Santa Rosa, Calif., at first puckered me up with its sour cherry taste then a sweeter wine-like flavor took over. And Alaskan Brewing Co. 's surprising Alaskan Smoked Porter evoked memories of barbecued brisket.
And those were beers I tasted before Saturday's awards ceremony. After those were announced, like many others, I sprinted to quaff some of the winners.
I went over to congratulate co-owner and brewer Clay Robinson of Indianapolis' Sun King Brewery for its gold and silver medals for barrel-aged strong beers. The silver medalist, Batch 666: Sympathy for the Devil, is a sweet Belgian black ale aged in bourbon barrels. The gold medalist Lonesome Dove, an aged Belgian Tripel, is also sweet but yeastier.
Earlier in the week, Natalie Cilurzo of Russian River poured me a Pliny the Elder, one of the most sought-after beers in the U.S., which ended up winning a bronze for Imperial IPA. When I got a sip of the gold medal winner, Creeper, from Columbus (Ohio) Brewing Co. , it had that fresh slight oniony taste I recalled from my first Heady Topper , which I enjoyed last month while on vacation.
Similarly, Grunion, which won Ballast Point Brewing of San Diego a gold for American-style pale ale, had similar notes, treading into IPA territory. But perhaps my taste buds were suffering from sensory overload.

On Friday, Jim Koch, founder of Boston Beer Co., and brewer of Samuel Adams beers, poured me a Double Bock , a rich, smooth and sweet lager, which wound up winning a gold medal for German-style doppelbock or eisbock beers."This is a sipping beer," he told me.
That Basil Beer I mentioned earlier, it won a gold, too. And the Alaskan Smoked Porter took a bronze, while Gordon Biersch earned gold for its Rauchbier, which had subtler smoke influence. For a complete list of Great American Beer Festival winners, visit the festival's official website .
A couple of my favorite new beers that I tasted didn't win a thing. John Patrick Najeway, co-owner of Thirsty Dog Brewing of Akron, poured me a Siberian Night Imperial Stout while he manned the Ohio Brewers Guild booth. After I drank the creamy, roasty beer -- it has won three GABF medals in the past -- he recommended I try the bourbon barrel-aged version at the booth. That sweet, boozy sip was worth maneuvering through the busy Friday crowd for.
By the way, I did pretty well in our GABF fantasy draft , with unofficial results placing me in second behind Mark and Patti Robinson, founders of beer news site Brewtally Insane . They nudged me out of first place when Marble Brewery of Albuquerque, N.M., which already had two gold medals, also won the best small brewing company and brewer of the year.
Next Round takes a regular look at new and recently released craft beers. If there's one on your radar, or if you have suggestions or questions, contact Mike Snider via e-mail . And follow Snider on Twitter: @MikeSnider .

Tough grilling over AIG bailout
People have largely made up their minds about him  and it isnt good.By Philip Bump October 6 Follow @pbump
Sen. Pat Roberts with Sarah Palin. (AP Photo/The Wichita Eagle, Jaime Green)
Kansas Sen. Pat Roberts (R) is in trouble. Not like, hey, it's early; we're gonna turn it around trouble -- like it's finally time to panic trouble.
Over the weekend, NBC News/Marist College  dropped a new poll echoing one produced by Suffolk University last week . Roberts trails independent candidate Greg Orman by 10 points (per NBC/Marist) or five (Suffolk). But either way, more than Roberts wants to see a month before Election Day.
We knew this was coming. In the middle of September, Fox News surveyed Kansans to see whom they supported in the Senate race. Roberts led then -- but only when Democrat Chad Taylor was still in the mix. When Fox asked who Taylor supporters would back if he dropped out, they went five-to-one for Orman.
Taylor dropped out and managed to stay off the ballot after some machinations. So Roberts and the GOP establishment brought out the big guns, including appearances from beloved Kansan Bob Dole . The result? Orman up by as much as 10.
It's not hard to figure out why. In the NBC/Marist and Suffolk polls, people were asked their opinions of the two candidates. In each, Orman has a net positive approval by a wide margin -- meaning more people approve of him than not. Roberts' approval is underwater, as they say, with significantly more disapproving.
What's more, a larger number of people (even among likely voters) haven't yet made up their minds on Orman. That could be seen as a negative; Roberts will try and convince those voters that Orman is a question mark or worse. In this context, though, it's probably a positive. People have made up their minds on Roberts more than they have on Orman. Maybe Roberts can convince those 20 percent-plus of likely voters with no opinion of Orman that he's not fit for the Senate. Or maybe those 80-percent plus who've made up their minds on Roberts -- more of whom disapprove of his job performance than don't -- will get to those voters first.
It ain't over 'til the fat precinct sings, as they say (sort of), and Roberts is making a full-bore push for these last few weeks. But he's been pushing for a while, and, while there isn't enough polling to suggest the trend the polls are headed in, it doesn't seem like the pushing is going the direction Roberts wants.

ONGC likely to move  to 475 in this expiry, if my reading is correct. If my reading is wrong, we should see 360 on ONGC. I am betting on ONGC longs for this expiry. Axis longs till results on 17th and then shorts. Just those 2 major trades for this expiry.

Srinagar: Pakistan violated the ceasefire for the 12th time in the last six days when its troops resorted to unprovoked firing along the Line of Control (LoC) on Monday evening. The Pakistan troops fired at Indian posts in the Shahpur sector of Poonch district. A defence spokesperson said that India too retaliated to the unprovoked firing.
Pakistan, however, termed the firing 'unfortunate', saying that it will deal with it "strongly, if we are at fault".

"This is unfortunate. The situation is bad on borders. Both the sides are blaming each other. We are investigating and if are at fault, we will deal with it strongly. We want peace and we are ready to work on that with India," Sartaj Aziz, the advisor to the Pakistan Prime Minister, said. "We have asked the army to hold a meeting at the earliest with the counterparts," he said.

The standoff between India and Pakistan intensified in Jammu and Kashmir on Sunday night when five civilians were killed and 34 others were injured in firing by Pakistani troops in Arnia in RS Pura sector in what has been described as one of the worst ceasefire violations.
The Centre and the state government slammed Pakistan, with Defence Minister Arun Jaitley accusing the neighbour of deliberately creating tension along the LoC.
Congress and BJP condemned the ceasefire violations by Pakistan and said it was a "serious" issue.
"Whatever Pakistan is doing is certainly a serious matter. And we want to tell Pakistan that indulging in such activities is not good for that country," BJP leader Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said.
Condemning Pakistan's actions, former External Affairs Minister Salman Khurshid said it is despicable that such incidents have occurred on Eid. "There cannot be anything worse than this," the Congress leader said.
The Pakistani Rangers, meanwhile, refused to either accept or offer sweets as per the Eid tradition at the Attari border.
The Director General of Border Security Force (BSF), is in Jammu to take stock of the situation.
In October itself, there have been 11 ceasefire violations by Pakistan.
Home Ministry records suggest that Pakistan violated ceasefire 43 times till May 2014 and after the new government took over in May 2014, the country has violated ceasefire over 50 times.

Journalists should accept 'packages', says Nitin Gadkari

Mumbai: Union Minister Nitin Gadkari has courted a controversy asking journalists to "keep the packages (money) they get during the election season".
"In the next 10-12 days, you journalists will have 'Laxmi darshan'," Gadkari said at a poll rally in Sawantwadi in coastal Konkan on Saturday. "Be it reporters or editors, there are separate packages for reporters, newspapers and their owners," Gadkari said.
"Diwali has come. I have one request, keep whatever you get. Eat whatever you can," he said. The state secretariat and legislature journalists association flayed Gadkari's remarks. "Gadkari's comments are highly objectionable," president of Mantralaya Vidhimandal Vartahar Sangh, Pravin Puro said.
"Diwali has come. I have one request, keep whatever you get. Eat whatever you can," Union Minister Nitin Gadkari said.
"Gadkari has said journalists accept 'packages' (for election coverage). Due to such statements, the image of journalists gets dented," Puro said.

Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine goes to John O Keefe  May-Britt Moser  Edvard I Moser6
0
Stockholm: The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2014 was awarded with one half to John O'Keefe and the other half jointly to May-Britt Moser and Edvard I Moser for their discoveries of cells that constitute a positioning system in the brain.
This "inner GPS" helps explain how the brain creates "a map of the space surrounding us and how we can navigate our way through a complex environment," the Nobel Assembly said.
O'Keefe, of University College London, discovered the first component of this positioning system in 1971 when he found that a certain type of nerve cell was always activated when a rat was at a certain place in a room.
The trio has been awarded for their discoveries of cells that constitute a positioning system in the brain.
#nobel prize #medicine #physiology #john okeefe
Thirty-four years later May-Britt and Edvard Moser, of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim, identified another type of nerve cell that generates a coordinate system for precise path-finding, the assembly said.
It said that knowledge about the brain's positioning system may "help us understand the mechanism underpinning the devastating spatial memory loss" that affects people with Alzheimer's disease.
The Nobel awards in physics, chemistry, literature and peace will be announced later this week. The economics prize will be announced next Monday.

Problem Solver: Man gets icy reception from Chase bank2
In the weeks that followed, the Gruenthals kept in touch with Chase, which instructed them to file a claim with the bank's insurance company, Broadspire.
Lucille Gruenthal said the couple filled out all the paperwork, answered all of the insurance company's questions and figured they had a solid claim. The couple says the ice was unsalted at the time of the fall and it was on Chase's property.
In late spring, the insurance company reached its decision.
"They said, 'We're not legally responsible,'" Lucille Gruenthal said.
The couple called Chase, which directed them back to Broadspire. Broadspire said, simply, it would not pay the claim, Lucille Gruenthal said.
To avoid a hit on their credit report, the couple paid the $1,648.29.
Still without reimbursement nine months later, the Gruenthals emailed "What's Your Problem?"
"The bank says, 'We feel for you; we wish we could do more. We don't want to lose you as a customer,'" Lucille Gruenthal said. "We're not looking to sue the bank; we just want our out-of-pocket expenses."
She said her husband still has dizzy spells from the fall but is finally starting to feel better.
"The doctors say it could take up to a year to completely heal," she said.
The Problem Solver called Chase spokeswoman Christine Holevas, who promised to look into the case.
On Friday afternoon, Holevas emailed to say the situation had been fixed.
"We're sorry it took so long," Holevas said. "We talked with Mr. and Mrs. Gruenthal and have resolved it."
Lucille Gruenthal said a Chase representative called the couple Friday to apologize. "The main office said this was never brought to their attention and this should never have happened."
She said they picked up a cashier's check Saturday at the bank, and Chase paid the entire $1,648.29.
"I'm very happy," she said. "We have two kids in college, and a little money is going to help a lot."

Subway Wants You Skinny -- For Your Halloween CostumeEmail
Summer's over, but now we have to stay buff for ... Halloween season? That's the mood Subway hoped to capitalize on in a new ad, in which a woman asserts she has to eat healthy to fit into her sexy Halloween costumes.
Eating healthy is something everyone should do year round, but an ad playing on women's concern for their weight, coupled with an overabundance of very adult costumes (for a night that's traditionally about children) is causing controversy.  (Sexy Halloween costumes have long been weirding us out.)
Time magazine wrote a post excoriating the ad, headlined: "Subway Wants Women to Stay Skinny So They Can Wear Sexy Halloween Costumes," and notes in the accompanying piece, "This new ad reminds you that it's never time to stop dieting."
Adds Jezebel , "The ad is obviously sexist, but it's also just stupid and lazy. How easy  would it have been for them to throw a man in as well? Plenty of guys  wear shirtless Halloween costumes."
A man does appear in the ad, but he never moves from his seat and eventually is shown in a Viking costume for laughs. That's not quite the same as the woman, who cycles through several iterations of titillating costumes.
Not everyone thinks there's a lot of meat on this controversy sandwich, though:
"You don't have to read so into it," noted TODAY's Carson Daly on Friday.
Agreed TODAY's Matt Lauer, "I do think you need to at least look for the humor in it."
A Subway spokesperson told TODAY, "We understand that some people may not have picked up on the intended humor in our Halloween commercial.  Our objective was certainly not to offend anyone."
Either way, it's important to remember ... right after Halloween comes the end-of-year holidays, and those are packed with calorie-laden treats, too. May as well eat healthy now!

What Weightlifting For Just 20 Minutes Does To Your Brainreddit
Another reason why it’s a good idea to hit the gym: it can improve memory. A new Georgia Institute of Technology study shows that an intense workout of as little as 20 minutes can enhance episodic memory, also known as long-term memory for previous events, by about 10 percent in healthy young adults.
You may be surprised by what a quick workout session can do for your brain.
It's no secret that weightlifting is good for you -- from building muscle tissue to relieving stress -- but now a new study on brains and brawn suggests that going hard in the gym for as little as 20 minutes can boost your long-term memory by around 10 percent.
“Our study indicates that people don’t have to dedicate large amounts of time to give their brain a boost ,” study leader Lisa Weinberg, a graduate student at the Georgia Institute of Technology , said in a written statement. Just check out a video describing the study above.
For the study, researchers asked 46 healthy young adults to try to remember a series of 90 photographs that were shown on a computer screen. Then half of the group worked out on a leg-extension exercise machine -- doing 50 reps -- while the other half sat in a chair and didn't exercise. The researchers then took saliva samples from each person.
Two days later, the same men and women met with the researchers again to look at a series of 180 photographs, which included the 90 photos that were shown before. This time, the men and women were asked to recall which photos they had seen previously and which were new.
What did the researchers find?
The people who exercised remembered around 60 percent of the photos they had seen before, while those who didn't exercise remembered only around 50 percent.
Previous research in older men and women (50 to 85 years old) has found that a brief workout improves memory due to the exercise-induced release of the stress hormone norepinephrine . Scientists have long known that the hormone, a chemical messenger in the brain, plays a strong role in memory.
And it turns out that, in this new study, those people who exercised had increased measures of norepinephrine in their saliva samples. See the connection?
“The findings are encouraging," study co-author Dr. Audrey Duarte, an associate professor of psychology at the institute , said in the statement. "Even without doing expensive fMRI scans, our results give us an idea of what areas of the brain might be supporting these exercise-induced memory benefits."
The study was published online in the journal Acta Psychologica on Sept. 28, 2014.

5 Tools to Rock the Hell Out of Being an Entrepreneurreddit
Entrepreneurship or owning your own business is NOT for the faint hearted. I've done more inner work, faced more fears, and stretched myself WAY more in building up my business to success than I have doing any other SINGLE thing- EVER.
People often come to me to ask if I can help them start their own business, and I'm starting to  think I need to create a checklist for them to answer before I'll agree to work with them.
Here are a few of the questions I'd like to ask before working with someone- how would you answer?
1. Are you willing to commit fiercely to your vision, the way you would to a baby if you had one? (Think about the commitment it takes to raise a kid: being up all night, not screaming when you feel like you're about to CRACK the hell up, cleaning up endless messes, pushing yourself physically like you're in one of those hellacious Tough Mudder 5k courses, having endless patience, doing things repetitively, over and over and over again...and then sleeping 3 hours and getting up to do another day  all over again. THAT'S pretty similar to the patience, endurance and focus you'll have to have to start your own business)
2. Are you willing to not take failure personally? To think critically and honestly about everything you do, analyzing what worked and not crawling under the bed and giving up when something failed fabulously?
3. Are you willing to commit to the long haul? And do you have a way to support yourself while your project gets off the ground? Because one thing your new baby project WON'T give you is instant cash, so be prepared, again, to commit to the long haul.
So, how did you score? If you're still reading this, here are 5 tools that WILL allow you to rock the hell out of being an entrepreneur.
Tool #1: Clarity of Vision
When moving forward with your plan or business, it's CRUCIAL to be crystal clear about your goal and focus. Think about the difference between two archers: one blindfolds herself, spins around, and then shoots the arrow. The other stares at the target for a minute, seeing NOTHING but the bull's eye, gets into position, lines the bow up, and- never taking an eye off the center, SHOOTS! Guess who has a better shot of hitting their goal?
Tool #2: Spend Your Time Wisely- With a Laser-Like Focus
Structure, structure, structure. Whether you're one of those people who get sucked into Facebook or not, it is crucial to have your day mapped out. I have a calendar with all my program dates, major marketing moments, and time spent ON my business as well as all my vacation time (almost a week a month for 2015!) hanging on my wall in my office. From there, I make monthly blueprints of what needs to happen, and those get parceled into weekly blueprints, with every hour of every day 8-4, Monday throughThursday scheduled. That's how I fit in everything I need to do and still only work 4 days a week until 4-5 pm.
Tool #3: Manage Your Energy Like a BOSS
Ah, the difficult work of facing our deepest fears, oldest stories, and scariest sabotaging behaviors. Managing my energy has been one of the TOP most important (and effective) tool in building my business- and they won't teach it to you in 99% of the business courses out there. Managing your energy is about DECIDING what you want to believe is true, rather than letting your nasty little bugger of a inner critic voice scream relentlessly. So, instead of hearing "You're never going to make money at this!" you repeat to yourself "Every day I'm running this business better and making more money." Instead of "Who the hell wants what YOU'RE offering??" you tell yourself, "I am meeting more and more people who deeply need my work and are eager to invest in it."
Get the idea? Our simple little brains believe what we tell them, and our reality adjusts around that. So the more you tell yourself something is true, the truer it becomes.
What are you telling yourself is true about you and your business? Is it what you actually WANT for yourself?
Tool #4: Get Support- Because You and Your Work Deserve It
Imagine if Oprah had been determined to build her empire...without any help. Imagine if Richard Branson was committed to creating a billion-dollar a year enterprise...alone. Kind of laughable, right? But so many of you talk yourselves out of the support you need to become more visible, more effective, more powerful, and yes, more financially successful!
Support might mean a virtual assistant for a few hours a week. A mentor or a coach. Someone to clean your house a few times a month, take your kids somewhere fun while you work, a client care assistant to take over tedious scheduling tasks. Someone to format and send your newsletter. Whatever you're either doing and hating or NOT doing and know you need to in order to reach your goal.
And equally important is to stay aware of the stories and beliefs you're carrying around about why you SHOULDN'T be getting support- those are serious show-stoppers, folks.
Tool #5: Stay Connected- To You
Your work should be as alive as you are. This means that as you grow and change, so should your business. Staying connected to yourself and what matters to you and brings you joy is KEY to keeping your business exciting and thriving. Think: the difference between a dead plant in a dark corner and the plant you keep in the sun, water regularly and sing to from time to time (word on the street is that they LOVE that!)- which plant is your business?
Every year around my birthday I do a big list of celebrations from the year past, what I loved and what I want for the next year. Often in that space I'll also revisit my mission to see what's changed from the last year- am I REALLY loving work with my groups, more than my private clients? Do I want to be speaking more and writing less? Do I love traveling to meet new women? Am I SO psyched to be talking to women about marketing? What do I LOVE? Then I focus more on that in the coming year. Keeps my business joy-centered, exciting, and motivated.
So, there you have 5 tools to rock the hell out of being an entrepreneur. Are you in or out?

Warren Buffett s Latest Deal Has Officially Made Car Dealerships CoolAlways a trendsetter.
Photo by Bill Pugliano/Getty Images
Are car dealerships a good investment? Warren Buffett thinks so, and that's good enough for the market.
Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway on Thursday agreed to buy the Van Tuyl Group, the fifth-largest auto dealership in America with $9 billion in sales. For Buffett, it expanded a transportation portfolio that already included planes (NetJets) and trains (the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway). Once the acquisition is completed, the dealership will be renamed Berkshire Hathaway Automotive.

Since news of the sale broke, shares of auto retailers have traded up; when Warren Buffett buys a car dealership, everyone else gets on board . Shares of AutoNation and Penske Automotive Group, among others, spiked after the announcement. But over at BloombergView, auto-industry consultant Edward Niedermeyer is questioning the wisdom of the market's quick reaction:
Perhaps the biggest reason to think twice before following the Oracle is that the U.S. auto market is returning to its traditionally sustainable sales peak of between 16 million and 17 million units per year. While auto sales have been one of the few bright spots in the retail sector during a slow economic recovery, there's no reason to think that will last. Much of that growth is due to the expansion of auto credit, particularly through  subprime lending and longer loan terms , so there may not be much juice left in the tank for  further growth .
On the other hand, Buffett isn't stopping his auto investments at that. "I fully expect we'll buy a lot more auto dealerships over time," he told CNBC . In the meantime, go ahead and make all the Planes, Trains and Automobiles jokes you've got.

What do I care? That space is not mine to clean - SAMPATH KUMAR GP
The crux of the problem is that the urban Indian does not regard public spaces as his own
October 5, 2014:  
By placing cleanliness high up on his agenda, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has focused attention on a critical problem that is usually — pardon the pun — swept aside.
The initial official pronouncements also promise substantial financial and administrative efforts to ensure a toilet in every home.
Important as these initiatives are, it is difficult to brush aside the feeling that this approach is ignoring an important part of the problem: a major portion of the challenge of cleanliness in Indian cities is not so much about individual attitudes to hygiene, but about their approach to different spaces in the city.
Inside, outside
The idea that Indians typically do not care very much about cleanliness is not quite borne out by the conditions inside most homes. Most Indians make an effort to ensure their homes meet what they believe to be minimum standards of cleanliness.
The trouble arises from the fact that they do not have the same commitment to spaces outside their homes.
The distinction urban Indians currently make between these two spaces is deeply influenced by the extent to which they identify with a particular public space.
Typically, urban Indians do less to litter their places of worship than they do their roads. Though it is not explicitly stated, they believe it is their duty to keep their places of worship clean, but this duty does not extend to their roads.
Trying to overcome this divide through campaigns is not without its limitations. While such efforts do attract energetic campaigners, they do not always result in changing attitudes to public spaces.
Asking citizens to spend a hundred hours a year on cleaning public spaces would be useful, but the real challenge is to create everyday public practices that reduce the need for such cleaning.
If citizens stop leaving garbage on the streets the need for them to contribute a certain number of hours to remove it would not arise.
Stumbling block
Creating everyday practices that erase the distinction between attitudes to the home and to public spaces, however, comes up against a major barrier in Indian cities.
Individuals cannot easily identify with space outside their homes because that space is usually contested. In most, if not all, Indian cities we do not have clearly defined and widely accepted social norms for the behaviour of an individual in a public space.
There is, perhaps, no better example of the absence of such norms than roads in our cities. It is not unusual in some of the most global of Indian cities to find cars parked on pavements and two-wheelers treating this space as an extension of the road.
Even the simple act of crossing a road can be a contestation. It is quite common for pedestrians to wait in a group till they have sufficient numbers to force vehicles to allow them to cross.
These battles are not played out in the domain of traffic alone. India is one of the few countries in the world where an organisation can take control of all the roads in a city for a specified period of time by calling a bandh.
And these battles can extend well beyond the physical domain, to spaces demarcated by some of our other senses. The space demarcated by our sense of hearing can be contested by loudspeakers. Indeed, loudspeakers are now widely recognised as a common spark in communal riots.
Our sense of taste too can lead to contestations in public spaces, with the push towards vegetarianism in officialdom being contested by some Dalit groups organising beef festivals in academic institutions. In the midst of these widespread contestations it is difficult to get individuals to identify completely with a public space.
Rights and responsibilities
Rather than contributing to the social protection of a public space by, say, keeping it clean, the focus is on establishing the right of an individual over that public space.
The establishment of this right could be done on a relatively permanent basis as when a family claims the right to park their car on the road in front of their house, or on more transient terms as refusing to yield when driving.
The right to dump your garbage on the street then becomes more important than the duty to keep it clean. The absence of cleanliness in our public spaces is then only a reflection of the larger malaise of unresolved contestations over these spaces.
It is possible that the oath the Prime Minister would like us to take on keeping India clean will spark a sense of duty in some of us living in our cities.
But it is to be hoped that the part of the oath that requires us to stop others from littering our public spaces will not add another dimension to the already widespread contestations of these spaces in our cities.

Complete collapse of building standardsComplete collapse of building standards
ALPA SHETH
Down down With bad practices - G SRIBHARATH
The alarming number of accidents points to the need for better regulation of the construction sector
India has witnessed a significant number of building collapses in the past 18 months. There have been seven major building collapses in three Indian cities (Mumbai, Chennai, Vadodara) alone, resulting in a total of 234 deaths, along with innumerable injuries and economic losses.
The most recent building collapse at Moulivakkam, Chennai on June 28 of this year killed 61 people, while the building collapse last year at Mumbra (near Mumbai) killed 74 people.
Two of the collapses (in Vadodara and Mazgaon, Mumbai) relate to buildings built or used by the government or its employees. These statistics do not account for the major and minor fatal building collapses in other cities and small towns which go largely unreported in the media.
High mishap rate
None of the collapses discussed above has occurred in the event of a disaster, such as an earthquake or fire or cyclone. We restrict ourselves to the discussion of collapses which are not triggered by an external unusual event. Collapses may occur during construction or during the service life of a building. The collapses at Chennai and Mumbra occurred during construction. The other five collapses happened to buildings in use, and the age of these buildings was less than thirty years, within the expected useful life of at least 50 years.
Buildings typically fail (without an undue external event) due to deficient structural design, insufficient/incorrect detailing, poor construction, use of deficient building materials, poor maintenance, or due to a combination of these factors. In general, buildings that are designed and built according to the national building standards (National Building Code of India) have a fair level of in-built safety factors; design loads are more than the normally expected loads and there are safety factors embedded in the material properties.
It is expected that even if a building does fail, it would give adequate warning so as to ensure safe egress and prevent loss of life. And yet, all the seven building failures under discussion collapsed without giving sufficient warning.
A study of building failures in the US covering 11 years between 1989 to 2000 recorded 225 failures (including both partial and total collapses) with a total loss of lives of 97 persons.
This implies about 9 lives lost per year on average in the US, as compared to our record of 234 deaths in 18 months from just 7 select collapses.
Regulation required
Building construction in India is largely an unregulated industry.
And, a robust development regulation system should have the following
Strong legislation: a strong legislative framework empowering the regulatory system. While most states do have some form of such a mechanism, it is currently weak in structure and implementation.
Techno-legal regime: a regulatory system referenced to the National Building Code. The Bureau of Indian Standards prepares codes for design and construction, but these codes get legitimacy through the building byelaws of the local authority.
Enforcement protocol: Internal checks and balances that enhance openness and transparency in the building approval process will help to usher in a clean system. This includes a rigorous mechanism for verifying and approving building designs.
Quality control: a mechanism to monitor the quality of construction, through a testing and monitoring protocol for compliance with approved designs and drawings is needed.
Licensing of civil engineers: There is inadequate specification of qualification and work experience requirements; nor is there any means of ensuring their competence. There is no systematic continuing education programme for improving periodically professional capacity. A separate Board for licensing of structural engineers and construction engineers is required to facilitate competency in certification.
Unauthorised construction: a system for dealing with unauthorised construction is called for.
Professional misconduct: a system is needed for fixing responsibility for misconduct related to building failures and powers for punitive action. A primary requirement underlying the above regulations is professional integrity in administration. The regulatory and licensing mechanisms must not degenerate into a ‘license permit raj’. The Chennai collapse is an example of deficient engineering design. The Mumbra building was illegal;. it is a glaring example of a weak enforcement of development control regulations, compounded by deficient design and construction.
A restructuring of the development control regulations across the states at the local municipal level is called for.

Expedite 63 946 pending mines leases: Centre...Andhra Pradesh
(Concerned at slow pace of…)
NEW DELHI: Concerned at slow pace of clearance of mining concessions, the Centre has asked the states to expedite disposal of about 64,000 applications for leases pending with them.
"As many as 63,946 applications for various mining concessions are pending with states like Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh , Rajasthan , Chhattisgarh , Goa , Gujarat , Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha and Tamil Nadu. These states have been asked to fast-track disposal of these leases," a Mines Ministry official told PTI.
The Ministry has already asked these states to apply provisions of the Mines and Mineral Development and Regulation Act (MMDR Act)) to dispose of cases besides putting in place a "transparent lease disposal system."
Only Odisha and Karnataka have initiated steps to put in place a transparent IT system for granting lease so far, the official said adding, "no concrete action has been taken for this by a large number of states."
It is a matter of concern that of the total applications, 43,216 are pending for mining leases (ML), 20,088 for prospecting licences (PL) and 645 for reconnaissance permits (RP) with these states.
As per the rules, there are provisions for disposal of RP within six months; PL within nine months and ML within 12 months.
The ML is granted for undertaking operations for extracting minerals while PL is granted for undertaking operations for purpose of exploring. RP, on the other hand is granted for preliminary prospecting of a mineral through regional, aerial and geophysical surveys.
The Centre has also asked the states to refer to a Supreme Court order of September 2010, known as Sandur case, "which clearly explains the applicability of different provisions of the MMDR Act, 1957, in processing mineral concession proposals" for virgin areas, previously held areas, and non-notified areas.
Also, it said there is considerable delay on the part of the state governments in sending proposals for prior approval of the central government in respect of virgin areas.
As per sources, clearances to leases have slowed down due to a host of reasons, including spurt in illegal mining cases. About one lakh cases of illegal mining are reported annually in the country.

Court opens to public American parents proceeding to cancel their adoption of Russian childrenA very interesting decision, especially since adoption-related proceedings are generally closed to the public, In the Matter of Adoption of Child A and Child C (N.Y. Surr. Ct. Oct. 2, 2014) . Here’s the court’s explanation of why there is especially strong reason to open these proceedings:
VII. PUBLIC INTEREST IN RUSSIAN/AMERICAN ADOPTION CASES
In addition to the general public interest in this case, independent interests are also implicated. The issue in this case will be important, generally and independently, to different people throughout the United States and Russia.
First, the court’s determination with regard to the allegations of fraud will be of significant concern to Russian children being offered for adoption. This court will take judicial notice of the fact that the 2013 prohibition on Russian/American adoptions by Russia has not ended the Russian/American adoption trade.
Second, the psychological well-being and the mental health of children that have been or may be adopted from the Russian Federation will be of great public concern for any person who has adopted or may be considering an adoption.
Third, the public will have humanitarian concerns over how children are being treated in Russia, and what developmental disabilities are resulting from their treatment.
Fourth, this case will be of great public concern to all families considering adoption through the services rendered by Spence-Chapin and the Cradle of Hope. The outcome of this case will have rippling implications on related subject matter throughout the United States and Russia.
Here is the full opinion:
The following constitutes the court’s decision and order concerning the closure of the Nassau County Surrogate’s Court from public access during the A and C adoption related proceeding. This court has heard oral argument and reviewed the petitions and memorandum of law in this case to make the following determination. Parent Father (hereinafter “PF”) and PM (hereinafter “PM”) reside in Nassau County, New York. Their children, whom they adopted from the Russian Federation are A, born 2000, and C, born 2002.
Before exploring the complex issues in regard to denying admission to the public for a judicial proceeding certain observations in regard to this case must be made. Judicial Notice is the rule of law of evidence that allows the fact to be introduced into evidence if the truth of that fact is so notorious or well known, or so authoritatively attested, that it cannot be reasonably be doubted. Judicial notice of the following aspects of the Russian/American adoption trade must be made in light of the Petition in this case.
1. In the past 30 years, 60,000 Russian children have been adopted by Americans;
2. The estimated payments to private and public Russian sources have been estimated to be 1/3 of a billion dollars;
3. Russia is not a party to the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-Operation in Respect of Inter-Country Adoption. This convention guarantees certain rights to adoptive children and the process of adoption;
4. An estimated 20 percent of Russian children adopted in the United States suffer from developmental disabilities from severe to mild;
5. Since 2001, over 18 adopted Russian children have died through violence of their adoptive parents or supervisors. Seventy-five percent of these children were in the United States for less than 6 months and under the age of two years;
6. In 2013, Russian President Putin publicly stopped the Russian-American adoption trade yet Russian children can still be obtained in the worldwide adoption market through other Eastern European adoption agencies;
7. Adopted Russian children have been returned to Russia without American due process; and
8. Adopted Russian children throughout the United States are currently being exchanged on the Internet through a process called Re-Homing without the benefit of any court or governmental supervision.
To these disturbing facts of the Russian/American adoption process, the allegations of fraud in the Petition of the parents in this case are profoundly disturbing. These include:
1. Allegations of fraud in the inducement during the course of the adoption petition process by American adoption agencies.
2. Allegations of “bait and switch” of children during the adoption process by American adoption agencies.
3. Allegations of Russian organized criminal component in the Russian/American adoption process both in Russia and the United States.
II. FACTS
In late 2006, the Ps enlisted the assistance of Spence-Chapin Services to Families and Children (hereinafter “Spence-Chapin”) located at 410 East 92nd Street, New York, New York 10128. The Ps wanted to adopt one or two healthy children through Spence-Chapin’s services from the Russian Federation (hereinafter “Russia”). Spence-Chapin is an adoption service that has placement programs for children domestically in the United States, and internationally.Spence-Chapin referred the Ps to the Cradle of Hope, located at 8630 Fenton Street, Suite 310, Silver Spring, Maryland 20910. Cradle of Hope provides adoption services to Spence-Chapin clients seeking to adopt children from Russia through the Bridge of Hope Program. The Bridge of Hope Program is described as placing children who are “selected by their orphanage directors as healthy and socially well adjusted.” The Ps received an information packet through the Bridge of Hope Program. The package contained various paperwork and photos of Russian children. The Ps chose a photograph of two children siblings, A and C. During the summer of 2007, A visited with the Ps for three weeks under the supervision of the Bridge of Hope Program.
In December of 2007, the Ps traveled to Russia to visit a child named C, who appeared to be the same child depicted in the information packet provided to the Ps by the Bridge of Hope Program. While visiting Russia, the Ps were introduced to an alleged half-sister of A and C. The Ps were informed that A and C were abandoned by their birth mother. The Ps were told that this half-sister was consenting to the adoption of A and C. She informed the Ps that A and C’s birth mother was in a drug rehabilitation program and their father was in prison.
On April 14, 2008, the Ps adopted A and C in Russia. They never adopted the children in the United States. Processing of the adoption required a medical examination by a United States Embassy approved doctor. The children were superficially examined and cleared for entry to the United States with all tests coming back negative. The medical examination was brief, and upon their return to the United States it was discovered that the children did, in fact, have significant medical and psychiatric problems.
The Ps were provided a medical report by the Cradle of Hope that reflected the children had “minor developmental delays”; however, the Petition alleges that the children suffered, and continue to suffer, from serious mental health disorders. The Petition exemplifies this by describing multiple occasions where the children threatened to kill PM, contacted unknown parties, and have been found to have been sexually abused in the past. Additionally, the Petition alleges concerns that C is not the same child that the Ps originally picked out in the Bridge of Hope Program package. This proceeding will help determine whether this was a mere administrative error or a “bait and switch” technique by an American adoption agency.
From May 2008 until May and September 2012, the Ps explored every avenue that they could to meet the health demands of their children. The Ps sought the help of leading child psychologists and continued to support A and C emotionally, medically and physically. Both A and C suffer from serious mental health diseases and have acted out and threatened to kill the Ps since moving to the United States. Since mid-2012, A and C have resided in a New York State mental health facility for children in need of psychiatric care. The children are living there because medical professionals determined that it was absolutely necessary for the children to be under constant medical supervision.
The Ps seek to vacate the adoption under the theory of fraud in the inducement, alleging a “bait and switch” and misrepresentation from various entities involved during the adoption process including Spence-Chapin and the Cradle of Hope. The Ps seek to vacate the adoption due to newly discovered evidence, alleging that A and C have been criminally programmed, they have severe psychiatric illnesses and that they are unable to form familial bonds. The Ps also seek to vacate the adoption for cause, alleging the Ps are in danger of being harmed by A and C, and that both A and C are in danger of harming themselves. Additionally, the petition alleges that the original birth father of both A and C never consented to the adoption and, therefore, it is invalid.
III. PUBLIC ACCESS AS OPPOSED TO TRIALS IN SECRET
The New York State Judiciary Law codifies the presumption of an open trial:
The sittings of every court within this state shall be public, and every citizen may freely attend the same except that in all proceedings and trials in cases for divorce, seduction, abortion, rape, assault with intent to commit rape, criminal sexual act, bastardy, or filation, the court may in its discretion, exclude therefrom all persons who are not directly interested therein, excepting jurors, witnesses, and officers of the court. (Judiciary Law §4).
Public trials are an essential facet of our judicial system. As Justice Holmes stated in Crowley v Pulsifer (137 Mass 392 [1884]):
It is desirable that the trial of cases should take place under public eye, not because the controversies of one citizen are of public concern, but because it is of the highest moment that those who administer justice should always act under the sense of public responsibility, and that every citizen should be able to satisfy himself with his own eyes as to the mode in which a public duty is performed. (Crowley v. Pulsifer, 137 Mass. 392, 394 [1884])
The First Amendment grants access to the public in criminal trials. Public access is equally extended to civil trials (Danco Labs v Chemical Works of Gedeon Richter, 274 AD2d 1, 6-7 [1st Dept. 2000]). The United States Supreme Court stated in Richmond Newspapers v Commonwealth of Virginia (448 US 555 [1980]) that open trials “enhance the integrity and quality of what takes place” and increases the veracity of witness testimony (Richmond Newspapers v Commonwealth of Virginia, 448 US 555, 597 [1980]).
IV. A BALANCE OF EQUITY AND FACTS: AN OPEN COURTROOM AGAINST THE CONCEPT OF A CLOSED COURTROOM
A party must make a compelling argument to overcome the presumption of an open courtroom. The presumption is a difficult task to overcome, even when children are involved (Anonymous v Anonymous, 263 AD2d 342, 342 [1st Dept, 2000]; also see Anonymous v Anonymous, 158 AD2d 296 [1st Dept, 1990]). Compelling circumstances are required to overcome the presumption of an open courtroom (Matter of Herald Company v Weisenberg, 89 AD2d 224, 226 [4th Dept 1982]). It has been argued, and other courts have considered NYCRR § 205.4, a Family Court Trial Rule, which provides further privacy rights to parties in court when the custody of children are involved. However, as stated in Capital Newspapers Div. of Hearst Corp v Moynihan (71 NY2d 263 [1988]), when the presumption of an open courtroom has been modified, the legislature has done so “in specific language and these exceptions have been strictly construed by the courts” (Capital Newspapers Div. of Hearst Corp. v Moynihan, 71 NY2d 263, 271[1988]). Therefore, it should not be extended to a proceeding vacating an adoption.
Even if the test is considered, this case fails to set forth compelling circumstances. When considering closure under NYCRR § 205.4, the significant interests of the public and society as a whole must be weighed against any potential harm to children involved. The presumption can only be overcome when evidence of a harm or potential harm is compelling. Therefore, the severity of the harm and the specific evidence leading to the harm must be considered.
There will always be an argument to close a courtroom when children are involved — to shield their lives from the public eye. However, if closure were granted in every case involving a child, it would no longer be an exception, it would be the rule. The court’s position is bolstered by another court’s holding of an open courtroom in an adoption case, where public interest was great (In re Motion to Vacate the Adoption of John Doe, 2007 NY Misc. LEXIS 2577 [Sur Ct, New York County 2007]).
Additional case law in New York State compels public access to public proceedings: Anonymous v Anonymous, 263 AD2d 341, 344 (1st Dept. 2000); Merrick v Merrick, 154 Misc 2d 559 (Sup Ct, New York County 1992); Anonymous v Anonymous, 158 AD2d 296 (1st Dept 1990).
V. PROOF OF HARM: COURT PROCEEDINGS CONCERNING CHILDREN AND ISSUES OF PUBLIC ACCESS
There must be a concrete showing of proof of harm against the children. Mere speculation of harm is insufficient (Merrick v Merrick, 154 Misc 2d 559 [Sup Ct, New York County 1992]). When closure of a courtroom has been granted, courts used factually supportable evidence offered by medical professionals who recently observed the children involved in those cases, holding that it would be traumatizing to the children considering their mental health to have to come into court. However, in the case before this court, a definitive proof of harm is only speculation and has not been shown by the petitioners. In our case, it must be noted that the identity of the children and parents will remain anonymous, and there is the strongest of possibilities that the children will not be present at court proceedings.
VI.GENERAL SECRECY IN ADOPTION RELATED PROCEEDINGS DOES NOT REQUIRE CLOSURE
Although adoption records are sealed and considered secret pursuant to DRL §114, an argument extending this secrecy to closure of the courtroom in cases of dissolving an adoption will be unavailing. It must be noted that the following interests are served by sealing adoption proceeding and records, none of which will be accomplished by closure of the courtroom in our case. The legal principles requiring the closing of a courtroom in adoption cases are clear:
1. Protecting the identity of all parents (Matter of Linda F.M., 52 NY2d 236, 239 [1981]).
2. Protecting the privacy of adoptive parents and their new family (id).
3. Protecting the child of his/her adoptive status (id).
The parents involved in this case may no longer be considered parents at the conclusion of this matter, there will not be a new family and the children are already aware of their adoptive status.
VII. PUBLIC INTEREST IN RUSSIAN/AMERICAN ADOPTION CASES
In addition to the general public interest in this case, independent interests are also implicated. The issue in this case will be important, generally and independently, to different people throughout the United States and Russia.
First, the court’s determination with regard to the allegations of fraud will be of significant concern to Russian children being offered for adoption. This court will take judicial notice of the fact that the 2013 prohibition on Russian/American adoptions by Russia has not ended the Russian/American adoption trade.
Second, the psychological well-being and the mental health of children that have been or may be adopted from the Russian Federation will be of great public concern for any person who has adopted or may be considering an adoption.
Third, the public will have humanitarian concerns over how children are being treated in Russia, and what developmental disabilities are resulting from their treatment.
Fourth, this case will be of great public concern to all families considering adoption through the services rendered by Spence-Chapin and the Cradle of Hope. The outcome of this case will have rippling implications on related subject matter throughout the United States and Russia.
VIII. CONCLUSION
Due to the heightened public interest in this case, and the amount of families that have adopted children in the past and who will adopt in the future from Russia, the application for an order closing the courtroom during this trial is denied. This court must note that the need for cogent and logical scrutiny of a public action is a cornerstone of democracy. This matter is far too important to the people of Nassau County, the United States and Russia to limit the public to its unique factual issues.
The actions of the media in their coverage of this proceeding is not without reservations. They should not make any attempts to identify A, C or Ps. If such attempts are made, this court will strongly reconsider the issue of public access.

Banks request clarity on tax treatment over bonds under Basel 3Banks request clarity on tax treatment over bonds under Basel 3

New Delhi, Oct 6:  
Bankers have sought clarity from the Finance Ministry regarding taxation of additional tier—I bonds through which they are expected to raise capital to meet Basel III norms.
Clarity on taxation would help investors in putting money into such instrument without hesitation.
Banks have requested the Ministry to clarify tax treatment issues with regard to additional tier-I bonds in a meeting held recently, sources said.
Sources said bankers in the meeting said that investors want to know whether these instruments will be treated as bonds or equity for taxation purposes.
Under the Basel-III norms, additional tier-I bonds come with loss absorbency features meaning that in case of stress, banks can write off such investments or convert them into common equity if approved by the RBI.
This will help banks to conserve capital at the time of stress or loss.
Additional Tier I bonds, which qualifies as core capital or equity capital, is one of the means of raising capital by the public sector banks which would require Rs 2.40 lakh crore by March 2019.
Besides, investors also want clarity if they have option to exit such an investment after a few years.
Only few banks, including Bank of India, have raised funds through this instrument.
Some of the regulators, including pension regulator (PFRDA), have also raised issues on the taxation structure of these bonds.
However, PFRDA recently permitted pension fund managers to invest in Basel III compliant Tier I bonds of banks.
“It is hereby clarified that additional Tier I bonds compatible under Basel III issued by scheduled commercial banks in accordance with the RBI guidelines are to be considered as debt instruments eligible for investments under the debt category of all NPS schemes provided they are rated as investment grade by at lease one rating agency,” PFRDA had said in a notification.
Tier I bonds are instruments which are perpetual in nature and therefore are akin to shares.

Corporate ratings upgrades hint early signs of recoveryCorporate ratings upgrades hint early signs of recovery
PTI
Tweet
Mumbai, Oct 6:  
After two consecutive financial years of sub—5 per cent GDP growth, India’s economy is showing early signs of recovery as reflected in a sharp rise in corporate rating upgrades in the current fiscal, rating agencies Crisil and Care said today.
The two domestic agencies said their respective ratios of rating movements are pointing towards early signs of recovery in Asia’s third—largest economy which expanded at a healthy pace of 5.7 per cent in the April—June period.
“Corporate India’s credit quality is showing early signs of recovery...upgrades exceeded downgrades in H1 — 741 upgrades compared to 451 downgrades,” Crisil said in a report.
Its competitor Care Ratings said there has been a “sharp increase” in the number of upgrades in the September quarter, where upgrades have doubled over the year ago period.
Crisil said the improvement in credit quality will be gradual and a significant recovery will be possible only on a sustained increase in investment demand.
Stating that improvement in business—related factors was the key driver for 60 per cent of the upgrades, Crisil said export—linked sectors and non—discretionary consumer segments like traders, packaged food, pharmaceuticals, textiles and farm products are getting enhanced ratings.
Players operating in the construction, engineering, capital goods and automobile ancillary sectors had higher downgrades than their counterparts in other sectors, Crisil said.
“Credit quality buoyancy in the overall economy is still some time away, and for that to happen, investment demand, which depends on the extent to which the Central government pushes big ticket policy reforms, needs to increase substantially,” Crisil Senior Director Pawan Agrawal said.
The key aspects to monitor going forward will be impact of the monsoons, progress by indebted corporates in reducing their external debt through asset sales or equity infusion, demand outlook in the economy, and the extent of policy reforms by the Government, Crisil said.

Mumbai, Oct 6:  
Worldwide semiconductor revenue is on pace to reach $ 338 billion this year, clipping at 7.2 per cent growth over last year and up from the previous forecast of 6.7 per cent, says Gartner.
“Semiconductor revenue set an all-time record in the third quarter of 2014, fuelled by a strong electronics build for the holiday season,” said Gartner research Director Jon Erensen said in a report.
“Get ready for a flood of new product launches, ranging from simple low-cost tablets to high-end ultramobiles and smartphones. Demand for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus has been robust, but there is concern for other types of devices planned for the holidays,” he added.
While some products may not sell in the holiday season, Gartner remains bullish on 2014 consumer demand and forecasts 2014 production of smartphones and ultramobiles to rise 27 per cent and 18.9 per cent, respectively.
The semiconductor market is expected to grow 5.8 per cent in 2015, with high inventories in the first quarter of 2015 emerging as the largest concern.

States not expanding Medicaid hobble the fight against HIV/AIDSBy Jonathan Capehart October 6 Follow @capehartj

As we begin to worry about the possibility of an Ebola epidemic taking hold in the United States, we must not forget the epidemic already firmly rooted here. The HIV/AIDS epidemic has raged for more than 30 years in this country with more than 1.1 million people in the U.S. living with HIV/AIDS and African Americans experiencing “the most severe burden of HIV,” according to the Centers for Disease Control. While a positive diagnosis no longer means guaranteed death, it does mean a life of expensive medications and care to manage the chronic disease. Lack of awareness and of access to care continue to help spread an infection that is relatively easy to avoid.
The arrival of the Affordable Care Act in 2010 improved health care options for people living with HIV/AIDS. Insurance coverage was finally possible because the law prohibited insurers from denying health coverage because of a preexisting condition. And that meant access to care and medications that prolong life and help slow the epidemic’s rate of transmission. The expansion of Medicaid would loop even more people with HIV/AIDS into care.
The imperative of doing so was vividly demonstrated in three maps presented by Lauren Banks of AIDS Alabama during a panel I moderated on HIV/AIDS at the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation legislative conference late last month. Right now, only 27 states and the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid. The states that have yet to extend the federal government health care program are also home to some of the highest concentrations of HIV infections and those living with HIV/AIDS. To see those maps is to wonder why governors and state legislators in those states seem willing to deprive their citizens of health care and the life-prolonging and life-saving treatment that come with it.
The first map Banks presented showed the “rates of persons living with an HIV diagnosis, by county.” The heavy concentrations in the South, Northeast and urban areas are hard to miss. Those counties in the deepest red reported a rate of more than 384 persons per 100,000 living with HIV or an AIDS diagnosis as of 2010.
(Courtsey AIDSVu)
The second map Banks presented showed the data filtered to just show the rate of African Americans living with an HIV or AIDS diagnosis. The first thing you notice is that the areas of highest concentration on this map are almost identical to those in the map above. Those counties in the deepest red reported a rate of more than 1,061 persons per 100,000 living with HIV or an AIDS diagnosis as of 2010.
(Courtsey AIDSVu)
Now, look at the map below to see the stark and disparate impact of this epidemic on blacks and whites. Banks didn’t show this next map, but I found it while researching this post.
(Courtsey AIDSVu)
According to the latest data from the CDC, an estimated 50,000 people tested positive for HIV in the United States in 2011. African Americans “accounted for an estimated 44 percent of new HIV infections in 2010” and “accounted for 44 percent of people living with HIV infection in 2009.”
Other data from the CDC show the South had the highest percentage of new AIDS diagnoses (45 percent) at the end of 2010. The South had the highest percentage of people “living with an AIDS diagnosis” (40 percent) in 2009. And the South “accounted for 48 percent of the 17,774 persons with a diagnosis of AIDS who died in the 50 states and the District.”
And this brings me to the third map Banks presented during the panel, which shows the status of Medicaid expansion . You don’t need to be a geography whiz to see that the HIV/AIDS epidemic rages in the Southern states that are “not moving forward at this time” on Medicaid expansion.
(Courtesy The Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation)
Kaiser Health News (KHN) reported last March on a study which estimated that “nearly 115,000 uninsured, low-income people living with HIV/AIDS would be eligible for Medicaid if all states adopted the expansion.” But it added, “Of these, nearly 60,000 live in states not moving forward with the Medicaid expansion.” The KHN story notes that “About 70 percent of the group living in states not expanding Medicaid earn too little to qualify for financial help to buy insurance in the marketplaces created by the health law.”
Sylvia Burwell, the secretary of health and human services, is in talks with the governors of Tennessee, Utah and Indiana to expand Medicaid in their states. This is great, but there is no action in the states where it is needed most in the fight against HIV/AIDS. And an HHS official told me Friday that the agency has “worked with both Democratic and Republican Governors to be flexible so they can design a solution that works best for their states and their low-income residents.” The official added, “As we approach open enrollment for 2015, we urge all Governors to help people both get covered and stay covered, and we are committed to working with all states to implement Medicaid expansion in a way that maximizes coverage options for uninsured residents.”
If the moral argument for the need to extend health coverage to all those who want and need it doesn’t hold sway then perhaps the economic one will. The ACA mandates full federal financing of a state’s Medicaid expansion. Starting in 2017, that 100 percent federal match will gradually taper to and remain at 90 percent by 2020. Thus, the remaining 23 states that haven’t done so are leaving money on the table that could help thousands of people living with HIV/AIDS to get health coverage, care and treatment for “a big disease with a little name.”  Knowing that, it takes a special kind of callousness to continue to say no to those in need.

Morning Plum: Could conservative overreach help Dems keep the SenateBy Greg Sargent October 6 Follow @theplumlinegs
The forecasters continue to predict Republicans are marginally favored to take the Senate. But they also agree this battle remains extremely close and that Democrats could still hang on. If they do, it will be partly because of a factor that continues to go under-appreciated: In an election that is supposed to be all about the unpopularity of President Obama and his health law, conservative governance, and conservative overreach, are very much on the ballot this fall, too.
A new batch of NBC/Marist polls released over the weekend showed Democratic Senator Kay Hagan hanging on to a four point lead in North Carolina, while independent Greg Orman now leads incumbent Republican Senator Pat Roberts in Kansas by 10 points. The North Carolina finding is in sync with the average , while the Kansas one isn’t, though the Kansas average does show Orman leading .
It would have been awfully bold to predict six months ago that Republicans would be trailing in North Carolina and Kansas. But what’s notable here is that both these states are home to two of the nation’s leading experiments in conservative state-level governance .
In North Carolina, the Senate race has turned to an unexpected degree on the hard right turn of the state legislature under Hagan’s opponent, state House Speaker Thom Tillis. The NBC poll of North Carolina finds Hagan leading even though her favorability ratings are under water, at 42-48. Tillis’ personal ratings are worse, at 36-47, a net of minus 11. Given that Democrats have relentlessly attacked Tillis over the state legislature’s education cuts and tax cuts for the wealthy — and given that Tillis has not committed any noticeably awful gaffes — it seems reasonable to assume the legislature’s priorities might be a key reason Republicans are trailing.
The case in Kansas is somewhat less clear cut. Kansas governor Sam Brownback has turned his tenure into a “real live experiment” in the proposition that slashing taxes will unleash runaway growth , an experiment conservatives have held aloft as a showcase for the whole country. The result has been a flood of red ink and deep cuts to government and education that have made moderate Republicans in the state recoil in shock .
It’s hard to know just how responsible this is for Orman’s lead. But the NBC poll of Kansas also shows Governor Brownback down slightly against his Democratic challenger. Meanwhile, Orman is leading in spite of the fact that Obama has only a 36 percent approval rating in the state, and in spite of relentless GOP efforts to link Orman to the President, suggesting this race isn’t All About Obummer, but about something else. The poll also shows there are more self-described moderates in the state (40 percent) than conservatives (31 percent). And Orman’s message is premised on the unpopularity of both parties, the GOP included, which might be easier to do if Brownback’s overreach is alienating independents and moderate Republicans, which appears to be happening.
It’s a mistake to read too much significance into election outcomes. But if Democrats do hold North Carolina and Orman wins and caucuses with Dems — which the forecasters seem to see as a real possibility — it will make it somewhat more likely that Dems hold their majority. If so, it would be quite the outcome if two states that are hosting nationally watched experiments in conservative governance end up playing a key role in making that happen.
*************************************************************************
* HOW DEMS HOPE TO HANG ON IN ALASKA: Don’t miss Philip Rucker’s outstanding piece on the voter mobilization machinery that Dems are building throughout far flung rural Alaska , which will be key to Senator Mark Begich’s chances even if he is slightly behind GOP challenger Dan Sullivan:
In 2012, Alaska had 82 early voting locations, mostly in urban and suburban areas. But after Alaska Native leaders demanded better access in rural villages, the state is opening 208 early voting locations this month — 161 of them in rural Alaska. This means that the campaigns have a full two weeks to marshal voters to the polls…Sullivan has five field offices…this year, Begich opened 16 offices, many in far-flung communities. Whereas Sullivan and the Republican Party have 14 field staffers on the payroll, Begich and the Democratic Party have 90.
Also, Alaska is notoriously difficult to poll, so this sort of stuff really bears watching here.
* ERNST HOLDS SLIM LEAD IN IOWA: The NBC polling released this weekend also finds Joni Ernst leading Bruce Braley by two points, 46-44. Given that the polling average shows Ernst up by 1.2 points, it seems likely that Ernst’s edge is significantly smaller than that Des Moines Register poll putting her up six that got so much attention.
* DEMS LEAD EARLY VOTING IN IOWA: Political scientist Michael McDonald has a useful overview of the state of early voting in Iowa, which shows Democrats with a lead, though there are important caveats , which hint at what we should be watching for now:
Republicans now have 62,881 total ballot requests, 38,145 more requests than they had at a similar point in 2010, representing a 154 percent increase. Democrats still lead with 103,537 total requests, but this is 32,545 more than the similar point in 2010, representing a 68 percent increase. The DSCC claims that Iowa Republicans are just banking votes from people who voted in 2010 and would have voted in 2014 anyway.
That last notion is key. The DSCC claims 30 percent of Democrats who requested absentee ballots, and 47 percent of independents who did the same, did not vote in 2010. Dem chances turn on whether they are able to get those who didn’t vote in the last midterm out this time.
* DEMS LEAD IN CONTACTING VOTERS: Nate Cohn takes a look at new polling and finds Republicans retain a small edge in the battle for Senate control, but also finds this in the data :
The Democrats have invested millions more than Republicans in building a strong turnout operation, and the effects of that effort are already evident in the YouGov data. More voters have been contacted by Democratic than Republican campaigns in every state but Kansas and Kentucky, where Republican senators fought competitive primaries. Whether the Democratic turnout machine can turn its advantage in voter contacts into additional votes on Election Day might well determine Senate control.
As I’ve reported here , the basic Dem game plan is to try to reach parity (or better) on the air, and then grind out a victory on the margins through brute organizing and voter mobilization.
* CLINTON GOES ALL OUT IN ARKANSAS: Politico reports that Bill Clinton has no less than four rallies planned in Arkansas , to persuade swing voters that Senator Mark Pryor is a centrist who is better for the state than the far-right Tom Cotton, and to mobilize core Dem voters whose turnout will be crucial on the margins. Key to this will be African Americans, who are positioned to play a pivotal and historic role in several southern Senate races — if they turn out.
* DEMS PRESS CLIMATE CHANGE IN MICHIGAN RACE:  The New York Times has an interesting and useful overview of all the spending on ads coming from Democratic groups, which shows Dems pressing a range of issues — from Personhood to women’s health to the environment — across the country , in an election that was supposed to be all about Obamacare. Note this factoid:
In Michigan, for example, 79 percent of issues mentioned in ads by Democratic-leaning outside groups have been about the environment or energy, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Wesleyan Media Project.
* A RETURN OF ‘VOODOO ECONOMICS’: Paul Krugman suggests that if Republicans take the Senate, they’ll be in a better position to push the neutral Congressional Budget Office to adopt “dynamic scoring,” i.e., the idea that we should factor in future economic growth in measuring the fiscal impact of tax cuts:
For years people like [Paul] Ryan have posed as champions of fiscal discipline even while advocating huge tax cuts for wealthy individuals and corporations. They have also called for savage cuts in aid to the poor, but these have never been big enough to offset the revenue loss. So how can they make things add up?…Inevitably, then, they’re feeling the pull of that old black magic — and if they take the Senate, they’ll be able to infuse voodoo into supposedly neutral analysis.
* BREAKING: IOWA CHICKEN CHARGE IS BOGUS: Republicans and Joni Ernst continue to attack Dem candidate Bruce Braley for supposedly threatening to sue a neighbor over chickens wandering into his yard. Glenn Kessler takes a very close look at the situation and concludes that there is no definitive evidence that this threat was made .
Noteworthy: The source for this claim — a lawyer for the local condo board who made an inconclusive claim that Republicans have spun up and fed to the media like chicken feed — is refusing to clarify it.
Greg Sargent writes The Plum Line blog, a reported opinion blog with a liberal slant -- what you might call “opinionated reporting” from the left.

I feel very happy that I could get a gold and a bronze: Sania MirzaSania Mirza said she was not yet thinking about the 2016 Rio Olympics (Source: PTI)
Press Trust of India | Hyderabad | Posted: October 6, 2014 7:01 pm | Updated: October 6, 2014 7:03 pm
Tennis ace Sania Mirza expressed happiness over India winning five medals at the recently-concluded Asian Games at Incheon, although she felt many people did not expect them to do well with the team the country had sent.
“I feel very good. I feel very happy that I could get a gold and a bronze. I think many people did not expect because we did not go with the best team. But I am very happy that we could come back with five medals,” she told reporters.
With some of top players pulling out, the expectations from Indian tennis squad were not high in the Asiad. Sania and Saketh Myneni defeated Chinese Taipei’s Hsien Yin Peng and Hao Ching Chan to win the country a mixed doubles gold at the Incheon Asian Games. She also bagged a bronze in the women’s doubles event partnering Prarthana Thombare.
Apart from these two medals, India’s men’s doubles pair of Myneni and Sanam Singh pocketed the silver, while Yuki Bhambri and Divij Sharan settled for a bronze.
Yuki also managed a bronze in men’s singles. Sania, who had won the mixed doubles at the US Open prior to the Asian Games, said she was happy with her career at the moment.
“At the moment, I am very happy with the way my career is going, with the way my life is going,” she said.
Unwell since last one week, Sania said she was recovering well and looking forward to a break.
“It (fitness) is going ok. I have been sick the last one week. I have been recovering a little bit. I am looking forward to a few days off. It has been a very long few months for me. But it has been very good. So, I am looking forward to a few days off,” she said.
Sania said she was not yet thinking about the 2016 Rio Olympics but was getting ready to play the Singapore Open in about two weeks time.
“Olympics is really far right now. I am planning for two weeks from now. Hopefully, if I am still playing tennis two years from now, then I will be there. Before that I have a lot more to look forward to,” she said.
The Hyderabadi tennis ace, who has been made a brand ambassador by the TRS government in Telangana, said she would like to bring laurels to the state.
“I am very happy to be the brand ambassador of Telangana. I hope I can keep bringing laurels to the state,” she said.
Olympics is really far right now. I am planning for two weeks from now.

SP backs RLD  wants Delhis Tughlaq Road bungalow declared as Charan Singh memorialPrint
Written by Maulshree Seth | Lucknow | Posted: October 6, 2014 6:59 pm | Updated: October 6, 2014 7:01 pm
Samajwadi Party on Sunday extended support to Ajit Singh’s campaign for declaring a Tughlaq road bungalow, formerly occupied by the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) chief, a memorial to his father and ex-prime minister Chaudhary Charan Singh.
The announcement came after RLD national general secretary Jayant Chaudhary, former MP and son of Ajit Singh, met Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav at his residence in Lucknow for inviting him to “Kisan Swabhiman Rally” on October 12 in Meerut. The rally has been called by Ajit Singh to put pressure on the NDA government for converting the bungalow into a memorial in the honour of the socialist leader. The invitation to Akhilesh came in his capacity as the state president of Samajwadi Party.
“Chief Minister has told them that Samajwadi Party is committed to the ideology of Chaudhary Charan Singh and has been implementing his policies. Samajwadi Party is in favour of both a memorial for Charan Singh as well as Bharat Ratna for Charan Singh,” said Rajendra Chaudhary, SP spokesperson and state cabinet minister.
Rajendra Chaudhary, who was present during the meeting, said, “SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav has a lot of respect for Charan Singh and has worked to take forward his ideology by continuous struggle for prosperity of villages and villagers.” He, however, maintained that the support should not be seen as the confirmation of participation of Akhilesh or his father Mulayam Singh  in the programme.
RLD spokesperson Anil Dubey, who was also part of the meeting along with RLD state president Munna Singh Chauhan, told The Indian Express, “Jayantji met the Chief Minister to invite him for the October 12 rally in Meerut, which would aim at putting pressure on tje NDA government to declare former bungalow of Ajit Singh as a memorial for Chaudhary Charan Singh. The meet has been very positive and we are hopeful that he would come.”
Dubey said that while Akhilesh Yadav has assured of his presence, “Bihar CM hief Minister Jeetan Ram Manjhi, former Bihar CM Nitish Kumar, Haryana Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, Janata Dal (United) leader Sharad Yadav have already given their consent.” He said that RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav has also been invited to the rally.
Ajit Singh recently evicted the bungalow, weeks after civic authorities in New Delhi disconnected water and power supply to the house as the RLD leader did not comply with the eviction notice served to him. He had been staying in the bungalow for 36 years.

Maruti Suzuki launches Ciaz sedan at Rs 6.99 lakhFirst shown as a concept model in the 2014 Delhi Auto Expo earlier in 2014, the Ciaz has replaced the aging SX4 in Maruti Suzuki’s portfolio in India.
Express News Service | New Delhi | Posted: October 6, 2014 6:54 pm
Maruti Suzuki launched the much awaited Ciaz sedan on Monday with introductory prices of the car ranging between Rs 6.99 lakh to Rs 9.80 lakh, ex-showroom Delhi. First shown as a concept model in the 2014 Delhi Auto Expo earlier in 2014, the Ciaz has replaced the aging SX4 in Maruti Suzuki’s portfolio in India.
The Ciaz will be offered in a choice of two engine options across a total of eight variants, namely- VXi, VXi+, ZXi and ZXi Optional for the petrol variants; and VDi, VDi+, ZDi, and ZDi Optional in the diesel variants. The petrol variants of the Maruti Suzuki Ciaz feature the company’s K-Series 1.4 litre four-cylinder naturally aspirated petrol engine that develops 92.5PS of max power @ 6,000 rpm and 130Nm of peak torque @ 4,000 rpm. This engine comes mated to a 5-speed manual gearbox while a 4-speed automatic transmission is also on offer. Although, the automatic gearbox can only be had in VXi+ or ZXi trim. The ARAI certified fuel economy is 20.73 km/l for the manual car, whereas, the automatic version has a slightly lower figure of 19.12 km/l.
The diesel variants are powered by the Fiat derived 1.3 litre four-cylinder turbocharged MultiJet diesel engine that develops 90PS of peak power @ 4,000 rpm and 200Nm of maximum torque @ 1,750 rpm. In the Ciaz, Maruti claims this engine to return an ARAI certified fuel efficiency of 26.21 km/l, thereby, making it India’s most fuel efficient car! Unlike the petrol, the diesel engine variants will only be offered with a 5-speed manual gearbox.
Speaking of the features, the base -VXi / VDi variants are decently equipped and come fitted with central locking, a driver information display, projector lamps, fog lamps, keyless entry, electrically adjustable ORVMs, a double din stereo, rear air-conditioning vents, tilt adjustable steering, front and rear armrests, front and rear cup holders, power steering, all four power windows and rear defogger. The subsequent VXi+ / VDi+ variants get anti-lock brakes, steering mounted audio controls, driver airbag, and reverse parking sensors in addition.
Further up the range, the ZXi / ZDi variants feature alloy wheels, climate control, rear sun blind, illuminated foot well with adjustable lighting, dual airbags, reverse camera, height adjustable driver’s seat, and electrically folding ORVMs.
The top of the line ZXi (O) / ZDi (O) come with start/stop button, leather upholstery, a touchscreen infotainment system with voice recognition, electronic brake force distribution and 16 inch alloy wheels. The ZXi (O) and ZDi (O) variants, however, will be made available in early 2015.
The Maruti Suzuki Ciaz is also claimed to be the most spacious car in its segment as it has the longest wheelbase amongst its competition. The Ciaz will be taking the fight against the Honda City, which is by and large the favorite in the segment.

A lunar eclipse bathes the moon in color Wednesday morningComments
By Blaine Friedlander October 6

Now, even the moon will rock the red. On Wednesday morning Oct. 8 before sunrise, the moon wraps itself in reddish, copper tones thanks to a total lunar eclipse in the western sky.
Lunar eclipses – unlike solar eclipses – are safe to watch, says noted eclipse expert Fred Espenak. (Espenak’s EclipseWise website can be found here .) A lunar eclipse can be observed with nothing more than the naked eye, he says.
Standing between the sun and the moon, our planet throws a shadow as a result. This shadow has two parts: a penumbra and an umbra. The umbra is the central shadow and the penumbra is the perimeter shadow surrounding the umbra.
Entering the partial phase (the penumbral shadow) at 5:15 a.m. EDT, the moon slowly gains a red glow. Our lunar colleague then moves into the umbral shadow by 6:25 a.m., and – and barring cloudy skies – consumes itself wholly in crimson.
The full moon officially occurs at 6:51 a.m. (EDT), according to the U.S. Naval Observatory. And the middle of the total lunar eclipse occurs at 6:55 a.m., but note the sky will be lightening for sunrise (7:11 a.m.) in the east. The moon sets in the west a mere five minutes later at 7:16 a.m., according to the Naval Observatory.
The moon will turn a lovely shade of "celestial red" when it passes through the shadow of Earth for a total lunar eclipse in the early morning hours of Oct. 8. (ScienceAtNASA via YouTube)
 
Quartet in the cosmos
This total lunar eclipse is the second of four total lunar eclipses in a row and that special quartet of events is called a tetrad. The first total lunar eclipse in the tetrad was April 15 and the next one will be April 4, 2015 and then Sept. 28, 2015.
Between 1582 and 1908, there were no tetrads. In our modern age, there will be eight tetrads in this century. The last quartet was 2003-04, while the next one will occur in 2032-33.
It’s a family affair
Lunar eclipses occur in a series – or a family – every 18 years, 11 days and 8 hours, and these eclipse families are called “saros,” says NASA. The Oct. 8 eclipse belongs to lunar eclipse Saros 127, a series that dates back to July 9, 1275. The last eclipse in this family will happen on Sept. 2, 2555.
Our ancestors enjoyed this series’ longest total lunar eclipse on July 23, 1888, when it lasted 1 hour and 46 minutes. The shortest total eclipse in Saros 127 will be Nov. 9, 2068, when it will last just over 18 minutes. Saros 127 continues with its next total lunar eclipse on Oct. 18, 2032.
View online in case of clouds
In case of clouds, look online to Slooh.com , where the eclipse will be webcast live starting at 5 a.m. EDT, on Wednesday.
In about two weeks, the Washington gets another cosmic treat: A partial solar eclipse at the end of daylight on Thursday, Oct. 23.

A top Taliban figure gives away his hiding spot on Twitter— zabihullahmujahid (@zabihmujahid) October 3, 2014
Mujahid quickly denied that he was in Pakistan and said the geolocation was part of an “enemy plot.”
The Taliban is active on social media—it used to tweet regularly under the handle @alemarahweb, though that account doesn’t exist anymore. Mujahid has nearly 6,000 followers.
Social media has a history of outing the location of people who’d probably prefer to remain hidden. This summer, in a shrewd act of investigative Instagram reporting, BuzzFeed discovered that a Russian soldier was operating inside Ukraine .
“Mujahid” might actually be a combination of several different people. Here’s one of them, with his back turned to the camera, speaking to CNN in 2009:

Vishal Sikka ropes in former SAP colleague Michael Reh to revive Infosys' Finacle
Neha Alawadhi & Varun Sood, ET Bureau Oct 6, 2014, 04.37PM IST

Finacle
(Reh, who joined Infosys…)
NEW DELHI/BANGALORE: Vishal Sikka has tasked his former colleague from SAP , Michael Reh to help revive the fortunes of Infosys's core banking, Finacle, thereby underlying the significance of the division after the first non-founder CEO said that he aims to double company's investment to revive the struggling solutions vertical.
M Haragopal, senior vice president and head of Finacle, decided to end his over two decade stint with the Bangalore-based company, prompting Sikka to anoint Reh, who joined Infosys on October 1. Reh, formerly EVP for business information and technology at SAP, will continue to be based out of Hamburg, Germany, ET learns.
This change in leadership at Finacle is effective October 20.
"Haragopal...has expressed his desire to move from Infosys to pursue his entrepreneurial ambitions. The management has accepted his request and has appointed Michael Reh as Senior Vice President and the new Global Head of Finacle," Infosys said in an internal email sent to employees on Monday.
An Infosys spokesperson declined to comment, saying: "As a matter of policy we do not comment on the appointments or exits other than Members of the Board or Executive Officers"
Although Infosys does not share revenues generated from its core banking product, over the last three years Finacle has seen revenues dip from from $314 million in 2012 to $297 million by the end of March 2014, estimates advisory firm Nelson Hall. This was mainly on account of poor demand from banks to invest in next generation core banking solutions and company's inability to tap into the large US market, said one former Infosys executive.
For now, Infosys clubs revenues from Finacle along with its clients from the banking, financial services and insurance space, which accounts for a little over 33.5% of company's $8.25 billion revenues.
Last week, Sikka told industry participants at an Infosys customer event in Berlin that among other things, he plans to double investments in Finacle, without sharing details. Some experts, including Rachael Stormonth, senior vice president at Nelson Hall, believe that Infosys may look at expanding Finacle brand to include insurance, something which Mumbai-based TCS has done with its core banking product BaNCS.
For now, Infosys has been successful in selling Finacle to 170 banks in emerging markets, including Asia Pacific, Middle East and Latin America, and has built customer base in Ireland, the Netherlands and the UK. These geographies account for about over 90% of Finacle's revenues while US accounts for remaining 8-9%, according to an executive at banking financial and services space at Infosys. Experts at Forrester and Nelson Hall believe that Sikka could help expand Finacle's reach in the US as there is "pent-up demand" for replacement of core banking systems from both large and small banks.
"Finacle is also one of a small group of solutions that offer more than basic social media support," said Frederic Giron, VP and Research Director, Forrester Research.

Gayana Samaja’s Sangeeta Kalarathna award for S. Shankar
Ranjani Govind
arts, culture and entertainment
The vocalist also runs the Shankarabharanam Kala Mandira and has published three books related to music
As a young boy, S. Shankar always sat on the floor mat spread at Gayana Samaja’s concerts to hear visiting vidwans in the late 1950s. As a senior vocalist today, the 64-year-old is thoroughly pleased that to be chosen for the prestigious Sangeeta Kalarathna award instituted by Gayana Samaja.
“I am unable to believe that this biggest Sabha award of Karnataka is being bestowed on me. I am grateful to the institution and my gurus for this,” he says. The 46 Sangeeta Kalarathna award will be bestowed on Shankar on October 19 during Gayana Samaja’s Sangeeta Sammelana scheduled to be held from October 12 to 19.
With an MSc in Maths from Bangalore University, Shankar’s passion for melody made him enter Akashavani as an 11-year-old child artiste. Before he completed his academic studies, he had already won AIR’s national level vocal competition. He retired as the Senior Accountant from the AGS office.
With the melodic foundation laid by mother Rajamma Sastry, Shankar went on to have a 25-year steady guidance from Vallabham Kalyana Sundaram, a senior vocalist of the 1960s. “My guru could relate to the styles of yesteryear greats, including Musiri and M.D. Ramanathan. I enjoyed the open-throated style of R.K. Srikantan and the articulate sahitya rendering of Balamurali Krishna. Both could reach out to people with their expressive lyrics,” says Shankar.
He says that Swami Chinmayananda believed ‘Melody gains strength with intermittent pauses’. “My guru Vallabham’s styling too is a gamaka-oriented one with imaginative raga phrases rendered with short subtle pauses to highlight a point,” he explains. “Our stylised modulations transport one to the Mysore Devendrappa and Brinda-Muktha approaches.”
Shankar flaunts a rare D-sruthi. He has sung for hundreds of CDs – from Geeta Govinda to Basavanna Vachanas – brought out by Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan under S. Krishnamurthy’s music direction.
He runs the Shankarabharanam Kala Mandira where he has published three books related to music. He is taking forward the Vallabham musical lineage to his 25 students and through his music lessons on AIR on ‘Amruta Gurukula’.

Why this Joe Biden gaffe matters moreBy Aaron Blake October 6 Follow @aaronblakewp
U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, right, walking near St. Michael's Cathedral in Kiev, Ukraine, Tuesday, April. 22, 2014. Biden warned Russia on Tuesday that "it's time to stop talking and start acting" to reduce tension in Ukraine, offering a show of support for the besieged nation as an international agreement aimed at stemming its ongoing crisis appeared in doubt. (AP Photo/Sergei Chuzavkov)
It has been a really rotten few weeks for Vice President Biden. First came a trio of gaffes that earned him a Worst Week in Washington nod . Then, on Thursday, he suggested that  being vice president is a "bitch."
None of these things, though, compare to something else Biden said in that very same speech Thursday.
Biden was forced to apologize over the weekend to leaders of both Turkey and the United Arab Emirates after suggesting in the speech at Harvard that these two countries and another ally — Saudi Arabia —  were the United States' "biggest problem"  in responding to the Syrian civil war.
“The Turks, who are great friends — I have a great relationship with (Turkish President Recep Tayyip) Erdogan, whom I spend a lot of time with — the Saudis, the Emiratis, etc. What were they doing? They were so determined to take down (Syrian President Bashar) Assad and essentially have a proxy Sunni-Shia war,” Biden said, according to AP.
Biden added: "They poured hundreds of millions of dollars and thousands of tons of weapons into anyone who would fight against Assad — except that the people who were being supplied were al-Nusra and al-Qaeda and the extremist elements of jihadis coming from other parts of the world.”
Biden also said Erdogan admitted to him that Turkey "let too many [foreign fighters] through" into neighboring Syria.
Needless to say, these are some pretty serious allegations. And they were met with some understandably hard feelings from countries who are supposed to be allies. Erdogan swore off his relationship with Biden and called for an apology, and Biden offered one Saturday. Then Biden  apologized to the UAE on Sunday .
This is all very inside baseball — so much so that most Americans probably won't tune in enough to process what just happened. But as Biden's many gaffes go, few are as damaging as this one. And in case anyone thought Biden has a real shot at becoming president in 2016 —  something we've argued for a long time is folly  — this should remind us why that almost definitely won't happen.
Biden's gaffes are a long-running subplot in Washington at this point. And most of them are along the lines of his "bitch" comment or using outdated and/or offensive terminology like "shylocks" and "the Orient."
All of it, though, paints a picture of a guy who can be pretty careless with his words. Sometimes that carelessness seeps into much more serious issues. And few things are as serious as international diplomacy.
To be clear, all of these things hurt Biden to some degree. He has created an image of himself as a sort of un-serious politician — a guy you'd like to have a beer with but wouldn't trust to run your country. And polling bears that out, with  even many Democrats saying they don't think he would make a good president .
But while using offensive terms and even plagiarizing (which sank Biden's 1988 presidential campaign) are bad, alienating the countries the United States depends on for supporting its Middle East mission — something Turkey is still weighing — is quite another. And foreign policy is supposed to be Biden's strong suit.
Biden, who already had very little shot at becoming president in 2016, just showed precisely why that is — and caused the White House a massive headache in the process.

Fox News Sunday turns to racing Teddy Roosevelt for good luckBy Dan Steinberg October 6 Follow @dcsportsbog
(Courtesy Fox)
For the past two weeks, Fox News Sunday has been paying tribute to a Jayson Werth garden gnome as part of its commitment to the home nine.
With the Nats’ season in peril this weekend, Chris Wallace’s program upped the ante.
“As you may know, we’re the official Sunday show of the Washington Nationals in their quest for the World Series,” Wallace said late in Sunday’s program. “Last night they lost 2-1 to the San Francisco Giants in the longest playoff game in history, and they now trail the five-game series two games to none. We’ve been counting on our lucky Jayson Werth garden gnome to help us root for the Nationals, but now, we’re calling in reinforcements. So one of the racing presidents from Nats Park, Teddy, is here today to help us urge on our team. Go Nats!”
 
(Via Fox)
The rest of the panel included Brit Hume, George Will, Juan Williams, and the AP’s Julie Pace, none of whom presumably raced Teddy.
Incidentally, if my math is correct, racing Teddy is now 6-0 during postseason presidents races, having gone 2-0 during Saturday night’s unprecedented postseason double-header. The Nats, on the other hand, are now 1-4 during playoff games in which Teddy has won a presidents race.
Elsewhere, the New York Times noted that Saturday’s crowd included former White House chief of staff Andrew Card, former Fed chairman Ben Bernanke, NBC’s Chuck Todd, Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer and majority leader Kevin MCcarthy. Also, Todd’s new Meet the Press set includes a Werth garden gnome.

The Princess Bride might be made into a musical  and other gems from a Cary Elwes AMABy Sarah Kaplan October 6 Follow @sarahkaplan48
The wonderful thing about cult classics — for fans and for publishing companies — is that they can be rehashed endlessly without going stale.
At least, that’s the notion behind actor Cary Elwes’ memoir “As You Wish: Inconceivable Tales from the Making of The Princess Bride,” which comes out this month, nearly 30 years after the original film was released.
In a  Reddit AMA  pegged to publication of his book, the real-life Elwes proved himself as charming as the fictional hero Westley, whom he played. He thanked fans for their questions, deflected praise to his co-stars and confessed that his daughter is his biggest weakness. He also — reportedly — responded to questions in his underwear.
We wish.
Elwes’ question-and-answer session was less quotable than the movie he’s most famous for, but it still held some fun “Princess Bride” tidbits. Here are five of the best:
1. Andre the Giant, who played Fezzik, was a threat to the well being of nearly everyone on set (in the best possible way).
Not only could the 7-foot-4, 500 pound actor consume 103 beers in one sitting, getting the rest of the cast drunk in their effort to keep up, but he also inadvertently got Elwes injured. Andre talked Elwes into driving the all-terrain vehicle he’d been using to get around the set, and Elwes swiftly crashed the car and broke his toe (right before filming the sword fight scene with Mandy Patinkin, no less).
2. Elwes has a poor opinion of other actors. 
Q: What is your opinion on the existence of R.O.U.S.’s?
A: I could spot ‘em from a mile away! There’s plenty in Hollywood.
3. Elwes remembers nearly every fan he meets. (Or at least, he’ll say he recalls them for their benefit). 
“You’re more than welcome, I remember meeting you,” he told a commenter who had talked with him about lacking confidence at ComicCon. Elwes added that he uses meditation, a journal and exercise to deal with his self esteem issues. 
4. There is a girl somewhere who has a tattoo of Elwes’ signature:
Apparently the fan had the words “As you wish” inked onto her neck and wanted Elwes to sign it so she could have his autograph added to the tattoo.
“Initially I hesitated but her mother insisted,” Elwes wrote. 
5. “The Princess Bride” might be made into a musical. 
No details, except that “it’s a go on Broadway,” according to Ewles.

Victims of Colombias conflict fight to be recognized as suchVictims deserve recognition. (REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini)

October 6, 2014
More than 6.5 million people have registered as victims of the armed conflict in Colombia. As peace talks in Havana between FARC rebels and the government seeks to address victims’ rights, a surprising issue has emerged.
Who is recognized as a victim?
Last month, FARC published a blogpost on its website claiming that Clara Rojas , a Colombian politician, was not a victim. Rojas was kidnapped by the FARC in 2002 and was held captive for six years in the jungle, where she bore a child by one of the guards (whom she decided to have a consensual relationship with). Rojas was campaign manager for presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt, whom she was accompanying at the time of the kidnapping.
“When Ingrid was captured by the FARC, the others were told they could leave. Clara said she had made the decision to stay with Ingrid. Anything that happened to Ingrid, would have to happen to her, too, she said”, reads the blogpost, purportedly written by “Diana” a guerrilla fighter who met Clara during her captivity.
The blogpost spurred a media outcry in Colombia, not only because it implied that Rojas had brought it upon herself to be kidnapped, but also because of passages in the guerrilla’s narrative that ridiculed Rojas and other hostages in her group.
“To use the private lives of the hostages as a political weapon is too vile,” wrote Colombian journalist Marta Ruiz in her opinion column in Semana, a prominent political weekly magazine.
Rojas’s story illustrates the difficulties of dealing with the subject of victims during peace negotiations. Thus far, rural development policy, political participation and illicit drugs have been points already discussed in Havana, while the topic of victims, the end of the armed conflict, and the implementation of the agreements remain pending in the agenda. The third of five delegations of victims who will give testimonies at the negotiation table arrived Thursday in Havana.
No talks with the FARC have ever gone so far as the ones held in Havana today. Furthermore, a weary Colombian population would like to see an end to a decades-long conflict. The current president, Juan Manuel Santos, was reelected this year, partly with the expectation that his government will bring an end to the conflict between the Colombian government and the FARC.
President Santos was in New York for the 69th Session of the UN General Assembly. One of the topics of his address, Sept. 23 , was peace and preparing a post-conflict Colombia.
Meanwhile in Havana, negotiators continue to address the issue of the reparation of victims and continue meeting people identified as such. A total of 60 are expected to travel. That’s less than one out of 100,000 registered victims of the armed conflict.

Brazils markets need to relax  Rousseff isnt out yetBrian Browdie
October 6, 2014
Financial markets cheered first-round results of Brazil’s presidential election, but the fate of the country’s economy, which entered recession in the second quarter , remains uncertain.
The results of Sunday’s vote mean that incumbent Dilma Rousseff will face off against the pro-business senator Aecio Neves in a runoff slated for October 26. Rousseff garnered 42% of votes cast, followed by Neves, who had 34%. Neves’ better-than-expected performance helped lift Brazil’s real the most since August 2013  Monday. Brazil’s equity markets also surged .

Tap image to zoom
Still, Neves—who has touted his ability to restore economic growth—faces an uphill battle in the second-round matchup. He must win support from voters who sided with Marina Silva, a socialist candidate who trailed Rousseff and Neves with 21% of votes in the first round of the election.
“A problem Neves faces is the ability of Dilma’s campaign to portray him as a rich playboy, out of touch with the needs of the average Brazilian,” writes Craig Botham, an analyst with Schroders, in a research note. “This makes it doubtful whether Silva supporters will automatically transfer their support.”
The market reaction to the prospect of political change comes amid economic sluggishness and popular discontent over rising living costs and what critics say has been misplaced spending priorities . But the reactions of investors might be overly optimistic about the true prospects for a change. “It remains to be seen whether Marina will formally endorse Neves,” adds Botham. “Without this, it is difficult to foresee his victory.”

Protests pinch HK s luxury districtWill Hong Kong's luxury district get pinched by protests?
By Kathryn Vasel   @KathrynVasel October 2, 2014: 4:40 PM ET
 
Protests spread to Hong Kong's luxury district
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
Hong Kong's Umbrella Revolution could take a toll on Chinese luxury spending.
Peaceful pro-democracy protests are taking place throughout Hong Kong, including in the government and financial districts and on Canton Road, a popular luxury shopping district.
The Occupy Central movement coincides with China's celebration of Golden Week, a national holiday that typically brings thousands of mainland tourists to Hong Kong. Last year, 1.2 million tourists flocked to the region during the holiday, according to the BBC.
Golden Week brings a lot of travel and spending with restaurants and retailers experiencing a big boon, explained David Dollar, senior fellow at the China Center at the Brookings Institution. This year's demonstrations will have a short-term effect on the economy, he said. "Think of it like a bad-weather event. There will be less shoppers and spending, but when it's over it will bounce back. The people who can afford to come to shop in Hong Kong are able to do it another time."
Related: Hong Kong protesters are so freaking nice
One tourist told CNN International's Kristie Lu Stout that, "it's OK to demonstrate, but you should be considerate of the general public." Another worried that "this will make people feel that Hong Kong is inconvenient."
CNN's Lu Stout reports that while activists are present on Canton Road, which is home to luxury heavyweights, Fendi, Burberry, Chanel and Louis Vuitton, they aren't blocking access to the stores.
Chinese tourism is a major component to Hong Kong's economy and Chinese consumer spending accounted for one-third of total retail sales in the region last year, said Ling-Wei Chung, principal economist at IHS. "Chinese tourists spend a lot of time and money in Hong Kong—especially on luxury goods, including jewelry and watches, accounting for one-fifth of total sales. If the tourists aren't spending on luxury items, that could hurt Hong Kong's economy"
The demonstrations gave one visitor to Hong Kong pause, reports CNN Correspondent Will Ripley: "I'm afraid if we go in, we won't be able to get out again because the traffic is so jammed up."

“My entire office is exposed to the world,” says Chaitanya Prasad, not displaying the strain of his high profile office.
As Controller General, he heads the office that issues patents, designs and trademarks, besides being the registrar of geographical indications that protects products identified with a region, like the Darjeeling Tea or Pochampally Ikat.
Compulsory licence
The Patent Controller General’s office stands silent and tall at Antop Hill, on the eastern fringes of the island city Mumbai — far from the acrimonious discussions that follow some of its decisions.
Not only do these decisions trigger local debates between trade and civil society, but at times, they take the form of full-fledged trade standoffs with countries, as is being witnessed between India and the US. In fact, Prasad took charge on one such day in March 2012, when India issued its first compulsory licence on Nexavar, an advanced kidney cancer drug from Bayer.
The CL issued to Natco Pharma allowed the Hyderabad-based company to make its version of the drug at 97 per cent less than the innovator-drug’s price on the payment of royalty. The decision still causes much heartburn for several foreign trade lobbies.
Monopoly factor
Despite the debates on decisions taken by his office, Prasad says his efforts are directed at making the Patent Office less intimidating and more accessible to customers.
Prasad is of the opinion that the 10 per cent price discount on online filings over manual ones is paving the way for round-the-clock filing by individuals and small businesses.
Besides facilitating transparency, the initiative also weeds out scope for corruption and errors that could creep in while digitising manual documents, he explains. Even status updates on patent filings are available, he adds.
Patents grant an innovator 20 years of exclusivity to make and market a product. But, when the product is a medicine, public health workers fear such monopolies could make the medicine more expensive for patients.
Balance is imperative
People can also check the “working of a patent” for CL opportunities, Prasad explains. Companies are required to “work” their patents and service the local market.
Failing this, a third party could seek a CL from the Patent Controller to make the same drug. And this was pretty much how the first CL was issued on Bayer’s Nexavar. “We realise IPR (Intellectual Property Rights) are beneficial for innovation, but there needs to be a balance between the rights of an innovator and a company with the rights of the citizen,” says Prasad.
Twenty per cent of the disease burden is in India and the country needs to think about that, he adds.
Responding to demands on his office to provide more information, he counters that the amount of information on the Web site was like no other in the country. But in certain cases, “we are duty bound by the law to take a fee,” he explains.
International search
The Indian Patent Office is also taking global strides as an International Searching Authority (ISA) and International Preliminary Examining Authority (IPEA) under the Patent Cooperation Treaty.
India is one of 17 countries recognised as an ISA-IPEA and its Patent Office can provide citizens of any country good quality International Search Reports (ISR) at reduced prices, he says.
Iran has already notified India as one of the ISA/IPEAs to which its citizens can send their search requests, he said, adding that they have met Iranian representatives in Geneva to sort out any problems that their citizens may have. The Patent Office has already issued over 200 ISRs for Indian citizens as well.
Back home though, about 43,000 patent applications have been filed up to March 2014. The scale continues to tip in favour of foreign applicants.
Research needs to be encouraged at the school level, says the Patent Controller, where children are taught to question, hypothesise and analyse. Only then would the country be able to promote innovations that stem from India, he concludes, on an optimistic note.

Capital case for legible prescriptionsCapital case for legible prescriptions
M Somasekhar/ G Naga Sridhar
Tweet
The Government is all set to make it mandatory for doctors to write their prescriptions in capital letters
A doctor’s prescription, it is said, is best understood by the neighbourhood chemist, but times are changing. ‘Sorry, this is illegible. It seems to be some antibiotic drug,’’ V Ramesh, a Hyderabad-based businessman, was told by a popular pharmacy.
The hand-written prescription with the name of the medicine and its dosages, was no more than illegible jottings. This is an experience not unfamiliar to consumers across the country.
Block letters
But this may soon become a practice of the past. The Government is all set to make it mandatory for doctors to write their prescriptions in capital letters. A draft to this effect has already been sent by the Medical Council of India (MCI) to the Government.
“The process is on and we expect this to be issued very soon,” said a senior official with the MCI’s ethics section. Pharmacists agree that there is a serious problem with longhand prescriptions, “Actually, we are de-coding agents. Most of our sales staff dread reading the prescriptions,” says A Rambabu, who runs Akunuri Medicals in Hyderabad.
Nalgonda case
In fact, it is a pharmacist from Nalgonda in Telangana, Chilukuri Paramathma, who is largely behind the imminent change, along with some NGOs.
He doggedly pursued the matter, compiled a list of over 100 pairs of drugs, which sounded similar and were spelt differently by a single letter, but were used for different ailments.
He then followed this up with the State medical organisations, MCI, and several key authorities under the Health Ministry, including the regulatory, Drug Controller General of India.
After four years of pursuit, he filed a PIL in the Andhra Pradesh High Court. And earlier this year, a two-member Bench of the Court comprising Chief Justice Kalyan Jyothi Sengupta and Justice Sanjay Kumar issued directions to the MCI to take appropriate steps.
Ban plea
The pharmacist’s plea was to ban the running hand-writing style in prescriptions, as pharmacists were unable to understand them and ended up dispensing the wrong medicines. For instance, Microgest prescribed for a woman to help with her pregnancy, was read by the pharmacist as Misoprest, which can cause an abortion.
MCI prescribes
The Centre’s approval is awaited on the MCI’s draft directing doctors to prescribe in capital letters. It will become mandatory for doctors, once the Centre gives its nod.
Dr Mandeep Singh, Apollo Hospitals Director (Medical Services), points out that all prescriptions for its in-patients are in typed formats. “(In the) next six months, we aim to extend this to out-patients as well,” he added.
But in smaller establishments run by neighbourhood doctors, it may be easier to opt for a less expensive change in habit — from running handwriting to all-caps!

October: Wear the pink ribbonTweet
The Breast Cancer Awareness Month is marked across the world every October, to increase awareness on early detection and treatment as well as palliative care of this disease, says WHO.
There are 1.38 million new cases and 4,58,000 deaths from breast cancer each year (IARC Globocan, 2008). Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide. In low- and middle-income countries, there have been rising incidence due to increase in life expectancy, urbanisation and adoption of western lifestyles, the WHO said. Early detection remains the cornerstone of breast cancer control. With adequate diagnosis and treatment after that, there is a good chance of cure.

TechNexus unveils publishing  events  research initiativeWhy Chicago's TechNexus has ventured into the book-publishing business
TechNexus used a book-signing party Thursday night to quietly roll out its new Innovation Networks initiative.
TechNexus managing director Jonathan Baskin said Innovation Networks will emphasize three areas — book publishing, events and research — and that it aims to each year publish three to five books that feature a business-tech focus.
Thursday’s event celebrated the initiative’s first book: “Billion Dollar Apps: How to Find and Implement a Winning Mobile Strategy,” by Alex Bratton, CEO of Lisle-based Lextech.

Baskin said Innovation Networks hopes to drive the conversation on collaborative innovation and ultimately to build business for TechNexus, which specializes in bringing startups and large corporations together.
“We make money when big companies get answers to their problems by working with tech startups,” Baskin said.
Innovation Networks published Bratton’s book months ago, but Baskin said TechNexus waited until this week to conduct an event because officials wanted to demonstrate results. He declined to discuss sales numbers but said they are happy about the book’s performance.
Baskin said Innovation Networks also will feature a series of events in which startup entrepreneurs will collaborate with innovators at large companies and with members of the venture capital community. The initiative also will survey companies in the TechNexus network, generate industry-specific research and publish the results, he said.
“We’re trying to improve the quality of the discussion,” Baskin said.

Can Seattle Afford to Pay a Premium Minimum Wagereddit
CEO Nick Hanauer sees the possible approach of a modern Shay's Rebellion : Farmers with pitchforks marching on investment bankers and plutocrats.  If social unrest is to be avoided, Hanauer believes the top 1/100th of one percent must show greater political accountability for the design of the economic system and for laws that foster increased inequality.  After all, lobbyists working for financial elites have helped tilt the playing field.
During the last several decades corporate profits have expanded remarkably. These gains reflect productivity increases acquired through technological advances, improvements in business efficiency and an "open society" approach to market development.  Multi-national businesses engaged in global trade have benefitted from the growth of low-wage work forces in developing countries, lower net corporate taxes relative to profits, lower interest rates on corporate bonds, and larger markets across which to spread overhead.  By most measures this combination has produced a stunningly profitable era for big business, high finance, top corporate management, and mega-investors.
During the last 35 years the top 12,000 richest families in the U.S. have pulled away from the top 1.2 million households (the top one percent), while the top one percent have left the bottom 80 percent in the dust -- median U.S. household income hovering around $52,000 in 2013.  (Even at the 90th percentile , annual household income remained under $150,000 in 2012.)  Theoretically and rhetorically, democratic capitalism is not supposed to produce this effect.  The core political idea in democratic republicanism is that the vast majority have sufficient political wherewithal to hold their own in competition for resources, opportunities, and prosperity.  Unfortunately, the public's shrinking share of the American apply pie contradicts this expectation.
Nick Hanauer is concerned that widening gaps in income and wealth bode poorly for the sustainable prosperity of elites like himself.  Consequently, he is working tirelessly for "middle-out"economic policies that boost the capacity of consumers to spend, thus funneling a larger net share of the economic pie to the bottom 90 percent. Since middle and working class families spend a far greater portion of their total income than do elites, sustainable economic stimulus comes from looking out for consumers, not just pumping easy money for investment banks.
Recently, Nick Hanauer was influential in helping the Seattle City Council approve a plan to increase the minimum wage within the city's jurisdiction to $15 an hour by 2018 -- potentially the highest minimum wage in the U.S.  This move raises the question of whether Seattle is becoming the new Paris of the Pacific: a place that can sustain a higher wage than most parts of the country because of its enviable circumstances.  It also raises questions about the scalability of Seattle's strategy -- questions that other advantaged cities are entertaining as well.
No one thinks Seattle is a typical American city.  The Seattle metro area is rich with nationally important corporations well-positioned in their business sectors: corporations such as Microsoft, Amazon, Weyerhauser, Quest, Costco, Paccar, Starbucks, Nordstrom and Seattle's high-pay, semi-oligopolistic employment giant, Boeing (with its headquarters now in Chicago).  Geographically speaking, Seattle dominates one of the most attractive and unique port locations in America.  With its infrastructure of globally dynamic businesses, major companies from around the world cannot afford to ignore Seattle, even if the costs of doing business there climb.
Forbes rates Seattle's tech job growth as number one in the nation. Inc.com lists over sixty companies in the Seattle metro area with a three-year revenue growth over 100 percent, plus dozens of smaller internet, software and STEM companies with considerable potential.  Instructively, the Lewis Mumford Center for Comparative Urban and Regional Research ranks the Seattle metro area number three in the nation when combining the five competitive metrics of "knowledge jobs," globalism, economic dynamism, innovative capacity and the digitization of the local economy.
Once the area's business synergies are evaluated it becomes evident that Seattle can afford to pay premium wages because its companies have cultivated national and worldwide market advantages that sustain premium pricing or competitive advantages in products and services.  Thus, the economic encumbrance upon local residents is relatively light if Seattle moves to a $15 an hour minimum wage.  Visitors from across the nation and around the world (many traveling at the expense of their employers), will not be deterred but will fill the coffers of Seattle area businesses all the faster.  Meanwhile, the social services burden of caring for the urban area's underemployed will decline, as food service, hospitality, retail and other low wage sectors receive a larger subsidy from outsiders.
Since most of the manufactured goods that "Seattleites" buy are not manufactured in Seattle, the cost-of-living impact of raising the minimum wage is minimal upon metropolitan residents, especially when Seattle's superior household income level is taken into consideration.
Additionally, with so many business-hub communities surrounding Seattle (more than a dozen not counting bedroom communities), residents desiring low-cost local services do not have to drive far to find businesses not constrained by the new minimum wage.
In sum, Seattle, like several dozen other advantaged U.S. cities, can raise its minimum wage, battle income inequality locally, and prosper. The larger question is what happens when Seattle's move goes viral?

Kevin Metheny  former WGN-AM 720 boss and "Pig Virus" to Howard Stern  dead at 60Kevin Metheny, onetime WGN-AM chief, dies

Kevin Metheny, 1954-2014: 'one of the major talk radio programmers of the modern era'
When Kevin Metheny became program director of WGN-AM 720 in 2008, he brought with him a lengthy resume, a reputation for being controversial and a clear mission — shake up programming at a Chicago radio institution and grow its audience.
The rebuilding process was, by most accounts, a failure, with key personalities exiting the station amid growing resentment from some longtime listeners. Mr. Metheny's rocky tenure at WGN was over in less than two years.
But the well-traveled program director, dubbed "Pig Virus" by shock jock Howard Stern, rebounded with radio giant Cumulus Media, first as program director of WJR-AM in Detroit and more recently as operations manager for KGO-AM and KSFO-AM in San Francisco, where he started work this summer.

Resilient throughout his four-decade career, Mr. Metheny, 60, died Friday, Oct. 3, apparently of a heart attack, according to reports.
"He was not afraid to put his fingerprint on a station or on a personality," said Michael Harrison, publisher of Talkers magazine, a radio trade publication. "Sometimes it was for good and sometimes it didn't always work out that well. But he was undoubtedly one of the major talk radio programmers of the modern era."
News of Mr. Metheny's death was first reported by AllAccess.com, a radio industry website.

"Kevin Metheny's sudden passing (Friday) afternoon is a devastating personal and professional loss for his broadcasting family at Cumulus, and for the entire radio industry," John Dickey, vice president of Cumulus Media, said in a statement. "Kevin was a legendary broadcasting talent who touched many lives in his remarkable 44-year career, and whose successes made an indelible mark on radio."
Born into a radio family — he was the son of broadcaster Terrell Metheny — Mr. Metheny started his own radio career in Oklahoma. His travels in the radio industry would end up taking him to stations in Ohio, New York, Florida, Minnesota, Maryland, Georgia, Texas and South Carolina. In addition to his tenure at WGN-AM, he listed on his LinkedIn resume an earlier stint at WEFM in Chicago.
Mr. Metheny also was involved in programming and production for MTV and VH1 between 1984 and 1986.
Nice to see the Tribune finally pulled down the insulting, poorly-written ANONYMOUS "obituary" that ran for three days calling this guy "pig vomit" in front of his grieving children. Stay classy, Tribune !

He first made a name for himself, however, as program director at WNBC-AM in New York from 1980 to 1984. There Mr. Metheny was charged with guiding ascending radio star Howard Stern, who openly bristled under his management. Stern ridiculed his boss, calling him "Pig Virus" on the air and in his best-selling book "Private Parts," and then caricaturing him as part of a composite program director named "Pig Vomit" in the movie version of his memoirs.
One area of contention was Mr. Metheny's insistence that Stern and other on-air personalities emphasize the "N" when delivering the WNBC call letters. Harrison said the idea was a deceptively innovative way to differentiate WNBC from rival WABC for listeners. Mr. Metheny was, in essence, rebranding and positioning the station through one simple letter.
Mr. Metheny was hired as program director at WGN-AM in December 2008, one week after its parent company, Chicago-based Tribune Co., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. He was brought to the station by Randy Michaels, a former radio executive who rose to become CEO of Tribune Co. during the protracted bankruptcy.
"It's an honor to join the leadership of an American treasure like WGN Radio," Metheny said in a statement at the time of his hiring. For some critics, his tenure all but buried the station.
Mr. Metheny's attempts to advise long-time WGN-AM midday hosts Kathy O'Malley and Judy Markey on the kind of show he wanted from them ultimately resulted in their sudden exit from the station in May 2009.
Other changes on Mr. Metheny's watch included the controversial hire of convicted former Chicago City Clerk Jim Laski, a radio novice, as well as bringing in Greg Jarrett from San Francisco to handle morning drive and Mike McConnell from Cincinnati for midmornings.
Mr. Metheny also hired veteran Chicago radio personality Garry Meier for afternoon drive. He moved John Williams in and out a variety of daytime slots. And he opted not to renew the contract of midday host Steve Cochran, who had been in line to succeed the retiring Spike O'Dell in the station's coveted morning slot until he failed to agree to terms on a new deal just before Mr. Metheny's arrival in 2008.
"Our plan may not have been the most elegantly or artfully executed of all possible plans, but we actually understand what it is we think we are trying to do and why we think we're trying to do it," Mr. Metheny told the Tribune in 2010.
Mr. Metheny left WGN-AM on the heels of the departure of Michaels, who was forced to resign as Tribune Co. CEO in October 2010.
Harrison said that while the changes at WGN rightly came under much criticism from listeners and industry insiders alike, Mr. Metheny was not necessarily the author of the plan.
"He was basically doing the job that he was hired to do," Harrison said. "He didn't really fail; the project failed. If he failed, he wouldn't have popped up again as program director of WJR or as the operation manager for Cumulus in San Francisco."
Harrison said he thought Mr. Metheny was already gaining traction in turning around the struggling San Francisco stations for Cumulus Media, the largest pure-play radio company in the U.S. with some 525 stations in 110 cities. That he maintained their confidence, and his own, despite so many ups and downs may be his true radio legacy.
"His reputation and accomplishments are simply unparalleled and we are grateful for having had the opportunity to work with him as (program director) of WJR in Detroit and most recently, as operations manager of KGO and KSFO in San Francisco," Dickey said. "His Cumulus family extends our deepest sympathies to Kevin's loved ones. We will miss him profoundly."
Mr. Metheny is survived by two daughters.

Obama visits a microcosm of the manufacturing economyBy Katie Zezima October 5 Follow @katiezez
President Obama speaks at Millennium Steel Service in Princeton, Ind., on Oct. 3 to discuss the economy as part of Manufacturing Day.
PRINCETON, Ind. – President Obama came to a steel plant here Friday, touting the nation’s manufacturing economy to a crowd of workers and others and celebrating jobs numbers that show the nation’s economy is getting back on track.
The demise of America’s manufacturing sector has been well-documented over the past few decades, from plant closings and job losses across the nation to the detrimental impact it has had on towns and cities here in the Rust Belt and beyond.
But manufacturing is back – just not in the way most people probably imagined. And southwest Indiana is a microcosm of what’s going on around the country.
“In some ways, American manufacturing is powering the American recovery,” Obama said here.
Manufacturing is big business in Indiana, and this corner of the state, where fields of corn and soybeans stretch as far as the eye can see, is no exception. The sector makes up about 15 percent of the jobs in the region, said Gale Blalock, a professor of economics at the University of Evansville. The area is anchored by Evansville, a city of 120,000 on the Ohio River.
The Evansville region has adapted rather quickly to the changes, said Blalock and Greg Wathen, president and chief executive of the Economic Development Coalition of Southwest Indiana. The region illustrates the new manufacturing economy that Obama holds up when he speaks about the economy – one driven by a highly skilled, tech-savvy workforce whose jobs pay far more than those a generation ago.
“It’s not the manufacturing my mother and father did. It’s a whole other world,” Wathen said.
That world involves fewer jobs – but ones that pay more. The sector has added 700,000 jobs since the beginning of the Obama administration, said Aric Newhouse, senior vice president for policy and government relations at the National Association of Manufacturers. Despite that, the sector is down 1.7 million jobs since the start of the recession, he said.
Evansville was once home to a bustling Whirlpool plant that employed nearly 10,000 people in the early 1970s. It was such an economic driver that it was labeled “the refrigerator capital of the world.” College football teams played each year in the Refrigerator Bowl here.
Whirlpool shut down production in 2010, shipping the jobs to Mexico, and closed a remaining product development center in 2012.
Despite the closing of the plant, economists here said the region weathered the recession rather well, because the jobs that did come in are high-paying.
Toyota, which has a plant across the street from Millennium Steel here, recently announced a production increase – a $100 million investment that will bring in 300 skilled jobs.
The shift is noticeable for many older workers – many of the employees who worked at the Whirlpool plant are older and now collecting Social Security, Blalock said.
But those new jobs come with higher wages than a previous generation knew. The average salary for a manufacturing worker nationwide is $77,000, according to the Manufacturing Association; some of the product development jobs pay more than $100,000, Blalock said.
As Obama said Friday, there is a whole new landscape.
“When we think about manufacturing, we always think about the traditional guy with the hard hat and the glasses, and there are sparks flying and it’s noisy. These days you go into a manufacturing plant like this one, first of all, it’s clean, it’s quiet, and so much of it is running on computers and automation and new systems,” he said.

Shift Jayalalithaa to Tamil Nadu: Deve GowdaPeople gathered near a circle leading to Parappana Agrahara Central Prison where Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa had been jailed after being convicted in the disproportionate assets case.
Bangalore, Oct 4:  
Former Prime Minister H D Deve Gowda today suggested that AIADMK supremo Jayalalithaa, lodged at Parappana Agrahara prison here after being convicted in an illegal assets case, be shifted to Tamil Nadu as it was a burden for the state to manage the large number of protestors and also maintain law and order.
“I only appeal to the state government... let the former chief minister (Jayalalithaa) be transferred to Tamil Nadu,” he said.
“...every day a huge number of people are coming here and protesting, every day we have to manage them by deploying special police force, along with maintaining law and order here... why should we take this burden?”
“Whether bail is given or not, we have nothing to do with it. It is a judicial matter....why do we want this?” he asked.
A special court here had on September 27 convicted Jayalalithaa and sentenced her to four years in prison, besides imposing a Rs 100 crore fine on her.
Gowda also said the court was specially appointed for this case and cannot give bail now.
“Let them go and appeal in whichever court they want... What do we have do with it?”
Jayalalithaa’s plea for immediate bail in the case and suspension of the four-year sentence will come up in the Karnataka High Court on Oct 7.

Child star comes of ageIndia A team player Unmukt Chand in action during a warm up match against West Indies in Mumbai on Sunday. (Source: PTI)
Written by Bharat Sundaresan | Mumbai | Posted: October 6, 2014 1:39 am | Updated: October 6, 2014 6:47 pm
You could be pardoned if you thought Unmukt Chand would have played for India already by now. After all, the last two U-19 captains before him to have led the nation to Junior World Cup glory — Mohammad Kaif and Virat Kohli — didn’t have to wait too long for their boys-to-men transformation. And to boot, Indian cricket had wasted no time in anointing the opener as the poster-boy of its future.
For many, Chand was the next Kohli. That was 2012. In the following two years, Chand remained a child star, waiting for the big break on the big stage.
As he waited, Chand’s stock took a massive dive. To the extent that some had even raised eyebrows on his selection to the India A squad to face the touring West Indians. Going into the two matches, there were few eyes on Chand, even with the entire gamut of the national selection committee in audience. But if he tickled their interest just a tad with a breezy unbeaten 79 at Brabourne Stadium on Friday, he must have gotten their complete attention at the Wankhede Stadium on Sunday with an enterprising 111-ball 101, a knock that ensured that the West Indians leave Mumbai with little gains and two losses against the second-string Indian side.
The only resistance from the Caribbean side came in the form of Denesh Ramdin, someone who would knew what Chand has gone through in his nascent career so far.
Two of a kind
Ramdin too had captained the West Indies at the U-19 World Cup. He too had been touted as a future star from the moment he played competitive cricket. But for more than a decade, he had remained the prodigal son of West Indian cricket. The one they expected to take world cricket by storm. But not only did he fail to live up to his early hype, the Trinidadian’s innate genius came to the fore more in flashes than in bursts.
Like it did at Wankhede under the lights. When Ramdin walked to bat, his team looked well set for another humiliating collapse and a comprehensive hammering. But then he swept and pulled, and cut and glanced his way to three-figures while dragging the West Indian innings from disarray to the brink of an unlikely win. Along the way, he also provided a blueprint for his teammates in the dressing-room on how to tackle spin bowling by using his feet immaculately and dealing with the likes of Karn Sharma and Parvez Rasool with an unabashedly attacking intent.
Ramdin’s up-and-down career had seen an unprecedented surge in the last 12 months, culminating with him being named as the West Indian captain for Tests earlier this year. At the same time, the wiry wicket-keeper had also finally come of age in the limited-overs formats, establishing a place in the middle-order continued…
Often he flashed at those outside his off-stump and kept the slip cordon interested. But he survived

In pictures: A temple in Andhra where devotees go to kill or be killedComments
There is a temple in Andhra Pradesh where devotees go all equipped to kill or be killed. Every Dussehra night, the Devaragattu temple in Kurnool district of Andhra Pradesh witnesses frenzy where hundreds of men wielding long sticks (lathis) hit each other on heads.
The event, called Banni festival, at the temple located near the Andhra-Karnataka border, draws people from both states in huge numbers. The ritual takes place at midnight when the procession idols of the ruling deities Malamma (Parvati) and Malleshwara Swamy (Shiva) are brought down the hill temple at Neraneki.
Men, mostly farmers, do not budge even as their white shirts are drenched red with blood and the “victory parade” to commemorate the killing of a demon by Mala-Malleshwara continues till the break of dawn.

Medical teams are deployed and doctors ready to stitch heads but many just smear turmeric on the wound and go about the business.
Temple authorities refute any suggestion of violence in the whole episode.
“It is like dandiya only that we use large sticks. Devotees are charged at that time and in the swirling of the sticks some get hurt,” Ramkumar Shastri, a priest at the temple tells HT. “In olden days, it used to be axes, spears etc.”
The ritual in the region once under the Vijayanagara Empire is said to be centuries old and according to a local police official, has one hundred years of recorded history.

The records though do not show many deaths. According to the district police 113 were injured in 2012, 34 in 2013. On Friday night, 56 were injured. A man was killed in 2006 but police say it was a revenge killing committed with the ritual as a cover-up.
Kurnool SP Ake Ravikrishna says that they conduct awareness camps, clampdown on arrack sale and bind over the anti-social elements but on the Dussehra night, about 1,000 police personnel at the venue are mostly limited to the audience as the sentiments and tempers run high.
Here are some more pictures from the festival:

Indian-origin Briton on trial for wife s murder in Cape Town pleads  not guiltyprint
In this April, 8, 2014 file photo, British businessman Shrien Dewani arrives at the airport in Cape Town, South Africa. (AP photo)
British millionaire Shrien Dewani on Monday pleaded not guilty to charges of murdering his young bride while on honeymoon in Cape Town as his long-awaited trial got under way.
Speaking from the dock, Dewani, dressed in a dark suit and tie, glanced nervously around court and said he was "not guilty" of charges of murder, kidnapping and obstructing justice.

The prosecution is expected to argue that Dewani is a gay man who was so desperate to escape an arranged marriage that he hired hitmen to kill his bride on their Cape Town honeymoon.
In a statement read by defence layer Francois van Zyl, Dewani admitted he was bisexual, but said he was "instantly physically attracted" to Swedish-born bride Anni (nee Hindocha), who was shot dead on November 13, 2010, aged 28.
"I've had sexual interaction with both males and females. I consider myself bisexual," Dewani's statement said.
Businessman Dewani finally appeared in court after losing a three-year extradition fight in Britain and was ruled mentally fit to stand trial.
He was sent back to South Africa in April to answer charges.
He claims that he and his bride were hijacked at gunpoint as they drove through Cape Town's impoverished Gugulethu township in a taxi.
Dewani escaped unharmed, but his wife's body was found in the abandoned car the next day.
Local media have reported that one of the main witnesses for the prosecution will be a sado-masochism "master" from Britain who will claim that Dewani paid him for sex.
Gay prostitute Leopold Leisser is said to have claimed in a statement to British police that Dewani had told him he was getting married to a "lovely girl", but he needed "to find a way out of it".
The three South Africans have been tried and convicted and are serving jail sentences of between 18 years and life for their role in Anni Dewani's death.
Taxi driver Zola Tongo admitted guilt in a plea bargain along with another man, Mziwamadoda Qwabe. The two were sentenced to 18 and 25 years in prison respectively.

A third man, Xolile Mngeni, was later found guilty of firing the shot that killed Anni Dewani and was sentenced to life imprisonment.
Tongo's claim that Shrien Dewani had offered him 15,000 rand ($1,300, 1,000 euros) to have Anni killed is expected to play a key role in the prosecution's arguments.
The case has angered many in South Africa who accuse Dewani of callously using the country's reputation for violent crime to murder his wife in the belief that he would get away with it.
   
Justice and closure
Anni's family said it has been "a period of torture" since her death.
"All I ask for is the full story and justice," Anni's father Vinod Hindocha told reporters in Cape Town on Sunday.
Another family member, Anni's uncle Ashok Hindocha, said they hoped the trial would help them get on with their lives.
"We are not going to get Anni back... but we need to know the truth so we can move on," he told a news conference.
Dewani fought a long legal battle to avoid being extradited from Britain to South Africa, claiming he had mental health problems, including depression and post-traumatic stress.
But an assessment by South African psychiatric experts found he was "not mentally ill" and fit to stand trial.
Both Dewani and Anni are of Indian origin, from what news reports have described as devout Hindu families.
Anni's cousin Sneha Hindocha, in a statement cited by South Africa's The Sunday Independent, chronicles a rocky 17-month courtship during which Anni repeatedly felt sexually rejected by Dewani.
The defence is likely to paint a picture of a happy newlywed couple.
The trial is set to run into December.

Warner inspires Australia to easy winAggressive southpaw David Warner led Australia's assault (Source: AP)
Reuters | Dubai | Posted: October 6, 2014 3:14 pm
Three debutant bowlers and a typically rampaging innings from David Warner helped Australia coast to a six-wicket victory over Pakistan in their sole Twenty20 international in Dubai on Sunday.
The win meant Aaron Finch began his stint as T20 captain in style to boost the tourists ahead of the three-match one-day series starting on Tuesday.
Debutants Cameron Boyce, Kane Richardson and Sean Abbott all took wickets in their first overs to restrict Pakistan to 96-9 under the lights. Boyce ended up with two for 10 while stalwart Glenn Maxwell picked up three for 13.
Warner then led the assault on the easily gettable total, reaching his fifty by smashing a switch-hit six. He finished on 53 not out off 39 balls as Australia made their target in 14 overs.

Stop praising Modi  Kerala Cong tells Shashi Tharoor | Support not endorsement: TharoorNarendra Modi
(Responding to Modi's call, Tharoor had…)
THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The Congress in Kerala today warned Shashi Tharoor against praising Prime Minister Narendra Modi but the former Union Minister set the record straight holding that he is a "proud Congressman" and had not even remotely endorsed the "Hindutva agenda" of the BJP.
Signalling that disciplinary action would be contemplated against Tharoor if he kept on lauding Modi's initiatives, KPCC Vice President M M Hassan said, "As a first step, we are asking him to stop praising Modi as his stance went totally against the Congress' ideals."
Expressing strong displeasure, KPCC President V M Sudheeran said Tharoor should not be oblivious of the fact that he had been elected on a Congress ticket.
"Tharoor should not forget the fact that it is the Congress that made him a Member of Parliament. He should refrain from speaking against the party line," Sudheeran said at Vatakara in Kozhikode district.
Sudheeran also indicated that, if necessary, disciplinary action would be initiated against Tharoor after consulting other leaders if he kept on eulogising Modi.
Defending himself, Tharoor said his response to Modi's call to support the "Swachh Bharat" campaign would not mean that he even remotely endorsed the BJP's "core Hindutva" agenda and that he continued to be a "proud Congressman".
"I am astonished that anyone would suggest that I am pro- BJP. I have a 30-year paper trail of published writings on my idea of India and my profound belief in India's pluralism," Tharoor, a minister in the previous UPA government and the second term MP from Thiruvananthapuram, said in a Facebook comment.
"Being receptive to specific statements or actions of BJP leaders does not remotely imply acceptance of the party's core Hindutva agenda. The PM pitched his appeal as a non-political one and I received it in that spirit. I am a proud Congressman and a proud Indian. In short, not pro-BJP, just pro-India," the former UN diplomat, said.
Tharoor has responded positively to Modi's invitation to join the ambitious Swachh Bharat campaign but wanted it to be a sustained programme instead of being "tokenism".
Responding to Modi's call, Tharoor had last week said he was honoured to accept the invitation to join the 'Clean India campaign'.
Tharoor, who praised Modi on a couple of occasions earlier, however, added he was not a fan of tokenism and the challenge would be to sustain it beyond a week of 'photo ops'.
Modi has invited nine persons, including Tharoor, to join in the Swachh Bharat campaign on the model of the 'Ice Bucket Challenge'.
Tearing into Tharoor, former state Youth Congress President M Liju said it was surprising that the Congress MP failed to realise the true agenda behind Modi's schemes.
"Tharoor is not a nursery school student. It is difficult to believe that he fails to understand the true agenda and political gimmickry of Modi's programmes," Liju added.

Nobel prize in medicine awarded for discovery of brains GPSBy Ariana Eunjung Cha and Fred Barbash October 6 Follow @arianaeunjung Follow @fbarbash
U.S.-British scientist John O'Keefe and Norwegian husband and wife Edvard Moser and May-Britt Moser have won the Nobel Prize in medicine for discoveries of brain cells that people use to orient themselves. (AP)
Three scientists, including a husband-and-wife team, have been awarded this year’s Nobel Prize in medicine for deciphering the mechanism in the brain that allows us to find our way around.
The three winners of the world’s most coveted medical research prize are John O’Keefe, who holds both U.S. and British citizenship and is director of the Sainsbury Wellcome Center in Neural Circuits and Behavior at University College London; May-Britt Moser, a professor of neuroscience at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology; and Edward I. Moser of the same university.
All worked on different components of the same problem: how we “orient ourselves in space” and navigate, the Stockholm-based Nobel committee said in announcing the prize Monday. The discovery of what the group called the brain’s “inner GPS” has “solved a problem that has occupied philosophers and scientists for centuries.”
O’Keefe discovered the first component of this system in 1971. He found that when he placed rats in certain parts of a room different cells in the brain’s hippocampus – which is believed to be important in functions related to space and memory -- were always activated. He theorized that these areas that he called “place cells” formed a map of the room.
The Mosers, who are from Norway, followed up on that research in 2005, finding what scientists dubbed “grid cells” that make up a coordinate system that allows us to navigate. The couple was researching rats moving in a room when they noticed that another area of the brain, the entorhinal cortex, was activated in a unique spatial pattern that corresponded with the location of the animal’s head and the borders of the room.
Research into the inner workings of the brain has been among the top priorities for the scientific community in recent years. Last year, the European Union launched a 10-year effort to simulate the human brain on supercomputers. And President Obama launched a $100 million initiative to build tools to accelerate the pace of brain research – an effort that many believe will be as groundbreaking as the Human Genome Project, which led to the sequencing of the 3 billion base pairs that comprise human DNA.
Last year, two Americans -- James Rothman of Yale University and Randy Schekman of the University of California at Berkeley -- and German-born Thomas Suedhof of Stanford University won the Nobel in medicine for their work on how the body’s cells communicate. The research has had a major impact in our understanding of how the brain transmits signals.
Cornelia Bargmann, a neurobiologist at Rockefeller University and a 2013 winner of the Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences, funded by Internet entrepreneurs Mark Zuckerburg, Sergey Brin and others, said this year’s Nobel-honored work is groundbreaking because it not only tells us about how the brain understands space but more complex cognitive relationships, as well.
Bargmann, co-chair of the advisory committee for the president’s BRAIN (Brain Research Through Innovative Neurotechnologies) initiative, said the scientists showed the brain creates a two-dimensional grid of the world  based on “a group of neurons that tell you where you are moving and how you have been.” Those points are in turn linked to people, places and other sights, smells and experiences.
“The first time I saw that work I nearly fell out of my chair -- it is so amazing,” she said. “It is the beginning of how memory is represented. This is why some people compare memories to moving through space.”
Joshua Sanes, director of Harvard University’s Center for Brain Research, said that while the work by O’Keefe and the Moser is still in the early stages – it has only been done in animals, and it’s unclear whether human brains are set up the same way – it provides fundamental insights into brains and their relation to life.
“It’s about navigational abilities that little kids have, mice have, ants have and honey bees have,” he said. “It’s a very basic evolutionary mental activity that is absolutely critical for many species' survival. How the brain works is maybe the biggest mystery that remains in all the world of the life sciences, and this is a key piece in the puzzle.”
The Nobel winners’ work provides such a fundamental insight into the brain that many neuroscientists are hopeful that the discovery will one day help us find treatments for a host of neurological conditions.
“The studies were of a part of the brain involved in certain neurological disease, such as Alzheimer’s, and getting lost is a symptom of Alzheimer’s,” Sanes explained. “While nobody should be thinking this is on the direct road to a treatment, but it provides a starting point for the first time.”
Emery Brown, a member of the advisory committee for the BRAIN initiative, said he expects work building on the three scientists’ discoveries to accelerate over the next few years as scientists try to figure out whether the place and grid cells work the same way in humans.
If it turns out to be the case, he said, the implications are far-reaching.
“You could think of ways to help stimulate areas to enhance memory, to help people who have had brain injuries recover function, maybe even to help preserve function as we grow older,” said Brown, a professor of computational neuroscience at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
The Nobel Prize in physics will be announced Tuesday, the prize in chemistry Wednesday, and literature on Thursday. The Nobel Peace Prize will be announced Friday. A prize in economics, in memory of Alfred Nobel, will be announced on Oct. 13.

I feel very happy that I could get a gold and a bronze: SaniaMirzaSania Mirza said she was not yet thinking about the 2016 Rio Olympics (Source: PTI)
Press Trust of India | Hyderabad | Posted: October 6, 2014 7:01 pm | Updated: October 6, 2014 7:03 pm
Tennis ace Sania Mirza expressed happiness over India winning five medals at the recently-concluded Asian Games at Incheon, although she felt many people did not expect them to do well with the team the country had sent.
“I feel very good. I feel very happy that I could get a gold and a bronze. I think many people did not expect because we did not go with the best team. But I am very happy that we could come back with five medals,” she told reporters.
With some of top players pulling out, the expectations from Indian tennis squad were not high in the Asiad. Sania and Saketh Myneni defeated Chinese Taipei’s Hsien Yin Peng and Hao Ching Chan to win the country a mixed doubles gold at the Incheon Asian Games. She also bagged a bronze in the women’s doubles event partnering Prarthana Thombare.
Apart from these two medals, India’s men’s doubles pair of Myneni and Sanam Singh pocketed the silver, while Yuki Bhambri and Divij Sharan settled for a bronze.
Yuki also managed a bronze in men’s singles. Sania, who had won the mixed doubles at the US Open prior to the Asian Games, said she was happy with her career at the moment.
“At the moment, I am very happy with the way my career is going, with the way my life is going,” she said.
Unwell since last one week, Sania said she was recovering well and looking forward to a break.
“It (fitness) is going ok. I have been sick the last one week. I have been recovering a little bit. I am looking forward to a few days off. It has been a very long few months for me. But it has been very good. So, I am looking forward to a few days off,” she said.
Sania said she was not yet thinking about the 2016 Rio Olympics but was getting ready to play the Singapore Open in about two weeks time.
“Olympics is really far right now. I am planning for two weeks from now. Hopefully, if I am still playing tennis two years from now, then I will be there. Before that I have a lot more to look forward to,” she said.
The Hyderabadi tennis ace, who has been made a brand ambassador by the TRS government in Telangana, said she would like to bring laurels to the state.
“I am very happy to be the brand ambassador of Telangana. I hope I can keep bringing laurels to the state,” she said.

SP backs RLD  wants Delhis Tughlaq Road bungalow declared as Charan SinghmemorialPrint
Written by Maulshree Seth | Lucknow | Posted: October 6, 2014 6:59 pm | Updated: October 6, 2014 7:01 pm
Samajwadi Party on Sunday extended support to Ajit Singh’s campaign for declaring a Tughlaq road bungalow, formerly occupied by the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) chief, a memorial to his father and ex-prime minister Chaudhary Charan Singh.
The announcement came after RLD national general secretary Jayant Chaudhary, former MP and son of Ajit Singh, met Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav at his residence in Lucknow for inviting him to “Kisan Swabhiman Rally” on October 12 in Meerut. The rally has been called by Ajit Singh to put pressure on the NDA government for converting the bungalow into a memorial in the honour of the socialist leader. The invitation to Akhilesh came in his capacity as the state president of Samajwadi Party.
“Chief Minister has told them that Samajwadi Party is committed to the ideology of Chaudhary Charan Singh and has been implementing his policies. Samajwadi Party is in favour of both a memorial for Charan Singh as well as Bharat Ratna for Charan Singh,” said Rajendra Chaudhary, SP spokesperson and state cabinet minister.
Rajendra Chaudhary, who was present during the meeting, said, “SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav has a lot of respect for Charan Singh and has worked to take forward his ideology by continuous struggle for prosperity of villages and villagers.” He, however, maintained that the support should not be seen as the confirmation of participation of Akhilesh or his father Mulayam Singh  in the programme.
RLD spokesperson Anil Dubey, who was also part of the meeting along with RLD state president Munna Singh Chauhan, told The Indian Express, “Jayantji met the Chief Minister to invite him for the October 12 rally in Meerut, which would aim at putting pressure on tje NDA government to declare former bungalow of Ajit Singh as a memorial for Chaudhary Charan Singh. The meet has been very positive and we are hopeful that he would come.”
Dubey said that while Akhilesh Yadav has assured of his presence, “Bihar CM hief Minister Jeetan Ram Manjhi, former Bihar CM Nitish Kumar, Haryana Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, Janata Dal (United) leader Sharad Yadav have already given their consent.” He said that RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav has also been invited to the rally.
Ajit Singh recently evicted the bungalow, weeks after civic authorities in New Delhi disconnected water and power supply to the house as the RLD leader did not comply with the eviction notice served to him. He had been staying in the bungalow for 36 years.

World Bank says China's growth to slow down to 7.4 per cent

(However, the report pointed…)
BEIJING: China may miss the official target of 7.5 per cent GDP growth rate as the World Bank today cut the forecast for the world's second largest economy to 7.4 per cent this year, predicting its continued slow down.
China's growth will ease to 7.4 per cent this year and 7.2 per cent in 2015, as the government seeks to put the economy on a more sustainable path with policies addressing financial vulnerabilities and structural constraints, the World Bank said in its report released in Singapore today.
The figure is notch lower than the official target of 7.5 per cent, which the Chinese government set for this year as a threshold to halt the continued slow down of the economy hit by declining export markets and slow increase of domestic consumption.
China registered 7.7 per cent GDP last year. The slowdown from heydays of double-digit GDP growth till 2010 was attributed to China continuing with the structural reforms to address financial vulnerabilities and structural constraints.
"Measures to contain local government debt, curb shadow banking, and tackle excess capacity, high energy demand, and high pollution will reduce investment and manufacturing output," the state-run Xinhua news agency quoted the World Bank's report.
"China's slowdown in economy would be gradual; it is not the bottom falling out of China's growth," said Sudhir Shetty, World Bank's Chief Economist in East Asia and Pacific Region, adding, the slowdown in economic growth of China will not have a dramatic impact on other countries.
However, the report pointed out that if China experiences a sharp slowdown, which is unlikely, it would hit commodity producers in the region, such as metal exporters in Mongolia and coal exporters in Indonesia , especially hard.
Regarding China's outlook, the report said structural reforms in sectors such as state enterprises and services could help "offset the impact of measures to contain local government debt and curb shadow banking."
As to the property market, the bank said "a major nationwide correction in real estate prices in China remains unlikely, although there may be pressure on prices in several of the less rapidly growing provinces."

(Anand was deputed by UB Group…)
NEW DELHI: Vijay Mallya-led UB Group's MCFL, which is the takeover target of two rival fertiliser firms, will pay only a token salary of Re one per month to its Managing Director Deepak Anand in the current fiscal.
The salary of Re 1 a month has been approved by shareholders for 2014-15, as also for the subsequent year 2015-16, till the next annual general meeting takes place.
Anand was deputed by UB Group as Managing Director of Mangalore Chemicals & Fertilizers Ltd (MCF) in April 2005 and since then he has been paid Rs one per month as token salary.
Meanwhile, Anand is on the rolls of UB Holdings as President, Fertilisers.
Intensifying the battle for acquisition of MCFL, Deepak Fertilisers and Zuari Group both on September 26 raised their open offer prices to Rs 93.60 per share and Rs 81.60 per share, respectively.
Deepak Fertilisers had launched open offer to buy additional 26 per cent stake in MCFL in April this year at Rs 63 per share following which Zuari and UB group joined hands in May and launched open offer for same number of shares at Rs 68.55 per scrip.
The battle for control of Mangalore Chemicals heated up again after the Competition Commission of India (CCI) cleared an open offer launched by Zuari Group firms on September 4. The CCI had cleared the open offer of Deepak Fertilisers on August 19.
After this, both parties have announced that the open offer will start on October 1 and close on October 17. The last date for upward revision of the offer size or price was September 25.
At present, Deepak Fertiliser holds 25.31 per cent stake in MCFL, whereas consortium of Zuari group companies have 16.43 per cent stake and Vijay Mallaya's UB group 21.97 per cent stake.
Zuari Agro Chemicals had also entered into an agreement this year to use Mangalore Chemicals's facilities for contract production.
The battle for MCFL between Deepak Fertilisers and Zuari Group was triggered in April 2013 when the latter bought about 10 per cent stake in MCFL through open market.
Later, Deepak Fertilisers acquired 24.46 per cent stake in MCFL in one go in July 2013. After this, Zuari group had increased its stake to 16.43 per cent in the same month.

Prices of essential goods will fall further in Modi rule: Amit Shah22

Pune: BJP President Amit Shah on Monday said that prices have come down since Narendra Modi came to power at the Centre and that the downward trend could continue further in the current month.
"Prices of essential commodities as well as that of petrol and diesel are falling since Modi became Prime Minister and the downward trend could continue further in the month of October," he said addressing an election meeting at Lonavala near.
Shah stressed on a harmonious Centre-State relationship and urged people to vote BJP to power in Maharashtra in the October 15 assembly polls to ensure proper development of the state. "Maharashtra should have a government that will work shoulder to shoulder with Narendra Modi at the Centre to take the state ahead on the path of development," Shah added. The BJP president also attacked Congress-NCP alliance alleging that people of the state were condemned to a 15-year-old "corrupt rule" that took Maharashtra backward.
"Prices of essential commodities as well as that of petrol and diesel are falling since Modi became PM and the downward trend could continue further in the month of October," the BJP president said.

Hyderabad: Regretting that BJP-Shiv Sena alliance could not continue in Maharashtra, Union Minister M Venkaiah Naidu on Monday expressed confidence that his party would come to power on its own in the western state.
"I have full confidence that BJP government would be formed in Maharashtra. Our alliance with Shiv Sena was there for 25 years. It is unfortunate. Shiv Sena could not understand the prevailing situation. I would like to tell the reason. In the present Maharashtra Assembly, BJP's strength is more than Shiv Sena. In the recent Lok Sabha polls, BJP got six seats more than Shiv Sena," Naidu said.
"Still, we said you be in number one position. You take maximum number of seats. In the number two position, we fought in 119 seats earlier, BJP would fight in 130 seats and you fight in the remaining seats. But, they said no. It was unreasonable. That's why it could not happen. Still, we don't want to make it an issue," he said.
"People of Maharashtra should be freed from Congress. I am fully confident that it will be a Congress-free Maharashtra," M Venkaiah Naidu said.

"People of Maharashtra should be freed from Congress. I am fully confident that it will be a Congress-free Maharashtra," the BJP leader further said. Replying to a query, Naidu said "it would be good if both Thackerays (Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray and MNS leader Raj Thackeray) become one."

Haryana Assembly elections: Modi woos Faridabad voters  calls for end to dynasty politics8
0
Faridabad: Prime Minister Narendra Modi breathed in new life into the election scene in Faridabad as he addressed an election rally in this National Capital Region on Monday.
Flanked by the Haryana BJP unit, Modi appealed to the voters to elect a majority government in the state like that at the Centre during the Haryana Assembly elections. He dared the ruling Congress party claiming that it won't be able to reach double digit in the Assembly elections.
He reminded Congress of its humiliating defeat in the Lok Sabha elections. "Congress will meet its fate because of its own sins," he said.
'The Congress will meet its fate because of its own sins,' Modi told a roaring crowd at Faridabad's Dussehra ground.
#haryana assembly elections 2014 #narendra modi #faridabad #haryana
From the Gandhis to the Chautalas, Modi targeted both Congress and the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) over dynasty politics. He called for its end. "Farmers' land is being given to son-in-law, this has to stop," he said referring to the alleged land scam involving Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda and Robert Vadra, the son-in-law of Congress President Sonia Gandhi.
Addressing a big crowd at the Dussehra Ground in Faridabad, Modi promised better jobs, education and infrastructure for Faridabad if the BJP was voted to power. He also said that he won't be able to 'help' Haryana in case any other government came to power.
"There is a man in Delhi who is worried about your security and respect. This is my Haryana, I cannot see it getting ruined," he said to a roaring crowd.
Faridabad MP Krishanpal Gurjar, former cricketer Chetan Sharma and candidates from the nine Assembly constituencies from Faridabad shared the stage with Modi.
In his 30 minute-long speech, Modi once again targeted former CM Om Prakash Chautaa Chautala saying, "the one who cannot trust his sons,  how will he trust you people." Chautala is serving a jail term after hin conviction in a teachers' recruitment scam but is out on bail campaigning for his party INLD.
Modi called for the general population in Haryana to check the worsening sex ration in the state.  He reminded, "Against 1000 men in Haryana, there are only 875 women, which mean over 125 of our boys will remain bachelors. This has to stop. We live in the 21st century and not the 18th century."
He assured that the monthly pension for the old will not be less than Rs 1000.
Modi once again tried to woo Haryana's rural populace through this rally, like his previous ones at Hisar and Karnal. But Faridabad, which houses a major chunk of Haryana's urban population, did not see anything come its way.
He reminded the gathered public about 'Swachch Bharat Abhiyan' and asked them to pick up the garbage littered by them around the venue.
'Crowd puller' Modi' rally is sure to have an impact on the fortunes of BJP candidates in Faridabad but it is to be seen if the BJP manages to form a majority government in the state ruled by caste and panchayats.
BJP, for the first time has fielded candidates in all the 90 Assembly seats. It recently broke its alliance with the Haryana Janhit Congress.  Party sources say BJP may finish third in the race when the counting of votes take place on October 19. It may join hands with INLD.

The Test: Can Redskins throw at ShermanBy Mark Bullock and Neil Greenberg October 6 Follow @ngreenberg
The Test asks two Post specialists to take unique looks at a Redskins issue leading up to each game. Neil Greenberg of  our Fancy Stats blog  runs the numbers; Separately,  Mark Bullock  gives it the eye test. Together, they provide a double dose of insight.
Neil Greenberg’s take:
Richard Sherman says he is the best cornerback in the league, but he has proved to be vulnerable this season.
When he is in coverage, opposing quarterbacks have a 65.0 passer rating against, and that includes a masterful performance by Philip Rivers and the Chargers in Week 2, where San Diego completed four of five targets on Sherman’s side of the field for 54 yards — 27 of which came after the catch.
The key will be to take utilize tight end Niles Paul, who hopes to play , and create a favorable matchup against the Seahawks’ linebackers. Among Washington’s pass catchers, Paul is averaging almost double the amount of yards per route run when asked to run a pattern.
That should be enough to expose Seattle’s outside linebacker K.J. Wright, who is yielding 1.3 yards per snap when he is asked to drop into coverage, the third most among outside linebackers who have played at least 50 percent of their team’s snaps.
Related: Gruden says he won’t concede half the field to Sherman
Mark Bullock’s take:
Sherman has certainly proven himself as one of, if not the best corner in the NFL. He excels in the Seahawks Cover 3-based scheme that allows him to play left corner and take away his deep third of the field and sometimes more from the offense. Not many teams dared to throw it his way last season, instead finding ways to work to the other side of the field. But the Chargers this season figured out a few ways to make Sherman less of a factor for the Seahawks’ defense.
This is just a simple four verticals play by the Chargers. Four verticals has always been a way to attack Cover 3 schemes and variants of it. San Diego stands up its future hall of fame tight end Antonio Gates and lines him up as part of a ‘Trips Right’ formation. He runs the key route in this defense, crossing the middle of field and running away from Sherman’s side.
Covering a tight end running deep is always a tough assignment for linebackers and safeties. Earl Thomas is covering the deep middle of the field and is the best in the league at doing so. But the trips formation forces him to shade to that side — the top in the photos above. Add in the seam route from the slot receiver and Thomas is forced to stick to that side of the field. That leaves Gates running against a linebacker and an obvious place to throw for quarterback Philip Rivers.
Gates makes the catch and picks up a big gain in the process on a play that Sherman couldn’t do anything about.
San Diego got inventive with how they used Gates in that game. They moved him around trying to get the best matchup and managed to find success.
This time the Chargers use a ‘Trips Left’ formation, but with all three receivers on the same side. That leaves Gates on the right side on his own. The Seahawks were left with two choices on how to use Sherman; either keep him on his left side of the field and leave a lesser corner or a safety on a receiver, or move him over to the receiver side and leave Gates one-on-one. Here, Seattle opted for the latter, and Rivers wasted no time in going to Gates.
Seattle leaves safety Kam Chancellor in coverage with Gates, but Chancellor just can’t stay with him.
Rivers drops the ball over Gates’s shoulder and Chancellor can’t do anything to save the touchdown.
Jay Gruden moved his tight ends all over the formation in Cincinnati, often using the same look as the Chargers did here. If Jordan Reed or Niles Paul manages to overcome their injuries in time for Monday night, they could be used in similar fashion to Gates. If both are ruled out, then Washington will have to look at other ways to attack Seattle. Denver showed a couple of ways that the Redskins could still attack Sherman’s side of the field.
This is the type of play I’m expecting to see on Monday night. Denver has wide receiver Wes Welker run an underneath crossing route, while they set up blocks on the opposite side of the formation.
As Peyton Manning dumps off the pass to Welker, the blockers engage with their defenders, clearing a path for Welker to work up the sideline.
Sherman manages to push Welker out of bounds, but not before he picks up the first down. DeSean Jackson would be ideal on this type of play. His speed could see him hit the edge and turn the corner before the Seattle defense can adjust, but it would require good blocking from his fellow receivers.
The Broncos also threw directly at Sherman’s receiver a couple of times, but Manning was careful to anticipate the throw as best as he could and get the ball to the receiver as he made his cut.
Here, Denver has receiver Emmanuel Sanders run a dig route, with the slot receiver running a quick out.
The two routes cross paths, attempting to create traffic for the defensive backs, but it doesn’t work.
Manning anticipates the throw excellently. He is already delivering the ball a step or two before Sanders makes his cut.
With the throw so well anticipated, Sherman has no chance to make a play and has to settle for making the tackle.
If the throw is timed to perfection, like it was here, even Sherman can’t do anything about it sometimes. But it takes a lot of guts from a quarterback to trust his receiver to cut exactly when he needs to and be in the right position when the ball arrives, otherwise the defense could get some easy interceptions.

Govt warns Pakistan against border firing  says armed forces  fully readyComments
Defence minister Arun Jaitley on Monday deplored the ceasefire violations by Pakistan and said the Indian armed forces were "fully ready" and are responding to each of these provocations from across the border.

He told Pakistan that it should realise that the kind of environment it was generating between the two countries was certainly not going to help in normalising relations.
Reacting to the continuous ceasefire violations, the minister said Pakistan has been trying to create tension in both the international border and Line of Control (LoC).
"This is resulting in a series of ceasefire violations as a result of which innocent civilians have lost their lives.
Pakistan must realise that the kind of environment it is generating between the two countries is certainly not going to help in normalising relations.  The onus of creating a positive environment is on Pakistan which is utterly failing to do so.
"Let everybody be assured that our armed forces and para-military forces are fully ready and they are responding to each of these provacations from Pakistan," Jaitley said.
Condemning the shelling, union home minsiter Rajnath Singh said “Pakistan should stop ceasefire violations now and should realise that the situation in India has changed”.
Read: Five dead, 29 wounded in Pak shelling on border
Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah said the targeting of civilian areas exposed the frustration of the Pakistani government after its failure to gain international attention on the Kashmir issue.
"They (the Pakistani leadership) have nothing else to speak, but only Kashmir. Whenever they go abroad, they try to raise only Kashmir issue, but every time they miserably fail to get international attention. The cross-border shelling is an indication of their frustration," he told reporters after meeting civilians injured in the shelling at the Government Medical College Hospital in Jammu.
Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said the government has given instructions to the army to reply to the ceasefire violations.
"The Army has been instructed to reply to the ceasefire violations and it is acting on the issue," Prasad told reporters.
Condemning Pakistan's actions, former external affairs minister Salman Khurshid said it is despicable that such incidents have occurred on Eid. "There cannot be anything worse than this," the Congress leader said.
Five civilians were killed and 29 wounded in firing by Pakistani forces along a stretch of the border in Jammu district on Monday, the heaviest firing between the two countries since India called off bilateral talks last month.
The latest firing is the eleventh time Pakistani troops have violated the ceasefire since October 1, a Border Security Forces (BSF) official said. This is probably the highest number of civilian deaths in a single day in shelling. Even when firing was at its highest between July and August, two people died in the 45 days shells rained down on the border.

1 300-Year-Old VillageArchaeologists surveying land acquired by Petrified Forest National Park have found traces of two ancient villages. The flags mark a site where pottery was found.
NPS
Archaeologists have uncovered a second ancient village in Arizona's Petrified Forest National Park that is 1,300 years old.
The latest basket-maker village dates between 200 A.D. and 700 A.D., based on the types of pottery found, according to Bill Reitze, the park's archaeologist. It was discovered this summer, following the first discovery last year of similar slab-lined pit-houses.
These are dwelling structures dug into the ground unique to the Southern Colorado Plateau and found throughout the park, but not often in these high concentrations, Reitze said.
NPS

Both of the large basket-maker sites are in neighboring, stabilized sand dunes less than a kilometer apart, Reitze said. The discoveries were made as part of an expansion project that has doubled the park's size after Congress passed the Petrified Forest National Park Expansion Act of 2004.
Scientists Trying New Trick to Catch You in a Lie
"There are not a lot of national parks that have the opportunity to get bigger like this to protect sites and produce future research," Reitze told ABC News. "A lot of archaeology happens in response to development. What makes this unique is new sites are discovered, research [is] being done and all these sites are being protected, all at once."
The artifacts are primarily stone tools, including spear points, scrapers and knives, made out of petrified wood, shells and small early ceramics. Last year, ruins of a multi-story house were discovered that may have been part of a trade network.
NPS
PHOTO: One "really neat artifact," Reitze said, was a white pendant carved from soapstone or siltstone.
"It’s really interesting because it really allows us to see on a larger scale things we’ve noticed in other areas in the park," Reitze said.
The park is split between Navajo and Apache counties.
NPS

Reitze said he plans to record additional discoveries and date what they've found with radiocarbon.
One of Reitze's colleagues will be conducting an ethno-botanical study to analyze prehistoric sites.
"Because the park is doubling in size, we are finding something every day -- certainly not like these sites, but we are finding things every day," he said.

New midterm forecasts released Monday are bullish for the GOPComments
By Paul Gronke and Phillip Ardoin October 6
There’s no more accurate way to predict the day’s weather than looking out the window that morning, and there’s no more accurate way to forecast an election than looking at the polls on election eve. There are several academic and nonacademic meteorologists — The Washington Post’s Election Lab , Five Thirty Eight , The Upshot , Princeton Election Consortium , Daily Kos , Pollster  and more — providing daily election forecasts. These models currently rely on aggregated preelection polls, with a sprinkle of the fundamentals and a dash of state-specific factors.
Political science forecasting dates to at least 40 years ago, when Edward Tufte published his famous 1975 paper in the American Political Science Review. A Google scholar search on “political science election forecasts” returns over 50,000 results over 40 years and spanning elections worldwide.
For the past 12 years, the political science journal PS has published a symposium featuring midterm and presidential election forecasts by leading political scientists. This year’s symposium is being released Monday. It forecasts sunny days ahead for the GOP — a net gain between four and 16 seats in the House and five to eight seats in the Senate. Three of the five Senate forecasts would lead to unified Republican control of Congress.
(Note: The Highton, McGhee, and Sides forecast dates to when the PS issue went to press. Updated forecasts are published at Election Lab.)
With new polls coming out daily, why pay attention to these forecasts?
To continue the analogy, political scientists are the climate scientists of the meteorological world, not the short-term weather forecasters. The PS forecasts are not based on a simple aggregation of polling data. Alan Abramowitz’s model , for instance, captures shifting political sentiments nationwide without reference to a specific race. Joseph Bafumi, Robert Erikson and Christopher Wlezien quite consciously rely only on information collected well before the election. Their approaches parallel the difference between climate science and short-term weather forecasts.
Political scientists enjoy playing the election prediction game, just like journalists, but we draw a bright line between forecasting and understanding. A light-hearted example by Michael Alvarez and Brian Loynd published 20 years ago illustrates the difference. Alvarez and Loynd showed that an American League victory in the World Series contributes nearly 12 percentage points to the Republican Party’s vote total. (One can only speculate about the impact that interleague play has had on this important result!) But Alvarez and Loynd never thought that the World Series had any direct causal link to election outcomes, just like last year’s snowstorms in Washington, D.C., tell us anything about long-term climate change.
The value of the political science models is to assess how well we can predict the election, even significantly ahead of time, based on scientific theory . These models provide a baseline for how well a party “should” do that we can then use to understand the results. For example, the disjuncture between the 2010 forecasts and the results provided evidence for the impact of salient roll call votes on vote outcomes . James Campbell developed the now common metaphor of “wave” elections in response to underestimates of the 1994 Republican victory .
In short, the point of political science models is not just to tell us who will win, but to help us determine why they won.

Gone Girl breaks through our deadlocked discussion of false rape allegationsBy Alyssa Rosenberg October 6 Follow @AlyssaRosenberg
On the occasion of his fifth wedding anniversary, Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) reports that his beautiful wife, Amy (Rosamund Pike), has gone missing. The new trailer of "Gone Girl" has Neil Patrick Harris making an appearance. Based on the novel of the same name by Gillian Flynn, "Gone Girl" is set for an Oct. 3 release date. (20th Century Fox)
Spoiler alert: This post discusses the plot of “Gone Girl” in detail.
In adapting Gillian Flynn’s novel “Gone Girl,” about a woman who appears to have vanished but turns out to be framing her husband for murder, director David Fincher and Flynn, who wrote the script made what to my mind are two major changes to the book.
(Credit: Twentieth Century Fox)
First, they de-emphasized the families of the two main characters, toning down Amy Elliot Dunne’s (Rosamund Pike) rage at her parasitic, greedy parents and virtually eliminating her husband Nick’s (Ben Affleck) terror that he will turn into his hateful, uncaring father. They also change what we learn about Amy’s previous career of faking injuries to herself from others. Fincher’s film eliminates Amy’s faked attacks by women and focuses on a rape allegation Amy makes against an ex-boyfriend who precedes Nick and another one Amy makes later in the story, to create cover for herself when she decides she wants to return home to Nick rather than see him be executed.
The false rape allegations in “Gone Girl” have long been controversial . But I think in paring back the other elements of the story and focusing attention more clearly on them, Fincher has achieved something interesting and important, finding a way for his movie to talk about why certain narratives of sexual violence against are appealing to the media.
Talking about false rape allegations is a difficult thing to do. They exist, of course. But in an environment where people seeking to report sexual assault are often treated as fundamentally dishonest, advocates often worry that an intense focus on women who make false reports exaggerates the prominence of this phenomenon, in turn throwing up more hurdles that the much larger number of truthful people must surmount to be treated by the police and in court.
“Gone Girl” at its best manages to break down this deadlock. Because Amy is such a highly specific personality, with a uniquely distorted sense of what she is owed and how it ought to be delivered, it would be an outrageous stretch for anyone to imply that her behavior reflects on other women in any way at all. We can talk about what Amy does in “Gone Girl” without needing to defend other women from the slanderous charge of being anything like her.
As a result, Fincher is free to examine why Amy’s lies resonate, first with the New York Police Department, to whom she made her first allegation years before the movie takes place, and then to the national media, particularly a rancid, Nancy Grace-like commentator named Ellen Abbot (Missi Pyle).
With her New York ex Tommy (Scoot McNairy), a nebbishy comedy writer, Amy plays on the cops’ sexual suspicion of a man who is not hyper-masculine, encouraging the impression that a gorgeous blonde like her would not have sex with a man like Tommy voluntarily. In a counterfeit diary Amy mocks up to cast suspicion on Nick once she disappears, she implies that Nick brutalized her sexually to push the detectives to suspect him: “Nick uses me for sex when he wants,” she writes in one entry.
When she vanishes, Amy designs for it to be discovered both that Nick had a mistress and that Amy had tested positive for a pregnancy, details designed to make her disappearance look as painful as possible, and to provide rocket fuel for Ellen Abbot, who begins covering the story non-stop. “Amy would have loved you and all you do for women,” Amy’s friend Noelle (Casey Wilson) tells Abbot, but Amy understands the TV star better. If women stopped being in pain, Ellen Abbot would be out of a job.
In a cover story for New York Magazine, Vanessa Grigoriadis wrote of anti-rape activists on college campuses  and how “shattering silence, in 2014, means not just coming out with an atrocity tale about your assault but offering what Danielle Dirks, a sociologist at Occidental, calls ‘an atrocity tale about how poorly you were treated by the people you pay $62,500 a year to protect you.’”
Amy creates a great atrocity tale, particularly when she comes home, having murdered her college ex-boyfriend Desi (Neil Patrick Harris) and telling a horrible story about how he kidnapped her and held her captive so she can remove suspicion from Nick. In telling the cops her story of what Desi did to her, Amy picks lots of fabulous, scandalous words beginning with the letter “s.” Desi would “Starve me. Shave me. Sodomize me,” Amy tells them.
If the local police officer, Det. Rhonda Boney (Kim Dickens), is suspicious of Amy, the media and their audiences are utterly enraptured, addicted to the delicious prospect of horror. And with the world invested in Amy and her story, Boney and Nick are stuck, unable to contradict it.
“Gone Girl” does not imply that people lie about having been raped on any sort of large scale. But it does suggest that our addiction to female pain has conditioned us to demand that women suffer on command and on a sufficient scale for us to believe them. Our fascination with such atrocity narratives might make us susceptible to false claims. It also trains us to demand terrible things from women who are telling the truth.

Shahpur Clashes: Victim buried amidst security  police book 11 forriotingPrint
Express News Service | Ahmedabad | Posted: October 6, 2014 7:36 pm
The death of Shahpur youth on Sunday midnight made situation worse in communally sensitive Shahpur area that witnessed violence after a team of Ahmedabad Crime Branch reached the spot to round up suspects in cow slaughter case. The victim was buried in a burial ground close to Ahmedabad Police Commissioner office amidst heavy police protection.
The victim Ashraf Khan Pathan of Shahpur had suffered a bullet wound during the clashes when the police resorted to shelling tear gas shells.
Ashraf’s body was taken from VS Hospital after the post mortem for the burial at Moosa Suhag burial ground in Shahibaug near the Ahmedabad Police Commissioner office.
The police did not allow the family to take the body to Shahpur fearing another round of clashes in the area. The body was taken to a mosque behind hospital under police protection where the family offered ritualistic prayers. The funeral procession was taken from the Ellisbridge area under full police protection with the city police piloting the convoy.
The victim’s family members and community members joined in from walled city area and shouted slogans against cops during the procession and showed aggression on the roads against the victim’s death. Add CP (traffic) Harikrishna Patel handled the traffic and security on the road till the procession was taken to the burial ground.
Ashraf was taken to VS Hospital where he succumbed to bullet injuries in the wee hours. The doctors at the hospital stated that as per the primary report a piece of aluminium was removed from his body during operation that suggested a countrymade weapon was used in firing. The service revolvers and pistols of police generally contain copper.
Ashraf’s family that is upset and angry with the incident however have told police that the deceased had no enemity with anyone that could have triggered private firing in the midst of the clashes.
The Ahmedabad Police however claim that there was no firing at all in the clashes and only tear gas shells were used. The police have however sought a forensic report on the bullet wound.
DCP Zone I Virendra Yadav said, “There is high possibility that tear gas shells that were used during the incident might have left an impact on victim’s body since the tear gas contains aluminum particles. However a detailed report on that has been sought on what impacted his body”.
The Shahpur police have registered a case of rioting against 11 main accused for rioting who were identified as Aslam Sheikh, Nasir Sheikh, Salman Habib Sheikh, Zariuddin Moinuddin, Ayubkhan Nawabkhan Pathan, Mohsin Jummakhan Pathan, Aspal alias Suran, Salav Sarifuddin Saiyed, Aamir Panwala, Saddam Hasan and one Kabado among other 1500 to 2000 person in the mob as per the FIR.
As per the FIR, the Shahpur police have said that the he mob of around 1500 to 2000 persons from Shahpur and neighbouring areas got together and protested against the Ahmedabad police team that went for patrolling to check the illegal trade of beef in the area. The mob did not let the police check continued…

Ivo Karlovic stuns Marin Cilic inShanghaiMarin Cilic of Croatia returns a shot during his men's singles tennis match against Ivo Karlovic (Source: Reuters)
Reuters | Shanghai | Posted: October 6, 2014 7:32 pm | Updated: October 6, 2014 8:00 pm
U.S. Open champion Marin Cilic made a shock first-round exit from the Shanghai Masters on Monday after losing 7-5 2-6 7-6(2) to fellow Croatian Ivo Karlovic.
After dropping the first set, Cilic broke his opponent twice in the second to force a decider but Karlovic clinched the tie-breaker to seal victory.
Cilic, sixth in the race to November’s elite eight-player ATP Finals in London, had won his last two matches against Karlovic, who blasted 20 aces to his opponent’s nine.
“It’s a gamble with him,” Cilic said of his compatriot. “He goes all in or nothing. It’s always difficult.
“He was serving really well towards the end of the match. I couldn’t get into his serve. It can happen with Ivo. It’s always tricky.
“The game, I’m feeling it’s on the spot. Though I lost today, it’s unfortunate, bad luck, but I’m going with positive energy into the next weeks to finish the season well,” added Cilic who is seeking his first ATP Finals appearance in London.
It proved a good day for big-servers as world number 14 John Isner belted down 22 aces to beat Spaniard Pablo Andujar 7-6(5) 1-6 6-3.
The American, who lost to Tomas Berdych in the China Open quarter-final last week, won 71 percent of his service points.
“Beijing was great last week,” said Isner after his 38th win of the season. “I had a pretty good tournament. Got my tail kicked in the quarters.
But I’m playing pretty well.
“I’m still alive here. I’m glad I’m not on a flight home tomorrow. It’s all good. Playing better away from the States is something I’m always trying to do and I feel like it’s something I’ve done so far.”
Argentine Juan Monaco downed Portugal’s Joao Sousa 6-2 7-6(4) to set up a second-round clash with eighth seed Milos Raonic.
Grigor Dimitrov, currently 11th in the race to London leaderboard, beat Denis Istomin 6-3 6-3 to move into the second round while Frenchman Richard Gasquet beat compatriot Jeremy Chardy 7-6(7) 6-2.
Gasquet’s second win in two meetings with Chardy pits him against Berdych who was swept aside by Novak Djokovic in the China Open final on Sunday.
Djokovic, Rafa Nadal and Roger Federer are together this week in Shanghai for the first time since Wimbledon having already secured their places at the London season finale.

Stop praising Modi  Kerala Congress tells TharoorUpdated: October 7, 2014 01:17 IST
Stop adulation of PM, Tharoor told
Girish Menon
national politics
State leadership to examine prospects of initiating action against the MP
Congress MP Shashi Tharoor’s pro-Narendra Modi statements have stirred up a hornet’s nest in the State, with several Congress leaders condemning them as expressions of obeisance to the Modi government.
Leading the criticism against Mr. Tharoor, who represents Thiruvananthapuram in the Lok Sabha, Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee president V.M. Sudheeran said that Mr. Tharoor’s persistent pro-Modi statements were quite disturbing, considering the fact that these were being made without consultation with either the Congress high command or the State leadership. He felt that Mr. Tharoor had fallen into the BJP’s trap.
Home Minister Ramesh Chennithala said that it was hard for the Congress party to accept the policy perspectives of the BJP and the RSS. In this context, it was highly improper on the part of a Congress MP to praise the Prime Minister’s action.
Besides informing the party high command about Mr. Tharoor’s intransigency, the party leaders would jointly examine the prospects of initiating action against Mr. Tharoor, he said. KPCC vice-presidents M.M. Hassan and V.D. Satheeshan came out with statements asking the MP to end his laudation. Interestingly, Chief Minister Oommen Chandy was conspicuously silent on the ongoing controversy
Mr. Tharoor, who is at present abroad, had accepted Mr. Modi’s invitation to join the Swachh Bharat campaign as one of the nine brand ambassadors. A couple of weeks ago, he had praised the Prime Minister for his speech in the United Nations General Assembly.
Reacting to the row through his social media page, Mr. Tharoor said he had accepted the Prime Minister’s appeal since it was pitched as non-political one. He was astonished at being branded as pro-BJP. He had a 30 year paper trail published writings on his idea of India and its pluralism. “Being receptive to specific statements or actions of BJP leaders does not remotely imply acceptance of the party’s core Hindutva agenda,” the FB post said.
Mr. Tharoor’s relations with the State leadership have been queasy for some time now. His recent engagements with Prime Minister Narendra Modi through their respective twitter handles and Facebook accounts only served to add to the discomfiture of the Congress leaders. In the bipolar politics of the State, where the BJP has been struggling to find a political toe-hold, hobnobbing with the party’s leader is an anathema.

Nine reasons to believe the Nationals can still win the seriesBy Scott Allen October 6 Follow @ScottSAllen

For the Nationals, it’s win or go home today in San Francisco. Here are nine reasons to be optimistic that Washington can overcome its 2-0 deficit against the Giants.
It’s been done before, most recently by the Giants
Of the 46 teams that have fallen behind two games-to-none since the current divisional series format began in 1995, 29 have gone on to be swept, including the Tigers and Angels this season. Five teams, though, have come back to win the series. The Giants, who won three consecutive games at Cincinnati in the 2012 NLDS after dropping the first two games at home, are the most recent team — and the only National League squad — to do it. The Giants clinched that series on the same day Jayson Werth hit his walk-off homer in Game 4 against the Cardinals. With the revised 2-2-1 schedule, Game 5 of this year’s series would be in D.C.
Doug Fister is on the mound for Game 3
Fister, who established a reputation as the Nationals’ stopper this season, will be making his eighth career playoff start, by far the most of any pitcher on the Washington staff. The Tigers were 2-0 in playoff elimination games that Fister started and he earned the win in Game 5 of the 2011 ALDS at Yankee Stadium. He’s also familiar with San Francisco in October. Fister took the hard-luck loss in Game 2 of the 2012 World Series against the Giants, but he allowed only one run on four hits in six innings.

The Nationals believe in themselves
Werth to reporters after Saturday’s 18-inning loss :
“We’ve got an uphill climb. But I believe in this team and these guys. If anybody can do it, we can. We’ve just got to stay positive and play our game. I really do. I believe we can do it.”
The Nationals are really good after a loss and a scheduled day off

August 27, W 2-1 vs. Miami
Sept. 27, W 8-4 at Arizona
*The Nationals lost a game following a loss and a rain out twice in the past two years.
The Giants are due for a losing streak
The Nationals have 12 winning streaks of three games or longer this season. That includes the first three games of their series at San Francisco in June, during which they outscored the Giants 17-5. Washington has lost at least three games in a row only five times this season, while the Giants have dropped at least three straight on 10 different occasions this year.
The bats can’t get any colder. 
(Weather.com)
The Nationals have 3 runs and 15 hits in 27 innings of baseball this series and yet they could be ahead 2-0. The warm weather can only help the lineup get going.

Fans sacrificed a chicken and burned sage outside of Nationals Park on Sunday
“We’re going to take the bad juju and give it to the chicken, so that when the Nats play in San Francisco…they’re going to win,” Nationals superfan Hugh Kaufman told Let Teddy Win .
Hey, whatever it takes.
Teddy can’t win
Teddy won both Presidents Races during Saturday’s game to improve his career postseason record to 6-0. The Nationals are 1-4 in home playoff games. There isn’t a Presidents Race at AT&T Park. That’s a good thing.
#Nats fans like people with skills, magic skills, Nunchuck skills, SKILLS! #PresRaceChamp pic.twitter.com/Gj36VlOfCB — Teddy Roosevelt (@Teddy26Nats) October 4, 2014
#Nats fans also like Nats wins, Teddy.
It’s baseball
The Nationals and Giants just played the longest postseason game in playoff history. The Royals and Orioles are set to square off in the ALCS. Expect the unexpected. The Nationals can do this.
I’m seeing the Royals run roughshod over the 2 best teams for most of the season and I’m expected to believe the Nats can’t win 3 straight?

Thanks to drought (and politics) in Brazil  coffee futures are soaringBut thank goodness for Colombia(Reuters/Michael Dalder)

October 6, 2014
Meteorologists this weekend issued new weather forecasts for Brazil’s coffee belt region, saying that predicted early-October rainfall won’t be arriving after all. The lack of rain is expected to stunt the country’s arabica crop. Accordingly, coffee futures, which have been climbing throughout the past few weeks, are even higher this morning: $2.21 per pound as of 10:05 am on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

Brazilian coffee production was already hurt  by a severe drought in the first three months of 2014. It rained in July, but now that October has come around it’s time for the arabica trees to flower, for which they need moisture. Without rain, the flowers may fall off without producing the cherries that are later harvested for their seeds, or beans.
A surprising outcome in Brazil’s presidential elections this weekend may also have something to do with today’s coffee futures. The Brazilian real gained against the US dollar after pro-business candidate Aécio Neves challenged incumbent President Dilma Rousseff with 33% of the first-round votes, forcing a runoff later this week.
Neves has pledged to slow inflation, reports Bloomberg , and speculation that he might win the election has given Brazil’s currency a boost today—another factor lifting coffee prices.
Arabica coffee beans account for most of the world’s coffee and are considered superior to the robusta variety. Brazil is the source of about one third of the world’s coffee and one half of the world’s arabica. On the bright side, Colombian production of arabica coffee is expected to hit a 20-year high for its next crop, providing a supply cushion against the Brazil situation.

If a Tree Falls in the Forest  But No Scientist Says So...reddit
Recently, the highly respected Bulletin of the American Meteorology Society ("BAMS" to those in the know), published a special issue consisting of a couple dozen articles investigating the potential impact climate change might have had on various extreme weather events of 2013. This has become somewhat of an annual rite now (see for example the corresponding 2012 special issue ), a sort of scientific postmortem on what role climate change might have played in specific weather events.
It might be tempting to view this volume as an authoritative statement by the scientific community on the role climate change may or may not have had in some high profile, devastating recent extreme weather events. But that would be misguided. The BAMS special issue is not a representative, community-wide scientific assessment like those published by the National Academy of Sciences or the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change . The editors, instead, have solicited contributions from a relatively small number of groups, so the findings do not necessarily reflect the range of views of the broader scientific community. Some leading climate scientists who were not included in the effort have presented evidence of a greater role for climate change in several of the events dismissed or downplayed by the BAMS articles (see e.g. Kevin Trenberth of NCAR on the September 2013 Colorado floods , Stefan Rahmstorf of the University of Potsdam on the June 2013 Central European floods and Jennifer Francis of Rutgers on the 2013/2014 California Drought ).
The California drought is of particular interest since it is both an unprecedented and absolutely devastating ongoing event .  The thread potentially connecting that event to climate change is the unusual atmospheric pattern that prevailed during winter 2013/2014. That pattern was associated with a persistent "ridge" of high pressure over the western U.S. (see my previous Huffington Post piece) that caused the jet stream to plunge southward over the central U.S., chilling the eastern third of the country, and to veer northward over the west coast, pushing the warm moist subtropical Pacific air masses that would normally deliver plentiful rainfall (and snowpack) to California well to the north, resulting in bone-dry conditions in California and balmy weather in Alaska.
In fact, there are at least three different mechanisms that are potentially relevant to the connection between the 2013/2014 California drought and human-caused climate change. There is (1) the impact of climate change on the pattern of sea surface temperature (SST) off the west coast. One recent study suggests that climate change favors an SST pattern in the North Pacific that increases the incidence of the atmospheric circulation pattern responsible for the current drought. Then there is (2) the marked decrease in Arctic Sea Ice due to global warming. Studies going back more than a decade show that reduced Arctic sea ice may also favor such an atmospheric circulation pattern.  More recent work by Jennifer Francis of Rutgers provides independent support for that mechanism. Finally, there is (3) the effect of global warming on soil moisture. All other things being equal, warming of soils leads to greater rates of evaporation and drying. This mechanism leads to worsened drought even if rainfall patterns are unchanged.
One of the three BAMS articles investigating the climate change connection with the California Drought (by Noah Diffenbaugh of Stanford and collaborators) did find a climate change role. They found that the high pressure ridge responsible for deflecting storms to the north was indeed made more likely by climate change. Even without accounting for increased evaporation due to warmer soils, they conclude that climate change likely increased the probability of the 2013/2014 California drought.
Two of the three BAMS articles, however, argue against a climate change connection. But here's the problem: the experimental design used in these studies completely leaves out all three of the mechanisms described above. These studies only looked at the impact of the overall warming of SSTs, without addressing whether climate change might be favoring the specific pattern of SST tied to the high pressure ridge and consequent drought. Neither of the studies accounts for the possible impact of decreasing Arctic Sea Ice (Indeed, one of the two studies explicitly acknowledges this shortcoming: "Other factors, such as the impact of climate change on the...SST gradient and storm tracks... and changes in sea ice extent... are not examined."). Finally, neither of the studies account for the impact of warming on soil evaporation. So, the fact that two of the three studies find no climate change connection may simply point to deficiencies in the approaches used. The adage "absence of evidence is not evidence of absence" would appear to apply in spades here.
Predictably, the conflicting findings and mixed message of the BAMS report led to confused and misleading headlines like the LA Times "California drought and climate warming: Studies find no clear link". Contrast that with Stanford's press release "Causes of California drought linked to climate change, Stanford scientists say" and the Sacramento Bee commentary "Droughts likely to be new normal for California".
I fear that the problem here runs far deeper than the specific flaws in the experimental designs of certain studies. What is most problematic is an over-dependence on climate model "detection and attribution" approaches for assessing the impact of climate change on the likelihood of extreme weather events. That machinery fails when the approaches used in these studies fail to capture real-world processes that may be critical to these relationships. The failure to identify a climate change impact may simply represent a failure on the part of the chosen model to capture real world processes, rather than the absence of a climate change influence on the events in question.
I'm troubled that this latter possibility receives such short thrift in many of the articles in the BAMS volume. Indeed, a quote by UK scientist Myles Allen in the New York Times ' coverage of the BAMS findings encapsulates the hubris by some climate researchers: "If we don't have evidence, I don't think we should hint darkly all the time that human influence must be to blame somehow." Never mind the caricature of his fellow scientists here as furtively attempting, in the absence of any evidence, to blame every weather event on climate change (who are these scientists that Allen speaks of? I've never read any quotes by climate scientists that could possibly be characterized this way). The real problem is the lack of humility among some scientists when it comes to evaluating the potential impacts that climate change may be having on our environment. As leading climate scientist Kevin Trenberth has put it ,  "The environment in which all storms form has changed owing to human activities." Trenberth notes that global warming has already increased the average amount of water vapor in the atmosphere by about 4%, "extra moisture flowing into the storms that produced the heavy rains and likely contributed to the strength of the storms through added energy."
In other words, climate change has fundamentally altered the atmospheric environment in which all weather takes place, and has very likely increased the frequency and intensity of various types of extreme weather, including more intense flooding events, more extensive continental drought, more extreme heat and more intense storms.  Just because an event hasn't been positively "attributed" to climate change in a formal "detection and attribution" study does not preclude speaking about the role climate change may have played, when the event is (a) consistent with expectations in a warming world, and (b) part of a larger trend. A negative finding in an attribution study could be a consequence of deficiencies in the experimental design. And the notion that scientists could possibly publish a peer-reviewed article for every weather event that may have been influenced by climate change is, on its face, absurd.
And so to return to where we started, just as a tree that falls in the forest did so whether or not a scientist was there to observe it, an extreme weather event influenced by climate change was thusly influenced, whether or not a scientist published a peer-reviewed article establishing so. We should keep that in mind when we talk about the ways that climate change is already impacting extreme weather, and likely to impact it further if we do nothing to reduce the ongoing warming of the planet.

The Muslims Date With DestinyOf all the debates raging at the moment, this is the most absurd.
I will summarize.
A growing number of spiritual authorities, from Cairo to Riyadh to Jakarta, have decided, finally, to condemn the crimes of a form of militant Islam of which they had long been far too indulgent.
In London, a movement is growing in which thousands of people are proclaiming, on the Web, their refusal to stand by as murder and serial decapitation are done in their name, accompanied by appeals to holy war issuing from Iraq.
The movement extends to France, where the imam of Drancy, Hassen Chalghoumi -- and now other imams including Dalil Boubakeur, rector of the Great Mosque of Paris -- have found the words to express the horror they feel at the assassination of Hervé Gourdel in the mountains of the Kabyle region of Algeria and are inviting their followers to take to the streets to voice their anger and disgust.
But we also have a band of narrow-minded individuals who, instead of applauding, with pride, this sign of national unity in the face of the worst -- instead of admiring, above all, the courage of these demonstrators, who know that holding up the portrait of a "dirty Frenchman" makes them traitors, apostates, and dead men walking in the eyes of the Islamic State, can think of nothing better to say than that the demonstrators are being "manipulated," "blamed," and "forced to apologize for something that has nothing to do with them."
"In declaring their solidarity," one French commentator observed, "have in fact only responded to a summons and confirmed the suspicion in which they had been held."
I will overlook the contempt shown by these commentators.
I will not dwell on the fact that there are still editorialists on the left who cannot see their fellow citizens of Arab, Berber, and, more broadly, Muslim descent as other than eternal victims, acted upon by history but never making it, incapable of finding their own voice, alienated.
And I will not comment on the sense of humor of those who, on a decidedly ill-conceived website, have dared to compare readers of the Koran who reject the murderous interpretation made of it by the followers of Al-Baghdadi to wearers of prosthetic limbs attempting to distance themselves (sic) from Oscar Pistorius, Martians dissociating themselves from Jacques Cheminade (head of the Lyndon LaRouche movement in France), or women severing themselves from reality TV star Nabilla Benattia.
The truth is that no one has proposed severing from anybody else.
The truth is that, except within the Front National, no one has said that France's Muslims are "suspects" who must establish their bona fides.
But the truth is also that Islam itself -- the Islam invoked by the killers of Mosul no less than by the imams of Lyon or Paris, the Islam from which Daesh has, like it or not, fashioned a bloody standard -- has become a forum for debate, nay, a battlefield, and that Muslims are the first referees of that battle.
Islam against Islam.
A war for possession of the holy names of Islam.
An ideological struggle within Islam between those for whom jihad is a spiritual discipline and those who understand it as a call to murder and holy war.
Consider for a moment the young Muslims in France whom the improvised preachers have invited to join the thousand of their fellow citizens who have already left for Syria and Iraq.
Imagine them tempted by the coalescing jihadist group that they see forming in their town or on Facebook pages that convey the message that being a Muslim means hunting Jews, Christians, Yazidis, and Shiites.
Those young men urgently need real imams, real scholars, to tell them no, that's not what the Koran says.
They need to see other groups, like the one that gathered last Friday in front of Paris' Great Mosque, and hear them proclaim that Islam is a religion of brotherhood and peace.
It is imperative that in opposition to the idea of Islam promulgated by the new sect of assassins -- whose followers, for the time being, continue to grow -- another idea should take root and gather speed. That idea must be supported by powerful voices, and, strong with the authority of those voices, debunk and demolish the contrary idea and push its advocates back into limbo.
To say this is not to insult Muslims but to glorify them.
It is not to mistrust them but to express confidence in their vitality and their ability to stand up for French democracy.
It is not to fall into communitarianism but rather to engage, or to reengage, in politics -- real politics, the kind that pulls apart as well as pulls together, the kind that draws boundaries within ideological formations that our teachers told us should always be subjected to close scrutiny in order to distinguish the two eternal camps of inhumanity and coexistence.
The time has come to treat not just the symptoms but the cause of the illness within Islam that Abdelwahab Meddeb has diagnosed over the past two decades.
This chain of tragedies, this climate of suspended apocalypse, this planetary cyclone within which whirl, among other things, key texts of Islam -- perhaps all of this will be, for those who hold those texts as articles of deep faith, the starting point of a long, heroic march at the end of which the world's third great monotheistic religion will, as the other two have had to do, break with the dark part of itself.
May the Muslims of France not miss their date with destiny.
May the irresponsible commentators who urge them to stay home not succeed in disarming them on the eve of the battle that has been awaiting them for so long.
We are all in this fight. But they are on the front line -- they have to win.

Illinois attorney general probing hack at JPMorgan15
"The risk is phishing" Wexler said, adding that people should be on the lookout. She said that there is no evidence that account numbers, passwords, user IDs, birthdays, or Social Security numbers were taken.
The stolen data is likely to end up being sold on underground cybercrime exchanges to fraudsters who will use it for "phishing" and other schemes. Holden said it is likely to be broken up into groups based on categories such as zip codes, with wealthy demographics going for higher rates. He estimates that lots of varying sizes would sell for between $1,000 and $15,000, with each of them being resold multiple times.
Such information can be used to craft "phishing" emails to seek other types of online accounts, beyond the initial firm that was breached, particularly when combined with personal details from social networking sites such as Facebook, Google, LinkedIn and Twitter, security researchers warned. Details from social media profiles can provide criminals with rich information that they can use to craft convincing "phishing" emails, including information about family, friends, education and work.
"Social media helps the criminals pursue their trade," said Mark Rowley, assistant commissioner for specialist operations for London's Metropolitan Police.
JPMorgan's Wexler said that the bank is not offering credit monitoring to its customers because no financial information, account data or personally identifiable information was compromised.
JPMorgan disclosed at the end of August that it suspected it had been the victim of a cyber attack, and said it had hired outside forensics experts to help it investigate the matter, which law enforcement is also probing.
In a letter to investors in April, JPMorgan Chase Chairman and Chief Executive Jamie Dimon told investors that the bank expects to spend more than $250 million on cybersecurity this year, with about 1,000 people focused on the area. The bank's efforts will grow exponentially in the coming years, he added.

The Moving Image and Assamese Culture: Joymoti, Jyotiprasad Agarwala and Assamese Cinema
Guwahati-based actor and TV show host Bobbeeta Sharma
TOPICS
non-fiction
Understanding Bobbeeta Sharma’s comprehensive overview of Assamese cinema in English.
Just four years after Alam Ara, the first Hindi talkie, hit the screens in Mumbai came Joymati in Assamese (1935). The recently-published The Moving Image and Assamese Culture: Joymoti, Jyotiprasad Agarwala and Assamese Cinema (OUP) by Guwahati-based actor and TV show host Bobbeeta Sharma investigates how director Jyotiprasad Agarwala converted his two-year mission into reality. Perhaps the first comprehensive attempt in English to give a well-researched overview of Assam’s film industry — interspersed with rare old photographs of films, posters, filmmakers and actors — Sharma highlights how an ‘outsider’ turned the novel medium into a vehicle of cultural assertion of the people he embraced as his own. The struggle of Joymati’s actor Aideu Handique is used to highlight society’s posturing towards women. Just 14, Handique was duped into acting. She was lured into a waiting barge on the river near her village, which sailed the moment she got in. When she returned after the shooting she was ostracised for not being ‘a good girl’. A rickety bamboo outhouse was built in the periphery of her parental home for her. Aidue died a spinster in 2002. Worse, she never saw the original film.In this interview, Sharma, also the Chairperson of Assam State Film Development Corporation (ASFDC), talks about her book and what led her to write this. Excerpts:
What drew you to the subject?
In 1995, while teaching in Assam’s Pandu College, I enrolled myself as a research fellow in the Department of Film Studies in Jadavpur University, Kolkata, under the supervision of the Department head Mihir Bhattacharya. I wanted to research on cinema history and Assamese cinema particularly. But I soon got busy hosting TV serials and including the popular Bidexot Apun Manuh on Assamese NRIs, which needed a lot of foreign travel. I had to give up my job and the PhD. But I continued collecting material on the subject with the hope of writing a book. It took me 18 years to complete it but I guess better late than never.
You see Joymoti as an attempt to assert Assamese cultural identity.
I wanted to trace the history of Assamese cinema through the history of our performing arts. Oral traditions, folklore, folk songs and dances were a part of everyday life. With the influx of British imperialism and Bengali culture in its wake, what was once popular gradually came to be looked down. There was also a positive side. It exposed the educated Assamese to the Indian Renaissance. The Assamese youth who went to Kolkata for higher studies drew inspiration from it and began expressing their views on Assamese nationality. This backdrop had a profound influence on Jyotiprasad to connect to a ‘meaningful past’.
His lineage also played a role. His great-grandfather was Navrangram Agarwala, a Marwari trader from Rajasthan who came to Assam in 1829 and embraced Sankaradeva’s Vaishnavism. His son Haribilash Agarwala published the religious texts of Sankaradeva. Jyotiprasad’s paternal uncle Chandrakumar Agarwala was a poet who launched the journal Jonaki, which heralded the age of romanticism in Assamese literature. Jyotiprasad himself was a poet, dramatist, musician, sculptor and filmmaker. So when the Indian film industry was still nascent, Jyotiprasad chose to appeal to Assam’s ‘meaningful past’ through folk narrative of Ahom princess Joymoti. The film showcased all that was essentially Assamese: the sets, the outfits, the outdoor scenes, Japi dance, Bhaona performance, the songs … Joymoti thus became a vehicle of cultural assertion of a people subjugated by colonial and cultural imperialism.
Is the original print available?
Only eight reels were preserved by Jyotiprasad’s brother Hridayananda Agarwala who later gave it to Bhupen Hazarika to make the documentary Rupkonwar Jyoitprasad Aru Joymoti in 1976. This print is available in the film archive of ASFFDC.
Was it easy to find research material?
I recorded an interview with the actor who played Joymati, Aideu Handique, and spoke to Hriyananda Agarwala who was closely associated with the film. I acquired some valuable original newspaper clippings through writer Jimoni Choudhury. I read old Assamese books, magazines, newspaper clippings, as the film generated interest while it was being made and received critical acclaim later. People like the former Chief Minister Gopinath Bordoloi and Lakshminath Bezbarua wrote newspaper articles about it.  
Agarwala once said that the Assamese film industry needs the support of Assamese public. What would you say to that?
True. Earlier, people used to watch Assamese films but that has waned, partly due to the lack of good Assamese films and partly due to competition from TV and Hindi movies. Assamese films have to keep their basic ‘Assamese-ness’ intact to attract audience. However, sometimes, even good films are not watched. About nine years ago, Jahnu Barua said that he would not make an Assamese film because he didn’t get the desired audience support even after his film won national and international acclaim.

The Holy Trail: A Pilgrim’s Plight; Nabaneeta Dev Sen, trs. Soma Das, Supernova Publishers, Rs.225.
TOPICS
fiction
An account of the Kumbh Mela beautifully captures the zeitgeist of the late 1970s.
It’s not surprising that writers over the ages have written extensively about the extraordinary event that is the Kumbh Mela. The latest on this illustrious list is acclaimed author, Nabaneeta Dev Sen. However, her take on the Kumbh Mela is spirited, hilarious and has refreshing feminist overtones.
How she goes there is a tale by itself: Scheduled to attend a literary seminar in Hyderabad, a chance conversation results in a wild urge to visit the Kumbh Mela and take a dip in the holy waters on the occasion of mouni amasvya. What’s wrong with that, you might well ask.
The problem was that Nabaneeta is a young woman who plans to travel alone in 1977. A time when an unescorted woman visiting a crowded pilgrimage was absolutely unthinkable. When she talks about it, her male colleagues frantically try to dissuade her and whisk her away to Tirupati as a diversion. Though sufficiently awestruck by the grandeur of Tirupati, she continues to insist on going to the Kumbh — alone.
Finally, armed with VIP references, a cholera vaccination certificate and a dozen precautionary instructions from well-wishers and her mother, Nabaneeta sallies forth. When she gets there, Nabaneeta, predictably, refuses to approach the Tourist Bureau and press camp for accommodation as instructed. Instead she chooses to travel with a bunch of oddballs.
What follows is not a decorous well-planned trip but a raucous disorganised jaunt that ends with the heroine taking a dip in the icy waters dressed in a heavy Kanjeevaram sari and woollens, and brandishing a sandal in one hand. By the end of her pilgrimage, Nabaneeta has not only attained a commendable degree of spiritual fulfilment but has also acquired two fathers, an uncle, a son and countless brothers, which is more than what even the most devout pilgrims can boast of!
The journey of this intrepid mother-of-two, markedly lacking in piety and decorum, makes for an effervescent read. Though the story is far from original, the inherent humour in her writing and the protagonist’s feisty nature lifts this book above the mundane.
Nabaneeta, self-confessedly lacking in feminine charms but generously endowed with self-deprecating wit, makes for a charming heroine and it is very easy to get swept along in her crazy escapades. Refreshingly frank and fearless, she does not simper while sleeping shoulder to shoulder in an all-male group and thinks nothing of sharing a fire with chillum-puffing sanyasis. A lot of the book’s fun element hinges on the strait-laced middle-class Bengali values and codes of conduct expected of women and it is to translator Soma Das’s credit that she does a splendid job of interpreting from the original version.
Though the language is heart-warmingly simple and straightforward, the atmosphere of the Kumbh Mela is created with vivid details. The zeitgeist of the late 1970s is beautifully captured and certain scenes — Nabaneeta and her dubious companions heading for the Sangam in pouring rain, the heroine lying quietly in a cramped tent while a family quarrel rages over her, looking back at a rain-washed scene of the Kumbh while departing from the venue — stand out in the mind’s eye long after the book is done with.

We Can t Talk About Inequality Without Talking About Talentreddit
This post first appeared on Harvard Business Review's blog, and is posted in conjunction with the publication of the October 2014 issue of the magazine's feature article , "The Rise (and Likely Fall) of the Talent Economy," which can be read in full here .
Anyone thinking about democracy and capitalism today needs to take account of Thomas Piketty's monumental book, Capital in the 21st Century . There lots of similarities between his argument and the one I make in my most recent HBR article. We both look squarely at the same phenomenon -- income inequality -- and have similar interpretations and I am thrilled at the huge positive impact that he has had on this important issue.
There are also important differences -- or complementarities, I would like to believe. To begin with, he is a macroeconomist and as such he sees natural resources, capital and labor as the prime drivers of economic productivity. From this perspective, inequality is a function of the accumulation of capital, which provides control over natural resources, principally land, and allows the capitalist to collect increasingly huge rents from such ownership. I concur that during most of the 20th Century, that was a pretty good way to explain income inequality.
But I'm a business strategist and from where I'm looking, the game has changed dramatically in the past 50 years. Talent has become the critical force in the economic equation, more important than either raw materials and labor, and a worthy if not overwhelming adversary for capital.
To be fair, macroeconomists don't view human resources as completely generic "labor." Many have worked on the returns to skills and returns to education, showing that labor is more highly paid if it is educated and skilled and also that it increases business productivity. However, they don't see talent as a distinctive actor in the economic equation, an opponent of capital independent of labor.
But my take is that talent is now a force in its own right. Every capital-intensive business is threatened by the proverbial two-kids-in-a-garage who might demolish it, without the benefit of either capital or natural resources. Whether they are Hewlett and Packard, Jobs and Wozniak, or Page and Brin, established and accumulated capital has everything to fear from the power of talent. And increasingly, this talent is aimed at taking all the spoils. Its implicit goal is to be the moral equivalent of equity capital. It wants to capture all of the upside. And it wants to turn equity capital into the moral equivalent of debt -- it should earn a fixed return on its investment and nothing more.
To be sure, Piketty does note (with some incredulity) the rise of the "supermanager" as an economic agent but in the end, he still sees capital accumulation by investors as the main source of inequality and the biggest challenge to the functioning of the modern economy. I think that recognizing the importance of talent enhances the quality of the picture. As I argue in my article , managerial and entrepreneurial talent has started to extract a huge share of economic rewards, at the expense of both traditional capital and traditional labor.
The second enhancement that I would suggest to the Piketty narrative is to draw a distinction between the real economy and the capital markets. The real economy is the one in which real companies, individuals and governments buy and sell real things for real prices. Macroeconomists (such as Piketty himself) add up these real transactions to produce numbers like Gross Domestic Product.
The capital markets, however, are not the real economy. The value of stocks and bonds are not directly determined by economic actions or events. They are driven by expectations of future economic actions and events. Market participants imagine what will happen in the future and pay prices for securities -- whether stocks, bonds or real estate investments -- that reflect their beliefs about the future value of such securities. That future may or may not happen but in the intervening time, those who make such projections define the value of those instruments with their shared expectations.
This may sound like semantics, but one of Piketty's key observations is that a vast amount of capital was "wiped out" during the crises of the two World Wars and the Great Depression in between. I see things a bit differently. Yes, hard physical assets like buildings and machinery in France, Germany, and England were indeed destroyed by bombs in the great wars. But those losses pale in comparison to the paper losses on the value of financial securities caused by lower expectations about future economic performance, which is what Piketty observed as the destruction of capital.
In my view, however, paper losses on financial securities don't necessarily equate to the destruction of capital. There is a story (possibly apocryphal) about Hong Kong's richest billionaire, Li Ka-Shing , that illustrates this point. In the middle of the great Asian Financial Crisis of 1997 , a huge one-day fall in the value of Hong Kong's Hang Seng index drove down the market value of his holdings by close to US$10 billion, then the largest one day fall in an individual's fortune ever recorded.
Asked by a reporter about how he felt about this, Li reputedly replied that he hadn't lost a single dollar: "What have I sold in the last day? Before the price drop, I owned a set of assets. After the drop, I own the same assets. I am no poorer. Their earnings prospects were the same the day before and the day after. Had I sold, I would have been poorer, but I didn't." He was absolutely right and the value of his holdings soon returned to more than their previous glory. The same happened to capital in the modern democracies after World War II. The resurgence of capital values in the 1950s was not about the creation of new assets to replace those destroyed by war but rather a re-evaluation of assets that had largely always been there.
The distinction is important because managerial talent is largely rewarded through the expectations market, though equity-based compensation. That opens up the possibility (I would suggest certainty) that managers will focus on shaping (or even manipulating) expectations more than creating real economic value in the form of products, services, and jobs.
The bottom line is that we need a richer story about inequality that takes into account the importance of talent and the difference between the real economy and the capital markets. Saving democratic capitalism from itself will need that understanding, because what's going wrong with our economy is a vicious dynamic in which a talent elite not only appropriates an ever-greater share of economic rewards but also channels its energies away from economically productive activities. To me, the key challenge to democratic capitalism in the 21st century is talent, not capital.

Women in Business: Becky Taylor  Sylvan Learning Franchiseereddit
Becky Taylor has worked in the field of education more than 35 years. She began her career, as a Special Education teacher, serving students identified with mental impairments, learning disabilities and behavior disabilities. In 1988, she became a Sylvan Learning Center franchisee and over the past 25 years has successfully grown her organization of centers in eastern NC.  She currently owns and operates 5 centers and serves on various councils and committees with the Sylvan Corporate Office in Baltimore, MD.  She became the Sylvan National Spokesperson in 2008 when she was chosen to tape a National TV commercial for the franchise organization.  She most recently completed a 4-year term serving on the Sylvan's Franchise Organization Association National Board of Directors.  She was appointed, in 2013, by the Governor to serve on the NC State Board of Education.  She will be inducted into the Educator's Hall of Fame at East Carolina University in October 2014.
How has your life experience made you the leader you are today?
I was second to the oldest in a family of six children.  My parents were divorced when I was in 2nd grade so my mom had her hands full trying to raise us on her own with little financial support.  I am confident that I acquired many critical values that helped me become the leader I am today as I learned first-hand the importance of hard work, commitment, sacrifice, and persistence.  I found out how to be resourceful and receptive to new ideas.  I very thankful for the opportunities I received growing up and know that I have and can continue to help others experience success in their lives.
How has your previous employment experience aided your position as a franchise owner?
I was very fortunate to start working at the age of 14 in a Developmental Day Care Center.  This experience is what led me into the field of Special Education.  I quickly knew I would become an educator and loved the idea of working with students that learned differently.  At the same time, I started working, after school, in my father's business.  That is where I began learning the principles of accounting, setting business goals and managing people.  After graduating from college, I taught in the public schools for a decade and acquired a wealth of understanding about the public schools and teaching students of all ages and abilities.  When I left the public schools, I had the opportunity to work at the University level, where my experience writing grants, directing special projects, teaching and supervising teachers gave me new knowledge that has been invaluable in my role as a franchise owner today.
What have the highlights and challenges been during your tenure as a franchise owner?
I have had many highlights and challenges during the past 27 years as a franchise owner.  I think the greatest challenges include learning how to manage staff and how to delegate.  I am not sure when I finally became more comfortable with these skills, but know that I was still struggling with both managing staff and delegating during the first 5 to 10 years as a franchisee.  Today, I feel very comfortable managing staff but do not think it is a skill that is ever truly mastered.  I continue to focus on how to be a better manager every single day.  I know the people a franchisee has on staff can mean the difference in running a successful operation.  I am fortunate to have highlights almost every day at work because of the families I serve.  Managing a Sylvan offers more rewards than I could have ever imagined.  Some of my greatest highlights are phone calls from parents sharing stories and thanking us for changing their lives.  The success stories are awesome and keep me motivated to continue running the best centers possible.
How is your Sylvan franchise making a difference in the education industry?
I feel than my Sylvan franchise had made a difference by helping others see the value of creating a positive learning environment, building motivation and confidence in learners and how there truly is not a one size fits all when it comes to learning.  I see the education industry replicating many of these principles more today and pleased to think Sylvan contributed to this mindset.
What advice can you offer women who are seeking to own a franchise?
I would encourage other women to become a franchisee.  I would want to make sure they understood the time and commitment it takes to own a franchise.  I would tell them to be prepared to work hard and to reach out to others for support.  Many women try to do everything on their own but as a business owner, it is very important to build relationships with other successful owner.
How do you maintain a work/life balance?
This is probably the most difficult role for a female franchise owner.  When I first became a franchisee, my son was 5 years old and getting ready to start kindergarten.  As a franchisee, I had to work long hours and learning to balance all responsibilities was not easy.   As with many business owners, I have the personality that wants everything done perfectly (including being the best mom and wife), so I had to learn quickly how to organize my life to be the best I could at both work and home.  I had to learn to leave work at work and enjoy time with my family.  It took great planning to coordinate and appreciate all the roles required.  Today, my son is 32 yrs. old and I just became a grand mom of twins. So once again, I am trying to maintain work/life balance because of new demands.  It absolutely can be done.  I will say worrying and complaining about it is not the answer.  It is a matter of taking control of your life and knowing when to say no.
What do you think is the biggest issue for women in the workplace?
Probably the biggest issue in the workplace for women is lack of respect.  I personally have not experienced this problem like many women have, but I think women allow this to become an issue by not asserting themselves in a genuine manner.  We are all people, no matter if we are male or female, so conduct yourself as an equal and be yourself.
How has mentorship made a difference in your professional and personal life?
I have been very fortunate to have mentors throughout my life.  I have always looked for strong attributes in others and tried to learn from them.  I listen and watch people.  When I find someone that I admire and know I can learn from, I slowly continue to build that relationship. There are many individuals that love mentoring others.  I would not be where I am today without the many mentors that have helped me.
Which other female leaders do you admire and why?
On a local level, I admire female leaders such as our State Superintendent of Public Instruction, Dr. June Atkinson.  Dr. Atkinson has a wonderful history in NC of taking on challenges and handling them in such a professional manner and getting positive results.  Her ability to manage people and situations is very admirable to me.  I also admire many other female leaders in the Sylvan franchise community.  I have had the pleasure of being friends with fellow franchisees - such as Susan Valverde (franchisee in Texas) and have developed a trusting relationship with her as a result of our mutual mentoring.
What do you want your franchise to accomplish in the next year?
I want to grow my franchise during the next year in revenue by at least 20%.  I want to open at least one or two satellite locations within my territories in order to offer the convenience to families and to serve students closer to their homes. I want to continue to empower my staff to take on more of the management of the centers and to give them ownership opportunities.

Maruti launches mid-sized sedan Ciazautomobile
Aiming to grab a share of the mid-sized sedan segment, Maruti Suzuki India (MSI) on Monday launched its Ciaz with an introductory price starting at Rs.6.99 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi).
The new sedan comes in petrol and diesel options, powered by 1.4 litre and 1.3 litre engines, respectively.
The petrol variants are priced between Rs.6.99 lakh and Rs.9.34 lakh, while the diesel variants are priced between Rs.8.04 lakh and Rs.9.80 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi).
“Millions of Indians have enjoyed Maruti cars for years. These customers are looking to upgrade to mid-sized sedans. Ciaz is for them,” MSI Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Kenichi Ayukawa said.
The mid-sized sedan has been developed on a completely new platform. In addition to the domestic market, the company also plans to export the car to markets in the Middle East, Latin America and Africa.

Spending time with Jaddu bhai (Jadeja)  Ashwin bhai proved helpfulPress Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: October 6, 2014 4:37 pm
Not even in his wildest dream did Pawan Negi think that he would take a five-for on a stage like the CLT20 final and after producing that unexpected stellar effort, the overnight star attributed his success to his stint at Chennai Super Kings and inspiration Daniel Vettori.
Negi beat the likes of Robin Uthappa, Jacques Kallis, Ryan ten Doeschate with his flight and guile on way to a memorable spell in only his second match of the tournament for the Chennai Super Kings.
“It really was a perfect night for me. I never thought I would get to play the game in the first place but looking at the pitch, coach (Stephen Fleming) decided to field me and I am glad I could repay the faith,” the Delhi-born Negi told PTI after returning home from Bangalore.
It was a remarkable showing from the 21-year-old medium pacer-turned spinner considering the limited opportunities he got during Chennai’s campaign, in the presence of established Indian tweakers Ravindra Jadeja and Ravichandran Ashwin.
“There are not a lot of people in Delhi with whom I can discuss my bowling. That way spending time with Jaddu bhai (Jadeja) and Ashwin bhai in the nets proved quite helpful, even when was not getting a game. And anyway I was told by coach Fleming to be ready for my chance. He said it could come anytime,” said the diminutive cricketer, who has just played two first-class games for Delhi since his debut in 2011.
Though he got the taste of IPL with Delhi Daredevils, Negi says spending a season with the mighty Super Kings has lifted his game by leaps and bounds.
“Initially I was nervous with Dhoni bhai, Fleming, Andy Bichel (bowling coach) and other big names around. But now I am okay with the dressing room atmosphere, it feels like family. Overall it has been a thorough learning experience. You don’t get to bowl to top-quality batsmen that often in domestic cricket as you do in IPL and CLT20,” he said.
While Jadeja and Ashwin are known to use a lot of variations, Negi keeps it simple. He made it a point to bowl slower through the air and fox the batsmen in the flight.
“That is how I have always liked to bowl and will continued to do so. The pitch in the final offered assistance and things went as per plan,” said Negi pointing out to his favourite dismissal of the day when he had Uthappa stranded outside the crease.
Negi still trains with childhood coach Ajay Verma but for the bowling part, he relies mostly on his role model Vettori.
“I am yet to meet him but I constantly watch his videos on the Internet. That itself has taught me so much.” Negi knows the fame and moolah lies in the shortest format but he is determined to prove his worth in Ranji Trophy also.
“Hopefully, I will get to play more of four-day cricket. Doing continued…

HP to split into 2 companies1
“There's still lots of opportunities in other adjacencies, where we don't chase the market leaders,” said Whitman, who will be CEO of HP Enterprise, the business that will sell computer servers and networking gear and data storage to businesses.
Whitman said HP's balance sheet had improved markedly over the past few years, allowing the company to come to the decision to split up from a position of strength.
“This would not have been possible three years ago,” she said, referring to a proposal to spin off PCs in 2011.
Some analysts expressed skepticism about the latest move.
Barclays analysts noted that the sudden announcement in 2011 was disruptive to HP's sales, its sales force and demand.
“If the (latest) decision by HP isn't well communicated or is not well executed, the negative share shifts could be material,” they said in a note.
Analysts at Bernstein Research also warned of “material negative synergies” and one-time costs associated with the spinoff, largely in purchasing but also in distribution. The separation, they said, was fueled by weakness, not strength.
A spinoff of the PC business was last proposed in 2011 by then-Chief Executive Leo Apotheker. HP later ditched the plan - and Apotheker, replacing him with Whitman.
HP said it planned to cut 5,000 more jobs as part of its multi-year restructuring, raising the total under Whitman to 55,000. The company currently has more than 300,000 employees.
The separation will result in a fundamental reshaping of one of technology's most important pioneers, which is on track to generate $112 billion in revenue in the fiscal year this month.
While there were skeptics, many investors and analysts had called for a break-up of HP or a sale of the PC business so that HP could focus on the more profitable side of its operations.
“Shareholders will now be able to invest in the respective asset groups without the fear of cross-subsidies and inefficiencies that invariably plague large business conglomerates,” Ralph Whitworth, former HP chairman and founder of Relational Investors LLC, said in a statement.
Relational owns a 1.49 percent stake in HP.
HP is the latest in a line of companies to spin off operations in an attempt to become more agile and capitalize on faster-growing businesses.
Online auction company eBay Inc, which was formerly run by Whitman, said last week it would spin off electronic payment service PayPal.
“We like the spin and believe it could create additional value over time,” UBS analyst Steven Milunovich, wrote. “In our view, focus is more important than synergies, and it is hard to be good at both consumer and enterprise computing.”
HP's printing and PC business will be led by Dion Weisler, currently an executive in that division. Whitman will be chairman of HP Inc.
Goldman Sachs & Co served as financial adviser to HP. Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz was legal adviser.

New Delhi, Oct 6:  
The Intelligence Bureau (IB) has asked the Department of Telecom (DoT) to block ‘We Phone’ application as it facilitates spoofing of caller id and is difficult to identify to locate or identify actual caller.
“IB has written to DoT around a month back to block ‘We phone’ application which is freely available on Android Play Store and Apple’s application store as it allows user to spoof call,” an official source said.
‘We Phone’ application, which offers call service similar to Skype, allows user to make free calls using mobile internet service to other subscriber having same application.
The application after verifying user’s phone number at the time of installation gives an option to disable the number to hide it.
IB has told DoT that in free version of this application caller id on receiver screen starts with +1777 whereas in paid version any number can be set to display as caller id.
The Intelligence agency has written that the server of We Phone is located outside India and any call made from We Phone is routed through the server located abroad and therefore it is difficult to identify and locate the actual calling number or user.
When checked at Android and iOS, the application is still available and running.

Ivo Karlovic stuns Marin Cilic in ShanghaiMarin Cilic of Croatia returns a shot during his men's singles tennis match against Ivo Karlovic (Source: Reuters)
Reuters | Shanghai | Posted: October 6, 2014 7:32 pm | Updated: October 6, 2014 8:00 pm
U.S. Open champion Marin Cilic made a shock first-round exit from the Shanghai Masters on Monday after losing 7-5 2-6 7-6(2) to fellow Croatian Ivo Karlovic.
After dropping the first set, Cilic broke his opponent twice in the second to force a decider but Karlovic clinched the tie-breaker to seal victory.
Cilic, sixth in the race to November’s elite eight-player ATP Finals in London, had won his last two matches against Karlovic, who blasted 20 aces to his opponent’s nine.
“It’s a gamble with him,” Cilic said of his compatriot. “He goes all in or nothing. It’s always difficult.
“He was serving really well towards the end of the match. I couldn’t get into his serve. It can happen with Ivo. It’s always tricky.
“The game, I’m feeling it’s on the spot. Though I lost today, it’s unfortunate, bad luck, but I’m going with positive energy into the next weeks to finish the season well,” added Cilic who is seeking his first ATP Finals appearance in London.
It proved a good day for big-servers as world number 14 John Isner belted down 22 aces to beat Spaniard Pablo Andujar 7-6(5) 1-6 6-3.
The American, who lost to Tomas Berdych in the China Open quarter-final last week, won 71 percent of his service points.
“Beijing was great last week,” said Isner after his 38th win of the season. “I had a pretty good tournament. Got my tail kicked in the quarters.
But I’m playing pretty well.
“I’m still alive here. I’m glad I’m not on a flight home tomorrow. It’s all good. Playing better away from the States is something I’m always trying to do and I feel like it’s something I’ve done so far.”
Argentine Juan Monaco downed Portugal’s Joao Sousa 6-2 7-6(4) to set up a second-round clash with eighth seed Milos Raonic.
Grigor Dimitrov, currently 11th in the race to London leaderboard, beat Denis Istomin 6-3 6-3 to move into the second round while Frenchman Richard Gasquet beat compatriot Jeremy Chardy 7-6(7) 6-2.
Gasquet’s second win in two meetings with Chardy pits him against Berdych who was swept aside by Novak Djokovic in the China Open final on Sunday.
Djokovic, Rafa Nadal and Roger Federer are together this week in Shanghai for the first time since Wimbledon having already secured their places at the London season finale.

Sonam Kapoor  Fawad Khan to work together in Battle For BittoraPrint
'Battle For Bittora' is also touted to be a passionate love story.
Written by Sonal Gera , Edited by Sarika Sharma | New Delhi | Posted: October 6, 2014 7:01 pm | Updated: October 7, 2014 12:07 am
Sonam Kapoor is riding high on the success of her latest release ‘Khoobsurat’ and it seems another wish of hers is going to be fulfilled soon.
Few days back, the pretty actress was reported saying that she would want to work with her ‘Khoobsurat’ co-star – Fawad Khan – again. Anil Kapoor’s company has, reportedly, purchased the filming rights for author Anuja Chouhan’s bestseller ‘Battle For Bittora’ and Sonam and Fawad have been finalized to play the lead in the movie adaptation.

‘Battle of Bittora’ is a story of a 25 year old girl, who lives a carefree life in Mumbai, until one day her grandmother commands her to contest elections from their province. Sonam will, in most probability, play the daughter of the illustrious Pande dynasty in Pavit Pradesh. Her main opponent, Zain Altaf from the royal family, will be portrayed by the Pakistani heartthrob Fawad Khan.
‘Battle For Bittora’ is also touted to be a passionate love story.
The movie will be produced by Sonam’s younger sister Rhea Kapoor.

Monica Lewinsky turns up... in actor Alan Cummings celeb-packed social circleBy Emily Heil October 6 Follow @emilyaheil
Monica Lewinsky (Mark Seliger exclusively for Vanity Fair.)
It seems Monica Lewinsky is having more fun than we might have imagined. In June, the former scandal star penned a Vanity Fair essay that had us just a teeny bit worried on that front. Yes, she wrote, she was dating, but she’d been gun-shy about guys, unable to find a conventional job, and fearful of paparazzi flare-ups.
So we were relieved to read a mention of Lewinsky in the New York Times’s profile of actor Alan Cumming indicating that Lewinsky’s life isn’t all fearful self-Googling. She’s one of the players in “The Good Wife” star’s “starry social circle,” according to the piece, which finds her a regular guest at Cumming’s dressing room-slash-hangout space for his Broadway turn as the emcee in “Cabaret. ” (On a recent stop, shes wearing “a black tank top and a dark tie-dye skirt” to see her pal, whom she met 15 years ago through Harpar’s Bazar editor Gllenda Bailey.)
In addition to members of the cast and crew, other visitors to the space, dubbed “Club Cumming” (really, there’s a neon sign to that effect), have included James Franco, Cate Blanchett and Woody Harrelson, the NYT reports.

SC panel comes out with guidelines on govt advertisementsPress Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: October 6, 2014 7:51 pm
A Supreme Court-appointed high-powered committee has recommended that names and pictures of political parties and their office bearers like presidents be not mentioned in government advertisements.
Holding that there had been “misuse and abuse” of public money on such advertisements, the three-member committee headed by eminent academician Professor N R Madhava Menon has framed guidelines to regulate expenditure and contents of such advertisements paid out of tax payers’ money.
The report, submitted to the apex court, has emphasised that only pictures and names of the President, the Prime Minister, Governor and Chief Ministers be published to “keep politics away from such ads”.
Sources said the Committee has also endorsed the suggestions of the Election Commission that there must be “severe” restrictions on such advertisements six months prior to elections.
It recommended that a deadline should be fixed for prohibiting their publication and the poll panel should be authorised for the purpose.
The committee, also comprising T K Viswanathan, former Secretary General of Lok Sabha and Solicitor General Ranjit Kumar, recommended that there should only be a single advertisement, preferably by Information and Broadcasting Ministry, in respect of commemorative advertisements, which are given on birth and death anniversary of an important personality.
The Committee said that an amount or budget for the public advertisements should be declared by each ministry and public sector undertaking and it should be audited by CAG.
The Committee, which also suggested that there should be an implementation committee headed by either Ombudsman, or Cabinet Secretary or Secretary I&B Ministry, said government advertisements should not be allowed to the advantage of the ruling party and for assailing the opposition.
Further, sources said that the committee in its guidelines suggested that there should be a clear-cut differentiation between legitimate message of government from that of political message which can be done by enacting legislation.
The committee prepared its guidelines by consulting provision of various countries and having meeting with all state governments and political parties.
The apex court had on April 24 decided to frame guidelines to prevent misuse of public funds by the government and its authorities in giving advertisements in newspapers and television for political mileage and set up the committee.
It had said there is a need to distinguish between the advertisements that are part of government messaging and daily business and advertisements that are politically motivated.
“In these circumstances, conceding that the existing DAVP policy/guidelines do not govern the issues raised in these writ petitions and do not lay down any criteria for the advertisements to qualify for public purpose as opposed to partisan ends and political mileage, there is a need for substantive guidelines to be issued by this court until the legislature enacts a law in this regard,” it said.

Bill OReillys lame excuse for his awful Killing Patton blunderBy Richard Cohen October 6
Fox News host Bill O’Reilly. (Photo by Paul Morigi/Invision/AP, File)
As I just knew he would, Bill O’Reilly has explained why he failed to mention that Gen. George S. Patton, the unmistakable (though somewhat flawed) hero of his latest book , was a rabid anti-Semite who mistreated the Holocaust survivors in his care: The “narrative was tight,” he explained on his Fox News show last Wednesday . To be as charitable about this as possible, I now have to wonder if O’Reilly read his own book.
“Killing Patton” lacks almost any narrative at all. It is a Great Dismal Swamp of a book, with themes suddenly arising from the mist of some researcher’s industrious endeavors. As Lawrence O’Donnell illustrated the other night on his MSNBC show, you can open the book anywhere and find some transparent diversion from the essential Patton story. “Killing Patton” is as padded as a puffy winter coat.
O’Donnell dropped the book on his desk to see where it opened. The passage was a lengthy description of Hitler’s diet. This is typical. I opened the book at random and found a chapter that begins with Franklin Roosevelt’s death at Warm Springs, Ga. We learn what we already knew: that his former – or maybe current –mistress, Lucy Mercer Rutherford, was with him at the time. She quickly vacated the place, lest she be discovered by the president’s wife, Eleanor, who was then in Washington. All of this is better told in Doris Kearns Goodwin’s “No Ordinary Time.” Unlike O’Reilly, she can write.
I flip open the book one more time. Now I am at a chapter that begins with the Potsdam Conference of 1945. “President Truman wants a word with Joseph Stalin,” it begins –and then meanders all over the place. We learn that the “tablecloth and chairs at the negotiating table are bright Russian red.” We learn that Truman is offended when an army officer offers “anything you like while you’re here – anything in the way of wine and women.” We learn a bit about Robert Oppenheimer, who directed the development of the atomic bomb. All of this is mildly interesting, although hardly new, and has almost nothing to do with Patton. He was neither in FDR’s bedroom nor at Potsdam.
Soon, though, Patton would become the commanding officer in Southern Germany and, with the end of the war, be responsible for the so-called Displaced Persons camps in Bavaria and elsewhere. Many of these displaced persons were Holocaust survivors. Patton had contempt for them. He called them “animals” and, in letters to his wife and in diary entries, made his anti-Semitism as plain as could be. Here, in reference to a critical report on the condition of the DPs by an official named Earl G. Harrison, is a sample diary entry : “Harrison and his ilk believe that the Displaced Person is a human being, which he is not, and this applies particularly to Jews who are lower than animals.”
When asked on his show how he could have left out these passages, O’Reilly summoned his inner Joe McCarthy: “The far left is desperate, desperate to disparage ‘Killing Patton’ because they despise General Patton and they despise me. It pains them to see the overwhelming success of the book.” Give him credit for not mentioning communists in the State Department or, for that matter, Benghazi.
But how is it possible to write over 300 pages on Patton and not once mention his rancid Jew-hatred? How is it possible to mention the flower beds at the Potsdam Conference and not pause to cite Patton’s mistreatment of people who, just a short time before, had been in Auschwitz? How is it possible not to mention that Patton ran his camps in such a manner that President Harry Truman, in a letter to Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, said , “As matters now stand, we appear to be treating the Jews as the Nazis treated them except that we do not exterminate them.” Golly, gee, Bill, isn’t that colorful enough for you?
O’Reilly, like Patton, forgets why World War II was fought in the first place – to combat the evils of Nazism. Foremost among the evils was anti-Semitism, which provided the rationale for the Holocaust. O’Reilly could easily have mentioned Patton’s repellent anti-Semitism, but it clearly was not all that important to him. He didn’t have a tight narrative. He has a narrow mind.

Supreme Court declines to hear gay marriage cases185
The court did not explain why it was not taking up the issue. Among the possibilities are that a majority believes it would be premature to intervene and wants to see more lower court action, or that on this deeply polarized court neither the liberals nor the conservatives could be certain of how the issue would resolved and did not want to risk forcing a national precedent now.
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who has officiated at a same-sex wedding, said last month that for the justices there is "no need for us to rush" unless a split emerges in the regional federal appeals courts and one of them decides to uphold a state ban on gay marriage.
In order for the Supreme Court to hear a case, at least four of the nine justices must vote to hear it.
Most legal experts had believed the justices would want to weigh in on a question of national importance that focuses on whether the U.S. Constitution's guarantee of equal treatment under the law means gay marriage bans were unlawful.
White House spokesman Josh Earnest said that "there may ultimately be a role for the Supreme Court to play" on gay marriage and that the justices must make that call. Earnest emphasized that President Barack Obama's view is that "it's wrong to prevent same-sex couples who are in loving, committed relationships and want to marry from doing so."
Opponents of gay marriage said they would continue to defend state bans in court. "The people should decide this issue, not the courts," said Byron Babione, a lawyer with the conservative Alliance Defending Freedom.
In June 2013, the justices ruled 5-4 to strike down a key part of a federal law called the Defense of Marriage Act that had restricted the definition of marriage to heterosexual couples for the purpose of federal government benefits.
But in a separate case decided that day, the justices also sidestepped the broader question of whether state bans violated the Constitution, but allowed gay marriage in California.
The momentum within America's courts in favor of gay marriage reflects a sea-change in public opinion in the past decade, with polls showing a steady increase in support. It was only as recently as 2004 that Massachusetts became the first state to allow gay marriage following a state court ruling.
State officials defending their bans say the Constitution does not dictate how states should define marriage and that there is no deeply rooted legal tradition that supports a right to gay marriage.
When the nine justices ascended their mahogany bench at 10 a.m., they betrayed no concern for the possible uncertainty or confusion arising from their orders rejecting the same-sex marriage cases. Proceeding with the usual practice, Chief Justice John Roberts announced only that "orders have been duly entered and certified" and were on file with the clerk's office.
The justices then heard an hour of arguments in a case involving a police search.

IFC to invest $100 m in Bilt Paper equity
PTI
Tweet
New Delhi, Oct 6:  
International Finance Corporation will invest $ 100 million (about Rs 616 crore) in Bilt Paper BV, a step down subsidiary of paper manufacturer Ballarpur Industries, in lieu of fresh shares.
“BPBV has today entered into definitive agreements with IFC for subscription of new shares worth $ 100 million at an implied pre money valuation of $ 600 million,” Ballarpur Industries said in a BSE filing.
“This will result into a shareholding of IFC in BPBV of 14.29 per cent,” the company added.
Bilt Paper is also exploring the possibility of listing of its shares at an overseas Stock Exchange, the company said.
The subscription of shares is subject to fulfilment of conditions set out in the definitive documents, it said.
In June, Ballarpur had said that BPBV is evaluating and exploring options with IFC for receiving potential investment from IFC, in a combination of debt and/or equity in BPBV and/ or its step down subsidiaries.

Bartiromo: Implications of the big, bad buck

Few market indicators reflect the power of the U.S. economy and stock market as much as a strong dollar. And the deep liquidity and strength of the U.S. economy is clear in how the dollar has traded this year.
"A stronger dollar is likely to be both an economic and market positive," says Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab.
The better-than-expected jobs numbers Friday intensified what has been the hottest streak for the dollar in the 41 years since the dollar index has been tracked. The currency is up for 12 straight weeks, trading at multi-year highs against the euro and the Japanese yen as turmoil around the world sends more assets into the "safe haven" of the big bad buck.
"It means we have the best horse in the glue factory," says Congressman Paul Ryan, (R-Wis.).
Stronger U.S. growth and higher interest rates make the U.S. a more attractive place for investment and triggers even more buying of dollars.  So the U.S. might not be firing on all cylinders yet,  but relative to the rest of the world, it is leading.
To be sure, the once hot BRIC nations — Brazil, Russia, India and China — long perceived to be the growth engines of the world, have slowed considerably from the highs of 10 years ago. Meanwhile the slow, yet consistent stability of the U.S. economy has attracted foreign investors in a world of geopolitical worry.
The U.S. is far stronger than other economies globally,  U.S. Treasury debt yields are relatively attractive vs. Germany and Japan, and there is no shortage of negative headlines from global hot spots in places such as the Mideast and Russia. "So the flight to quality makes sense," says Mark Lehman, president of advisory and investment firm JMP Securities.
The European economy continues to struggle as well, with many investors disappointed that the European Central Bank did not offer any new stimulus last week at their regularly scheduled meeting.  Even Japan, which was among the best-performing stock markets of 2013, has had a tough time this year as a debate rages as to just how strong its economy and recovery really are, in the face of a weak Japanese yen.
But the perceived safe haven status of the dollar has also stoked worry about deflation and whether the U.S. is simply getting too expensive to stay competitive with the rest of the world. The strong currency is a surefire sign that international investors have faith in the slow U.S. economy. But when is the strong dollar too strong?
The strong dollar causes deflation, and a broad index of commodity prices is off 7% from its recent highs, notes Larry McDonald, head of Macro Strategy at Newedge SocGen. As the dollar appreciates, commodities become more expensive for overseas buyers who have to convert their currencies into dollars. A strong dollar makes U.S. exports much more expensive and, as a result, McDonald says, will create a drag on U.S. GDP of 0.375% during the next 12 months.
Third-quarter earnings will begin to flow out in the next few weeks and analysts overall expect Standard & Poor's 500 earnings to show double-digit growth for the quarter, according to S&P Capital IQ. Yet some analysts are questioning whether large multinationals will miss profit expectations and blame it on the dollar because their products are looking much more expensive than their international counterparts'.
"In the short term, there is some risk that third-quarter corporate earnings could be dented by the dollar's recent surge, at least multi-nationals," says Schwab's Sonders.
This is one reason The Federal Reserve is also watching the moves. At the last Fed meeting, Philadelphia Fed president Charles Plosser told colleagues, "The Fed must monitor the dollars effect on U.S. exports and the GDP."
There are certainly benefits to a strong dollar, including lower import prices for things like oil and auto's, as well as cheaper travel for Americans overseas. But that might not be enough as we approach year end and the pressure is on companies to deliver strong profits to justify a red hot stock market.

Antibacterial, or “anti-odor,” clothing is one of those concepts that sounds too good to be true. Yet you can easily find a diverse array of socks , shirts , and jackets with antimicrobial properties for sale online. The garb is advertised as being resistant not only to odor-causing bacteria, but even the very germs that can make us sick.
Sounds great, but what’s the catch? Well, according to a new study by researchers at the University of Alberta, the catch is that they don’t really work—like, at all.
A team led by Dr. Rachel McQueen studied two types of bacteria-resistant fabrics: one designed to reduce the risk of infection, and another crafted to prevent unpleasant odor.
A team studied two types of bacteria-resistant fabrics: one designed to reduce the risk of infection, the other to prevent odor.
The first test measured the antimicrobial effects of three different textiles commonly found in these products, and showed no significant reduction in bacterial presence. The second test showed nearly identical results: no difference in odor or bacterial intensity.
How could this be? How could advertisers make such grand claims with virtually no scientific evidence to back them up? The key, according to Dr. McQueen, is in the way the textiles were analyzed.
In lab tests, researchers actually did observe significant reductions in bacterial activity for both types of textiles. But the human tests—really, the only tests that matter—showed no measurable difference in microbial growth.
“We aren't necessarily seeing the same results in the lab about antimicrobial activity translating into antimicrobial activity when we're wearing them next to our bodies in real life,” McQueen said in a statement.
The reason is likely due to the multitude of variables—from proteins to swear—that could interfere with the antimicrobial properties of certain textiles. The lesson, says McQueen, is to be skeptical of marketing claims.
Other research suggests these antimicrobial materials may have harmful effects on the human body.
"If you're actually buying something that says it's antimicrobial, it may not be," she added. "I think that's important to consider in relation to a lot of claims made about textiles—that is, to be skeptical about the claims marketers make."
Advertising claims aside, other research suggests these antimicrobial materials may have harmful effects on the human body. For example, silver nanoparticles—a microscopic material known for its antibacterial effects—are too small to cling to their host fabrics, and may leach into your skin and cause unknown cell damage in the process.
Ultimately, it's just another reason why you should treat miraculous marketing claims with a hefty dose of skepticism.

A reporter misidentified Kevin McCarthy. So did a lot of Fix readers.By Jaime Fuller October 6 Follow @j_fuller
This is Kevin McCarthy. EPA/MICHAEL REYNOLDS
A few months ago, the Fix published a quiz called " Name that member of Congress, " which showed how hard it is to tell one politician from another. There were 13 questions, and the average person got five -- 5! -- right.
We even had a question about House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), whom a CQ reporter last week confused with Rep. Steve Womack (R-Ark.).
Womack wasn't one of the alternatives to McCarthy in our quiz, but 75 percent of quiz-takers correctly identified the majority leader -- making him clearly one of the more identifiable members (at least among the 13 we chose).
Marin Cogan, in a great New Republic story titled "They All Look the Same!" , noted that even many representatives had trouble telling representatives apart.
Kyrsten Sinema, a new congresswoman from Arizona and the first openly bisexual person ever elected to the House, told me she wasn't worried about trying to learn all the new names and faces. As a professor at Arizona State University for 10 years, she's had some practice. Her method? "I look at clothes -- don't write that down," she said. Some members, like Texas Democratic Representative Pete Gallego, she notes, wear something distinctive, like cowboy boots emblazoned with the seal of Texas. Also: "Some men wear the same suit every day."
The lesson here? If you see a member of Congress, say something. Namely, "who are you?"

Typhoon Phanfone soaks Japan; Typhoon Vongfong next in lineTyphoon Phanfone hit Japan with torrential rains and high winds that killed at least one person, stopped trains from running in Tokyo and canceled flights. (Reuters)
 
Typhoon Phanfone, which lashed Tokyo with 70 mph winds and dumped nearly 20 inches of rain in the mountains, is moving away from Japan on Monday. But another typhoon, Vongfong, is quick on its heels and expected to impact the country early next week.
Typhoon Phanfone made landfall in Japan’s Shizuoka Prefecture as a category one with sustained winds of 80 mph around 8 a.m. local time, and continued to crossed over eastern Japan, including Tokyo, for the next few hours.
Tokyo recorded wind gusts up to 70 mph, and sustained winds around or above 40 mph lasted for about two hours in the city. Over 19 inches of rain has fallen in the mountainous regions of the Shizuoka Prefecture over the past three days, and over 16 inches has been logged in the Yamanashi Prefecture, north of Shizuoka. Tokyo has recorded around 10 inches of rain over the past three days.
In addition to causing hundreds of flights to be grounded, and prompting a halt of ongoing rescue efforts on Mount Ontake, which is northwest of Phanfone’s landfall location, the typhoon has also left several people dead or missing, including two U.S. military officials, according to CNN, who writes :
The two airmen were among four who were washed out to sea as a group of them took photos of big waves on a beach on the island of Okinawa on Sunday afternoon, according to the Japanese Coast Guard. One airman managed to make it back to the beach, but another was found in the water and confirmed dead later Sunday, the coast guard said. The search for the two missing men was hampered by rough seas, said Kadena Air Base, the U.S. military installation where they were serving.

Japan won’t have much time to dry out before the next storm comes ashore. Typhoon Vongfong, which is packing sustained winds of 105 mph and gusts up to 125 mph, the equivalent of a category two hurricane, is moving west across the Pacific after bringing six inches of rain to Guam with 60 mph wind gusts.
The Joint Typhoon Warning Center expects Typhoon Vongfong to strengthen over the next few days, reaching super typhoon status with 150 mph sustained winds on Wednesday. It’s at this point that the powerful typhoon is forecast to make a right hook and track north toward Japan.
While Typhoon Vongfong is expected to weaken from it’s super typhoon status before reaching Japan, it will likely bring heavy, flooding rain to a region already drenched from Phanfone.

Water distress can be addressed with proper technology: ChandyWater distress can be addressed with proper technology: Chandy

Kochi, October 6:  
Chief Minister Oommen Chandy has emphasised the need for using latest technologies for water conservation and wastewater treatment in the State.
Several parts of the State are facing acute drinking water scarcity and clean and safe water is becoming a scarce commodity. This can be addressed with proper technologies, he said.
The Chief Minister was inaugurating the second Indian-German Water Partnership Summit on the subject ‘German Solutions to Indian Challenges’ here on Monday.
He said water scarcity in several coastal areas can be addressed by implementing cost-effective and location-specific desalination plants. The Chief Minister was also of the view that treatment of wastewater needs special attention by using appropriate technologies.
Kerala, with the maximum domestic well density in the world, has around 46 lakh open wells. The State government in its effort to rejuvenate this vital drinking resource has initiated steps to recharge the wells with rainwater.
Though Kerala is receiving an annual average rainfall of three meters every year, due to its topography, 95 per cent of the rainwater is flowing into the sea. Considering this, the government has formulated several schemes for construction of check dams over rivers, streams and canals for water conservation.
The summit was organised in association with SCMS School of Engineering and Technology and Kochi Corporation.

Hyderabad, October 6:  
There is need for making the country clean and tidy, said Union Minister for Urban Development M Venkaiah Naidu.
Addressing a press conference here on Monday, he said Swach Bharat programme was not a political statement but a cultural movement involving all stakeholders, he said.
The government would focus on evolving public-private partnerships for the programme. “The funds under corporate social responsibility initiatives and local areas development funds available for Members of Parliament will be used for the purpose,” he said.
Effective measures should be taken for solid waste management, he said, adding that public-private partnership was required for achieving these objectives.
“I have spoken to all Governors, political leaders, religious institutions and celebrities to spread the message of this movement,” Naidu said.
One should not politicise the scheme and see it as a cultural renaissance, he added.

One buried alive in Guwahati-Shillong highway landslidePrint
Written by Samudra Gupta Kashyap | Guwahati | Posted: October 6, 2014 8:59 pm
One person was buried alive when a massive landslide carried away several vehicles including small cars on National Highway 40 at Umling in Meghalaya, 60 kms from Shillong on Sunday evening. A team of the NDRF, backed up by the state police took nearly 16 hours to clear the road on Monday.
Ri Bhoi district Deputy Superintendent of Police Rymphang Pde said the highway, also called GS Road for the first 100 kms as its connects Guwahati with Shillong, was partially cleared after a night-long exercise by the NDRF, police and local volunteers. “We have cleared a part of the road and regulated traffic since today morning,” he said.
The DySP said while six vehicles were trapped in the massive landslide, all the occupants managed to escape except for one person. The lone victim, identified as one Dhan Bahadur, hailed from Nagaland and his body was dug out from the debris on Sunday evening. A family from Guwahati which was travelling back from Shillong, had a miraculous escape even after the car was pushed away by about 100 metres by the slush.
While the landslide brought down rocks, trees and soil covering about 100 metres of NH40 whose four-laning is still going on, local MLA Jemino Mawthoh blamed the highway construction company engaged by NHAI for frequent landslides occurring in the recent months.
Two major landslides had occurred near this spot on September 22 following heavy rains. On Sunday, however there was no rain, though the exposed hill-slopes had reportedly become soft due to last month’s heavy rains.
“Earth-cutting has been carried out very unscientifically during the four-lane construction, leading to frequent landslides on the Guwahati-Shillong highway. NHAI should institute an inquiry into whether specifications have been followed or not while cutting hills to widen the highway,” the legislator said.

(Dhoni, the current Indian…)
CHENNAI: After the likes of Sachin Tendulkar and Virat Kohli , cricket captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni has become the latest cricketer to own a football team in the high-profile Indian Super League, investing in the Chennaiyin FC ahead of the event starting October 12.
Dhoni, the current Indian cricket captain, has pencilled a deal to be a co-owner of Chennaiyin FC along with Bollywood actor Abhishek Bachchan .
Dhoni was excited to be a part of ISL as he is also passionate about football.
"I used to be a goalkeeper in school and always enjoy playing and watching the game. I wanted to be associated with football so when the opportunity came to be a part of Chennaiyin FC I was ecstatic as this gives me a chance to connect with the city of Chennai again. I have played franchise cricket for this city so I know how supportive they are," Dhoni stated.
He added, "I am sure all the players of Chennaiyin FC will see how much love Chennai gives to their players. The Hero Indian Super League is a fantastic platform for football to grow with so many big names, IMG-Reliance and Star India associated with it. I look forward to an exciting season ahead but at the same time it's important that we develop the grassroots level and produce more football stars in India."

CareFusion gets Becton Dickinson for $12BBecton Dickinson to buy CareFusion for $12.2 billion

The healthcare sector has been rife with deal-making  as companies continue to consolidate in the wake of pressure to reduce healthcare costs under Obamacare. The latest: medical equipment supplier Becton Dickinson, which is acquiring medical products manufacturer CareFusion. The $12.2 billion cash and stock  deal values CareFusion  at $58 a share.
News of the deal boosted Becton Dickson BDX   8% to $124.98 and CareFusion CFN  23% to $56.75 in heavy trading.
The deal “allows us to align our highly complementary technologies and products to address unmet needs in the growing $20 billion global medication management industry,” says Becton Dickson CEO Vincent Forlenza.
“It accelerates BD’s transition from a product-focused company to a customer-centric provider of innovative healthcare solutions with leading scale across the medication management value chain and expanded solutions for patient safety,” Forlenz said. “With the targeted cost savings we have identified and the growth opportunities we see in bringing CareFusion products to more patients and healthcare workers around the world, we expect this transaction to create meaningful value for our shareholders, customers, employees and other stakeholders.”
About 77% of San Diego-based CareFusion’s sales, including infusion pumps, automated dispensing systems,  surgical instruments and medical surveillance software, are in the U.S., while more than 50% of Becton Dickson’s revenue comes from overseas sales.
Becton Dickson says the merger will  provide double-digit earnings per share growth within the first full year of the merger and $250 million in synergy related cost savings  by 2018.  The companies expect the deal to be completed by mid-2015.
CareFusion was spun off from Cardinal Health  in August  2009. In April, it paid out $40 million to settle  Justice Department allegations over sales and marketing practices over alleged kickbacks to doctors for promoting products not approved by the Food & Drug Administration.
The Becton Dickinson merger could result in a $33.2 million change-of-control payout for CareFusion CEO Kieran Gallahue, according to the company’s annual proxy.
Gallahue, who joined CareFusion in 2011,  received compensation valued at $10.8 million in the latest fiscal year and gained another $18.5 million from vested shares and exercising stock options.

Why its so hard to predict state tax revenuesTwenty-seven years of state forecasting errors. (Rockefeller Institute)
It’s no easy task, predicting the future.
For decades, experts have tried to forecast short-term tax revenues and, for decades, they’ve gotten their estimates wrong. Sometimes those errors are small, but sometimes they’re much larger. In fact, the middle-of-the-pack error over- or undershoots actual revenues by about 3.5 percentage points, according to a  new study by the State University of New York’s Rockefeller Institute of Government that shows exactly how off the forecasts can be and what might explain the errors.
While most states had similarly small mistakes, seven had median errors of more than five percentage points. (Actual tax revenues were defined as the sum of sales, personal income and corporate income taxes — typically but not always the largest categories in each state.)
So why can’t forecasters get it right? The researchers identified a few areas where analysts seemed to have particular difficulty forecasting. Here’s what they found:
1. Errors were largest after recessions
Errors were large during and after recessions, with those surrounding the 2007 and 2001 recessions missing the mark by much larger margins than during and after the 1990 recession.
Median forecast errors as share of actual revenues, by fiscal year. (Rockefeller Institute)
2. Small states and those with few industries had bigger errors
Accurate forecasts were particularly elusive for smaller states and those whose economies draw on just a few sectors (particularly oil, gas or gambling). Alaska, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire and North Dakota all had particularly large forecasting errors, for example. The errors in such states also tended to be subject to bigger swings.
In some of those states — Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire, Vermont and Wyoming — the personal income, sales and corporate income taxes also accounted for less than half of all taxes, unlike most states.
Forecasting error by state. (Rockefeller Institute)
3. The earlier the forecast, the larger the error
When a forecast covers two years, the error for the second year is typically larger by well over a percentage point. In fact, each 10-week lag between when a forecast is made and the period covered corresponds with a roughly half-percentage-point increase in forecasting error. Here’s how the authors put it:
The policy implications of the first part of our analysis are clear: States should minimize unnecessary lags between forecast preparation and the start of the fiscal year, and should update those forecasts as close as possible to the start of the fiscal year, as many states do.
4. Corporate income tax forecasts had the largest errors
Corporate income tax forecasting errors were largest. (Rockefeller Institute)
In all but a handful of states, the personal income tax, corporate income tax and sales tax account for over half—often well over half—of all taxes collected. But states seem to have had much more trouble getting it right when it came to predicting corporate income taxes, the authors found. While those findings may have implications for tax policy, there are few ways it can be practically applied, they concluded.
States have relatively little opportunity to reduce volatility simply by restructuring their tax portfolios. Only by virtually eliminating the corporate income tax and significantly increasing reliance on the sales tax relative to the personal income tax could the typical state reduce revenue forecasting errors, and even then most tax combinations would not reduce forecast errors very much. Changing the structure of individual taxes may be more promising, but it can raise difficult tax policy issues. For example, making income taxes less progressive might also make them less volatile and easier to forecast, but that may run counter to distributional objectives that some policymakers hope for.
5. Forecasters seem to err on the side of overestimating
The vast majority of states underestimated more than they overestimated. (Rockefellere Institute)
Only five states had negative median forecasting errors, suggesting that analysts may try to overestimate with their forecasts. That would make sense, as the consequences of crafting policy based on underestimates — having less money come in than expected — are more severe than basing policy on overestimates, in which states find themselves with more revenues than planned for.

In a neighborhood created by airplane tycoon William Boeing during the Great Depression sits a mansion  now on the market for nearly $4 million.1919 NW Blue Ridge Dr, Seattle, WA
For sale: $3,695,000
During the Great Depression, airplane tycoon William Boeing cleared 200 acres of timber from a scenic piece of Seattle and built brick mansions intended for his executives.

The new neighborhood, dubbed Blue Ridge, was initially unpopular and remote.  Rumor has it that the first road through the neighborhood was built to give bootleggers smuggling booze in by boat a path through to the city.

As the Great Depression waned, some Boeing executives began building  homes in the neighborhood . Among the first was Donald "D.R." Drew, Boeing's financial secretary. Drew and his elegant wife built several homes, eventually settling in this modern down a gated drive. Originally, it had an indoor pool.
Courtesy of Zillow
The couple was well-known in the close-knit neighborhood, especially because of a famous, frequent visitor. Bob Hope used to spend time at the house, sleeping there when he was in town and attending parties.
The  Blue Ridge neighborhood is still an enclave for the very wealthy, with a clubhouse and private pool. Since Boeing built the neighborhood, it has filled in to include about 450 homes along winding streets, many with beautiful views of the Puget Sound and Olympic Mountains.

This home, which last sold in 2002 for $2 million, has changed hands several times. It has been completely redone by architect Vassos Demetriou, with a titanium front door and interiors of limestone, marble, onyx and Hawaiian Koa.

The home faces the water, with walls of windows offering a 180-degree view. Inside, the bright white home has mid-century lines, but a decidedly contemporary feel.
Tere Foster and Moya Skillman hold the  listing  for Windermere Real Estate.

The online illicit drug economy is booming. Heres what people are buying.By Christopher Ingraham October 3 Follow @_cingraham
A heroin addict prepares to shoot up. (Spencer Platt/Getty Images)
In October 2013, the FBI shut down Silk Road , a thriving online black market where, with a bit of technical know-how, you could to purchase things like illicit drugs, forged documents and weapons. Think Amazon, but for drugs and other not-so-legal things. The FBI may have hoped that shutting down Silk Road would take a bite out of illicit drug sales online. But if anything, it appears the opposite has happened.
In the past year, dozens of similar sites -- so-called "darknet" markets — have sprung up in Silk Road's place. Just before it was shut down, Silk Road, along with three similar sites, had about 18,000 drug items listed for sale — everything from marijuana to ecstasy to heroin. By April 2014 -— six months later — there were 10 darknet markets listing 32,000 drug items for sale. By August of this year there were 18 darknet marketplaces with 47,000 drug listings, according to data compiled by the Digital Citizens Alliance .
Programmer Daryl Lau wanted to quantify the transactions happening on Silk Road 2.0, currently one of the largest darknet markets. From a purely practical standpoint, he also wanted to know if it was possible to scrape data from these sites, given the complicated security protocols. After "an hour or two of coding" he had a program up and running, and he's written up what he found at his Web site .
Not knowing quite where to start, he limited his queries to nine of the most commonly-used illicit drugs, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse : cocaine, heroin, opium, amphetamines, MDMA (ecstasy), ketamine, mescaline, LSD and marijuana. Taken together, these drugs account for about 28 percent of all drug items listed on Silk Road 2.0. Prescription drugs likely account for the lion's share of the remainder. A survey of the original Silk Road's users last year found that more esoteric drugs, with names like "2C" and "NBOMe", also accounted for a substantial share of purchases .
Among the nine drugs he queried, MDMA was the most popular item by far with nearly twice as many items listed as marijuana, the second-highest. LSD, cocaine and amphetamines rounded out the top 5.
Daryl Lau
Why the strong showing for MDMA? One of the appeals of markets like Silk Road 2.0 is that buyers can rate the quality of the purchased items after their transactions have been completed. If darknet markets resemble Amazon in their ease of ordering, they're more like eBay when it comes to the importance sellers place on maintaining a high rating. Over at Hacker News , user tedks succinctly explains why this especially crucial for drug sales:
It's interesting and probably not surprising that the most popular drug on the Silk Road 2.0 (and probably other darknet marketplaces) is MDMA. MDMA is difficult to find in pure forms and impurities can kill you. If you buy MDMA from a vendor with a 4.9/5 rating, you can be reasonably certain you're getting quality product.
By contrast, MDMA purchased on the street is often laced with potentially life-threatening adulterants.
Aside from the simple ease of use, the seller ratings, which serve as a stand-in for drug quality, are one of the most attractive features of these markets for potential drug buyers. In the run-up to its sting on Silk Road last year, the FBI made over 100 purchases from the market and had the drugs analyzed for purity. As FBI agent Christopher Tarbell explained ,  "Samples of these purchases have been laboratory-tested, and have typically shown high purity levels of the drug the item was advertised to be on Silk Road."
Lau's data shows an average of 29 reviews for each product, meaning that the average drug item comes with a fairly substantial review history to evaluate it by. Beyond that, the reviews potentially allow for a back-of-the-envelope calculation of sales volume overall. Lau suspects that only users who have purchased an item can review it, although this is just an assumption.
"If, indeed every sale can map to a transaction," he writes, "some vendors are doing huge amounts of business through mail order drugs. While the number is small, if we sum up all the product reviews x product prices, we get a huge number of USD $20,668,330.05."
Remember, too, that the items Lau tracked make up only a fraction of the total items listed on Silk Road 2.0, which itself only accounts for about a quarter of all online black market item listings, according to the Digital Citizens Alliance .
The FBI estimates that the first Silk Road did about $1.2 billion in business over the 2½ years it was active, although there's no way to independently verify that number. Based on the current proliferation of darknet sites, it seems reasonable to assume that the majority of this darknet commerce has simply migrated elsewhere.
When it comes to the darknet economy, the general law enforcement impulse seems to be "shut everything down." But as Conor Friedersdorf noted at the Atlantic last year , there's a strong argument to be made that shutting down darknet sites makes the world more dangerous overall. For starters, the emphasis on quality means that darknet purchasers are getting purer, safer product than they would otherwise. This would lead to lower harm and loss of life due to ingesting adulterated drugs.
More to the point, if you're buying drugs online you're not supporting local drug dealers and the crime and violence that typically accompany open air drug markets, particularly in inner cities. By cutting those sellers out of the equation, you're seeing a net reduction in violence overall.
The question, though, is whether the ease of drug access on the darknet will lead to higher rates of use overall, particularly of the more dangerous drugs like heroin and methamphetamines. The overall societal harm from increased use could offset any benefits accrued from the safer online transactions.
In any case, law enforcement agencies and policymakers should think long and hard before deciding to take action against illicit online economies.
Christopher Ingraham writes about politics, drug policy and all things data. He previously worked at the Brookings Institution and the Pew Research Center.

6 Customer Experience Lessons From a Digital Business Pioneerreddit
The New England Patriots may be known for their history of winning, but they also have a long history of technology innovation, which started in 1995 when they became the first sports team in the world to have a website. Functioning as the Publisher and Vice President of Content at Kraft Sports Productions, including the New England Patriots, Fred Kirsch is truly a technology innovator and someone who is focused on digital business transformation.
Fred Kirsch (Twitter: @Fred_Kirsch ) - VP, New England Patriots/Kraft Group
Whether you are sports fan or not, a lot can be learned from Kirsch, our recent CXOTalk guest, who is actively building and deploying new technologies to stay ahead of his field and to enhance the fan experience with the latest and greatest technology. We were also delighted to have Lauren Brousell , staff writer for CIO Magazine join our conversation.
6 Ways to Create Value for Customers with Digital
1. Start with a solid Wi-Fi (wireless) foundation - Jonathan Kraft , President of the New England Patriots, understood before 2012 that Wi-Fi was going to be a cost of doing business at Gillette Stadium because connectivity is expected by the fans and they partnered with Extreme Networks to make it happen. In a day and age where there are more smart phones than toothbrushes in the world, the first step to doing business is having the foundation to allow people to connect and use their phone and then building on it.
The Patriot's robust Wi-Fi network allows them the confidence to offer their Gameday live app to fans, as well as NFL RedZone , live replays and highlights of the game right after they happened and player stats because they are certain that fans will be able to connect. As fans get comfortable with the technology, the sky's the limit from live game day giveaways to expanded in-seat concessions ordering.
2. Know your audience - Everything the Patriots do revolves around creating value for their fans, which starts with knowing their audience. This means putting content wherever they want it, whenever they want it and however they want it instead of making fans come to them. "If our audience is going to mobile, we have to be on mobile and if that means crafting our content a little bit differently for shorter time for consuming it, we have to do that," says Kirsch.
As the Patriots came to realize that being a Patriots fan is a lifestyle, they recently launched a lifestyle section for Patriots.com which is home to digital content that ranges from tailgating recipes to travel guides for away games to stadium fashion. Kirsch shares the fact that a lot the lifestyle content is beating out the straight football content on their site.
3. Provide great digital support - In 2012, when the Patriots installed their Extreme Networks Wi-Fi throughout all of Gillette Stadium and made it free for all fans, they learned that they have fans of varying degrees of technical knowledge, which required a need to have support people in the stadium on game day.
To ensure that all fans have a great digital experience, the Patriot's have Wi-Fi coaches who roam the stadium on game day wearing very visible clothing marked 'Wi-Fi coach'. These Wi-Fi coaches know the ins and outs of the Gameday Live app and interact with fans who are on their phones and need help connecting to the Wi-Fi network. Besides helping the fans, the coaches provide Kirsch with feedback after every game allowing his team to act on it that week and correct it for the next game.
4. Create a unique customer experience - With a waiting list of 40,000 fans, the Patriots are in the fortunate position of not having to worry about ticket sales right now, which allows them to focus on creating a unique experience for both fans at home and those in the stadium. The Patriots are not looking to compete with the cost, comfort and convenience of home game viewing, but they are looking to make the energy, excitement and entertainment of the in-stadium experience as unique as possible.
According to Kirsch, "All the sporting leagues need to be looking at what they can do to make things better for the fans not just at the games, but when they are watching on TV as well, and figuring out how to serve fans better and create more value every year."
Always looking to enhancing the value of the fan experience, the Patriots have short-term plans to partner with Ticketmaster to offer paperless ticketing through smartphones as well as expanding their in seat ordering to the 300 level. Long-term plans include creating apps for wearable devices like the Apple iWatch that allow fans to check stats, developing an app for Google Glass and gearing up to support the new 4D TV's that are coming out.
5. Listen to your customers and solve problems - Fan feedback is extremely important in driving digital efforts for the Patriots. "We have people actually come into the stadium to participate in focus groups, and we also have emails that go out after every game where we pick about 300 fans throughout the stadium to survey their experience and to ask them poignant questions to elicit helpful responses," says Kirsch. Putting into practice what they preach, after learning from fans that they wanted to know where they could find the shortest restroom wait time, Kirsch took the feedback from the genius of the crowd and solved the problem digitally by developing a restroom wait time app.
6. Always put yourself in the position of the customer - When it comes to developing digital technology, Kirsch advices to put yourself in the position of the customer and look for sustainability and ease-of-use:  "I always put myself in the position of the fan. If I was a fan - which I am - would I find this cool, would I use it or would I use it once and then say it's cool but not use it again?"
UI and UX are really important because fans aren't really looking to make their lives more complicated with technology; they are looking for it to enhance what they are already doing and it has to be bullet-proof and easy-to-use.

Hong Kongs students want you to stop calling their protest a revolutionBy Ishaan Tharoor October 4 Follow @ishaantharoor

(Lam Yik Fei/Bloomberg News)
There have been barricades and occupations, hashtags and slogans . But no matter the striking optics of Hong Kong's week of student-led pro-democracy protests, there's one interpretation of events that its top activists insist you should not make: Please, they say, do not call this a revolution.
"We are not seeking revolution. We just want democracy!" said Joshua Wong, 17, a leading figure of the student movement, during a vast rally near Hong Kong government's headquarters, the environs of which have been taken over by protesters since last weekend. "We hope there will be no violence. It would be unfortunate if this movement ended with bloodshed and violence."
Many protesters are bracing for a final day out in the streets on Sunday, ahead of an ultimatum delivered by Hong Kong's government, calling on them to clear out and allow public institutions and officials to get back to work on Monday. It's not clear whether a police crackdown will ensure they are removed from the areas or not.
In the days since the occupations began, Hong Kong's protesters have won vast amounts of  sympathy around the world . Their bravery and ingenuity seemed to present a stirring rebuke to the ham-fisted actions of the local government and the heavy-handed rhetoric of its overseer, Beijing. Amid thunderstorms and pepper spray, images of Hong Kong's #UmbrellaRevolution spread globally. But this has worried some of the protests' most prominent voices.
They are sensitive to how the protests are being received both by other Hong Kongers as well as authorities in the mainland. China's rulers do not countenance such challenges to the status quo; the Hong Kong public, meanwhile, isn't interested in prolonged, destabilizing upheaval either. The idea of a "revolution" on China's doorstep may play well before the lenses of the international media, but it does not help the students, who are seeking reform and practical political gains.
"This is not a color revolution," Lester Shum, the deputy leader of the Hong Kong Federation of Students, referring to the generic term used for transformative poltical movements elsewhere. "This is a citizens' fight for democracy."
The emphasis here is not on taking down an existing system, but securing rights and freedoms many Hong Kongers believe they are owed by Beijing. The recent unrest was triggered after China announced that Hong Kong’s future leader – to be directly elected in 2017 – would only emerge from a slate of candidates hand-picked by the authoritarian Chinese leadership.
In an interview with The Washington Post earlier this week, 17-year-old Wong, a spindly waif of a teenager, rejected comparisons linking Hong Kong's protests with other rebellions in the past, or his own organizing efforts with that of other famous revolutionaries. "No one has inspired me," he said bluntly. "I came to organize the action just because I live in Hong Kong and care about the future of this city."
To that end, the protests have certainly showcased a stirring civic ethic among Hong Kong's youth. Their now hallmark resourcefulness and politeness was very much on display during a mass rally on Saturday, despite the cramped conditions and mugginess of the Hong Kong night. Volunteers at various points sprayed the protesters around them with water mist and waved fans to create something of a breeze. Others linked hands amid the massed throngs to create corridors through which foot traffic could keep moving.
"We are here for each other," said Karen Liu, a university student. "And that's  what matters."

Are we asking for it  reallyUpdated: October 5, 2014 20:06 IST
Are we asking for it, really?
Meenakshi Jayant
social issue
The past month saw Netizens flocking in support of Deepika Padukone after her photographs were reduced to a showpiece on the female anatomy by one English language newspaper. Whether the publication in print of the photograph in the first instance was more appalling or the editor’s vehement defence of it afterwards is a moot point. If a celebrity is judged by the way she dresses, then it’s no surprise that an ordinary person is also judged likewise.
Recently, I decided to head to a pub that my work-mates were insisting on checking out. Not thinking twice about it we headed to the place for a bite and to catch up on office gossip.
As it was still the early hours of the evening, the dimly lit pub was occupied by college students out for a bout of underage drinking, the odd couple or two in the love booths, and other usual sundry characters.
Not long after we settled into our seats, a young girl from the table beside ours approached us to enquire if we were teachers. One of my colleagues replied in the negative and asked her why she asked. To this she very sweetly replied that since it was Teachers’ Day she and her friends thought maybe we had come out to celebrate. Coming from a college student the question was an innocent one as most of us were dressed in our office attire and some even in formal Indian clothes. Most of my friends were amused and one even joked about S. Radhakrishnan sitting in heaven and scoffing at the suggestion of our being academicians. As she turned back to return to her friends, a doubt flashed through my mind, but I quickly pushed it aside as the server arrived with the menu.
Our orders placed, we were just about warming up into the conversation when the server arrived by my side with the menu card in his hand and politely informed me that the ‘Tom Collins’ that I had ordered was actually an alcoholic beverage, and checking if that is what I had actually wanted. Because, how could an Indian girl in a traditional outfit hanging out in an all-girls teetotaller group could possibly be someone who consumes alcohol, much less know that ‘Tom Collins’ is a cocktail? Of course he didn’t say that out aloud, but that is exactly what he meant. To say I didn’t feel denigrated at his question would not be completely true. I gave him the most indignant stare I had ever given someone in my life, but my inherently mild disposition prevented me from articulating my ire. Nonetheless I confirmed to him that it was indeed the ‘cocktail’ that I wanted.
So to sum up, a server and a bartender standing in the prime business district of India’s capital city totally ignored the fact that I could be an articulate, confident working woman who’s completely at ease in their pub — which is by no means an inexpensive one. Instead, they chose to focus on my attire, which for them probably screamed ‘out of place’. That is also perhaps what went through the collective minds of the college kids sitting beside us, which prompted one of them to ask us a question.
A woman’s education, her financial and societal status, are all secondary to her gender. It seems there is an unwritten societal code for women in India which each member of my sex is expected to abide by. And if, heaven forbid us, we are to breach this imaginary code then we should be prepared to face the consequences.
So that is what we do every day of our lives from when we are born to the day we die. The countless girls and women who go out of their houses daily are all open invitations for men to ogle at, to touch, to make passes and to presume that we are dying to be the object of their fantasies. Not to mention the social condemnation for seemingly innocuous choices.
None of us is spared. Not Deepika Padukone who, in the words of her contemporary Sonam Kapoor, “asked for it” by dressing irresponsibly. Nor the girl whose senile boss can’t help himself from dropping hints that he wants to go out with her simply because she is unmarried. And most definitely not the countless nameless girls, who according to a few senile lunatics, seemingly have fallen prey to ‘love jihad — the religious propaganda tool de jure’ because clearly these girls couldn’t love a Muslim man out of choice. In the minds of the menfolk, and unfortunately some women too, we are ourselves asking for it by dressing, behaving, thinking, choosing or acting in a certain manner.
Yes, all of us are asking for it. But it’s not what you think. We are asking you to just let us be ourselves — carefree and without apprehensions. Afford us the opportunity to live with dignity and respect. If that’s too much to ask for, just give us indifference. If that were to happen, I for one will be happy to finally enjoy my ‘Tom Collins’ in peace.

Social media can generate content for advertisers: Expert9
0
Kolkata: Indian advertisers can use social media as a content generator besides utilising it as a new marketing medium, says an expert. "Millions of people all over the world are sharing videos and pictures every day on a number of social media platforms. You can filter out the type of content you need and then license it for use in the marketing of your product," American digital media trainer Mandy Jenkins said during a recent visit to the city.
She said that although the concept is new but is fast catching up in Western countries and India can also learn from their experiences. Social media agency Storyful, where she works, has pioneered rights acquisition for such type of user generated content.
Giving an example she said if someone posts a video of a dog playing a piano, it can be used by some brand. "We use advanced technology to find such amazing pictures, videos, tweets and posts that brands and advertisers can quickly turn to their advantage. Our editors select the best of the content, verify it to determine originality and then contact the user to get it license. It is beneficial for both," Jenkins said.
"Millions of people all over the world are sharing videos and pictures every day on a number of social media platforms," American digital media trainer Mandy Jenkins said.

During an interaction with members of a chamber of commerce, she highlighted how India's growing interest in social media can be useful for business organisations. When asked about how to monitor abusive, hateful or blasphemous content on social media the expert said having strong moderators who regularly talk with users is the best bet.
"There needs to be specific rules and people need to be made aware of what they cannot do. The best of the websites have the best of moderators," Jenkins said.

Leading telcos hike mobile internet rates by up to 100 per cent

New Delhi: Telecom operators have raised mobile internet rates up to 100 per cent in June-September period across country. Airtel is latest to increase mobile rates by up to 33 per cent while Vodafone and Idea have started gradually implementing the increased mobile internet rates from June.
The three companies jointly hold around 57 per cent mobile services market share. While no comments were received from Airtel and Idea Cellular, Vodafone India spokesperson said "Around 2 months ago, we changed the base tariff of 2G for 1GB pack from Rs 155 to Rs 175. This has been carried out in a phased manner across circles."
Airtel and Idea too have increased the rate of 1GB 2G mobile internet pack to around Rs 175 from about Rs 155 GB. Telecom operators generally don't make public announcement about increase in mobile tariff. The change is noticed on their website after the new rates are implemented.
Airtel is latest to increase mobile rates by up to 33 per cent while Vodafone and Idea have started gradually implementing the increased mobile internet rates from June.
#airtel #vodafone #idea #mobile internet
They generally inform their post paid customer through SMS about change in rates of services before their next billing cycle starts. Pre-paid customers, which constitutes over 90 per cent of market, get to know about rate revision when they go to recharge their mobile phone or through website of companies.
Telecom operators are required to report change in tariff to telecom regulator TRAI. Vodafone and Idea Cellular increased rack rate, charged without any offer or scheme, by up to 100 per cent from 2 paise per 10 kb of data usage to 4 paise per 10 kb.
This means on Vodafone and Idea network 1 GB of 2G or 3G mobile internet will cost over Rs 4,000 (from Rs 2,000) which these companies under scheme are selling for around Rs 175.
Airtel started increasing mobile internet rates around first week of September. The company is now at par with Vodafone and Idea in terms of rack rate which is 4 paise per 10 kb. However, the increase is only of 33 per cent because the company was already charging 3 paise per 10 kb earlier.
The 2G data pack rate of Airtel is highest among the three at 10 paise per 10 kb which means cost of 1GB mobile internet usage without any scheme or offer for a subscriber is over Rs 10,000 which company is now selling for Rs 176.

We plan to carve out a niche in decorative paints market: Shalimar CEOconsumer goods
Shalimar Paints, which has a century-old legacy, is now well-poised for a resurrection after a stagnant phase for almost a decade. The Rs.546-crore Kolkata-headquartered paint company has embarked on a new growth and expansion strategy by turning its focus on high-margin decorative business from industrial segment.
Its Managing Director and CEO Sameer Nagpal, who has been at the helm of the company for little over a year now, is spearheading the company’s come back chapter. He spoke to The Hindu about the company’s strategy and focus areas. Edited excerpts:
Where did you miss the opportunity to grow in the decorative segment?
Our strategy in the past was on industrial products. If you look at the market size, Rs.20,000 crore is decorative and Rs.10,000 crore is industrial. The company’s focus was on industrial segment, and, therefore, actions, required for consumer business such as distribution network, dealer and painter engagement, were not taken. With focus only on the industrial segment and due to a combination of other factors, we missed the bus on consumer segment — decorative. But, we are now changing our strategy from industrial to decorative. We are working on the key success factors for this business.
What is the perception about your brand in the market?
We may have areas of weaknesses. But, broadly, dealers will know Shalimar. Of course, the relevance of Shalimar was lost. We have not communicated anything about the brand in the past 8-10 years … like what do we stand for. But, today, we have changed our branding. As far as Shalimar Paint is concerned, people know about it but don’t know what it stands for. Now, we have articulated our positioning as “the art and science of paint”. So, our art and science strategy has two levels. First level is to offer good quality, and second level is to offer value proposition that others don’t. Why are we saying this? Shalimar was South-East Asia’s first paint company.
It has many firsts to its credit. It’s only in the last couple of decades we lost our relevance. We need to regain that. Most of the other paint companies are focusing on emotion and colour, but we want to focus on paint and its quality. If we are able to successfully communicate the new positioning, our job will be done.
How are you re-aligning to support decorative business growth?
Our strategy is two-pronged. First, strengthen the bonding with dealers, and second influence the painters. So, we try for better engagement with dealers and try and give them the assurance that they can grow with Shalimar. Moreover, dealers are also frustrated a bit because they are dealing with only four companies with one player dominating them. They want more players. The consumer research we did revealed that painters have 51 per cent influence on the product.
In no other industry, an intermediary will have such a strong influence. Dealers’ influence is about 13 per cent. Brand’s influence on consumer is only 4 per cent. Though brand is important, it is not driving sales in this business. Here, 10 out of 100 people consider Shalimar even now. We have not advertised in the last many years. Still, 10 people consider. And, two people buy. So, our opportunity lies in how can we make the painters and dealers recommend our brand.
What are the key initiatives the company has embarked on?
We have been investing in strengthening the relationship with dealer-partners as also revamping distribution to improve service levels. As a result of dealer engagement programme, we started a club-dealer initiative.
Last year, our total decorative sales grew 2 per cent. But club dealers, who are 735 out of 8,000-9,000 dealers, saw 34 per cent growth. So, for me, if I can expand that 735 to a larger number, I can grow strongly.
Today, my current club-dealer base is 2,000 plus. In the first quarter of this fiscal, club dealers saw 66 per cent growth. So, my dealer engagement programme is paying dividends. We are now running painter programme, too. It is typically a plan to influence the painters to promote Shalimar.
So, painter programme helps us increase the sales through counters that help dealers to buy more from the company. These are among the initial steps we are doing.
What are your immediate-term goals and targets in decorative business?
At present, two-thirds of our revenues come from the decorative segment. We are targeting growth and improvements in profitability. We plan to carve out a niche in this segment. Initially, we are trying to do a lot of catching up. That is our Phase I strategy, that is, bring the company to the industry level, but in a slightly different manner. Our Phase II strategy will be based on innovation, and we are already piloting that. We believe that paint can do a lot more than what it does today. As we said, most brands talk about emotion. We respect that. However, we have a different thought process.
We gather that south is likely to play a key role in your new growth curve. Could you explain?
In terms of geographical split, we are strong in North India and weak in South. We sense that our biggest opportunity is in South due to higher urbanisation. Also, from a retail point of view, South is an exciting market. South accounts for about 29 per cent of decorative business of the industry.
For us, only 17 per cent of our sales are in South.
We are now looking for South as a market to focus, and our investment in Chennai plant will significantly lower my cost and improve product availability.
The plant is coming up at Gummidipoondi, near Chennai. We are targeting completion of work by January 2015. This plant will be dedicated only to decorative business. All the top end emulsions will be launched from this plant. This will be a mother plant to feed high-end products. Also, we are setting up a new distribution centre in Coimbatore, and this will solve our problem hugely.

Tension eases at Hong Kong protestsHong Kong protesters remain on streets but allow government workers past
By Jethro Mullen, Tim Hume and Elizabeth Joseph, CNN
October 7, 2014 -- Updated 0059 GMT (0859 HKT)
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Demonstrators let city workers enter central government offices
Key road near protest site reopens to traffic Monday morning
Student group says it has met with government representatives
Crowds remained on the streets early Monday, the day authorities had set as deadline
Hong Kong (CNN) -- Pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong ignored a deadline given by the government to disperse but allowed city workers to enter offices that had been blocked last week.
There were no apparent signs of any police action against the demonstrators early Monday, and the protest sites were populated but peaceful.
The protesters, many of them students, have blocked major highways in several key districts for the past week, challenging a decision by Beijing about how elections will work in the semiautonomous Chinese territory.
Violent outbursts caught on camera

Who are powering the Hong Kong protests?
Hong Kong protestors hacked through app
Hong Kong's top leader, Chief Executive C.Y. Leung, had called on the demonstrators to disperse by Monday so that classes can resume at schools and government employees can go back to work at offices surrounded by protesters.
By Monday morning, a key road adjacent to Leung's office reopened, although some 100 students remained camped out in front, according to a CNN staffer on the scene.
The protesters did not block the paths of Hong Kong government workers, allowing them to enter the Central Government Office Building through a corridor the students formed. Workers could be seen entering the building without incident.
Talks planned
The Hong Kong Federation of Students said at a press conference it had met with three representatives of the government to try to pave the way for future talks with Hong Kong's Chief Secretary Carrie Lam, the territory's second in command, to potentially defuse the crisis.
Lester Shum, the deputy secretary general for the students' federation, told reporters that the two sides had failed to reach an agreement, but had agreed to continue the dialogue, which both parties said would be direct and mutually respectful.
He said the students laid out three conditions for future talks: that the dialogue must be ongoing, that the student leaders must be treated as equals, and that real political change must emerge from the talks.
He said the student protesters would continue the protest until they had a productive dialogue.
Addressing crowds at the protests, the federation's secretary general, Alex Chow, repeatedly called on protesters to "add oil" -- a phrase meaning "keep it up" -- as he urged the movement to continue.
The federation also said in a statement that the government needed to take violence against the protesters seriously, and refrain from forcefully clearing the sites -- or the occupation would "certainly continue."
'You can see we all want to stay'
There was confusion Sunday evening as to whether protesters would leave two major protest locations to consolidate their efforts at the main demonstration site in the city's Admiralty district.
The protest group Occupy Central with Love and Peace said on its Twitter account that demonstrators had decided to withdraw from outside the chief executive's office, a key point of tension with authorities.
But after the tweet was sent, crowd numbers at the site grew rapidly, according to CNN staff present, with protesters yelling that it was false information that they were leaving.
Occupy Central also said that demonstrators at the Mong Kok protest site, where clashes have taken place with opponents of the movement, would relocate to the main protest site on a multilane highway near the government headquarters in Admiralty.
But other protesters did not want to comply with Occupy's announcement. They sat on the ground, and barricades were not moved.
Gary Yuen, 30, who has been at the Mong Kok site since the protests started, told CNN that less than 20 people had relocated to Admiralty.
"Today there are lots of supporters," he said. "You can see we all want to stay."
Chow, of the students' federation, told Hong Kong's public broadcaster RTHK it was up to individual protesters to decide if they would remain at the Mong Kok protest, but those who decided to stay should take care for their safety.
Are you there? Share images, if you can safely
Earlier clashes in busy area
Dozens of people were injured as scuffles broke out Friday and Saturday at the protest site in Mong Kok, a tightly packed district of shops and residences surrounding one of the city's busiest intersections.
Hong Kong government figures show that 165 people -- 120 male and 45 female -- have been injured since the protests started last week.
Students and other protesters have accused police of failing to protect them from attacks by people who want an end to the demonstrations.
Police have rejected the accusations, calling them "totally unfounded and extremely unfair to police officers who faithfully and diligently performed their duty at the scene."
The protesters had broken off previously planned talks with the government because of the violence.
Roots of unrest
Demonstrators are upset with a decision this summer by China's ruling Communist Party to let a committee stacked with Beijing loyalists choose who can run as a candidate for the chief executive role in the 2017 election.
A new electoral system will, for the first time, let the city's 5 million eligible voters pick a winner rather than the largely pro-Beijing committee of 1,200 members that has chosen past leaders. But critics argue that the right to vote is pointless if the candidates are handpicked by Beijing.
They complain the Chinese government is encroaching too heavily on the affairs of Hong Kong, which has been governed according to the "one country, two systems" policy since Britain handed it back to China in 1997.
Support for the protest swelled last Sunday, when police used tear gas and pepper spray in a failed effort to disperse demonstrators. The use of such heavy-handed tactics shocked many residents in Hong Kong, where protests usually unfold peacefully.
The Chinese and Hong Kong governments have declared the demonstrations illegal. Beijing has heavily restricted the flow of information on the Chinese mainland about the protest movement.
CNN's Pamela Boykoff, Anjali Tsui, Wilfred Chan and translator Daisy Ng contributed to this report.

Sharekhan s top 12 stocks which can give up to 26% return in next 6-12 monthsAxis Bank
(Rise on daily chart was a…)
NEW DELHI: The Nifty closed the truncated last week on a flat note, but looking at the daily charts we think that the bounce is complete as the Nifty has already retraced 61.8 per cent of the fall, Sharekhan said in a note.
The rise on the daily chart was a three-wave advance which further indicates that the bounce was corrective in nature. In other words, it was just a dead cat bounce.
"In the following week we expect the Nifty to head lower in a series of five waves down. The Bank Nifty has two options. It will either head lower in the wave V down of wave A since it hasn't overlapped the swing low of 15770 or head lower in wave C down," it said.
In either case, the overall trend remains down for both the indices. On the daily chart, the index is trading between the 20-day moving average (DMA) and the 40-DMA, ie 8044 and 7934, respectively. The momentum indicator is trading in a negative mode on the daily chart.
Sharekhan's Top Picks basket, a monthly report by the brokerage firm with a list of twelve stocks, appreciated by 3.6 per cent in September 2014 against a marginal decline of 0.8 per cent and 0.9 per cent in the Nifty and the Sensex , respectively.
For the month of October, the brokerage firm is replacing Apollo Tyres (up 13%) and Persistent Systems (up 28% in the last three months) with Gabriel India and Tata Consultancy Services, respectively, as part of the churn within the auto ancillary and information technology services sectors.
The brokerage firm recommends twelve stocks which can deliver up to 26 per cent return in the next 6-12 months:
Axis Bank Ltd: Target price set at Rs 476
Axis Bank is among the best capitalised bank and is likely to benefit from a recovery in the economy. An increase in investment activity will boost its fee income and add to its profitability.
Considering high visibility of the earnings growth and the healthy asset quality, the stock trades at a reasonable valuation (1.7x FY2016E book value [BV]). The brokerage firm has a buy rating on it with a price target of Rs476.
Federal Bank: Target price set at Rs 142
Federal Bank undertook structural changes in the balance sheet, viz increasing the proportion of the better rated assets and improving the retail deposit base, and is thus better prepared to ride the recovery cycle.
The valuation of 1.3x FY2016E BV is attractive when compared with the regional banks and other old private banks. The expansion in the return on equity (RoE), led by a better than industry growth (FY2014-16), will lead to an expansion in the valuation multiple. The brokerage firm has a buy rating on the stock with a price target of Rs142.
Gabriel India Ltd: Target price under review
Gabriel India is expected to continue to rally, led by a strong financial performance due to a strong growth momentum in the two-wheeler segment and its clients.
A strong traction in the two-wheeler volume, improving CV and PV segments along with the de-leveraging of the balance sheet would expand the margins and boost the earnings in the next couple of years. The brokerage firm remains positive on the demand outlook for the automobile industry and maintains a buy rating on the stock.
Gateway Distriparks: Target price set at Rs 310
The brokerage firm continues to have faith in the company's long-term growth story based on the expansion of each of its three business segments, i.e. CFS, rail transportation and cold storage infrastructure segments.
The coming on stream of the Faridabad facility and the strong operational performance will further enhance the performance of the rail operations. Also, the expected turnaround in the global trade should have a positive impact on the CFS operations. They maintain their buy rating on the stock.
ICICI Bank Ltd: Target price set at Rs 1728
ICICI Bank's asset quality has stabilised and fresh non-performing asset (NPA) additions are within manageable limits. The stock trades at 1.9x FY2016E BV.
Moreover, given the improvement in the profitability, led by lower NPA provisions, a healthy growth in the core income and improved operating metrics, the brokerage firm recommends a buy with a price target of Rs1,728.
Larsen & Toubro Ltd: Target price set at Rs 1840
Owing to poor results in its hydrocarbon subsidiary, L&T reported weak results in Q1FY2015 and the stock corrected significantly. The brokerage firm recommends investors to consider this as an opportunity to enter at a lower price point as L&T is one of the best bets to play the cyclicals (revival benefit yet to reflect in the numbers). Besides, the management expects the performance of hydrocarbon business to improve in future.
Lupin Ltd: Target price set at Rs 1512

CPI (M) demands reduction in diesel pricePTI The OMCs are reportedly earning Rs. 1.90 on every litre of diesel as “over recovery'', the CPI (M) Polit Bureau alleged.
TOPICS

The party wanted the government to transfer the benefit of the big fall in international crude oil prices to consumers
The Communist Party of India (Marxist) on Monday demanded an immediate reduction in diesel prices in line with the “big fall'' in crude oil prices in the international market. Brent crude, the global oil price benchmark, is at a 27-month-low of $92 a barrel.
In a statement, the CPI (M) Polit Bureau registered its protest over the refusal by the Government and the Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) to transfer the benefit of the big fall in international crude oil prices to consumers. Instead, the OMCs are reportedly earning Rs. 1.90 on every litre of diesel as “over recovery'', the Polit Bureau noted.
Referring to the United Progressive Alliance Government's decision to allow OMCs a monthly increase of 50 paise a litre of diesel from January 2013 in view of the spiralling prices of crude in the international market then, the CPI(M) pointed out that the Modi Government was pursuing the very same policy despite diesel becoming cheaper globally.
“Through this inaction, the Government is burdening the people in general and especially the farmers, small scale industries and the goods transport sector,'' the Polit Bureau noted.

Lawsuit based on alleged government targeting of tea party group organizer can go forwardFrom Zherka v. Ryan, 2014 WL 4928956 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 30, 2014) :
Plaintiff Selim Zherka filed this … action claiming that employees of the Internal Revenue Service hindered his application for tax exempt status and initiated an investigation against him as part of a broader effort to penalize members of the Tea Party for their political activities….
Beginning in 2009, plaintiff published newspaper articles and held rallies criticizing government officials for political corruption and “confiscatory tax policies.” Plaintiff organized and supported the creation of the Tea Party, a political party that received extensive publicity in the news media. At some point, plaintiff sought tax-exempt status for an organization he and others used primarily for educational purposes. However, plaintiff claims that defendant Lois Lerner …, an IRS employee, subjected his application to an inordinately high level of scrutiny, forcing him to abandon his efforts to obtain tax-exempt status. [The case against Lois Lerner was dismissed because “Plaintiff has not satisfied its burden of showing that [he] served defendant Lerner with a copy of the summons and complaint.” — EV]
Plaintiff alleges that in 2011, agent Ryan of the Federal Bureau of Investigation … and agent Ashcroft … of the IRS began an investigation into his commercial real estate dealings. Plaintiff claims these defendants issued over 75 subpoenas to his business associates, threatening them with criminal prosecution should they withhold information incriminating plaintiff. Plaintiff alleges that as a result, many of these business associates terminated their relationship with him out of a fear of “running asunder of federal agencies.” He asserts that defendants’ conduct was part of a broader government strategy to penalize Tea Party members for their political speech.
Plaintiff claims to have lost business as a result of the ongoing investigation. Moreover, he claims that defendants’ actions have chilled his political activities, damaged his reputation, and caused emotional injuries….
Plaintiff alleges First Amendment retaliation …. To state a claim for First Amendment retaliation, a plaintiff must show: (1) that the speech or conduct at issue was protected, (2) that the defendant took adverse action against the plaintiff, and (3) that there was a causal connection between the protected speech and the adverse action.” …
[P]laintiff alleges that defendants intentionally targeted him for investigation because of his active membership in a new political party. The First Amended Complaint indicates that defendants initiated their broad investigation solely against plaintiff because of his political efforts, and did not pursue similar investigations against apolitical businesses and taxpayers. Plaintiff’s activities centered on advocating for a reduction in local, state, and federal tax levies. Plaintiff claims that as a result of his political activities, defendants issued over 75 subpoenas to his business associates, and contacted dozens of them individually in a search for incriminating information. Defendants’ alleged conduct appears to have significantly damaged plaintiff’s business prospects and “curtailed his public advocacy.”
Plaintiff has made a plausible showing on his First Amendment and equal protection claims. His speech, which is directed at reforming government spending, is clearly protected. He has alleged facts showing that defendants targeted him for a wide-ranging investigation because of this speech, and that he was treated differently than other taxpayers and businessmen who did not espouse anti-taxation beliefs. Thus, plaintiff has pleaded sufficient facts to state a plausible claim for relief on his First Amendment [claim] ….
Plaintiff [also] alleges that defendants’ conduct is so shocking as to amount to a violation of his substantive due process rights…. Only “the most egregious official conduct” meets this threshold.
The question of whether conduct is shocking in a constitutional sense is highly context specific. In Rochin v. California, the Supreme Court held that the forced pumping of a suspect’s stomach was sufficiently shocking to constitute a substantive due process violation. However, in County of Sacramento v. Lewis, the Supreme Court held that a police officer’s decision to commence a high speed chase of a motorcyclist that resulted in his death did not “shock the conscience.” Similarly, in Cox v. Warwick Valley Central School District, the Second Circuit affirmed denial of a substantive due process claim against a school administrator who reported unfounded suspicions of child abuse to state officials. Likewise, in Lombardi v. Whitman, the Second Circuit affirmed dismissal of the plaintiff’s substantive due process claim where federal officials made public statements erroneously indicating that the air at the site of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks was safe to breathe.
Here, plaintiff alleges that he has been subjected to more than two years of investigation by defendants. He claims that defendants have threatened his business associates with criminal prosecution in order to secure their cooperation in the investigation. Moreover, he claims that defendants have inquired into his political activities and political affiliations, demonstrating a motivation to retaliate against him for his political speech. Plaintiff claims that defendants’ conduct has severely damaged his reputation and harmed his business relationships.
These allegations are disturbing and sufficiently shocking to allow plaintiff’s claim to go forward. While defendants did not subject plaintiff to forced-stomach pumping or other physical deprivations, they have allegedly investigated him for nearly two years based solely on his political message. Defendants’ alleged conduct appears to have jeopardized many if not most of plaintiff’s business relationships, causing him dramatic and permanent harm. Given plaintiff’s low burden at this stage in the litigation, he has alleged facts egregious enough to shock the conscience in a constitutional sense….
I’m skeptical about the substantive due process theory. When an express Bill of Rights provision “provides an explicit textual source of constitutional protection against [some] sort of … conduct,” “that Amendment, not the more generalized notion of ‘substantive due process,’ must be the guide for analyzing these claims.” That is what the Court held as to claims arising out of allegedly excessive force during seizures in Graham v. Connor (1989) (holding that the Fourth Amendment, not substantive due process, should be the guide for such claims). And the Second Circuit has applied this to substantive due process claims in free speech cases as well. But the First Amendment theory sounds viable, assuming of course that the plaintiff can prove what at this point he is only alleging.

Johnny Dronehunter: Defender of PrivacyBy Eugene Volokh October 6 Follow @volokhc
Somehow I missed this video when it first came out two months ago, but I thought it’s a good humorous accompaniment to the recent defense-against-drone posts ( here and here ).
It’s not good serious accompaniment, of course: Shooting down drones over someone else’s property (or over public property) just because you don’t approve of drones, or just for fun, is illegal destruction of property, except in highly unusual circumstances. The strong case for the use of force (nondeadly to humans, though damaging to drones) arises when it is photographing you on your own property, or perhaps — perhaps — when it is following you and deliberately recording you. And of course note that silencers (the particular product being sold in the view) are regulated and taxed under federal law, and banned altogether in some states, so check out the rules before buying one. But that’s just for the people who tend to take things seriously; I don’t think the video is meant that way.
[UPDATE: Sorry, the initial embed of the video didn't work; it should be good now.]

Flipkart fumbles with  Big Billion Day  sale  website crashes‘Marked up’ prices, server crash spoil Flipkart party
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, October 06, 2014

The great deals and discounts that e-commerce majors such as Flipkart, Snapdeal, Amazon and others are announcing in full-page advertisements every day this festive season may not all be for real.
India’s biggest e-commmerce company, Flipkart, in particular earned the ire of disgruntled shoppers by offering some supposedly discounted items at prices higher than what rivals such as Amazon and Snapdeal were offering.
For instance, a MacBookAir 13” was priced at Rs. 56,490 on Flipkart but Snapdeal sold it for Rs. 49,999.
In other instances, the company allegedly marked up the retail prices of some products and then offered “discounts” that brought the selling prices close to market rates.
“But the digital customer is smart. With so many social sites, it will be difficult to pull a wool over their eyes. They will see through any such attempt,” said Sandeep Komaravelly, senior VP (marketing) at rival Snapdeal.com.
To be fair, this practice of ramping up prices and then offering a “discount” was not true for all products, since a few discounts were genuine and lapped up by the customers.
Flipkart’s big festive season sale, The Big Billion Day, overburdened its servers, which crashed within two hours of the sale opening, angering shoppers further. “The traffic was heavy but our server did not crash,” a Flipkart spokesperson said, but refused to give any details.
Shoppers took to Twitter, Facebook and blogging to attack the company’s pricing.
A Twitter user, @Surnell, posted screenshots of what purported to show Flipkart raising prices of a product in the run-up to the sale only to slap a discount on Monday.
Dear @Flipkart Your 29% Discount demystified pic.twitter.com/U7rXfLkBty
— Suresh En (@surnell) October 6, 2014
“We got a billion hits on our site today and achieved our 24 hour sales target of $100 million (Rs 600 crore) in gross merchandise value (industry lingo for sales) in just 10 hours.
We are truly humbled by the immense faith our customers have shown in us,” Flipkart’s promoters Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal said in a statement on Monday evening.
Underlining the fierce battle for customers among e-commerce companies, Amazon, the world’s largest online retailer, bought the domain name “bigbillionday.com” (Flipkart’s name for its sale), which redirects customers to amazon.com and trolls Flipkart.
Monday’s sale brought hordes of shoppers not only to Flipkart but to other retailers as well. “We have seen a 30% jump today and over the last week, the traffic has been 10% higher than what we get very month,” Snapdeal’s Komaravelly.
Amazon spokesperson said, “Today, on the last day of our ‘Mission to Mars’ campaign, we have witnessed a 100% increase in sales since yesterday.
It is our biggest day ever and we believe it is owed to the introduction of Dhamaka deals every hour through the day  and ensuring the availability of the deals advertised.”
Amazon will hold week three of the “Online Shopping Dhamaka” festive celebrations followed by the “Diwali Dhamaka Week” starting October 10.

Modi urges EC to probe approval for Vadra land dealModi urges EC to probe approval for Vadra land deal
Agencies  Hisar, October 06, 2014
First Published: 12:23 IST(6/10/2014) | Last Updated: 18:34 IST(6/10/2014)
Prime Minister Narendra Modi Monday urged the Election Commission to look into Haryana government's approval of a land deal involving Sonia Gandhi's son-in-law Robert Vadra.
Addressing an election rally in Hisar Modi said, "They (Hooda government) know that after the elections,
the son-in-law (Vadra) will not get any clearances for illegal deals. So, in between the election process, they have dared to take such a decision,"
"I think Hooda was pressurised from the top (Congress leadership) to take such a decision," he added.
Watch: Modi hints at Vadra deals in Haryana election speech
The Election Commission, the prime minister hoped, would take "serious note" of the state government's decision.  "I hope they will take appropriate action for any violation of the Model Code of Conduct," he said.
"Despite the model code being imposed for the state elections, chief minister Bhupinder Hooda cleared land deal for the 'damaad' ( Robert Vadra) yesterday. The EC should take serious note of this."
"They knew they cannot do anything after the polls, so that is why they approved the land sale deal in a hurry," he added.
Modi's attack on Vadra came on a day The Indian Express  reported that Hooda government officially legitimised the land deal between Vadra and real estate major DLF.
The land deal in Shikhopur village of Gurgaon had been cancelled by Haryana's former director general, Consolidation, Ashok Khemka.
"It is clear from this decision of the shameless Hooda government that both he and the Congress party have already accepted defeat in Haryana," Modi said in his speech.
The prime minister also launched a scathing attack on dynastic politics, saying Haryana had not seen a government in which political families had looked beyond themselves and their family members.
"We want to make Haryana free from this 'parivaar-vaad' (dynastic politics). In the last 25 years, have you seen a government in Haryana which worked for the welfare of people," he asked.
"In Haryana, the government works only for the chief minister and his family members. All political leaders have been running their shops in Haryana for themselves and their families," Modi said.
Modi also took a dig at jailed former chief minister Om Prakash Chautala's Indian National Lok Dal saying that he "did not need the support of people in jail" to succeed.
Referring to Chautala's statement at a recent rally that he  would take oath as the state chief minister from jail, Modi said, "Some people are spreading lies. Some are dreaming of taking oath from jail, showing old photos with them taken in a certain program."

Equities closed a fifth straight week of advances Friday, boosted by accommodative actions from central banks in China and Europe. That factor could continue boosting markets as sources told Reuters that the Chinese leadership and central bank were ready to cut interest rates again and loosen lending restrictions. Such policy changes in the world's second-biggest economy could spur more market gains.
"The carry-over effect from China, taken with the fact that the U.S. is pretty healthy, and you have a market with a bias to trend higher, especially on the cyclical front," said Mike Gibbs, who helps oversee more than $500 billion as co-head of the equity advisory group at Raymond James in Memphis.
Cyclical stocks - tied to the pace of economic growth - led gains, with the S&P consumer discretionary sector <.SPLRCD> up 0.8 percent. Financials <.SPSY> rose 0.4 percent.
The weakest group was telecom <.SPLRCL>, down 1.6 percent. AT&T  fell 1.7 percent to $34.69 while Verizon  lost 1.6 percent at $49.41 after Citigroup downgraded the stock to "neutral." Both stocks limited the Dow's advance.

Prosensa soared 64 percent to $18.74 while Platinum was up 20 percent at $73.77.
Cimatron Ltd  jumped 42 percent to $8.65 on its heaviest ever one-day volume after 3D Systems Corp  agreed to buy the company for $97 million. Shares of 3D jumped 6.1 percent to $37.31.

Lazy stick penalties giving Caps PK workBy Alex Prewitt October 6 Follow @alex_prewitt
Brooks Orpik played almost seven minutes on the penalty kill against Carolina (AP Photo/Alex Brandon).
The captain came charging toward the boards, hard at Eric Staal, carrying payback Staal had launched himself at John Carlson, checking the Capitals defenseman behind the Washington net, so Alex Ovechkin took umbrage. Try handling 230 pounds of a steamrolling Ovechkin. You might end up like Staal did, pounded into the glass then down onto the ice.
“Absolutely that was the right thing for Ovi to do,” Coach Barry Trotz said. “That showed leadership. That was all about team. The Carolina player cross-checked our guy. Wasn’t necessary and Ovi jumped in. I’m all for that. That shows great leadership and great unity.”
For that aggression in a 5-2 victory Sunday afternoon , Ovechkin was escorted into the penalty box, two minutes for charging and two minutes for roughing. And so the Capitals headed to another penalty kill, the ninth power play offered to Carolina on Sunday night.
“We’ll kill those off all day long,” Trotz said.
The other Capitals penalties? Not so much. The Capitals were whistled twice for hooking, once for holding, once for tripping, once for slashing, once for interference, once for too many men on the ice and, because Nicklas Backstrom happened to fall down, two minutes for “closing hand on puck.”
“Lazy stick penalties,” is how defenseman Brooks Orpik described them, the kind the Capitals have committed in spades this preseason, the kind that has given their penalty kill unit the drilling it desperately deserved.
“Way too many penalties and unnecessary,” Trotz said. “We talked about that. We need to be way more disciplined. Guys had good intentions all night. They were playing the right way, other than the penalties. But it was good from a penalty kill standpoint, to get some more reps. So there was some benefit to the penalties. But I’d rather not. It puts people at risk.”
Risk, Trotz elaborated, by blocking pucks in traffic, a key element of Washington’s new penalty kill system. Versus Carolina and their 14-plus minutes of power play, the clear penalty kill lines formed. Orpik logged nearly seven minutes; Carlson, 6:31. Brooks Laich and Matt Niskanen hovered above five minutes apiece, while Joel Ward and Karl Alzner tallied in the 4s.
Both Hurricanes goals came on the power play: First, an unmarked Jiri Tlusty poked home a rebound and, in third period garbage time, John-Michael Liles fired a high wrist shot through a jungle of bodies which snuck past Braden Holtby’s glove. But for Laich, everything traced back to the penalties committed, and not how the Capitals set about killing them.
“I don’t think we can take as many penalties as we do,” he said. “I think that’s something we have to have pride in. I think our faceoffs on the PK need to be better … There’s still a few breakdowns that we’ve had, come with certain transfers, when a player’s supposed to continue with his speed and the weakside forward fall underneath him, clean those areas up. For the most part I think our guys have done a good job. It’s a new system from last year, so there are going to be a few wrinkles in there, but I thought our guys have done a pretty good job grasping it.”
But how do the Capitals stop taking penalties? Is it as simple as, “Just don’t do it?”
“Yeah they call it a little bit tighter at the beginning the year and…probably shouldn’t say this…it seems to fade as the season goes on,” Orpik said. “Just discipline amongst ourselves. I think we’ve all been guilty of it at some point during the preseason. Just something we have to clean up.”

Nitin Gadkari says journalists should accept packagesPress Trust of India | Mumbai | Posted: October 6, 2014 7:54 pm
Union Minister Nitin Gadkari has courted a controversy asking journalists to “keep the packages (money) they get during the election season” from Congress and NCP.
“In the next 10-12 days, you journalists will have ‘Laxmidarshan’,” Gadkari said at a poll rally in Sawantwadi in coastal Konkan on Saturday.
“Be it reporters or editors, there are separate packages for reporters, newspapers and their owners,” Gadkari said. “Diwali has come. I have one request, keep whatever you get. Eat whatever you can,” he said.
The state secretariat and legislature journalists association flayed Gadkari’s remarks.
“Gadkari’s comments are highly objectionable,” president of Mantralaya Vidhimandal Vartahar Sangh Pravin Puro said.
“Gadkari has said journalists accept ‘packages’ (for election coverage). Due to such statements, the image of journalists gets dented,” Puro said.

Modi and BJP s campaign is like Afzal Khan s army: UddhavUddhav compares BJP campaign to Afzal Khan's army
IANS  Osmanabad (Maharashtra), October 06, 2014

In the worst-ever attack yet on former ally BJP, Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray on Monday likened the ongoing poll campaign in Maharashtra by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's cabinet to an assault by Bijapur general Afzal Khan's army on Shivaji's dominion in the 17th century.
"What are they up to? First Modi comes to campaign, then his entire cabinet team is campaigning for votes in Maharashtra. They are like the army of Afzal Khan trying to conquer this state," Uddhav thundered at a huge public rally in the temple of town of Tuljapur.
He noted out that besides Modi, the home minister, external affairs minister, chief ministers and other top leaders were campaigning for the Maharashtra assembly elections scheduled for October 15.

The Sena chief alleged that their whole intention is "to break the state into pieces" in the name of bringing progress and development here.
"But, the people of Maharashtra will not tolerate such attempts. They (team Modi) will be made to bite the dust," he asserted to applause from the people.
He pointed out that Afzal Khan too met a similar fate when he tried to break up the Maratha empire of Chhatrapati Shivaji.
"Do you want Maharashtra to be divided into many pieces? Then vote for BJP. Do you?" he asked the gathering, which roared back "no, no."
Modi, during his campaign trail, is noted for his interactive connect with the crowds by asking similar questions and eliciting their responses.
Uddhav recalled his previous rally in Tulzapur in the last week of September when many party activists were reluctant to snap ties with the Bharatiya Janata Party.
"The party workers wanted the Sena flag fluttering in Tuljapur and in Mantralaya (the state government headquarters). But what if the seat went to the BJP quota? The workers were still insistenent," he said.
Just then (September 25), news trickled from Mumbai that the BJP had unilaterally snapped its 25-year-old alliance with the Shiv Sena, he said.
"What BJP?... The breaking of the alliance was probably the will of Goddess Tulja Bhavani. I got this feeling," Uddhav said.
However, he acknowledged that if the late BJP leaders Gopinath Munde and Pramod Mahajan were alive, he would not have allowed the alliance to break.

SC panel comes out with guidelines on govtadvertisementsPress Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: October 6, 2014 7:51 pm
A Supreme Court-appointed high-powered committee has recommended that names and pictures of political parties and their office bearers like presidents be not mentioned in government advertisements.
Holding that there had been “misuse and abuse” of public money on such advertisements, the three-member committee headed by eminent academician Professor N R Madhava Menon has framed guidelines to regulate expenditure and contents of such advertisements paid out of tax payers’ money.
The report, submitted to the apex court, has emphasised that only pictures and names of the President, the Prime Minister, Governor and Chief Ministers be published to “keep politics away from such ads”.
Sources said the Committee has also endorsed the suggestions of the Election Commission that there must be “severe” restrictions on such advertisements six months prior to elections.
It recommended that a deadline should be fixed for prohibiting their publication and the poll panel should be authorised for the purpose.
The committee, also comprising T K Viswanathan, former Secretary General of Lok Sabha and Solicitor General Ranjit Kumar, recommended that there should only be a single advertisement, preferably by Information and Broadcasting Ministry, in respect of commemorative advertisements, which are given on birth and death anniversary of an important personality.
The Committee said that an amount or budget for the public advertisements should be declared by each ministry and public sector undertaking and it should be audited by CAG.
The Committee, which also suggested that there should be an implementation committee headed by either Ombudsman, or Cabinet Secretary or Secretary I&B Ministry, said government advertisements should not be allowed to the advantage of the ruling party and for assailing the opposition.
Further, sources said that the committee in its guidelines suggested that there should be a clear-cut differentiation between legitimate message of government from that of political message which can be done by enacting legislation.
The committee prepared its guidelines by consulting provision of various countries and having meeting with all state governments and political parties.
The apex court had on April 24 decided to frame guidelines to prevent misuse of public funds by the government and its authorities in giving advertisements in newspapers and television for political mileage and set up the committee.
It had said there is a need to distinguish between the advertisements that are part of government messaging and daily business and advertisements that are politically motivated.
“In these circumstances, conceding that the existing DAVP policy/guidelines do not govern the issues raised in these writ petitions and do not lay down any criteria for the advertisements to qualify for public purpose as opposed to partisan ends and political mileage, there is a need for substantive guidelines to be issued by this court until the legislature enacts a law in this regard,” it said.

In pics: Residents along Indo-Pak border under heavy  fire  from all frontsComments
It was a night of horror in Arnia village of RS Pura sector in Jammu district, situated 5km from the international border, when Pakistani troops resorted to high calibre mortar shelling on the civilian areas, leaving five dead and 29 injured.
Pakistani Rangers resorted to firing and shelling of mortars on 10 border outposts and civilian areas along the border in Arnia belt from 10pm on Sunday night.

 Five civilians were killed and at least 29 wounded, the heaviest toll since India called off a round of peace talks in September.
The wounded were shifted to a district hospital at Jammu while relatives said they had become easy targets for Pakistani mortars.
“When firing started we thought it would be another routine thing. But, when heavy mortar shells started pounding our homes and heard cries, it was our worst nightmare,” said Soma Devi, a relative of the family that lost four members to the firing.

NEW YORK – The wife of former SAC Capital portfolio manager Mathew Martoma has broken her silence on his insider-trading conviction and insisted he was not guilty.
"He's innocent," Rosemary Martoma told The New Yorker during a Manhattan interview conducted after her husband's September sentencing to nine years in prison for his role in what federal prosecutors characterized as the most lucrative insider-trading scheme in U.S. history.
Mathew Martoma, a former financial lieutenant for hedge fund billionaire Steven Cohen at SAC Capital, was convicted in February on charges that he illegally obtained the secret and disappointing results of clinical tests on an experimental Alzheimer's disease drug in 2008.
He got the information by cultivating relationships with two doctors who had been briefed on details of the testing outcome, prosecution evidence showed.
Martoma subsequently triggered a $700 million sell-off of SAC Capital stock holdings in shares of Elan and Wyeth, the pharmaceutical firms that developed the drug. The transactions generated approximately $276 million in profits and avoided losses, along with a nearly $9.4 million 2008 bonus for Martoma.
Martoma convicted in insider trading case
The prosecution case largely rested on the shoulders of former University of Michigan researcher Sidney Gilman, one of the doctors who testified that he violated secrecy restrictions and shared the non-public testing results with Martoma.
"His story was coerced," Rosemary Martoma said of the now-disgraced researcher, suggesting that Gilman buttressed government evidence on the witness stand in a bid to avoid being prosecuted himself.
She argued that her husband independently researched Elan, Wyeth and their Alzheimer's drug, and then used the data "to formulate a hypothesis" about what the testing data would show.
Gilman may have slipped "on things he shouldn't have," said Martoma. But that was "irrelevant to Mathew's trading."
However, Martoma offered less certainty when asked directly whether her husband met with Gilman at the University of Michigan shortly before the drug test results were made public. It was at that meeting that Gilman turned over the most specific and disappointing data, trial evidence showed.
"I don't think he has a specific memory of it," she said.
Mathew Martoma, who declined to speak during his trial or at his sentencing, similarly elected to have his wife answer interview questions about his prosecution and conviction.
She insisted her husband had no potentially incriminating evidence against Cohen, who was not charged in the case. And she added "there is not, and never was, and never will be, any discussion of Steve Cohen taking care of us" in exchange for her husband's silence.
Martoma's attorneys filed a motion on Friday asking U.S. District Judge Paul Gardephe to stay the former portfolio manager's scheduled Nov. 10 surrender date and allow him to remain free pending appeal of the conviction.

The healthcare sector has been rife with deal-making  as companies continue to consolidate in the wake of pressure to reduce healthcare costs under Obamacare. The latest: medical equipment supplier Becton Dickinson, which is acquiring medical products manufacturer CareFusion. The $12.2 billion cash and stock  deal values CareFusion  at $58 a share.
News of the deal boosted Becton Dickson BDX   8% to $124.98 and CareFusion CFN  23% to $56.75 in heavy trading.
The deal “allows us to align our highly complementary technologies and products to address unmet needs in the growing $20 billion global medication management industry,” says Becton Dickson CEO Vincent Forlenza.
“It accelerates BD’s transition from a product-focused company to a customer-centric provider of innovative healthcare solutions with leading scale across the medication management value chain and expanded solutions for patient safety,” Forlenz said. “With the targeted cost savings we have identified and the growth opportunities we see in bringing CareFusion products to more patients and healthcare workers around the world, we expect this transaction to create meaningful value for our shareholders, customers, employees and other stakeholders.”
About 77% of San Diego-based CareFusion’s sales, including infusion pumps, automated dispensing systems,  surgical instruments and medical surveillance software, are in the U.S., while more than 50% of Becton Dickson’s revenue comes from overseas sales.
Becton Dickson says the merger will  provide double-digit earnings per share growth within the first full year of the merger and $250 million in synergy related cost savings  by 2018.  The companies expect the deal to be completed by mid-2015.
CareFusion was spun off from Cardinal Health  in August  2009. In April, it paid out $40 million to settle  Justice Department allegations over sales and marketing practices over alleged kickbacks to doctors for promoting products not approved by the Food & Drug Administration.
The Becton Dickinson merger could result in a $33.2 million change-of-control payout for CareFusion CEO Kieran Gallahue, according to the company’s annual proxy.
Gallahue, who joined CareFusion in 2011,  received compensation valued at $10.8 million in the latest fiscal year and gained another $18.5 million from vested shares and exercising stock options.

Narendra Modi wants to convert Mumbai into Ahmedabad: Chhagan Bhujbal12
0
Yavatmal: Hitting out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, NCP leader Chhagan Bhujbal on Monday said that Modi is gradually turning out to be the "PM of Gujarat" and wants to convert Mumbai into Ahmedabad.
"Modi is gradually emerging as the Prime Minister of Gujarat and wants to convert Mumbai into Ahmedabad. On what grounds is Modi claiming that Gujarat is ahead of Maharashtra?" Bhujbal said during an election rally of NCP candidate Sandeep Bajoria.
At a public rally in Gondia on Sunday, Modi had said like Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, where voters had given the BJP a full majority, Maharashtra could be the number one state in the country.
"Modi is gradually emerging as the Prime Minister of Gujarat and wants to convert Mumbai into Ahmedabad. On what grounds is Modi claiming that Gujarat is ahead of Maharashtra?" Bhujbal said.
#narendra modi #chhagan bhujbal #ncp #bjp
Responding to it, the NCP leader asked, "What does Modi want to convey by assuring development of Maharashtra in general and Mumbai in particular? Maharashtra is already number one state and hence there is no question of developing Mumbai on the lines of Ahmedabad." He accused Modi of creating a media hype and using every opportunity for his personal gains. Targetting Gujarat Chief Minister Anandi Patel for inviting investors to invest in Gujarat during a programme in Mumbai, Bhujbal said, "How can it be justified that she invited industrialists from Mumbai to set up their businesses in Gujarat?" On the Centre's proposed bullet train project between Mumbai and Ahmedabad, the former Maharashtra minister asked, "What is the use of starting a bullet train between Mumbai and Ahmedabad? Instead, they can go for the Mumbai-New Delhi, New Delhi-Kolkata or New Delhi-Chennai routes." Reacting to Modi's recent remarks that NCP chief Sharad Pawar chose the Rajya Sabha route and did not contest Lok Sabha polls as he was aware that the "ship (UPA government) was sinking", Bhujbal challenged Modi to contest an election from Baramati constituency, the hometown of the former Union Agriculture Minister. (MORE) PTI CORR NSK NP PRM 10061955
Accusing the Maharashtra BJP leaders of being "submissive" to Modi, the NCP leader sought to know why Shiv Sena is still a part of the central government. Bhujbal also attacked former CM Prithviraj Chavan saying that he failed to take any decisions during his tenure. "Maharashtra needs a Chief Minister who can take quick decisions. Prithviraj Chavan did not take any decisions in the last four-and-half-a-years," Bhujbal said. PTI COR NP PRM 10061955

Further, it was said that wherever needed, extra attention be paid to different development works in this area. They were accompanied by other senior officials of different departments.
The BJP-led NDMC as part of the Modi government's ambitious 'Swachh Bharat Mission' has taken up a sanitation drive on a long-term basis. The civic body's employees on Gandhi Jayanti had also vowed to dedicate 100 hours in a year for keeping their surroundings, offices and colonies clean, neat and tidy.

This is the post-Murdoch-takeover-offer era at Time Warner.
Jeffrey Bewkes, Time Warner's CEO, rebuffed Rupert Murdoch's summer offer of $85 a share — an offer many observers believed would have gone to $90 a share — by setting a near-term goal for moving the share price to $100 and positioning this 25% jump as something of a casual layup.
In fact, the fast way to $100 a share is the kind of deep cost-cutting that this relatively complaisant company has never been known for. This includes, as an order of magnitude, what knowledgeable insiders report is a call to slice $100 million out of CNN's annual budget of nearly $750 million.
Wolff: What next for CNN?
In one view, this is an assault on CNN's long-established and fundamental ways of gathering news — its global footprint strategy. In another view, it is the start of a broader transformation of Time Warner's vast, complex and internecine bureaucracy.
In either case, these are tasks and challenges — rethinking news and reforming its own systems — quite at odds with the company's entrenched nature, instincts and management style.

Indeed, Bewkes' approach in his eight years as Time Warner's CEO has been to stay resolutely out of the weeds of trying to reform what was once the world's largest, and is arguably still the most fractious, media company. This has been his unique talent, to stay out of reach of the tar baby, to manage the mess by navigating around it, and then selling off the most troublesome and recalcitrant pieces — the music company, the cable company, AOL and the Time Inc. magazines.
Each of those units presented intractable management problems. The Bewkes solution was to wash his hands of them.
But now Murdoch has in effect handed these same sort of problems back to Bewkes. By not offloading the mess to Murdoch, Bewkes, in order to quickly reach $100 a share, has to actually change the place.
It is hard to get more down in the muck than at CNN, a particular bureaucratic knot within Time Warner's larger bureaucratic morass, ever resistant to efforts to make it more competitive in a changing cable news world.
CNN, like most of Time Warner's businesses, has a classic legacy problem. Its former success and vaunted brand puts the premium on maintaining what it is, making it unyielding to any plan to make it something else. In fact, CNN continues to make a lot of money: $350 million last year. And Bewkes, by most reports, has been mostly satisfied with CNN's earning power and careful not to tamper with it. Pay no attention to the fact that Fox News makes three times that.
The network's long drift into prime-time irrelevance has been, according to insiders, less a financial issue (CNN receives high cable fees precisely because it is not Fox — it's the necessary counterpoint) than an issue of tortuously bad press. The blowback, not the ratings, have embarrassed Bewkes.
In 2012, Bewkes reluctantly pushed out CNN's longtime president, Jim Walton, and then, after a belabored search, hired Jeff Zucker, NBC's former chief, to overhaul the news network.
But in Time Warner fashion, CNN remains part of a legacy corporate structure that locks it into the Turner fiefdom — that self-protecting holdover of the Ted Turner era still located in Atlanta. Almost immediately, Zucker incurred the enmity of the Atlanta brass by moving pivotal parts of the CNN operation to New York. Atlanta's reflexive and continuing obstruction of Zucker included blocking the selection of his choice for deputy, Gary Ginsberg, not least of all because Ginsberg, an executive in Bewkes' inner circle, might have increased Zucker's leverage. Bewkes, in turn, moved out Turner chief Phil Kent, replacing him with Time Warner CFO John Martin.
Wolff: The rise and fall of Time Warner
While Zucker and Martin had previously been collegial — even, according to some, allies — they almost immediately became the top two contenders to replace the 62-year-old Bewkes on his retirement. (While Bewkes may be able to extend his retirement past 65, he will surely have to have a successor in place by then.)
The nature of the bureaucratic battle is clear: Martin is the financial engineer who may know little about the true nature of the television business but can cut costs; Zucker, if he can move the ratings needle, might then represent the triumph of showmanship and programming, and be the favorite to run a major media company.
Right now, Martin has the upper hand, helped by the Murdoch challenge and Bewkes' need to demonstrate quick results. Martin's program, something of a desperate one, is called "Turner 2020" and is meant to slash across all the Turner properties as well as CNN. And yet, in the bureaucratic rules of war, Martin's public slashing exposes him, thereby giving Zucker someone to blame for what most people see as the inevitability of CNN's continuing decline. Hence, Bewkes' sudden need to actually change the company, and upset everybody's apple cart, may well be a gift to Zucker, one of the most practiced survivors in the television business.
All of this backstabbing, strategic upending and certain low-grade civil war — already the traditional television side, Zucker's side, has largely thrown over the once ascendant digital side, run out of Atlanta — is exactly what Bewkes has for so long so adroitly steered clear of, always careful not to provoke the beast. And, indeed, there are people around Bewkes who believe he has so little appetite for such a fight that he will revert to type and sell CNN.
Meanwhile, Murdoch, seldom at a loss for how to deal with bureaucratic intransigence and intrigue, waits.

HP splits: Who s next
The court confirms it: The gay marriage fight is overBy Chris Cillizza October 6 Follow @thefix
The Supreme Court's refusal to take up challenges to laws legalizing gay marriage in five states has an immediate impact: Gay couples in those states can now wed.  But it has a longer-term impact too; it's another piece of evidence that the fight over gay marriage is effectively over in this country.
Politically speaking, this has been true for some time — a reality largely due to a massive shift in public opinion on the issue, which occurred in late 2011 and accelerated over the intervening years.  Here's The Post's trend data on the question of whether gay people should be able to marry:
Gallup's long-term trend on the question shows similar movement . (The first time Gallup showed a majority supporting same-sex marriage was in May 2011 .)
The trend line in the charts above is pretty clear. But even those charts undersell the steady march of public opinion toward acceptance of legalization of gay marriage. The other key factor to consider in understanding that movement is that young people are far more supportive of legalizing gay marriage than older citizens. Age is actually a more telling indicator of where you stand on gay marriage than party affiliation; more than six in ten Republicans ages 18-29 supported gay marriage in a March Pew poll  as compared with just 22 percent of Republicans 65 and older.
But wait, there's more. For people who say that young people who are supportive of gay marriage will change their tune as they age, that is not born out in the data, either. In fact, every generation — including the 65+ group — is growing more okay with gay marriage as they age.
Now, all of these charts make a very clear political argument: The country is rapidly growing more accepting of gay marriage and it seems — given the generational and inter-generational changes in the numbers — very unlikely that that trend will reverse itself. That's a simple political fact that Republican strategists have been trying to drill into the heads of their candidates in recent years; spending significant (or really, any) time talking about opposition to same-sex marriage is a straight political loser with virtually all voters not in the social conservative wing of the GOP base. (Sidebar: That's an amazing transformation in the politics of gay marriage; a decade ago, George W. Bush's reelection victory was credited in no small part to a number of ballot initiatives banning gay marriage on the ballot in key swing states. In 2004, 60 percent of Americans opposed gay marriage while 31 percent supported it, according to Pew. )
The cultural acceptance of gay marriage is something else entirely — and that sort of broader cultural perception is what is probably keeping the nation's highest court away from issuing any sort of wide-reaching ruling at the moment.  Consider that even as polling has shown acceptance of same-sex marriage shooting skyward, there has been much less movement on the more ethical/cultural questions related to it. In a Pew poll conducted in June 2013 , 45 percent of respondents said it was a "sin" to engage in homosexual behavior, and 45 percent said it was not. That's somewhat remarkable, given that the same poll showed that more than seven in ten people believe that recognition of the legality of same-sex marriage is "inevitable."
The court's ruling (or lack thereof) is expected to extend gay marriage to 30 states — and it's easy to imagine that a number of other states will follow suit in seeking legalization since there will be no pending legislation in front of the court to keep them from doing so. Will there eventually be a challenge to the legality of same-sex marriage in front of the Supreme Court? Yes.  Does the makeup of the court make some difference in how that decision turns out? Also, yes. But by not acting on the current challenges, the court has allowed the massive momentum in favor of gay marriage to continue. And not just to continue, but to grow.
The Supreme Court's action clears the way for an immediate expansion of same-sex marriage by turning away appeals from five states seeking to prohibit gay and lesbian unions. (AP)

Anchorage latest city trying to ban UberBy Reid Wilson October 6 Follow @postreid

The city of Anchorage on Friday filed a lawsuit in state Superior Court seeking an injunction requiring Uber, the digital car service, to stop operations just weeks after it began offering rides.
Anchorage municipal attorney Dennis Wheeler’s office sent the San Francisco-based company two cease-and-desist letters in the weeks after Uber began operating there on Sept. 18, and one Uber driver was issued a fine. But the company didn’t respond to the letters, forcing the city to go to court.
As in other cities that have taken Uber to court, hired transportation is strictly regulated, from the number of operator licenses available to the insurance and background checks required of the drivers themselves. In several cities, including in Anchorage, Uber has begun operating without waiting for the city to change its laws.
“It seems to be sort of their standard operating procedure to go into jurisdictions, operate without compliance of local code and not necessarily following cease-and-desist letters,” Wheeler told Alaska Dispatch News . “From my perspective, it’s not a good way to start a relationship.”
Taxi cab companies are some of the most powerful political interests in cities around the country. They argue that Uber doesn’t require the same standards to which their drivers must adhere, and both Uber and the cab companies have fought over insurance requirements.
Already, California and Colorado regulate Uber at a statewide level. Virginia’s Department of Motor Vehicles banned Uber and Lyft, a competing ride-share service, in June. The Seattle City Council voted in March to severely limit the number of rideshare driver permits , a big win for taxi unions. And cities like Vancouver , Berlin and Hamburg have banned Uber from operating, at least for the time being.
An Uber spokesman didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Monday morning, before business hours on the West Coast.

Cyclone alert in Bay; rains forecast for TN  PuducherryCyclone alert in Bay; rains forecast for TN, Puducherry
Vinson Kurian
Tweet
Thiruvananthapuram, October 6:  
As expected, a low-pressure area has sprung up over the Gulf of Thailand and adjoining Andaman Sea, which is forecast to grow as a cyclone (to be called ‘Hudhud’) soon.
India Met Department traced the ‘low’ over the Tenasserim coast (south-east Myanmar and adjoining Thailand).
It is expected to rapidly concentrate into a monsoon depression by Tuesday.
Cyclone forecast
It would intensify into a tropical cyclone, the first of the North-East monsoon season 2014, and would race towards the east coast of India.
Squally winds speeding up to between 60- to 70 km/hr have been warned of around the Andaman and Nicobar Islands on Tuesday.
Isolated heavy rainfall is likely over south interior Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry during the same period.
Almost similar forecast is valid for the next day as the depression ramps up into a tropical cyclone.
Meanwhile, the withdrawal process of the southwest monsoon from land has acquired a sense of urgency as it braces to cover more parts of peninsular India.
Monsoon withdrawal
The south-west monsoon has to retire fully from land before the Met can declare the onset of successor northeast monsoon over the peninsula.
Both are expected to happen simultaneously, given the build-up of conditions over the Andaman Sea and the Bay of Bengal.
Profile of wind pattern projected by the Met showed the ‘low’ sitting pretty in an environment of easterly flows from the Gulf of Thailand into the Andaman Sea/south-east Bay.
The Met merely joined peer international models to project the formation of the cyclone, which may barrel in towards Andhra Pradesh coast by October 12.
The build-up is similar to that of Super Cyclone Phailin that hit the same coast last year and tracked the same direction after having taken birth in the same location.
Transition phase
The period of monsoon transition from southwest to northeast in October is otherwise even known to create ideal conditions for cyclones to take shape in the Bay of Bengal.
Twin Pacific typhoons Phanfone and successor Vongfong have already surfed up the northwest Pacific basin and ‘excited’ the neighbouring South China Sea.
Phanfone has hit Japan, and Vongfong appears to follow a similar track, which is farther and away from South China Sea and the Bay of Bengal.
Southeasterly to easterly flows associated with these storms and warming up of the South China Sea and the Bay of Bengal ensured ideal conditions for storm development in these basins.

FinMin may amend RBI Act for appointing 5th Deputy Governor  COOFinMin may amend RBI Act for appointing 5th Deputy Governor, COO
Shishir Sinha
Likely to move Bill during Budget session
New Delhi, October 6:  
The Finance Ministry is considering amendments to the RBI Act 1934 to enable the central bank appoint a fifth Deputy Governor and a Chief Operating Officer (COO).
Finance Ministry sources confirmed to BusinessLine that both the sides had reached an informal agreement to appoint a COO and create the post of a fifth Deputy Governor in the RBI, but with a condition.
“The condition is that COO would be from among the two Deputy Governors from the RBI’s quota, while the key criteria for appointment of fifth Deputy Governor would be a person with at least 25 years of experience in public administration and governance,” a senior Finance Ministry official said.
In order to formalise the arrangement, the Finance Ministry is likely to move a Bill to amend the RBI Act during the Budget session. Traditionally, two Deputy Governors are from the ranks of the RBI, one is an economist and the fourth one is from the commercial banking space. At present, among the four Deputy Governors, HR Khan and R Gandhi are from the ranks of the RBI, Urjit Patel is a well-known economist, while SS Mundra was earlier Chairman and Managing Director of Bank of Baroda.
There is feeling that 25-year experience criteria, if approved, will mainly help Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officers, as it is they who usually have such a qualification. However, even without this condition, there have been instances, such as that of YV Reddy (an IAS officer of 1964 batch), who served first as Deputy Governor (September 1996-August 2001 and September 2001-July 2002) and was then appointed Governor (September 2003-September 2008).
The COO’s appointment is part of the RBI’s human resources (HR) restructuring exercise. The proposal envisages grouping various departments into five clusters to be headed be a Deputy Governor.
The proposal also talks about creation of an additional position of a COO in the rank of Deputy Governor to head one of the five functional clusters.
On August 14, the RBI said that its board meeting on August 10 approved the broad contours of the proposals.
The board also asked the RBI to initiate a dialogue with the Government on the additional post of Deputy Governor and the legislative changes that would be required.

Bangalore police gear up for an eventful day
Chennai, October 6:  
AIADMK workers are waiting with bated breath as the Karnataka High Court is all set to hear the bail plea of party chief Jayalalithaa on Tuesday, even as protests continued in Tamil Nadu against her conviction in the disproportionate assets case.
AIADMK workers and Jayalalithaa supporters, including State ministers, MPs and MLAs, continued their protests and fasts in various parts of the State for the release of Jayalalithaa, who is presently in a prison in Bangalore, after a Special Court there sentenced her to four years imprisonment in the case on September 27.
The Tamil Nadu Omni Bus Owners Association today announced that about 1,500 omni buses will keep off the roads in the State tomorrow “to show solidarity” with Jayalalithaa.
In Coimbatore and Nilgiris districts, tourists suffered without proper food and beverages today, following a bandh observed in these districts.
Protests continued in the Union Territory of Puducherry too, as AIADMK legislators, joined by various wings of the party, observed a 12-hour-fast led by MLA Om Sakthi Segar.
Schools to reopen
The Federation of Associations of Private Schools in Tamil Nadu announced that schools would reopen tomorrow itself after the pooja holidays.
However, its decision to hold a protest in the Directorate of School Education campus by administrators of all private schools tomorrow remains, said DC Elangovan, Secretary, Federation of Associations of Private Schools in Tamil Nadu.
He had announced yesterday that over 4,500 private schools would remain closed in support of Jayalalithaa.
Bangalore City Police is also gearing up for the big day tomorrow as it is expecting a heavy influx of AIADMK workers from Tamil Nadu into the High Court campus and around Central Prison premises at Parappana Agrahara in the city.
After a meeting with all Deputy Commissioners, Joint Commissioners and Additional Commissioners this morning, Bangalore Police Commissioner MN Reddi imposed prohibitory orders in a 1 km radius around the High Court as well as around Parappana Agrahara Jail for tomorrow as a precautionary measure.
“All arrangements are made to make sure that law and order is maintained,” Reddi tweeted.

Kochi, October 6:  
Pepper production is likely to be higher during the 2014-15 season following the prospects of a bumper crop in Karnataka.
The Karnataka crop, according to farmers’ estimates, will be some 70 per cent more than the normal crop of 25,000-30,000 tonnes.
“I harvested 10 tonnes of pepper last season while this year, I expect it to be 16-17 tonnes. A similar scenario exists in most plantations in the State,” Sunil Kumar, a pepper grower from Sakleshpur, told BusinessLine.
Many have brought more areas under the crop in recent years, he said, in view of record prices during 2013-14.
However, the current assessment cannot be taken for granted, he said, adding that: “When there is a bumper crop, diseases would also be wide-spread.”
Karnataka’s production alone could be between 50,000 and 55,000 tonnes, according to the current estimates. Others in the State have put it at 70,000-80,000 tonnes. Harvesting begins in end-February or early-March.
The area under pepper in Karnataka has more than doubled since 2011-12 when the 16,000 tonnes of the spice was produced on 21,061 hectares. The gestation period is three-five years and yielding normally peaks from the fifth year onwards. Hence, estimates appear to be exaggerated, said official sources.
In Kerala, production during 2011-12 was 16,500 tonnes from an area of 1,72,182 hectares. Though a vast area is reported to be under pepper cultivation, the number of vines may be few.
“For instance, we have pepper in one hectare of land in Kumily. It used to take two weeks to harvest the entire pepper crop until some 10 years ago. But, now it takes just two days as much of the vines have been destroyed by quick-wilt, said Punnoose, a grower.
The number of vines has declined continuously due to diseases, mainly the quick-wilt, said PA Thomas, a grower in Upputhara, Idukki. “If a vine is infested by quick-wilt, in two-three days all the vines in the area will be affected and destroyed”.
Scarcity of labour, diseases and price instability have forced many to shift to cardamom in several areas in the district, he said.
Pepper growers in Pathanamthitta and Wayanad districts also complain of quick-wilt diseases. Extension officers under the Kerala State Agriculture Department have reported quick-wilt infestation of pepper gardens in several panchayats of Pathanamthitta district. Bina Varughese, Krishi Officer of Aruvapalam Panchayat, said some 1,200 vines have been found infested by the disease in the panchayat. Similar cases have been reported from neighbouring panchayats also.
According to Joshua Daniel, a pepper grower in the region, a good number of pepper vines in his plantation has been found affected and immediate remedial measures have arrested its further spreading.
Total output in 2013 -14 has been estimated at around 35,000 tonnes, including carry forward stocks, according to the trade. It is against the normal output in the range of 55,000-65,000 tonnes until few years ago.
Internal absorption of pepper in the country is projected at 45,000 - 48,000 tonnes. Since the usage of pepper is in very small quantity, the price hike has not affected the consumption.

Flipkart rejigs consumer durables categoryFlipkart rejigs consumer durables category

Brings back refrigerators, washing machines, microwave ovens and water purifiers
Mumbai, October 6:  
Almost a year after discontinuing sales of large consumer durable items, online marketplace Flipkart has completely refurbished the segment by adding refrigerators, washing machines, water purifiers and microwave ovens recently.
The Bangalore-based e-tailer has re-entered televisions and air conditioners early this year.
Value-added services
The company has re-launched refrigerators and washing machines just a few days before its “Big Billion Day” sale that also talks about getting new products in exchange for old ones.  Customers can get options such as cash-on-delivery, 30-day replacement policy and in-a-day delivery guarantee. The firm has also provided some value-added services such as product exchange, scheduled delivery and exhaustive buying guide for this category.
Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal-founded Flipkart had downed the shutters of large and bulky items due to reasons such as high shipping costs, high returns, low margins, breakage, after-sales service facilities, and issues related to storage and supply chain.
The company had then said that these were purely business decisions and given that Flipkart is scaling up rapidly, decisions change depending on circumstances and are not necessarily permanent.
Stiff competition
Meanwhile, e-commerce experts are of the view that Flipkart’s decision to re-enter the category could be due to stiff competition from its rivals Amazon.in and Snapdeal. 
Amazon sells TVs and washing machines along with a few refrigerators but does not stock air conditioners. Meanwhile, Delhi-based Snapdeal.com has recently tied up with the country’s largest electronics and consumer durable chain Croma to sell the later’s products on its website. That apart, Snapdeal sells products of several other sellers and has one of the biggest assortments in this category.
 That apart, industry experts feel that Flipkart operated in the inventory-led model until last year and hence it had to bear the cost of stocking these large high value white goods and electronics.
However, now that it has transformed itself into a marketplace, a model where it does not require holding any inventory, it can sell these items through third-party vendors.  
Arvind Singhal, Chairman of retail consultancy firm Technopak Advisory, said: “Large appliances are a huge market in the country. They generate large volumes (sales) and hence no retailer or e-tailer can escape stocking these products.”

Rupee loses 22 paise to end at 7-month loweconomy, business and finance
The dollar index was sharply up by 0.60 per cent against a basket of six major global units. It was also up against other Asian units.
The rupee on Tuesday lost 22 paise to end at almost seven-month low of 61.75 against the dollar as month-end demand for the US currency from oil importers weighed on the local unit.
Sluggish local equities after the Reserve Bank on Tuesday kept key rates unchanged in its monetary policy and slowdown in foreign fund inflows put some pressure on the rupee, a forex dealer said.
The dollar index was sharply up by 0.60 per cent against a basket of six major global units. It was also up against other Asian units.
At the Interbank Foreign Exchange (Forex) market here, the domestic currency commenced lower at 61.60 from last close of 61.53.
It moved in a range of 61.82 and 61.55 before concluding at 61.75, a fall of 22 paise or 0.36 per cent from its last close. On Monday, it had plunged by 38 paise or 0.62 per cent.
Last time the rupee settled at this level was on March 5 when ended at 61.75.
Meanwhile, the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex on Tuesday closed better by 33.40 points after surrendering early gains.
Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) injected USD 37.70 million on Monday, as per SEBI data.
Pramit Brahmbhatt, Veracity Group CEO, said: “Today range-bound local equities and the month-end dollar demand from oil importers forced the rupee to depreciate to 61.75. Also the dollar continues to trade high at USD 86.06 strongest level since July 2010 versus a basket of major currencies.
In forward market, premium dropped further on consistent receipts by exporters.
The benchmark six-month premium payable in February dipped to 193-195 paise from 203-205 paise previously.
Far-forward contracts maturing in August, 2015 also tumbled to 436-438 paise from 454-456 paise.
The Reserve Bank of India fixed the reference rate for dollar at 61.6135 and for the euro at 78.2060.
The rupee, however, recovered slightly against the pound to 99.91 from overnight close of 99.94 and also rebounded to 77.68 per euro from 78.16. It too edged up to 56.24 per 100 Japanese yen from 56.28.

Attack Hit 76 MILLION U.S. Householdsreddit
A cyber attack at America's biggest bank this summer affected more than half of all U.S. households -- far, far more than previously estimated, and the latest in a string of massive, unnerving data breaches.
The attack at JPMorgan Chase affected the data of 76 million households and 7 million businesses, the bank said in a regulatory filing on Thursday.
That impact was far bigger than earlier estimates that about 1 million customers had been affected, the New York Times noted . It represents more than half of the roughly 115 million households in America.
Hackers attacked the bank's computer systems periodically between mid-June and mid-August, according to The Wall Street Journal. The attackers accessed customer names, email addresses, phone numbers and physical addresses, along with "internal JPMorgan Chase information relating to such users," the bank said in its regulatory filing . The bank didn't describe what sort of information that was.
The bank said it has seen no evidence that "account numbers, passwords, user IDs, dates of birth or Social Security numbers" were taken, and it has not yet seen any signs of fraudulent activity using the leaked data.
JPMorgan Chase representatives did not immediately return a request for further comment on the breach, which is under investigation by the FBI. Earlier on Thursday, a NYT report on the JPMorgan filing mistakenly suggested that the bank had suffered a second major breach. The paper has since corrected that story .
For context on the size of this breach, a recent cyber attack against Home Depot affected 56 million customer cards, in what was reported to be the biggest retail hack in history. Late last year, a data breach at Target affected roughly 40 million customers at the height of the holiday shopping season.

The Economy Is Losing to ISISreddit
Globally, there is much to fear and this summer saw the escalation or re-ignition of a number of serious conflicts. Ceasefires between Israel and Gaza were set and broken, and thousands of people were killed. The conflict between Russia and the Ukraine stepped up drastically leading to international penalties and sanctions by and against Americans. The Syrian civil war has intensified the terrorist activities of ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and Syria) resulting in threats to American soil.
These threats have changed the everyday priorities of people in the USA. Since April, our research has been monitoring what Americans say is their single most important issue. Early in the year, out of a list of nearly 30 items, the economy was chosen by 17 percent to 23 percent of people as their top issue. However, beginning in late July, the economy began to decline in importance, and only 12 percent of people chose it as their top issue in mid-August. Unemployment also lost some of its votes falling from an early year average of about 10% to a more recent trend of about 7 percent.
Where did the lost votes for the economy go instead? In just a few short weeks, unrest in Gaza, Ukraine, and Syria has caused the number of people stating that conflicts are their top concern to triple, an increase from 2 percent to 6 percent. A few comments from research participants include:
"ISIS is saying see you in New York. I'm worried about another attack on our homeland."
"We need to take care of and destroy terrorist groups like ISIS!!!!"
"Terrorism is a HUGE threat to our country and Obama and the Democrats are doing NOTHING about. ISIS is growing and we could see another event like 911 here in our country, but on a larger scale."
But, the rise in global conflicts doesn't fully explain the declining importance of the economy. In addition to conflicts, the percentage of people choosing immigration as their number one issue has more than tripled from about 2 percent early in the year to 7 percent now. A few research participants shared their very forthright and divisive views on the topic:
"I believe our biggest concern for the security of our nation is the number of male illegals entering at the present rate."
"Why does Obama keep playing games & calling them undocumented immigrants? They're Illegal, which means they became criminals the second they illegally entered our country. Kick them out or shoot them, I don't care, but get them out of here now."
"Millions of illegals need to be taken out of our jails and prisons and sent back to where ever they came from-however many times it takes them to get the point-kids and all. We cannot support our Veterans programs but we can spend trillions taking care of illegals-give me a break. This country needs to wake up."
"We need some way of getting illegal aliens out of our country. they are taking over. they think they own it now."
The economy appears to be making a slight comeback as the number one issue, and the immigration issue seems to have reached its peak. However, the increasing likelihood that global conflicts may have an impact on American soil may result in additional focus on conflicts as the number one issue. Stay tuned as we continue to monitor opinions.

Reduce the hassle when you exitigor.stevanovic/shutterstock.com
You cannot change your bank details when you make a redemption request
While making redemption requests, investors often request certain add-on services. Let’s look at some common requests and the formalities that need to be complied with.
I made a redemption request and asked for a change in bank details, but the details were not changed and the redemption cheque was sent with old bank details printed on it.
Mutual funds do not process requests to change bank details that are submitted at the time of redemption. Investors who have closed their bank accounts and want redemption proceeds to be credited to a new bank account should ensure they register the new bank account details in their folios well in advance. Mutual funds allow investors to register up to five bank accounts in their folios. This allows investors to choose the bank account into which the redemption proceeds need to be credited.
I had invested as a minor and now, as an 18-year-old, I have made a redemption request. However, it was not processed.
Any investment made on behalf of a minor will be locked till he/she attains the age of maturity. Transactions are not permitted in such folios till the status of the investor is changed from minor to major. Mutual Funds send advance intimation to investors informing them to register their new status in the folio. Update their status to ‘major’ by submitting new bank details along with the know-your-customer acknowledgement and an age proof. Mutual fund/registrar websites provide the required form detailing the documents required to effect this change.
I want to have all redemptions credited electronically to my account. What should I do?
Please inform the fund/registrar through a written and signed request. In your letter, please mention the IFSC/RTGS code of your bank and attach a cancelled cheque reflecting the relevant IFSC/RTGS code. The IFSC/RTGS code will then be registered in the respective mutual fund’s records and the mode of payout will be changed to electronic to ensure all payments are sent to this account electronically.
I have requested a mutual fund to “Redeem complete amount and make balance zero”. The fund has not closed the account and is debiting SIP amounts.
Please note that redemption of all units and ceasing of SIP are two different processes. If you ask for redemption of all units in a scheme, all unit balance as available on that particular date of the redemption request will be redeemed. To stop the SIP debits and further unit allotments, you need to submit a separate request three-four weeks in advance of the next SIP instalment due date.
I have units in my demat account. How can I redeem them?
You have to submit the redemption request to your broker, a trading member of the stock exchange or directly to your depository participant and the process would be effected through the stock exchange/ depository. The redemption proceeds will be credited directly to your registered bank account.

Gold poised at the brinkPsychological barrier: Gold has fallen below the $1,200 per ounce mark.
With prices closing below $1,200, critical technical supports are a threat for the ‘safe haven’ metal
October 5, 2014:  
Gold had another forgettable week in global markets, registering a negative close below the psychological $1,200 per ounce mark at $1,191.42, down 2.2 per cent. Mixed data releases from the US prompted gold to register volatile trades between $1,204 and $1,223 until Thursday
The trigger for the sharp fall came on Friday in the form of the US non-farm payroll (NFP) and unemployment data. The NFP increased in September by 248,000 as against the market expectation for a 216,000 rise. Also, the unemployment rate in the US fell below 6 per cent for the first time since July 2008 to 5.9 per cent in September from 6.1 per cent in the previous month. The strong US jobs data saw the dollar surging against all major currencies. As a result, gold prices declined sharply, falling below the psychological $1,200-mark to a low of $1,190.14 . The close below $1,200 could put more pressure in the near term.
Silver, on the other hand, was beaten down much harder than gold and it fell 4.6 per cent last week to close at $16.84 per ounce.
Cues to watch
The strong US employment numbers released have increased speculation further in the market for an early interest rate hike. So the market will now be watching carefully for the release of minutes of the US Federal Reserve’s September 17 meeting this Wednesday for cues on rates. This will be followed by the usual weekly unemployment claims data on Thursday. Gold prices now seem to be almost wholly driven by action in the dollar. Neither the US air strikes in Syria nor the other geopolitical tensions prevailing across the globe have in recent times helped provide a floor to the yellow metal’s price. Yes, the movement in the dollar will continue to influence gold prices. And the dollar index (86.64) remains strong. It can rise further to test 87.3 in the near term, which implies that more pain is on the cards for gold.
On the charts
Technically, price action in the coming week is going to be crucial for gold. The close below $1,200 for the first time since 2010 is a concern for the commodity. The price can fall to test $1,185 and $1,179, which are the crucial trend line and 100-month moving average support levels, respectively.
A reversal will fuel hopes for a corrective rally. But, whether the support will be broken or will hold should decide the next leg of movement for gold. A strong break above $1,200 could turn the sentiment positive. If gold declines below $1,179 decisively, it will be bearish for the medium term. This can take the price lower to the next target of $1,170. Also, it will reduce chances of a rise above $1,200.
In such a scenario, gold will be left in danger of a sharp fall to $1,150 or even lower levels.

The Best All Frills  No Chills Way to Build Brand Awarenessreddit
A buyer persona identifies who you are targeting with marketing initiatives.
It's the go-to foundation of all your marketing. You may have more than one. Your surveys, samples and interviews will flesh out the optimum profiles.
Four Critical Steps for Building an Accurate Persona
You can't make it up; interviewing a few sales or customer service reps and talking to 2-3 customers won't cut the mustard. Your building a foundation on a house of cards that's doomed to failure.
Don't confuse a basic customer profile with a persona. The latter are a much deeper dive than a profile, giving you insights into the underlying characteristics of your optimum target. Think about how an actor infuses the deep characteristics for an Academy Award.
Remember the old saying: "don't take a knife to a gun fight" - don't put an intern on the assignment or expect to create a personal after attending a half day seminar. This should be deep dive research done by people who understand marketing strategy and tactics.
Great personas begin and end with a translation of marketing goals. Your integrating qualitative research: pain points, motivation, drivers, lifestyle, education, personalities that help to build a target which in turn defines tactical marketing processes.
How Buyer Personas Help Your Brand
Buyer personas help to identify deep issues and behaviors that may not be on the surface. Your visiting a foreign country for the first time. Your customers may not tell you what they want; i.e. they are speaking a language you need to decipher (motivation, pain points, fears, wants, desires and needs).
Quantitative research may not be sufficient for creating an accurate persona profile. It's all about context too, the type of surveys used, size of the survey, questions and how this data is put together to identify a viable persona.
All of your work has a tactical end game: to identify goal centered customer strategies. How to reach them, via what channel, frequency of messaging, types of content, sales funnel systems and back end lead capture systems. Don't fall in love with the data: move to tactical marketing for testing.
Buyer personas help brand understand who the customer is and how to reach them via a content marketing strategy that identifies platforms, long or short form content ("snackable content" or long form story), rinse and repeat frequency, with social engagement measurement and lead flow analysis.

The Top 10 Challenges of Briefing Designersreddit
Co-written by Michael Liedtke
The value added by a good design brief is vastly underrated. When asked from where he received his inspiration, Syd Mead, the brilliant design futurist and the brain behind the concept designs for the movies, Blade Runner, Aliens and Mission Impossible III, replied: "The client design brief!"
Based on our joint and rather extensive experience with design briefs, we have created a list of the top ten challenges and how best to address them:
1) Clients are unclear about what they want from design and, therefore, have no clue what the design team should achieve.
2) Clients over-rely on intuition and neglect to request and integrate designers' input in the brief development process.
3) Clients underestimate the value of design.
4) Clients feel they already know their customers and don't want to change what they already have.
5) Clients do not understand brand form language.
6) Clients have unreasonable expectations about a design upgrade of their product.
7) Clients do not understand the need to do design research and feel that one look at their product(s) should tell the designer all that is needed.
8) Clients feel that they know their customers better than anybody else and can tell the designer everything they will ever need to know about them.
9) Language and definition misunderstandings - Contemporary can mean many things to different people.
10) Business has been slowing down and the client thinks it might have something to do with their designs and finally ask the designer to do "something."
If one wants to do a minor facelift to an existing design, then a verbal description may suffice for designers to generate initial concepts. However, if one intends to engage in actual innovation, the Design Quantification Criteria (DQC), the strategy, context and execution will have to be well thought out and effectively communicated to the design team.
One of the biggest mistakes made by clients is that they believe they know their customers very well already. They might see true fans of their product at a trade show but never take the time to experience the true context for the product, which is the environment in which their product is used.
In some instances, the best briefs were not even written on a piece of paper, instead, they were experienced. Visionary clients want to make sure that the design team truly understands the context of their product. These intensive program introductions are not inexpensive, but the clear understanding by the entire design team of the task at hand, makes it comprehensive. This obviously is not feasible for every product or client; however, an example might be a designer living the life of a trucker for a few days in order to really understand the needs and desires of this user and overnighting in the very same sleeper cab that the designer is challenged to redesign. This is the experiential design brief in action.
So, how does one get the client to provide what is needed for the design team to get the best possible design brief for the program and budget at hand? It all comes back to communication. While there are numerous templates, most of them boil down to the four basic questions of why, what, how, who and when. These questions can assist in establishing the Design Quality Criteria so it is important to walk the client through this list of questions, even if the client might not at first understand the purpose or see the need for this exercise. Once it is explained, this detailed information exchange suddenly earns an air of value and the client begins to understand that these designers are a lot like engineers after all.
Just as the engineering department requires clear directions beyond the typical "better, faster, cheaper", the design team also needs their own set of established Quality Criteria design - to create an effective and efficient design brief.

Confronting an office bully takes courage. (Design Pics/Thinkstock)
Q: My manager is treating one of my colleagues unfairly, yelling at her when she makes even the smallest mistake and looking for reasons to blame and punish her. She verbally attacks my colleague in front of the rest of us for things that are not against the rules and not a big deal. I think it is beginning to affect my coworker's health. Isn't this kind of treatment by a boss unethical?

Don't say — or do — this in Asia
A: The short answer: Yes. It’s always unethical to make other people feel unsafe, disrespected, or marginalised at work — and especially those who report to you.
“If we think about a strong ethical culture as a house with wooden beams, respectful behaviour is the centre, load-bearing beam,” said Linda Fisher Thornton, author of 7 Lenses: Learning the Principles and Practices of Ethical Leadership and chief executive officer of Leading in Context, a consulting firm based in Richmond, Virginia, in the US.
Leaders must show the way by modeling respectful conduct. Why does this matter? Because, aside from a leader’s duty not to harm those in their charge, bullying is toxic for the corporate culture, Fisher Thornton said.
“When people fear being attacked, they understandably tend to ‘pull in’ to protect themselves, much like a turtle pulling its head into its shell,” she said. Employees begin to spend their time thinking about what’s going on in the office and how to avoid being the next victim — instead of focusing on their work. All this wasted energy, Fisher Thornton said, is diverted away from the company’s real business.  
As for what you should do as a colleague when faced with this dilemma, it’s important not to escalate the situation. Yelling back at your manager when she attacks your colleague is not likely to work – and might even put you in the crosshairs. But you can try to do the right thing by your officemate in other ways.
Start by reaching out to see if your harassed colleague could benefit from some quiet support, Fisher Thornton said. Next, decide how you will report the problem. If your company has a policy preventing such behaviour — and a strong record of enforcing it – then your way is clear, especially if you feel comfortable going to your manager’s boss about the situation. Make sure you’ve documented the problem with notes, copies of emails and any other evidence before you alert a senior manager or the human resources department.
Be careful, Fisher Thornton warned, if your firm doesn’t have a history of holding strong against bullying. (This could also be a problem if this is the first workplace bullying problem your company has had to confront.)
“If the manager finds out that you reported her, and if she is fairly confident that nothing will be done to stop her, her behaviour could worsen,” she said.
In the event that you decide not to confront your manager or to report her, make sure that her behaviour doesn’t force you into violating your personal ethical standards as you go about doing your job.
Whatever happens, don’t agree to do anything that you feel compromises you  or damages your credibility, Fisher Thornton said: “You can look for a new job if you ever decide to leave, but your reputation can never be traded in for a new one.”

 Why Gold  Crude Prices Have Hit Multi-Year LowsGovernment to Streamline Subsidies, Cheap LPG for Rich May Go: Finance Minister
Precious metals seem to have joined the global downturn in commodity prices, with gold tumbling to its lowest level in 15 months on Monday. The fall in commodity prices augurs well for the Indian economy and for also for corporate earnings.
Here are 10 things to know about the fall in commodity prices,
1) Cash Gold hit $1183.46 an ounce today, its weakest since June 2013. Other precious metals also fell tracking weak gold prices. Platinum touched its lowest since 2009, silver fell to its weakest since 2010, and palladium hit an 8-month low. ( Read the full story here )
2) Gold prices fell mainly because of rising dollar. The US dollar has hit over four-year high against a basket of currencies. Commodities are priced in dollars, so when the dollar rises, more of it are needed to buy the same commodity. This hits demand and consequently hurts commodity prices.
3) The dollar has been rising on hopes that the Federal Reserve will soon start raising interest rates because of improving economic data in the US. A rate hike will lead to inward flow of funds into the US, strengthening the greenback.
4) Gold is not the only commodity under pressure. At $92/barrel, Brent prices are trading at their lowest in 27 months. Brent crude has been under pressure because of oversupply and weak demand in EU and China. It has now entered into bear territory after falling by more than 20 per cent since June. ( Read )
5) Global coal prices have also taken a hit, with coal trading around $70/ton after coming off sharply from US$100/ton 30 months ago. The prolonged slump is mainly due to declining demand of imported coal from China, which plays a dominant role in the overall international trade of the commodity, domestic brokerage Kotak says.
6) Prices of agricultural commodities such as sugar, wheat, tea and coffee have also fallen. Global sugar prices have slipped to 4-year low due to higher yields in Brazil and higher global stocks, Kotak says.
7) Among metals, aluminium prices have come under pressure after a rally. Iron ore prices are down by 40 per cent since December 2013 because of slowdown in China's steel consumption. ( Read )
8) India will be a key beneficiary of the fall in global commodity prices. Kotak says Brent prices may remain in a range of $90-$105/barrel over the medium term and this will offset inflationary pressures and reduce India's current account deficit and fiscal deficit. India's CAD comes down by $1.1 billion if Brent falls by $1/barrel, Kotak estimated.
9) Lower crude prices will also help support the rupee, which is likely to come under pressure once bond yields start to rise in the US. ( Read )
10) Softer prices of agricultural products and oil derivatives, which serve as raw materials for consumer companies, will result in an improvement in gross margins of consumer staples companies, Kotak says. For energy companies, overall under-recoveries will come down meaningfully. The benefit to companies will be clear when the government implements a more reasonable subsidy-sharing system, Kotak added.

Investors are sobering up. Now whatWall Street's beer goggles are clearing up. Now what?
By Matt Egan   @mattmegan5 October 5, 2014: 9:23 AM ET
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
Investors are sobering up -- and they may not like what they see.
For the past five years, investors have gotten drunk off the Federal Reserve's easy-money punch bowl.
The Fed's stimulus program, known as quantitative easing or "QE," left investors with beer goggles on. Stocks and bonds that normally would look unattractive suddenly looked pretty good.
Now that Janet Yellen is getting ready to remove the punch bowl, investors are being forced to take a more critical look at their portfolios.
"Everything looks good under the drug of QE, but once QE goes away those goggles start to clear up. Those warts and blemishes start to matter. Risk appetites change," explains Peter Boockvar, the Lindsey Group market analyst who came up with the beer goggles analogy back in January.
Even some members of the Fed admit the analogy works. Richard Fisher, the head of the Dallas Fed who has been critical of QE, used it in a speech earlier this year .
Related: Gold is back en vogue as investors worry
Sobering up: Recent turbulence in the stock market can partly be explained by the beer goggles effect.
Investors have been dumping stocks found in the previously red hot Russell 2000, sending that basket of smaller-sized stocks into "correction" mode last week. That's Wall Street code for a 10% decline from a previous high.
Smaller stocks are riskier than their larger cousins because their shares change hands less frequently, making it more difficult to buy and sell them. They're also more vulnerable to swings in the economy and credit markets than big stocks like Apple ( AAPL , Tech30 ) or Google ( GOOGL , Tech30 ).
The same sobering up process has hit so-called momentum stocks. High-flyers like Tesla ( TSLA ), El Pollo Loco ( LOCO ) and Netflix ( NFLX , Tech30 ) are all hovering well below their 52-week highs. Even red hot GoPro ( GPRO ) started responding to the laws of gravity last week.
That doesn't necessarily mean these are lousy stocks; just that investors realize they may take a breather as less of the Fed's easy money is sloshing around the financial system.
Even the credit markets are seeing the beer goggles impact. Junk bonds have taken a hit in recent weeks as Wall Street bets on which companies will be healthy enough to roll over their debt once interest rates begin to climb.

Reshaped risk and reward: The Fed's emergency actions transformed the risk and reward of virtually all asset classes. That's because with interest rates at zero, cash in the bank earns virtually nothing. It actually loses value due to inflation.
To avoid losing money, investors are forced to put more of their money in riskier assets like stocks and bonds. That helps explain one of the driving forces for the bull market in stocks and why the U.S. government can borrow money for 30 years at just 3%.
But now the Fed is hitting the brakes on QE and is poised to lift interest rates off the floor next year.
'Brace for a correction' So what should investors do in this changing environment?
Boockvar believes the bull's party days may soon be over.
"People should brace for a correction. You could easily have a bear market if the Fed starts to lose control," he said.
Boockvar argues that the Fed's easy-money policies only pulled forward a lot of asset price gains.
"They want you to buy a car today instead of tomorrow. They want you to buy a stock today instead of tomorrow. When that drug goes away, you need to give back some of those gains that were artificially gotten," he said.
Related: Good news is really good news. Finally!
Others believe the party could still go on, just at more hushed tones and only for some parts of the stock market.
David Lebovitz, a global market strategist at JPMorgan ( JPM ) Asset Management, expects large-cap stocks to fare better than small caps because they have better access to credit.
He especially likes stocks with exposure to the IT, energy and financial sectors.
The point is, blindly throwing money into the stock market might not be the best play once QE ends.
"We're at a point in the cycle where differentiation is much more important. It's going to be much more about security selection," Lebovitz said.

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) will campaign for Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) later this week, Roberts's campaign announced Monday. The tea party star becomes the latest well-known Republican to join the effort to rescue Roberts, who polls show is trailing independent candidate Greg Orman.
The Texas senator will help launch a Roberts campaign bus tour on Thursday. Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) will also join the effort.
"To stop the liberal Harry Reid-Barack Obama agenda, we must win the Senate Majority – and we can’t do that without Pat Roberts back in the Senate," Cruz said in a statement.
An NBC News/Marist poll released Sunday showed Roberts trailing Orman by 10 points. Orman has not said which party he would caucus with if the majority comes down to him.
Roberts is trying to shore up his support among Republicans of all ideological persuasions in the closing weeks of the campaign. He's already brought in Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), Sarah Palin and former Senate majority leader Bob Dole to stump with him.

Mining lease renewal process to commence in October  says Goa CMMining lease renewal process to start in October: Goa CM
Sanjay Jog | Mumbai Oct 07, 2014 12:25 AM IST
Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar on Monday stated that the mining lease renewal process would commence from October.
“The government plans to start process for renewal of mining leases from October onwards. I won't be able to give you the exact number. But the miners have to complete other requirements too, including environment clearances and necessary formalities with the Indian Bureau of Mines,” Parrikar told Business Standard.
Parrikar, who was in Mumbai to address Bharatiya Janata Party rallies for the Maharashtra Assembly election, said he expected the actual mining to start from January 2015 onwards. This, in part, was due to the low global ore prices prevailing currently.
Parrikar, however, completely ruled out the auctioning of mining leases. He said that the state cabinet had already approved a policy for renewal of iron ore leases by exercising powers under Section 8(3) of the Mines and Mineral Regulation and Development (MMRD) Act, 1957. The policy envisages renewal of mining leases of those who have already paid stamp duty. Auctioning of leases is not a route prescribed in the MMRD Act, Parrikar said.
The Goa government has already clarified that those found with substantial violations of various laws and regulations would face rejection of renewal claim.

Economy is reviving; investment potential in India s favour: SitharamanThe economy is reviving, foreign investors are favouring India: Nirmala Sitaraman
Sanjay Jog | Mumbai Oct 07, 2014 12:47 AM IST
Minister of State for Commerce and Finance Nirmala Sitaraman, in Mumbai to address election rallies, took time out to talk about the economy, foreign investment and trade facilitation in an interview with Sanjay Jog. Excerpts:
When will the government announce its foreign trade policy?
Very soon. The government wanted to announce it by the end of August. But we decided to hold meetings of stakeholders. Their viewpoints are taken and the policy will be released soon.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi had a discussion on India's stand at the World Trade Organization with US President Barack Obama. Do you expect an early solution?
Both the WTO and the US appreciated why India took its position. We explained that India was not alone in stocking grain. Yes, we want trade facilitation, but are you going to leave farmers high and dry and when you feed your poor is it trade distortion? We cannot have the same countries come to us saying there are starving people in India. My understanding is that both the US and the WTO are willing to hear us. We are hopeful that a (WTO) committee on agriculture meets and meets frequently.
Has investment picked up?
The atmosphere is completely changed. There is a feeling that the business environment is improving. It makes sense to invest in India as there is huge demand and a ready market. Foreign investment is clearly in favour.
Can we expect more reforms in foreign direct investment?
In just 115 days the government has raised the ceiling in FDI in defence from 26 per cent to 49 per cent. The government has drawn up a list of segments within defence where production can be delicensed. The railways have been opened up. We are going to ease operations in construction too. This government has opened up on many more fronts than 10 years of the United Progressive Alliance's rule.
Is the economy reviving?
There are strong indications that inflation is low, the trade deficit is reaching acceptable levels, money is stabilising and industrial production is showing positive signs. Standard & Poor's too provided an outlook much better than five years ago.
Is it time for diesel price deregulation?
The minister concerned will be able to tell you. It is true that petroleum prices have come down.
Will the government be able to meet the GST deadline?
Several meeting were held with states by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley. The GST is moving closer to a solution.
The finance minister has made a commitment to bring in a constitutional amendment by the end of the year. States are talking about compensation, particularly in the manufacturing sector. These are areas where detailed discussions are on. Resolution is near.

BREAKING  SCOTUS denies same-sex marriage appealsBy Jonathan H. Adler October 6
The Supreme Court was asked to consider petitions for certiorari in seven separate cases challenging state laws barring legal recognition of same-sex marriage.  On Monday morning, SCOTUSBlog reported , the Supreme Court denied all seven petitions.
Most commentators have assumed the Supreme Court would take one or more of these cases and (perhaps) conclusively determine whether the federal Constitution bars states from refusing to recognize same-sex marriages under state law.  Yet all seven cases below had come out the same way. In all seven, lower courts struck down the challenged state laws, so there was no circuit split.
Given the lack of a split, I do not think it is at all surprising that the court denied these petitions. (Indeed, coincidentally, I was planning on writing a post raising doubts about when and whether the court would take on a same-sex marriage case.)  There are several more cases pending in lower courts, including some in which there are reasons to suspect the states will prevail.  If so, the court will have a split to resolve, making a grant a sure thing.  If not, and same-sex marriage advocates run the table, the court can avoid resolving the issue.
Of course, on this issue, the real question is what Justice Anthony Kennedy thinks. Is he ready and willing to hold that the Constitution guarantees a right to same-sex marriage? Or is he still conflicted given his federalist sympathies?  This may ultimately determine when or whether the court takes a case challenging a state prohibition on same-sex marriage and how such a case is resolved.
UPDATE: Roberts Barnes reports for the Post  here .  How Appealing rounds up more news coverage.
SECOND UPDATE: It’s worth remembering that Justice Ginsburg remarked last month that there was “no urgency” to taking a same-sex marriage case.  At the time she noted that some circuits, such as the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, had yet to rule.  As Dale Carpenter reported here , there is some reason to think the Sixth Circuit might well uphold the challenged state laws barring recognition of same-sex marriages, even if on particularly narrow grounds.  That case was argued in August, and an opinion is likely in the next several weeks.
STILL MORE: Lyle Denniston explains here why most observers expected the Court to grant at least one of the petitions.

CNN boss Jeff Zucker: Chaos is good for CNNBy Erik Wemple October 6 Follow @ErikWemple
CNN President Jeff Zucker. (Reuters/Danny Moloshok/Files)
When CNN Worldwide President Jeff Zucker opens up to the media, good quotes often result. “Chaos is good for CNN,” Zucker told New York Magazine’s Gabriel Sherman for a just-published profile . That quote refers to the late-August news burst stemming from the protests in Ferguson, Mo., over the killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown; CNN thrived in primetime ratings for the important 25-54 demographic.
CNN’s good fortunes in turbulent times are, of course, well known by now. The 24-7 news network, founded in 1980, excels on breaking news and flounders when not much is going on. Under Zucker, that difficult duality has meant that when there are compelling stories out there, CNN doesn’t relent. Sherman reports: “According to CNN sources, Tapper vented to colleagues about having to cover the George Zimmerman trial so extensively, and Cooper protested the MH370 marathon.”
Deal with it, big-shot hosts. If CNN somehow fails to overcover a Zimmerman trial or a disappeared Malaysia Airlines plane, it’s wasting the sunk costs in its journalism operation — and there are a lot of them.
Speaking of costs, that’s a big topic at CNN, and one that Sherman’s profile just grazes. Over the summer, Zucker made clear to CNN staffers that they’d have to do “less with less” at a network that will be losing staff in the coming months. That’ll make it harder for Zucker to push the network to its long-since-surrendered spot atop the cable news scramble. In June 2013, Zucker said, “ask me again in three years” when he was asked about his timeline for preeminence . Now he’s telling Sherman, “It’s not about a path to No. 1 here. What we talk about is making the network essential and better.”

Apple partner GT Advanced Tech files for ban...Apple partner GT Advanced Technologies Inc files for bankruptcy
By Reuters | 6 Oct, 2014, 08.33PM IST
GT Advanced Technologies Inc, a partner with Apple Inc in a sapphire glass plant in Arizona, said it had filed for voluntary bankruptcy protection.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
GT Advanced Technologies Inc , a partner with Apple Inc in a sapphire glass plant in Arizona, said it had filed for voluntary bankruptcy protection.
Shares of the company fell more than 90 percent to 96 cents after a trading halt was lifted on the Nasdaq.
The company suffered a major setback last month when its scratch-resistant sapphire glass was left out of Apple's new large-screen iPhones.
"It would appear that something very fundamentally broke down in the relationship between Apple and GT Advanced," Raymond James analyst Pavel Molchanov said in an email.
Up to Friday's close, GT Advanced shares had slumped 36 percent since Sept. 9 when Apple unveiled its latest iPhones.
GT Advanced , whose subsidiaries also filed for bankruptcy, said it had $85 million of cash as of Sept. 29.
The company listed assets and liabilities in excess of $1 billion in its Chapter 11 petition.
The company, which filed for bankruptcy in a U.S. bankruptcy court in the District of New Hampshire, said it was seeking debtor-in-possession financing to get access to additional funds.
GT Advanced said it expected the court to authorize it to continue to conduct business as usual while it reorganized.
The company's shares had more than doubled in the nine months between last month's unveiling of the new iphones and Nov. 4, when the Arizona plan was first announced.
The stock traded as high as $20.54 in early July.

Jackson  Sherman played Little League togetherBy Liz Clarke October 6 Follow @lizclarketweet
Seahawks head coach Pete Carroll and cornerback Richard Sherman go way back with Redskins wide receiver DeSean Jackson. (Gregory Bull/Associated Press)
It was a roster any youth baseball coach would covet, with both DeSean Jackson and Richard Sherman on it.
The record of the 1999 Holly Park Little League team may be lost in history, but the Seattle Seahawks’ Web site (Seahawks.com) recently posted a team picture showing Sherman, its Pro Bowl cornerback, on the front row, and Jackson, Washington’s prize wide-receiver pickup and three-time Pro Bowl honoree, on the back row.
A Los Angeles native, Jackson, 12 at the time, went on to attend Long Beach Poly and play college football at University of California. Sherman, then 11, attended Compton’s Dominguez High School and played football at Stanford.
The two are expected to face off during Monday Night Football, providing one of the game’s more compelling matchups.
Sherman, who led the NFL with eight interceptions last season, has yet to get a pick through Seattle’s first three games.
Jackson, 27, flashed his rare speed by hauling in a pass from Kirk Cousins and extending it to an 81-yard game-tying touchdown in Washington’s eventual 37-34 defeat at Philadelphia. He’s third on the team in catches, behind Pierre Garcon (24) and tight end Niles Paul (21) with 15 receptions for 207 yards (13.8 per catch).

Jackson has played Washington’s past two games ailing with a sprained AC joint in his left shoulder, suffered in the first quarterback of the Week 2 victory at Jacksonville.
Both teams should be rested Monday. Washington (1-3) has had an 11-day break since the Sept. 25 meltdown against the New York Giants, while Seattle (2-1)) is coming off its bye week.
Sherman isn’t the only Seahawk familiar with Jackson’s explosiveness.
Coach Pete Carroll recruited him heavily when he was coach at Southern California. He called Jackson a tremendous athlete in speaking to Seahawks media last week.
“He has a natural skill for playing the ball,” Carroll said of Jackson, who attended USC’s football camp as a youngster. “He’s extraordinarily fast and really well equipped in body control and timing.”
Jackson enrolled at Berkeley instead, earning Carroll’s respect further as a wide receiver who demanded coverage in games against the Trojans.
“He has caught a lot of long touchdown passes,” Carroll said of Jackson. “We pay good attention to his ability to get you.”
Like Jackson, Sherman started his college career as a wide receiver but switched to cornerback while at Stanford. Sherman told Seattle media that Jackson was always among the best at whatever sport they played as children.
“A lot of people would’ve guessed he would’ve gone baseball, especially early on in the way his father was involved in baseball,” Sherman said. “He has always been a fantastic athlete.”
The Redskins head into Week 5 against the defending Super Bowl champion Seattle Seahawks and their dynamic secondary. The Washington Post's Mike Jones and Jason Reid say that quarterback Kirk Cousins should proceed with caution when looking down field. (Randolph Smith/The Washington Post)

Nobel in medicine awarded to three for illuminating brains inner GPSBy Ariana Eunjung Cha and Fred Barbash October 6 Follow @arianaeunjung Follow @fbarbash
U.S.-British scientist John O'Keefe and Norwegian husband and wife Edvard Moser and May-Britt Moser have won the Nobel Prize in medicine for discoveries of brain cells that people use to orient themselves. (AP)
Three scientists, including a husband-and-wife team, have been awarded this year’s Nobel Prize in medicine for deciphering the mechanism in the brain that allows us to find our way around.
The three winners of the world’s most coveted medical research prize are John O’Keefe, who holds both U.S. and British citizenship and is director of the Sainsbury Wellcome Center in Neural Circuits and Behavior at University College London; May-Britt Moser, a professor of neuroscience at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology; and Edward I. Moser of the same university.
All worked on different components of the same problem: how we “orient ourselves in space” and navigate, the Stockholm-based Nobel committee said in announcing the prize Monday. The discovery of what the group called the brain’s “inner GPS” has “solved a problem that has occupied philosophers and scientists for centuries.”
O’Keefe discovered the first component of this system in 1971. He found that when he placed rats in certain parts of a room different cells in the brain’s hippocampus – which is believed to be important in functions related to space and memory -- were always activated. He theorized that these areas that he called “place cells” formed a map of the room.
The Mosers, who are from Norway, followed up on that research in 2005, finding what scientists dubbed “grid cells” that make up a coordinate system that allows us to navigate. The couple was researching rats moving in a room when they noticed that another area of the brain, the entorhinal cortex, was activated in a unique spatial pattern that corresponded with the location of the animal’s head and the borders of the room.
Research into the inner workings of the brain has been among the top priorities for the scientific community in recent years. Last year, the European Union launched a 10-year effort to simulate the human brain on supercomputers. And President Obama launched a $100 million initiative to build tools to accelerate the pace of brain research – an effort that many believe will be as groundbreaking as the Human Genome Project, which led to the sequencing of the 3 billion base pairs that comprise human DNA.
Last year, two Americans -- James Rothman of Yale University and Randy Schekman of the University of California at Berkeley -- and German-born Thomas Suedhof of Stanford University won the Nobel in medicine for their work on how the body’s cells communicate. The research has had a major impact in our understanding of how the brain transmits signals.
Cornelia Bargmann, a neurobiologist at Rockefeller University and a 2013 winner of the Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences, funded by Internet entrepreneurs Mark Zuckerburg, Sergey Brin and others, said this year’s Nobel-honored work is groundbreaking because it not only tells us about how the brain understands space but more complex cognitive relationships, as well.
Bargmann, co-chair of the advisory committee for the president’s BRAIN (Brain Research Through Innovative Neurotechnologies) initiative, said the scientists showed the brain creates a two-dimensional grid of the world  based on “a group of neurons that tell you where you are moving and how you have been.” Those points are in turn linked to people, places and other sights, smells and experiences.
“The first time I saw that work I nearly fell out of my chair -- it is so amazing,” she said. “It is the beginning of how memory is represented. This is why some people compare memories to moving through space.”
Joshua Sanes, director of Harvard University’s Center for Brain Research, said that while the work by O’Keefe and the Moser is still in the early stages – it has only been done in animals, and it’s unclear whether human brains are set up the same way – it provides fundamental insights into brains and their relation to life.
“It’s about navigational abilities that little kids have, mice have, ants have and honey bees have,” he said. “It’s a very basic evolutionary mental activity that is absolutely critical for many species' survival. How the brain works is maybe the biggest mystery that remains in all the world of the life sciences, and this is a key piece in the puzzle.”
The Nobel winners’ work provides such a fundamental insight into the brain that many neuroscientists are hopeful that the discovery will one day help us find treatments for a host of neurological conditions.
“The studies were of a part of the brain involved in certain neurological disease, such as Alzheimer’s, and getting lost is a symptom of Alzheimer’s,” Sanes explained. “While nobody should be thinking this is on the direct road to a treatment, but it provides a starting point for the first time.”
Emery Brown, a member of the advisory committee for the BRAIN initiative, said he expects work building on the three scientists’ discoveries to accelerate over the next few years as scientists try to figure out whether the place and grid cells work the same way in humans.
If it turns out to be the case, he said, the implications are far-reaching.
“You could think of ways to help stimulate areas to enhance memory, to help people who have had brain injuries recover function, maybe even to help preserve function as we grow older,” said Brown, a professor of computational neuroscience at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
The Nobel Prize in physics will be announced Tuesday, the prize in chemistry Wednesday, and literature on Thursday. The Nobel Peace Prize will be announced Friday. A prize in economics, in memory of Alfred Nobel, will be announced on Oct. 13.

Kevin Metheny, 1954-2014: 'one of the major talk radio programmers of the modern era'
When Kevin Metheny became program director of WGN-AM 720 in 2008, he brought with him a lengthy resume, a reputation for being controversial and a clear mission — shake up programming at a Chicago radio institution and grow its audience.
The rebuilding process was, by most accounts, a failure, with key personalities exiting the station amid growing resentment from some longtime listeners. Mr. Metheny's rocky tenure at WGN was over in less than two years.
But the well-traveled program director, dubbed "Pig Virus" by shock jock Howard Stern, rebounded with radio giant Cumulus Media, first as program director of WJR-AM in Detroit and more recently as operations manager for KGO-AM and KSFO-AM in San Francisco, where he started work this summer.

Resilient throughout his four-decade career, Mr. Metheny, 60, died Friday, Oct. 3, apparently of a heart attack, according to reports.
"He was not afraid to put his fingerprint on a station or on a personality," said Michael Harrison, publisher of Talkers magazine, a radio trade publication. "Sometimes it was for good and sometimes it didn't always work out that well. But he was undoubtedly one of the major talk radio programmers of the modern era."
News of Mr. Metheny's death was first reported by AllAccess.com, a radio industry website.

"Kevin Metheny's sudden passing (Friday) afternoon is a devastating personal and professional loss for his broadcasting family at Cumulus, and for the entire radio industry," John Dickey, vice president of Cumulus Media, said in a statement. "Kevin was a legendary broadcasting talent who touched many lives in his remarkable 44-year career, and whose successes made an indelible mark on radio."
Born into a radio family — he was the son of broadcaster Terrell Metheny — Mr. Metheny started his own radio career in Oklahoma. His travels in the radio industry would end up taking him to stations in Ohio, New York, Florida, Minnesota, Maryland, Georgia, Texas and South Carolina. In addition to his tenure at WGN-AM, he listed on his LinkedIn resume an earlier stint at WEFM in Chicago.
Mr. Metheny also was involved in programming and production for MTV and VH1 between 1984 and 1986.
Nice to see the Tribune finally pulled down the insulting, poorly-written ANONYMOUS "obituary" that ran for three days calling this guy "pig vomit" in front of his grieving children. Stay classy, Tribune !

He first made a name for himself, however, as program director at WNBC-AM in New York from 1980 to 1984. There Mr. Metheny was charged with guiding ascending radio star Howard Stern, who openly bristled under his management. Stern ridiculed his boss, calling him "Pig Virus" on the air and in his best-selling book "Private Parts," and then caricaturing him as part of a composite program director named "Pig Vomit" in the movie version of his memoirs.
One area of contention was Mr. Metheny's insistence that Stern and other on-air personalities emphasize the "N" when delivering the WNBC call letters. Harrison said the idea was a deceptively innovative way to differentiate WNBC from rival WABC for listeners. Mr. Metheny was, in essence, rebranding and positioning the station through one simple letter.
Mr. Metheny was hired as program director at WGN-AM in December 2008, one week after its parent company, Chicago-based Tribune Co., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. He was brought to the station by Randy Michaels, a former radio executive who rose to become CEO of Tribune Co. during the protracted bankruptcy.
"It's an honor to join the leadership of an American treasure like WGN Radio," Metheny said in a statement at the time of his hiring. For some critics, his tenure all but buried the station.
Mr. Metheny's attempts to advise long-time WGN-AM midday hosts Kathy O'Malley and Judy Markey on the kind of show he wanted from them ultimately resulted in their sudden exit from the station in May 2009.
Other changes on Mr. Metheny's watch included the controversial hire of convicted former Chicago City Clerk Jim Laski, a radio novice, as well as bringing in Greg Jarrett from San Francisco to handle morning drive and Mike McConnell from Cincinnati for midmornings.
Mr. Metheny also hired veteran Chicago radio personality Garry Meier for afternoon drive. He moved John Williams in and out a variety of daytime slots. And he opted not to renew the contract of midday host Steve Cochran, who had been in line to succeed the retiring Spike O'Dell in the station's coveted morning slot until he failed to agree to terms on a new deal just before Mr. Metheny's arrival in 2008.
"Our plan may not have been the most elegantly or artfully executed of all possible plans, but we actually understand what it is we think we are trying to do and why we think we're trying to do it," Mr. Metheny told the Tribune in 2010.
Mr. Metheny left WGN-AM on the heels of the departure of Michaels, who was forced to resign as Tribune Co. CEO in October 2010.
Harrison said that while the changes at WGN rightly came under much criticism from listeners and industry insiders alike, Mr. Metheny was not necessarily the author of the plan.
"He was basically doing the job that he was hired to do," Harrison said. "He didn't really fail; the project failed. If he failed, he wouldn't have popped up again as program director of WJR or as the operation manager for Cumulus in San Francisco."
Harrison said he thought Mr. Metheny was already gaining traction in turning around the struggling San Francisco stations for Cumulus Media, the largest pure-play radio company in the U.S. with some 525 stations in 110 cities. That he maintained their confidence, and his own, despite so many ups and downs may be his true radio legacy.
"His reputation and accomplishments are simply unparalleled and we are grateful for having had the opportunity to work with him as (program director) of WJR in Detroit and most recently, as operations manager of KGO and KSFO in San Francisco," Dickey said. "His Cumulus family extends our deepest sympathies to Kevin's loved ones. We will miss him profoundly."
Mr. Metheny is survived by two daughters.

ISL: Chennaiyin FC announce MS Dhoni as co-o...abhishek bachchan
(Dhoni, the current Indian…)
CHENNAI: After the likes of Sachin Tendulkar and Virat Kohli , cricket captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni has become the latest cricketer to own a football team in the high-profile Indian Super League, investing in the Chennaiyin FC ahead of the event starting October 12.
Dhoni, the current Indian cricket captain, has pencilled a deal to be a co-owner of Chennaiyin FC along with Bollywood actor Abhishek Bachchan .
Dhoni was excited to be a part of ISL as he is also passionate about football.
"I used to be a goalkeeper in school and always enjoy playing and watching the game. I wanted to be associated with football so when the opportunity came to be a part of Chennaiyin FC I was ecstatic as this gives me a chance to connect with the city of Chennai again. I have played franchise cricket for this city so I know how supportive they are," Dhoni stated.
He added, "I am sure all the players of Chennaiyin FC will see how much love Chennai gives to their players. The Hero Indian Super League is a fantastic platform for football to grow with so many big names, IMG-Reliance and Star India associated with it. I look forward to an exciting season ahead but at the same time it's important that we develop the grassroots level and produce more football stars in India."
Last month, Dhoni's deputy in the Indian cricket team was announced as co-owner of ISL team FC Goa. Tendulkar is a co-owner of Kerala Blasters while ex-cricket captain Sourav Ganguly is a co-owner of Atletico de Kolkata.
The announcement was made by Chennaiyin FC co-owner Vita Dani.
"It is an absolute honour to have the legendary MS Dhoni as one of the co-owners of our franchise, Chennaiyin FC. Mahi has a strong association with the people of Chennai and so with him coming on board, we take another giant step towards achieving the goal of creating a world class football club in Chennai. Vanakkam Mahi!"
Chennaiyin FC starts their ISL campaign with an away game against FC Goa on October 15 while their first home fixture is against Kerala Blasters on October 21.

The low temperatures Sunday morning across the D.C. metro region, 10 to 15 degrees below normal, offered a sneak preview of typical mid-November early morning chill.
Reagan National Airport dropped to 44 degrees, some 11 degrees below normal but still 7 degrees above the record for the date: 37 in 1935.
To the west and north, temperatures were notably colder.  Dulles plummeted to 33 degrees, just one shy of its daily record, 32, set in 1970.

Michael Bloomberg receives an honorary knighthoodBy Helena Andrews October 6 Follow @helena_andrews
Former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg at a charity gala in New York on Oct. 1, 2014. (John Minchillo/AP)
If you’re like me — a fan of all things celluloid British, including but not limited to “ The Sword in the Stone ” — then images of round tables and suits of armor danced in your head when it was announced Monday that former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg was named (not dubbed) an Honorary Knight of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.
But apparently that isn’t exactly how things work. There will be a “presentation,” according to our source, but the amount of pomp and circumstance is usually up to the awardee. The former mayor can now officially add “KBE” to his signature, but “Sir Bloomberg” he is not — that title is reserved for British citizens.
. @MikeBloomberg congratulations on becoming an Honorary Knight of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire. Richly deserved!
— Peter Westmacott (@PeterWestmacott) October 6, 2014
The official ceremony, a small formal affair for friends and family at which Bloomberg will receive his KBE insignia, will most likely be held in the next three to six months in either Washington or New York. Peter Westmacott, the British ambassador to the United States, not Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, will be presiding.
“The UK honours system recognises exceptional achievement and service to the nation, and includes non-British nationals who receive ‘Honorary’ awards for their important contribution to British interests,” read the statement released by the British embassy in Washington.
While mayor of New York, Bloomberg, the $35 billion dollar media mogul, backed a tourism partnership between the big apple and London. Bloomberg L.P. European operations have been headquartered in London since 1987.

If the names “Chacha Chaudhury”, “Shrimatiji”, “Billoo” and “Pinki” ring a bell, and if you want to take a trip down Nostalgia Street to see those “comics” again, you could head to a cartoon exhibition currently on in the city.
“Remembering Vins, Pran and Bapu”, a joint exhibition of select cartoons by three noted cartoonists who passed away recently, has been organised by the Indian Institute of Cartoonists. The exhibition began on Monday. It showcases cartoons by Vijay Narain Seth (Vins), Pran Kumar Sharma (Pran) and Sattiraju Lakshmi Narayan (Bapu).
The cartoons by Vins are sketches with watercolours. They are self explanatory, frequently with no text. One shows Indian snake charmers on a golf course with one of them using a snake as a club to strike a golf ball. Another shows a clever schoolchild who has fixed a wheel on to his heavy schoolbag to save his back from the burden. In another cartoon, a bullock cart driver reads out instructions from a computer to guide the cart around his field. In yet another, a bullock cart driver has a helmet on his head, as he is surrounded by tall trucks amidst heavy traffic on a city road.
Bapu’s cartoons reflect the everyday lives of people. One shows an entire household in tears, sniffling while watching a TV serial. The cartoons are in Hindi, English and Telugu. Some have no text but still manage to make the onlooker smile.’ Over the years, the ideas and words used in them have changed (goggles are shades today).
The exhibition is on till October 18 and entry is free.

Steve King wants new video to go viral  decides to copy Jimmy KimmelBy Jaime Fuller October 6 Follow @j_fuller
In this parody of a "Jimmy Kimmel Live" segment, Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) reads a selection of insulting tweets about himself. (King for Congress via YouTube)
"Oddly, no one has compiled a list of all the cuckoo things Steve King has said." So wrote @bmorrett on Twitter. And so Rep. Steve King's (R-Iowa) campaign decided to lend a hand.
The conservative congressman's YouTube channel currently now features a two-minute recitation of mean tweets about him.
Hmm ... this feels familiar. Where have we seen this before? Oh, I remember!
We're not going to embed any of the "Celebrities Read Mean Tweets" segments from "Jimmy Kimmel Live" here, because people on Twitter say truly horrendous things that don't jibe with our newspaperish sense of manners. But you've probably seen them before. The videos have tens of millions of views.
As of posting, King's video had 560 page views.
The video isn't all self-deprecation. King responds to one tweet, which said of the representative, "your the problem." King's retort: "You're illiterate. You're rhymes with Common Core, which is where your education must have come from."
King has been a long-time opponent of the education standards which have conservative America up in arms.
The congressman has served six terms in the most conservative district in Iowa. He faces Jim Mowrer, an Iraq War veteran, in next month's election. A local poll from last month had King up by about 10 percentage points . In an Omaha World-Herald article about the race, a political scientist from Drake University said, “You can call the 4th District the kingdom of Steve King — the Steve Kingdom."
Jaime Fuller reports on national politics for "The Fix" and Post Politics. She worked previously as an associate editor at the American Prospect, a political magazine based in Washington, D.C.

19 of the 20 most charitable states voted for RomneyBy Niraj Chokshi October 6 Follow @NirajC
Of the 20 states whose residents donated the biggest share of their income, all but one voted for Mitt Romney in 2012.
Rates of giving ranged from 1.74 percent in New Hampshire to 6.56 percent in Utah, as a share of their adjusted gross income, according to a comprehensive review of Internal Revenue Service data by the Chronicle of Philanthropy . (Utah is home to a sizable population of Mormons, who are expected to contribute 10 percent of their income to the church.) Among the top 20, all but 18th-ranked Florida voted for Romney during the last presidential election. Wyoming ranked 20th with a rate of giving of 3.09 percent.

Equities closed a fifth straight week of advances Friday, boosted by accommodative actions from central banks in China and Europe. That factor could continue boosting markets as sources told Reuters that the Chinese leadership and central bank were ready to cut interest rates again and loosen lending restrictions. Such policy changes in the world's second-biggest economy could spur more market gains.
"The carry-over effect from China, taken with the fact that the U.S. is pretty healthy, and you have a market with a bias to trend higher, especially on the cyclical front," said Mike Gibbs, who helps oversee more than $500 billion as co-head of the equity advisory group at Raymond James in Memphis.
Cyclical stocks - tied to the pace of economic growth - led gains, with the S&P consumer discretionary sector <.SPLRCD> up 0.8 percent. Financials <.SPSY> rose 0.4 percent.
The weakest group was telecom <.SPLRCL>, down 1.6 percent. AT&T  fell 1.7 percent to $34.69 while Verizon  lost 1.6 percent at $49.41 after Citigroup downgraded the stock to "neutral." Both stocks limited the Dow's advance.

Prosensa soared 64 percent to $18.74 while Platinum was up 20 percent at $73.77.
Cimatron Ltd  jumped 42 percent to $8.65 on its heaviest ever one-day volume after 3D Systems Corp  agreed to buy the company for $97 million. Shares of 3D jumped 6.1 percent to $37.31.

Change is permanent sir anyway mrf creating more spiritual people.Silver Member
28 Followers
Earlier I was very critical and annoyed at MRF management on their policy of no Bonus and low dividend. But now we cannot change them and as the spiritual leaders say " Learn to accept person, situvation as they are" and then you would have peace of mind. There is no point in cribbing about the attitute of Management with the shareholders. Though Bonus would lead to temporary jump in prices, the capital of the company would jump and EPS would accordingly fall. On the other hand by not declaring Bonus, EPS is kept high and low floating stock add to the value of the script.For e.g Apollo is traded at 10 times its consolidated EPS, while MRF due to low Capital is getting a higher 15 times discounting. Both have similar revenue and profits but MRF is attracting higher valuation due to a low capital base.

Reuters |  Oct 06, 2014 10:17 PM IST
US stocks rose on Monday, extending a rally from the previous session as investors grew more confident in the economy's strength and Federal Reserve policy. Merger activity and corporate restructuring also boosted equities, with the S&P 500 advancing above its 50-day moving average for the first time since September 29, a sign that near-term momentum is improving. Tech shares were among the strongest of the day after Hewlett-Packard Co said it would split into two public companies, sending shares up 4.2 per cent to $36.68 on heavy volume. The S&P 500 index had posted its best day since August on Friday, lifted by a stronger-than-expected jobs report that boosted optimism about the economy.

Accurate accounting of house sale  profit  includes costs0
How do I calculate how much I've actually made from buying and selling property?
A: We fairly frequently get asked about calculating the true profit or loss from a property. In tax terminology, it's called the "cost basis," and it includes the cost of buying the property plus the cost of selling the property, plus the cost of any material additions or repairs (including a new roof or a room addition but not the cost of redecorating). All of these costs are then subtracted from the sales price of the property and the total is the cost basis.
There are a number of ways to make the "profit" look better than it is. If you simply subtract the purchase price from the sales price (which is what it sounds like you did), then you would get a higher profit.
But there are all sorts of costs you pay when buying and selling property (the real estate commission comes to mind, as do costs associated with getting a loan or advertising the property for sale, if you're selling by owner). By not subtracting those from your "profit" total, you might feel better about your investment prowess, but you would wind up paying taxes on gains unnecessarily.
Current tax law states that as long as you live in your primary residence for 24 months (or two out of the past five years), you can keep up to $250,000 in gains tax free when you sell. Since none of your "profits" was above this level, you probably never overpaid the IRS.
But we suspect your colleague is being slightly more accurate by including your true costs of purchase and sale, not to mention other costs.

Costs may make couple s refi plans a washShould we refinance our primary residence to a 15-year loan or should we keep paying down the principal? Eventually, we'd like to be done with the loan. I just don't know if there's an advantage to refinancing at this stage.
A: Thanks for your kind words about the radio show (Noon to 2 p.m. Eastern, at WSBradio.com).
The good news is that you and your husband are in great shape for retirement. As long as you can sell your lake house relatively quickly, and you're cash-flow neutral on the third property (which we suspect is a former residence belonging to you or your spouse, and is now a rental property), your retirement looks to be secure.
We had to guess on a few of your numbers. From where we sit, here's how things look when it comes to deciding whether you should refinance or continue to pay off your loan.
First, we're guessing you put down 20 percent, or $93,000 in cash on your current residence in order to avoid private mortgage insurance (PMI). If you didn't, then you should immediately refinance to get rid of that additional cost.
Assuming a 30-year loan of $372,000 at 3.875 percent, your monthly payment is $1,749.28. And you're adding $650 per month to that, for a total payment of $2,399.28. At that rate, you'll pay off your current mortgage in 18 years, with a total interest payment of $144,841.60.
If you refinance what we think is your current balance after two and a half years, you'll get a new 15-year loan for $335,639 at 3.5 percent. Your new payment will be virtually identical to your current payment, or $2,399.28. With this new loan, you'll pay $96,257.43 in interest.
You might compare the two amounts of interest and think you're better off with the second loan than the first. But remember, you're already two and a half years into your loan and have already paid roughly $36,000 in interest. And, your prepayments have sliced your loan term down to 18 years, of which you have roughly 15.5 years left.
So what are you really saving by refinancing? Not much. The way we figure, there's about $8,000 to $10,000 in savings by switching loans. However, you'll have some costs associated with getting a new loan, including points and fees and the time to gather all of the documents and shop for a new lender.
You might save $2,000 to $3,000 or you might not. In any case, it may not be worth the time and effort unless you were going to pay down the interest rate.
The time to have done this would have been two years ago, when you got the loan. Then, you might have snagged a 15-year mortgage for under 3 percent, or a 10-year loan for 2.75 percent.
If you can get a loan like that, then you might want to go for it. Otherwise, you're better off taking the $5,000 to $8,000 you'd pay in loan fees and making a bigger monthly prepayment (or even a one-time additional pre-payment), which may bring your loan term down by another year.
Hope this helps.

Refinance HELOC well before expiration  or expect troubleRefinance HELOC well before expiration

By Ilyce Glink and Samuel J. Tamkin
Q: My husband and I took out a home equity line of credit in 2004 at the height of the economic boom with a major bank. This bank also holds our first mortgage.
Of course we expected to pay it back before the 10-year term, but the recession derailed our plans.
We have been struggling but have worked hard to make payments on time. The line of credit became due this January. Last October I had a meeting with an accountant. He told us: "Don't worry. They are stuck with you. It is customary for them to term re-amortitize these equity lines."
I contacted the bank in December and presented them with a check for $500 as a sign of good faith until we met in January. When we arrived at the branch we were talked into applying for modifications and other programs.
We have continued to make interest payments per the original contract which they have accepted. Several times people at the bank have tried to discourage me from making those payments. Is that significant?
At the end of approximately six months and with a box full of correspondence, we were denied any help. We were very surprised. We took a little break to regroup. It had been a grueling process and very stressful for me.
0
My husband phoned another financial institution and asked to look at our case. We sent him income tax returns and he was hopeful that he could help us. He phoned the next day to tell us that he had run our credit report and that it showed 30-day late on the equity line every month starting in February. We didn't know how that had happened, as we had continued to make the interest payments.
No one at the bank had explained that that would be the case. The new lender told us that he would now not be able to grant us a loan unless the bank removed the late payments from our credit report.
When my husband phoned the bank on September 8, he was told they would not remove the late payments and our property had been referred to a foreclosure attorney. On September 13, we received a letter telling us they were notifying all credit agencies that our property was in foreclosure starting on September 4.
Now our credit is ruined virtually for the rest of our life.
Meanwhile, we know nothing about the foreclosure process and do not trust the bank after what has happened. We do have equity. Are we in danger of losing it? Will they now increase the payoff amount and quit taking payments on the first and equity line?
Has the bank acted in a legal and ethical manner? Do we have any recourse?
Could you please recommend an attorney or agency that might be able to help us?
FYI, I have never made a late payment on a mortgage in my life.
A: You've made a number of big mistakes, and it's hard to know where to start.
First, you should have been talking to your lender and not an accountant who has nothing to do with your mortgage. He gave you very bad advice about your HELOC.
Next, you should have started talking to lenders about refinancing your home equity line of credit loan six months to a year before the term expired. By waiting until the very end to start a conversation with your lender, you boxed yourself in and caused yourself a huge amount of damage, which you may or may not recover from.
Third, although you were making interest payments, you may not have been able to do that, per your HELOC loan agreement. What does the paperwork you signed say about not paying off the loan by the due date? It probably says that the lender retains the right to put you into foreclosure.
Now you've tarnished your credit, so refinancing may be impossible, the lender won't talk to you (because the loan has been referred to a foreclosure attorney) and you could lose your home. This is a very dangerous place to be.
You should immediately hire an attorney who can file an action to have the foreclosure stopped while you work things out. Find an attorney who is a real estate attorney but also who can help you with litigation. If you don't know of an attorney, you can go to the local bar association, ask for the head of the real estate committee, and tell him or her your story and ask for a referral.
In addition, you can file a complaint with HelpWithMyBank.gov, which is the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency's website. But it's unclear to us that the bank did anything wrong.
Good luck. We hope this works out for you.

Inova said to be in negotiations to buy 117-acre campus for translational medicine instituteBy Jonathan O'Connell October 3 Follow @OConnellPostBiz
Inova Health System executives have engaged in lengthy negotiations with officials from Exxon Mobil in an effort to acquire the energy company’s 117-acre campus in Merrifield as a new home for its Translational Medicine Institute .
The deal could allow the the expansion of Inova’s high-profile genomics research led by Dr. John Niederhuber, a nationally renowned surgeon who is chief executive of the institute and co-director of a clinical research network at Johns Hopkins University.
Sources familiar with the discussions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the talks were meant to be private, cautioned that negotiations have not neared completion and a deal may still not be reached.

Two sources said Inova, Northern Virginia’s largest healthcare provider, made its first offer for the property months ago and have since conducted escalating back-and-forth discussions with Exxon over how to reach a deal for the institute’s future home.
“They’ve been going back and forth and back and forth,” said one source. “The initial offer was an insult to Exxon. But now [Inova] is the only one that they’re focused on. They’re not talking to anybody else.”
Another source said Inova was also considering the relocation of its cancer center onto the Exxon property.
Spokespersons for Exxon Mobil and Inova declined to comment.
Personalized medicine based on genetic research is considered a major opportunity for expansion by Inova Health, led by president J. Knox Singleton, and a field ripe for commercialization that could boost the economy in Northern Virginia.
The campus is located just off the Capital Beltway at Route 50 and across the street from Inova’s flagship facility, Inova Fairfax Hospital.
Under the direction of Niederhuber, researchers at the Transalational Medicine Institute investigate ways to use personal genetic data in the diagnosis, treatment and management of disease.
Last summer, for example, the institute launched a partnership aimed at developing and commercializing computer models capable of predicting the risk of premature births. Researchers there are also in the midst of a study that will capture the genetic codes of 5,000 expectant families and track the first two years of the babies’ lives to gain more information about what triggers disease.

The wooded campus is one of Fairfax County’s most valuable commercial properties,  assessed at $193 million this year. Built to house Mobil Corp.’s domestic refining and marketing operations before the company was acquired by Exxon in 1999, it has four central office towers that total 1.2 million square feet and approvals for two additional towers totaling 550,000 square feet.
The buildings include more than 60 conference rooms, a 736-seat cafeteria, a gym, a swimming pool and a corporate board room featuring a lustrous beech wood table. Buried underground are more than 90 percent of Exxon Mobil’s 2,580 parking spaces and a quarter-mile-long service tunnel where deliveries arrive.
Exxon Mobil plans to depart the campus in late 2015, moving many of the Fairfax jobs to Houston.
With government contractors and other companies  cutting back dramatically, officials in Northern Virginia have been looking for other industries capable of boosting the area’s economy.
Gerald L. Gordon, executive director of the Fairfax County Economic Development Authority, said in an interview this week on the county’s prospects that he considers personalized medicine a “growth industry for the future” for Northern Virginia.
This is not the first time Inova and other Northern Virginia stakeholders have bet big on genetic research and personalized medicine as a growth industry.
Five years ago then-Virginia Gov. Timothy M. Kaine (D) and officials from the Ignite Institute for Individualized Health, a non-profit organization led by California geneticist Dietrich Stephan, announced plans for a $200 million genetic research facility with Inova that could attract thousands of jobs.
But no location was selected for the 300,000-square-foot project, and the following year a private investor, Inova and Fairfax County officials all subsequently backed out, leaving Ignite short of funds .
Gordon said the effort under Stephan had been too broad and that when the economic authority markets the county to biomedical or technology companies from out of town, Niederhuber provides a selling point.
“We’ve talked to people around the world and they know his name,” Gordon said.
Inova spokeswoman Jane Donaldson issued a statement saying that “as a matter of organization policy, we do not comment on rumor or speculation.”
Exxon Mobil spokesman Todd Spitler issued a statement saying that the company was discussing the property with all relevant parties and that “as a matter of practice, we do not comment on  market speculation or rumor.”

Failure of corporate governance results in financial crisis: IOSCObanking
The International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) said that corporate governance failures have been cited as contributors to the financial crisis and more recently to the Libor scandals.
 “Risks related to corporate governance may build up in the financial system, signalling the need for regulators to better understand how corporate incentives and internal structures contribute to generating those risks,” said IOSCO in its report, Securities Markets Risk Outlook 2014-15. This is the second edition of the annual IOSCO’s Securities Markets Risk Outlook series.
 A string of financial crises, including the Asian crisis of 1998, the dotcom bubble and the Enron scandal of the early 2000s and the global financial crisis of 2007/08 have brought the issue of corporate governance to the fore.
Governance failures
 More recently, said the report, “governance failures have been signalled as key risks in a growing number of scandals that have shocked financial markets, such as the Libor-scandal.” Consequently, between 2007 and 2013, investor confidence suffered a steady decline. Furthermore, trust in the financial markets also has been affected.
 The report said that a survey conducted for the U.S. population on financial trust highlighted that while investor trust in mutual funds has increased slightly over the past six years, trust in banks has been volatile since end-2008. “Very few people trust the functioning of stock markets and large corporations.”
At a micro, individual-firm level, there is some evidence to suggest that good corporate governance contributes to strong corporate performance, lower cost of capital, lower borrowing costs and out performance relative to one’s corporate peers.
Quoting another survey among business leaders, the report said that unethical practices were the biggest source of reputational risk to a corporation.
At the aggregate level, “sound corporate governance of financial firms is seen as a critical element in preventing a build-up of potential systemic risks.”

Bruges Will Cut Traffic With  an Underground Beer PipelineThe pipeline aims to be commuter- and eco-friendly, unclogging the streets and lowering emissions.

This article originally appeared in Wired .
In the years since the De Halve Maan brewery opened a bottling facility outside Bruges in 2010, the company’s faced a tricky logistics problem. It still brews beer at its original site downtown, just as it has for nearly five centuries. To get all that delicious beer to the new factory for filtration, bottling, and shipping, it uses trucks. Trucks that burn fuel, spew carbon, and clog the city’s cobblestone streets (which surely froths all that beer).

No more. The city council has approved the brewery’s unusual but clever plan to save time and money while reducing emissions and congestion. It will build a pipeline to ferry the good stuff across town, underground. Yes, you read that right: a beer pipeline.
Instead of making the three-mile drive in one of dozens of tankers that traverse town each day, the award-winning beer will flow through a 1.8-mile polyethylene pipeline, making the trip in 15 to 20 minutes. The pipeline will move 6,000 liters of beer every hour, De Halve Maan CEO Xavier Vanneste told Het Nieuwsblad .
As CityLab points out , Cleveland’s Great Lakes Brewing Company uses underground tubes to move beer between its brewery and its pub, across the street. But this is a longer journey, one with real environmental consequences, and the Belgian pipeline surely will have a bigger impact in terms of reducing traffic and carbon emissions. “In time, this innovative investment plan would reduce the amount of transport by heavy goods vehicles by 85 percent,” says Franky Dumon, the alderman for spatial planning who approved the project on behalf of the city council. “It is a win-win situation for everyone.”
De Halve Maan gets to move its beer swiftly and efficiently, without giving up the medieval site that draws more than 100,000 visitors every year. Bruges doesn’t have to spend a dime, since the brewery guarantees it will cover the installation and road repair costs. There are no public cost estimates for building the pipeline just yet, but De Halve Maan says it will minimize tearing up public streets with “computer-guided drilling techniques.”
The residents of Bruges will be happy to get all those trucks off the street, but we assume they’re at least kind of hoping for a burst pipe and streets filled with free beer.

Dollar Strength Seeing Global Reverberations; EMs Hit MostGold Gains Rs 130 on Wedding Season Demand
The week ahead should see equity markets rebound as dollar strength seeing oil and gold hit new lows for the year.
The strength in the dollar has seen globally currencies get weaker as the euro hit a near 2-year low at 125, the Japanese yen hit a 6-year low breaking the 110 barrier and so did most emerging market currencies plummet against the greenback.
A strong dollar, however, has also seen oil prices react sharply with WTI (Western Texas Intermediary) close below $90 and Brent below $92 - the lowest in the last 3 years. The correction in oil prices has been over 10 per cent in the last month.
Indian stock markets had a very dull holiday shortened trading week with Reserve bank of India (RBI) maintaining 'status quo' on rates and foreign investors on the sidelines.
Globally the strength of the dollar, continued protests in Hong Kong and gold below $1200 were the main events for the week. Prime Minister Modi's US visit also went off well with American corporates committing investments in India of almost $41 billion over the next 5 years.
The Hang Seng Index for Hong Kong stocks has lost almost 10 per cent for the month after continued protests saw the Hong Kong dollar fall to its lowest in the last 4 years.
Technically, the Nifty has now become range-bound with resistance around 8050 and support coming at 7877. For the week, the index ended down 0.28 per cent, while the high beta Bank Nifty lost 1.86 per cent. The outperformer for the week was the CNX IT Index which ended with gains of 3.42 per cent, coming on the back of rupee touching 61.5 a new 7-month low.
Top 3 gainers on the NSE were Sun Pharma, up 6.71 per cent, Wipro, up 4.61 per cent, and Infosys, up 4.53 per cent, while top 3 losers were DLF, down 7.41 per cent, Jindal Steel, down 7.06 per cent, and Tata Power, down 3.79 per cent.
The US Dow Jones Index staged a sharp rally on Friday and managed to close back above 17000 after seeing huge volatility for the entire week. The pull-back was also attributed to strong employment numbers showing growth momentum returning in the economy.
With results season on the anvil, markets should see further time-bound correction this week also with Nifty trading between 7850 and 8050. The rupee has so far shown extreme resilience against the dollar and would rate the best performer in the emerging market basket correcting around 2 per cent. With oil and gold now in near-term bear run, Indian equity should outperform with economy showing strong underlying growth and lower-than-expected current account deficit which should see increase in government spending.

Mumbai: India Inc will observe October 10 as the 'compliance day for laws', being organised as a part of the week-long series of deliberations and workshops around the across the country starting from Monday.
Scoring anything short on 10 on 10 on compliance would render individual and organisations vulnerable on compliances, especially as the cost of non-compliances has risen exponentially, said a release by Mumbai-based Legasis which is organising the 'Compliance and Ethics' Week.
The event would be flagged off in Pune on Monday and in the next three days from October 7, ten members of Legasis team will visit various locations across 10 states. The visits will highlight the importance of culture of compliance with poster campaigns, a presentation empowering the compliance executives and interactive sessions.
The event would be flagged off in Pune on Monday and in the next three days from October 7, ten members of Legasis team will visit various locations across 10 states.
#india inc #compliance day #tata steel #tata motors
Tata Steel, Tata Motors, Wells Fargo, Volkswagen, Adani Group, Sesa Goa and NFCL are among the companies where deliberations and workshops are being organised during the event, the release said. On October 10, an interactive workshop would be held in Mumbai on 'Criminalisation of Indian Business' which will be attended by compliance and ethics professionals.
Eminent panel members will share their experiences on regulators, governmental authorities, local governments, specialised bodies such as SEBI, CCI and others appearing to be competing with each other to collect as much fines as they can and penalise the business for any wrongdoing, it said.
"It is our belief that high ethical quotient, uncompromising compliance culture and strong governance practices benchmarked with global practices such as the OECD guidelines, would provide competitive edge to Indian companies," Legasis Services founder director Suhas Tuljapurkar said.
"By reinforcing compliance, our attempt is to enhance India's ranking in Global Integrity Index," he added. "With overall economy's impetus on development and growth, behaviour has become imperative for Indian business now to focus on governance and compliance," Legasis Services CEO Debashis Roy said.
The event will conclude on October 10 with a compliance awards ceremony followed by a panel discussion on critical developments in domain of compliance. A knowledge portal developed by Legasis on industry best practices for compliance management throughout the year will also be inaugurated on October 10, the release added.

When Talent Started Driving Economic GrowthWeekend Roundup: Is China Outpacing Mexico on the Rule of Law?
Getty/WorldPost Illustration
On the same day this week that President Obama announced a measure that could give legal protection to 5 million undocumented immigrants, massive protests raged across Mexico against the impunity and corruption that led to the horrific massacre of 43 students. From Mexico City, Sergio Sarmiento, Elena Poniatowska and Homero Aridjis chronicle the events and ponder what's next. Anthropologist Claudio Lomnitz examines the causes behind Mexico's corrosive impunity.   Meanwhile, as Xin Chunying writes from Beijing, China is also seeking to establish the rule of law through steadily boosting the role of the National People's Congress. While stifling dissent, China's President Xi is taking on both "tigers and flies" in his no-holds-barred assault from the top down on corruption.   Can China's effort succeed without active public engagement? Can Mexico learn from China and move from angry protest to systemic change? (continued)

Conventional Versus FHA: Which Should You Choosereddit
It is not an academic question. My calculations show that the wrong choice can cost a borrower as much as $33,000 over 15 years on a $200,000 loan, and as much as $66,000 on a $400,000 loan. Don't jump to the conclusion that the better choice is the mortgage with the lower interest rate. FHAs carry a lower interest rate but largely because of their high insurance premiums, they usually (but not always) cost the borrower more.
Do You Qualify For Both?
You have a choice between FHA and conventional mortgages only if you qualify for both. Then you can select the one that will cost you the least over the period you hold it, provided you correctly identify which one that is. Borrowers who cannot qualify for a conventional loan have no choice, they must use an FHA, which means that step 1 is to determine whether or not you qualify for both. If you can only put 3.5% down, for example, you can only qualify for an FHA, and the same is true if you can only put 5% down and your credit score is less than 660.
Because qualification requirements can vary with the purpose of the loan and type of property, there are a number of other situations where borrowers can only qualify for an FHA. If the borrower is looking to purchase a 4-family house, for example, qualification may be possible only with an FHA because the down payment requirement is much smaller than it is on a conventional loan.
While FHA qualification requirements are generally less restrictive than conventional requirements, there is one important exception. Loans used to purchase a property for investment purposes, as opposed to occupancy, are not allowed by FHA under any circumstances.
To see where your particular transaction stands in meeting FHA and conventional requirements, check it out with the Do You Qualify calculator on my web site.
Pricing Categories
Lenders today have two price lists for FHA loans and three lists for conventional loans. On FHAs, they distinguish:
• FHA standard loans, which are for amounts up to $271,050, and
• FHA jumbo loans, which are for amounts up to $625,500, the maximums varying by county.
On conventional loans, they distinguish:
• Conforming standard loans, which are for amounts up to $417,000 and eligible for purchase by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
• Conforming jumbo loans, which are for amounts up to $625,500, the maximums varying by county, and eligible for purchase by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
• Non-conforming jumbo loans, which are for amounts that exceed the conforming jumbo county limits and cannot be purchased by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
These pricing structures require that FHA/conventional cost comparisons be done separately for different loan amounts. The amounts I use are $200,000 which captures the pricing of conforming standard versus FHA standard; $400,000 which captures the pricing of conforming standard versus FHA jumbo; and $600,000 which captures the pricing of conforming jumbo versus FHA jumbo.
Measuring Cost to the Borrower
The cost of a mortgage to a borrower should be measured over the period the borrower has the mortgage. It is always possible that one mortgage might have lower costs over one period while the other would have lower costs over a longer or shorter period. Since mortgage life is not known in advance, I measure cost over three periods: 5, 10 and 15 years.
My cost measure includes lender charges and mortgage insurance charges, but not charges of other third parties, such as title insurers, which are not related to mortgage type. Total cost is defined as the sum of monthly payments of principal, interest and mortgage insurance, points and other lender fees paid upfront, and lost interest on upfront and monthly costs at 2%, less reduction in the loan balance over the period.
For each of the three loan amounts I compared the costs at 4 loan-to-value ratios (80%, 85%, 90% and 95%), three credit score (640, 740 and 800), and 3 periods (5, 10 and 15 years), or 36 comparisons altogether.
The Results
On both the $200,000 loan and the $400,000 loan, the cost of the FHA was significantly higher than that of the conventional in all 36 comparisons. This conclusion would hold for loan amounts up to $417,000. Prospective borrowers can safely assume that for loans up to $417,000, they are better off with the conventional than with the FHA.
On the $600, 000 loan, however, the results are mixed. At a credit score of 640, a borrower cannot qualify for a $600,000 conventional loan. At 740 and 800, the cost of a conventional loan is smaller with loan-to-value ratios of 90 or less, but at a ratio of 95, the cost of the conventional is larger. This mixed result would hold for any loan amount greater than $417,000. If you are in this bracket, the best way to be sure of your choice is to enter your own unique details in my calculator Which Type of Mortgage Will Minimize Your Costs?

Car-makers step on the gas for festive seasoneconomy, business and finance
With signs of consumer sentiment turning positive and first-time car-buyers thronging showrooms again, automobile makers are hopeful of good sales this festive season on the back of a slow revival for the past five months.
The auto market has seen good response during Onam, Ganesh Chaturthi and Navratri in the southern, western and northern regions, respectively, in September. Car-makers are already gearing up for the strong demand expected during Deepavali in October, the peak festive season. New models and facelifts are being launched to attract buyers.
“The first day of this festive season went well with upbeat retail sales posted across our network. We are gearing up our sales network to meet the demand expected in the coming days,” a spokesperson of Maruti Suzuki India said.
The country’s largest carmaker will be launching its much-awaited mid-size sedan Ciaz during the month. Pre-bookings for the car have opened.
The festival season is expected to be the silver lining for the industry that is on the road to recovery after two years of dismal sales. In 2013-14, domestic car sales stood at 17.87 lakh units or 4.65 per cent lower than the previous year. Likewise, in 2012-13, car sales dropped for the first time in a decade, by 6.69 per cent.
During the past two years, sales even during the festive season were tepid because of a continued economic slowdown, weak consumer sentiment, rising fuel prices and high interest rates. However, this year, the consumer sentiment has improved with a new government at the Centre and extension of excise duty cuts on automobiles announced in the Interim Budget in February.
The festive season generally accounts for 30 per cent of the sales volume for the automobile industry, said Rakesh Srivastava, senior vice-president (sales & marketing) at Hyundai Motor India.
“In the last two years, the growth for us during the festive season was very insignificant. This year, the industry is seeing a slow recovery; the encouraging thing is that first-time buyers are coming back to the market. There is also an increase in the number of exchange buyers. We are expecting a 15 per cent growth in volumes this season,” he added.
Similarly, Jnaneswar Sen, senior vice-president, marketing & sales, Honda Cars India, said, “There has been an improvement in buyer sentiment and it is indeed helping the industry.” With a rich portfolio including the newly launched Mobilio, and Amaze and Honda City, the company is confident that the season will bring in many buyers.Pravin Shah, chief executive, Automotive Division & International Operations (AFS), Mahindra & Mahindra, exuded confidence. “Looking at the last four months I must say slow and steady recovery has started … footfalls in the showroom are increasing, this gives me a feeling that October should be a good month compared to other months of the current financial year. We are expecting a growth of 15-20 per cent in our sales this season,” he said.

Its Rousseff and Neves in Brazil -- and a slap at a polling stationBy Dom Phillips October 5 Follow @domphillips
Though she led in the polls, Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff did not get the 50 percent of votes needed to win outright and will face opponent Aécio Neves in a runoff later this month. (Reuters)
RIO DE JANEIRO --  With 92 percent of the votes in Brazil's presidential election counted, incumbent Dilma Rousseff of the Workers Party is leading with 41 percent. She will almost definitely meet Aécio Neves of the Brazilian Party for Social Democracy in a second-round match-up. Neves has 34 percent. Brazilian Socialist Party candidate Marina Silva, who was until recently expected to face Rousseff in a second round, is out of the race, with 21 percent.
Brazil's voting technology has been a central feature of Sunday's elections -- and not always for the right reasons. New biometric voting systems being tried in different states caused problems when the fingerprint identification did not always work. There were long lines at polling stations in Brasília, the capital, and Niterói, near Rio de Janeiro, as a result.
Luiz Sampaio, 72, waited in line for an hour in Niteroí because machines were not working properly. It took numerous attempts before the machine recognized his fingerprints. "Each person took five to 10 minutes," he said. "Absurd."  Like many, he finally cast his vote for Rousseff.
Dias Toffoli, the president of Brazil's Supreme Electoral Court, compared the situation to a motorist driving a new car for the first time, in comments made at a news conference Sunday and reported by the O Globo newspaper.
"If the elector has to wait five or 10 minutes, what we have to guarantee is that the elector votes," Toffoli said.
A craze among Brazilian voters to take "selfies" at voting machines has also dominated the day -- even though it is illegal. So much so that there is a Tumblr stream called #SelfieNaUrna .
Technology also ruined Election Day for Col. Marcos Cardoso de Brito in Maceió, in Alagoas state in the northeast of Brazil. After an altercation in the line to vote, Brito, a candidate for senate for the National Ecological Party, lost his patience and slapped Marta Celeste de Oliveira, 39, who was waiting to vote, according to news site G1.
The incident was recorded on a cellphone and the video quickly had 14,000 hits on YouTube. Brito was videotaped leaving the polling station in a tirade of abuse. It was not the kind of Election-Day selfie anyone would have wanted.

A PS to Harvard Business Review Blog Post: Boards Can Be Terrible at Their Most Important Jobreddit
"A recent Bridgespan Group survey of nonprofit CEOs found that nearly half (46 percent) got little or no on-boarding help from their boards." -- Harvard Business Review
To help the board with the on-boarding process, a customized format can also be utilized. The board then tailors a program that helps the new executive to develop a solid base in the organization and to understand its unique climate and culture. Properly structured, this orientation takes about a year to complete. The board's time commitment decreases over the course of the year. Major responsibly for the program should rest with the board chair, but it should also involve one or more senior board members.
Every custom designed orientation program should include nine steps, either in sequence, or concurrently.
1. Developing immediate and long-term goals
2. Reviewing fiscal and personnel resources
3. Examining current policies and procedures
4. Developing staff relationships
6. Cultivating community or industry relationships
7. Understanding the customers, clientele, membership and stakeholders.
8. Discussing the new executive's career expectations
9. Establishing a succession plan should the executive be temporarily incapacitated
Steps one and two are often readily accomplished. The following steps need more detailed explanations because boards do not commonly initiate them.
• Examining Current Policies & Procedures: This is a routine but necessary task. The top administrative staff should be responsible for the new CEO's orientation on operating policies and procedures, and the CEO will also develop a fuller understanding of such policies and procedures as he/s makes daily operating decisions. However, when it comes to understanding how the board goes about setting policies, the CEO needs a formal "tutorial" orientation from the board chair. The CEO and the board chair should establish a work plan to determine if all board policies are concise, understandable and operationally complete. Depending upon the quality of prior work, this task can be simple or require extensive revisions and additions.
• Developing Staff Relationships: In any organization, top management changes cause staff insecurity and unrest. Old comfortable patterns will be broken. Resistance to change will likely occur. Board members must provide strong support for changes that are needed. Board members should have representation at all business meetings and at other functions where the board traditionally has been expected to participate.
• Fostering Board Relationships: Any astute new CEO will want to get to know his/h board well, and board members should expect a strong leader to assertively develop these interpersonal relationships. One suggestion is for the new CEO to meet individually with board members at their place of employment or another convenient location.
• Cultivating Community or Industry Associations: The board chair needs to assume leadership in helping the new CEO to develop contacts and relationships with community leaders, industry leaders and/or other stakeholders, such as key vendors. The board chair and CEO need to jointly develop a "game plan" to achieve the objectives involved.
• Understanding The Customers, Clientele, Membership and Stakeholders: Through informal meetings, presentations or reviews of pertinent issues, the board should strive to give the new CEO an understanding of how the products or services offered are perceived by various stakeholder groups. The CEO needs to try to verify the information with visits with stakeholders. If a significant gap(s) is noted, the CEO has an obligation to review it with the board to determine if the strategic plan in place is sound or needs modification.
• Discussing The New CEO's Career Expectations: As part of the hiring process, the board should have an understanding of that individual's career expectations and aspirations to be certain that these are compatible with the position being offered. The board and the new CEO must agree on a plan for his/h career development and growth, and the board should specify what it is willing to do to help the CEO with the plan.
• Succession Planning: Two plans are needed. One -- to cover a situation where the CEO is incapacitated for a period -- should be organized quickly. The other, long-term succession planning, a more difficult discussion, needs to take place every few years for the CEO and his/h direct reports.
Numerous benefits accrue to having a board-directed orientation program for a new CEO. The most important is the smooth transition that the program promotes. As a result of these efforts, power, authority, leadership and accountability are clearly understood and accepted by both the board and its new CEO. Misunderstandings and conflicts can be avoided.

Wal-Mart dives deeper into health-care marketBy Sarah Halzack October 6 Follow @sarahhalzack
Wal-Mart announced Monday that it will dive deeper into the health-care market, unveiling an initiative to allow customers to compare and enroll in health insurance plans in thousands of its stores.
Wal-Mart is teaming with DirectHealth.com, an online insurance comparison site and independent health insurance agency, to set up counters in its stores where consumers can talk to licensed agents about plan options.
“Our goal is to be the number one health-care provider in the industry,” said Labeed Diab, president of health and wellness for Wal-Mart U.S. “And the more we broaden our assortment, the more we broaden our offering, the more we educate the customer Wal-Mart is a great place to create a one-stop shop.”
Over the past several years, Wal-Mart has moved to expand its reach beyond retail into the health-care sector, where Americans are spending an increasingly larger share of their dollars. Earlier this year, the Bentonville, Ark.-based company began opening primary-care centers at several of its locations. Hundreds of its stores include acute-care clinics that offer a basic menu of services, including flu shots and blood-pressure screenings. Wal-Mart made waves about eight years ago when it announced it would offer generic versions of some prescription drugs for just $4 .
Some Wal-Mart competitors are by some measures outdoing the big-box retailer with their forays into health care : CVS, for example, has more than 800 retail clinics, according to consulting firm Merchant Medicine. Walgreens has about 400 of them, while Wal-Mart has about 100.
Wal-Mart first began hosting agents from individual insurers in its stores in 2005. The newly announced offering expands on that, with the agents able to guide customers through thousands of plans from hundreds of carriers. Direct­Health.com agents will receive a commission if they enroll an in-store customer in a health plan.
Diab said Wal-Mart hopes this one-on-one service will become a gateway for customers to come to their stores for all of their health-care needs.
“You’re educating the consumer on a very, very complex part of the [health-care] space,” Diab said. “And when you do that, they want you to take care of their prescription needs, their over-the-counter needs, their optical needs, the clinics.”
The program, known as Healthcare Begins Here, kicks off Oct. 10 and will run in stores through Dec. 7, closely tracking with the Medicare open-enrollment period and partially overlapping with the open enrollment period for federal health insurance exchanges. The company said it will monitor the success of the program and potentially bring it back next year.
Wal-Mart will initially offer the program at 2,700 of its 4,311 U.S. stores. Marcus Osborne, Walmart’s vice president of health and wellness payer relations, said the company selected locations based on customer interest and demand.
“We know where Medicare-eligible customers live today, and where there’s need for that, and where there are larger numbers of potential customers who could avail themselves of the public exchange,” Osborne said.
Wal-Mart’s expansion of its health and wellness offerings comes as the company is facing flat comparable store sales and slower foot traffic in its U.S. stores. Price-conscious consumers have been slow to open their wallets, even though the economy is showing steady signs of improvement. Meanwhile, the company is investing heavily in ramping up its e-commerce operation and in building new stores, including in its small-format Neighborhood Markets concept, which it hopes will help create greater opportunities to boost sales.

Small city routes to boost domestic aviationDomestic airlines to get boost from small city routes
Tommy Wilkes     New Delhi   Last Updated: October 6, 2014  | 10:40 IST
IndiGo Airlines seeks to cash in on a surge in demand for air travel from smaller regions(Photo: Reuters)
The airport in Patna, one of the country's smaller cities and the capital of its poorest state Bihar, is so crowded that government authorities this year said they need to build another one.
The airport has seen the number of passengers, and daily flights, double in the last four years as IndiGo Airlines , the largest carrier in the country, and smaller rivals like GoAir seek to cash in on a surge in demand for air travel from smaller regions to offset losses on highly competitive "trunk" routes linking big cities.
"We are close to capacity in our arrivals and departure lounges," said Santosh Kumar, who runs operations at Patna airport. "We can handle more planes but it is only possible with a bigger terminal. We need a bigger airport."
Higher disposable incomes, an expanding middle class and rapid urbanisation have made the country one of the world's fastest growing domestic aviation markets, where passenger numbers are expected to grow by more than 75 per cent in the next six years to exceed 217 million.
Much of that growth is expected to come from smaller cities like Patna, where more people are flying for the first time. Passenger numbers from these places have risen nearly 17 per cent a year since 2009, compared to 7.6 per cent from larger hubs, data from industry analyst CAPA - Centre for Aviation show.
That trend is set to continue as more airports are built in smaller cities. The new government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has picked five smaller cities this month to kick off a nationwide initiative to build about 50 new airports.
"The opportunity is changing," said Aditya Ghosh, president of IndiGo, which now flies larger Airbus A320 planes to and from Patna instead of smaller ATR jets. "On some of these smaller routes, the planes are more full than the trunk routes."
GoAir, which is the fifth largest carrier in the country, has also boosted flights to and from Patna and other smaller cities, Chief Executive Giorgio de Roni said, as these regional routes now make more money than the more congested routes between Mumbai and Delhi.
Flag carrier Air India 's regional unit is also looking at increasing its fleet to tap a larger share of this market, industry officials said. Air India did not respond to requests for comment.
While more established carriers see regional travel as a way to counter the razor-thin margins and losses on big city routes, a crop of new airlines are catering only to regional demand.
Zav Airways plans to start flying within the northeast in 2015, when Air Carnival also aims to fly within the south, according to CAPA.
Air Costa began flying within the southern parts of the country last October and in 2014, it agreed to buy 50 jets from Embraer SA in the biggest aircraft deal for a domestic regional carrier so far this year.
Chief Financial Officer Vivek Choudhary said Air Costa was bracing for competition. "But we are capitalising on the first-mover advantage," he added.
For now, demand for regional travel outstrips supply, making the sector attractive for airlines. Air travel penetration in India remains small in global terms, with 0.04 annual trips per capita against 0.3 in China and more than two in the United States.
Industry analysts, however, warn that as more carriers pile into the sector, fares will fall and airlines will face the same pressure on yields as they do now on big city routes.
"There is huge latent demand in some of these smaller cities," said Dhiraj Mathur, an executive director at PwC India who focuses on aerospace and defence. "But there's always a danger from increased competition."

Q&A With Arianna Huffington About Thriving During Expectation Hangoversreddit
In 2006 I had the pleasure of being introduced to Arianna Huffington.  It was such an honor to begin blogging on the site during the beginning years and also get to know Arianna. She has continued to be someone I deeply respect personally and professionally.  Since she has been a role model to me for nearly a decade, I wanted to get her advice on how to deal with what I call " Expectation Hangovers ."
In my own life and my work with others, I have seen that our greatest suffering comes from when our reality does not match our expectations.  However, disappointment can also be a catalyst for profound and positive change.  As someone who has thrived through many unexpected events in life, I knew Arianna would have incredible insight on the topic of overcoming disappointment. I trust you will be as inspired and comforted by her words as I have been.
CH: You are a woman who many would say "has it all": success, health, family, abundance, power, beauty, prestige, and so on.  Do these blessings also come with expectations? From others? From yourself?
AH: Yes, especially from myself. Over time I've gotten much better at silencing the harsh inner voice I call the obnoxious roommate living in my head. This voice feeds on putting us down and strengthening our insecurities and doubts. Educating our obnoxious roommate requires redefining success and what it means to live a life that matters, which will be different for each of us, according to our own values and goals (and not those imposed upon us by society). Humor helps in dealing with that constant inner critic. "Angels fly because they take themselves lightly," my mother used to tell my sister and me, quoting G. K. Chesterton.
CH: How do you navigate and manage expectations?
AH: I breathe! The connection that conscious breathing gives me is something I can return to hundreds of times during the day in an instant. A conscious focus on breathing helps me introduce pauses into my daily life, brings me back into the moment, and helps me transcend upsets and setbacks.
CH: Would you please describe an Expectation Hangover you have had that was particularly challenging?
AH: Unreal, and very unhealthy, expectations were major factors in my painful wakeup call.  On the morning of April 6, 2007, I was lying on the floor of my home office in a pool of blood. On my way down, my head had hit the corner of my desk, cutting my eye and breaking my cheekbone. I had collapsed from exhaustion and lack of sleep. In the wake of my collapse, I found myself going from doctor to doctor, from brain MRI to CAT scan to echocardiogram, to find out if there was any underlying medical problem beyond exhaustion. There wasn't, but doctors' waiting rooms, it turns out, were good places for me to ask myself a lot of questions about the kind of life I was living and the unrealistic expectations I had for myself.
CH: Was there a turning point or pivotal moment during your Expectation Hangover that began to transform your experience with disappointment?
AH: After my wakeup call, I looked back on my life and saw other times when I should have woken up but didn't. This time I really did and made many changes in the way I live my life, including adopting daily practices to keep me on track -- and out of doctors' waiting rooms. The result is a more fulfilling life, one that gives me breathing spaces and a deeper perspective.
CH: From your point of view, what is the purpose of disappointment? How does it serve us?
AH: Disappointment is a close cousin of failure, and I have failed many times in my life. I watched HuffPost come alive to mixed reviews, including some very negative ones, like the reviewer who called the site "the movie equivalent of Gigli, Ishtar, and Heaven's Gate."
But my mother used to tell me, "failure is not the opposite of success, it's a stepping stone to success." So at some point, I learned not to dread failure. I strongly believe that we are not put on this earth just to accumulate victories and trophies and avoid failures; but rather to be whittled and sandpapered down until what's left is who we truly are.
This book is such a refreshing reminder of a timeless truth: that we all have within us the ability to meet life's challenges, be empowered through adversity, and move from struggle to grace.
CH: In your book Thrive , you discuss how the pursuit of success and money is not the formula for happiness and peace.  Many people may get this on a mental level; however, still have difficulty letting go of the expectations they have to be successful and rich. What advice do you have for highly driven people who are attached to external success?
AH: Our current notion of success, in which we drive ourselves into the ground, if not the grave -- in which working to the point of exhaustion and burnout is considered a badge of honor -- is not working for anyone. This doesn't mean that we have to give up striving for success, but we need to free ourselves from the collective delusion that burning out is the necessary price for accomplishment and success. Recent scientific findings make it clear that this couldn't be less true. Not only is there no tradeoff between living a well-rounded life and high performance, performance is actually improved when our lives include time for renewal, wisdom, wonder and giving.
CH: How do you balance having a big vision for impacting the world with letting go of expectations? How do you balance all your responsibilities without losing yourself?
AH: I'll share an example of a decision I made that allowed me to let go of some of my own expectations. I did a major "life audit" when I turned forty, and I realized how many projects I had committed to in my head -- such as learning German and becoming a good skier and learning to cook. Most remained unfinished, and many were not even started. Yet these countless incomplete projects drained my energy and diffused my attention. As soon as the file was opened, each one took a little bit of me away. It was very liberating to realize that I could "complete" a project by simply dropping it -- by eliminating it from my to-do list. Why carry around this unnecessary baggage? That's how I completed learning German and becoming a good skier and learning to cook and a host of other projects that now no longer have a claim on my attention.
CH: One of topics you discuss in Thrive, which I love, is the importance of intuition and connecting to our inner wisdom. What is one step we can take to begin fostering this connection?
AH: Introduce five minutes of meditation into your day. Eventually, you can build up to fifteen or twenty minutes a day (or more), but even just a few minutes will open the door to creating a new habit -- and all the many proven benefits it brings.
Steve Jobs, a lifelong practitioner of meditation, affirmed the connection between meditation and creativity: "If you just sit and observe, you will see how restless your mind is. If you try to calm it, it only makes it worse, but over time it does calm, and when it does, there's room to hear more subtle things -- that's when your intuition starts to blossom and you start to see things more clearly and be in the present more. Your mind just slows down, and you see a tremendous expanse in the moment. You see so much more than you could see before."
CH: Finally, what have been your biggest lessons and blessings from your Expectation Hangovers?
AH: The biggest lesson is that living in a state of gratitude is the gateway to grace. Gratitude has always been for me one of the most powerful emotions. Grace and gratitude have the same Latin root, gratus. Whenever we find ourselves in a stop-the-world-I-want-to-get-off mindset, we can remember that there is another way and open ourselves to grace. And it often starts with taking a moment to be grateful for this day, for being alive, for anything.

E-commerce: A training ground for new entrep...Amazon
(The online marketplaces…)
NEW DELHI: When Pooja Parikh finished college, she knew she did not want a 9-5 job. The 25-year-old's dream was to start a business of her own.
"The idea of starting a jewellery retail business has been on my mind when I was very young. Since I had no previous entrepreneurial experience there were a lot of doubts in my mind," said Parikh, whose father is into the business of selling jewellery wholesale.
In order to avoid too much risk and gain some hands-on experience, she started her entrepreneurial journey by selling jewellery on online marketplaces Flipkart and Snapdeal. The initiative paid off so well that within months Parikh had the confidence to kick-off her own ecommerce venture, Azira Jewels.
"The response that I received on these online marketplaces was so good that I got the courage to start off on my own in such a short time," said Parikh.
It was not just the morale boost that led Parikh to start off on her own. She also got an insight into the online jewellery market and an idea about consumer behaviour online. "I learnt about concepts like in Google analytics and search engine optimisation. If you put up more designs and products, you probably figure on the top of the list on their website and get more hits," she said.
The big online marketplaces - Flipkart, Amazon and Snapdeal - have turned several like Parikh to entrepreneurs. While selling on these sites, they also acquired the skill and confidence to turn into full-time entrepreneurs.
For Neha Shah, founder of Enah.in (Neha in jumbled form), ecommerce was an obvious choice. "Choice of venturing into fashion segment of ecommerce was kind of obvious, as I had academic knowledge of both the professions," said the 29-year-old who is a telecom engineer from Mumbai University and has a masters in fashion design from NIFT, Delhi.
Her company started by selling women's apparels on Flipkart, Fashionara , Snapdeal and Myntra . When Amazon entered India, Enah was one the first apparel brands to be selling on it, claims the founder.
"There are several advantages of being present on other portals. Since these large enterprises have the financial muscles for marketing, newly established brands like Enah can certainly leverage from the enormous visibility created by being live on other sites. It not only helps in brand-building but also assures regular sales that keeps the cash flows in rotation," Shah added.
Today, 90% of Enah's revenue is generated from sales on other sites, but the profit margin with sales on its own site is much greater as the company does not have to pay commissions to anyone.
Ecommerce giants also organise training programmes for merchants on regular intervals, covering stuff as basic as what kind of pictures to be put on the site and how to put them up.
At times, like the ongoing festive season, there are training programmes which educate vendors about promotional events and how to make the best use of them. These help small entrepreneurs learn about marketing, selling, consumer behaviour and the overall online business, preparing them for the road ahead.
Enah now gets traffic from all parts of the country and, interestingly, has significant sales from small cities and towns. "We are glad to offer great designs at affordable pricing to India's booming fashion and value conscious markets. We take great care in designing each and every style of ours such that it creates a great fit and look on its wearer," Shah added.
Chintan Joshi, who has been a retailer of astrology-related products in Odisha, is a second-generation entrepreneur who took his father's business online. "The number of customers increases when you are selling in a market place," he said. While the offline mode had kept his reach limited to the local areas. He also owns an ecommerce site now.
The online marketplaces have not just encouraged entrepreneurs start off on their own but also helped existing entrepreneurs become better at their work.
Jagrati Shringi, founder of Voylla, has an ecommerce venture for selling jewellery and accessories since 2012. When Flipkart became big and Amazon entered into the Indian market, her company decided to align with them too.
"Such associations help in increasing profit and brand value," she said. "We already had the expertise of curating and collecting products and, with the online marketplace , we got the advantage of infrastructure."

Here comes the sun  Bryce HarperBy Adam Kilgore October 6 Follow @adamkilgorewp
The sun at AT&T Park could bother the Nats’ outfielders — from left, Bryce Harper, Denard Span and Jayson Werth. It could be particularly hard on Harper. (Getty Images)
During the Nationals’ workout Sunday afternoon, just before 3 p.m. on the West Coast, the sun loomed over the AT&T Park upper-deck seats along the first base line and beat down on left field. The Nationals and Giants did not yet know when first pitch would come Monday. The television schedule determined they would play at noon (San Francisco time) if the Angels won Game 3 of the ALDS and at 2 p.m. if the Royals ended the series.
Nationals reserve outfielder Nate Schierholtz, who played several seasons with the Giants, stood by the railing of the first base dugout and surveyed the sun. He said that if the game started at noon, the sun in left field would only come into play in the late innings, if at all. If it started at 2 p.m., then watch out, because by the third inning it could wreak havoc on left fielders.
Since the Royals won, Game 3 will begin at 2 p.m. And the sun could have a significant effect, starting around the third inning or so, as the sun shifts to its position over the first base line. Nationals starter Doug Fister relies on groundballs, and that may be an advantage. Defenses and pitchers will want to keep the ball out of left field.
The time of day may also impact hitters. Schierholtz was a member of the 2010 World Series champion Giants. During their run, they kept getting scheduled to play games in the mid-afternoon. The hitters all hated playing so many of those games, he said, because shadows creep across the infield, between the mound and the plate, making it impossible to recognize the spin of the ball coming out of the pitcher’s hands.
It’s a bright, sunny morning here in San Francisco. Later in the day, the sun may have an effect on the NLDS.
>>> If the Nationals had scored a run in the 15th, 16th or 17th inning Saturday night, Craig Stammen would have never needed to buy a drink in Washington for the rest of his life. He came out of the bullpen and fired three scoreless innings from the 13th to the 15th, mowing through the entire Giants lineup in 35 pitches.
Stammen had also thrown 15 pitches in Game. Despite throwing 50 pitches in two days Stammen played catch during the Nationals’ workout Sunday and will be available for Game 3.
“I think he’ll be fine to go,” pitching coach Steve McCatty said. “He’s one of these guys that has a rubber arm. The more you use him probably, the better his sink is. He’s resilient. It’s been amazing. They’ve all pitched, the last few days, extremely well.”
>>> Sunday afternoon, Manager Matt Williams listed the attributes of Giants left-hander Madison Bumgarner. “And,” Williams said, starting to smile, “he can rake.”
Bumgarner hit .258/.286/.470 with four home runs, including two grand slams. He posted a 113 OPS+, which would have tied him with Denard Span and ranked him just ahead of Christian Yelich, Matt Carpenter and Daniel Murphy. The Nationals know they need to treat Bumgarner, a right-handed hitter, with care.
“I watched him take BP,” McCatty said. “It’s fairly impressive. You’re not taking him lightly. Like Randy Knorr always says: A swinging bat is a dangerous bat. He’s an interesting guy when he swings, that’s for sure. He’s a big dude. He’s a strong dude.”

This claim was a pretty mealy apple when the Court first dismissed it  and it has not aged well with further discovery.By Eugene Volokh October 6 Follow @volokhc
A funny turn of phrase from Judge Nancy Torresen in Pan Am Systems Inc. v. Hardenbergh, 2014 WL 4908949:
The Amended Complaint alleges that Plaintiffs defamed them by publishing the March 21, 2011 article about Fink’s departure from Pan Am. In its Order of May 14, 2012, dismissing the original complaint, which contained most of the above quotation, the Court noted “[o]ne can infer from this quote that Mr. Fink’s removal was not his choice” and that “[t]he hyperbolic term ‘coup de grace’ carries with it a sense that Mr. Fink was fired.” The Court nonetheless held that the statement was not capable of conveying a defamatory meaning as a matter of law:
Maine law provides that a statement that an individual is fired, without providing defamatory reasons for the firing, is not defamatory. “An employee may be discharged for any one of a multitude of reasons unrelated to his honesty, integrity or occupational skill, or indeed for no reason at all…. [I]t is the reason for discharge rather than the discharge alone which can render the statement slanderous per se.” .Picard v. Brennan, 307 A.2d 833, 835 (Me. 1973). Since the statement provides no reason for Mr. Fink’s removal from Pan Am, it does not bear a defamatory meaning under Maine law.
The Plaintiffs nonetheless reasserted this claim in their Amended Complaint under the apparent theory that the following two sentences, which were not included in their original Complaint, cast it in a different light:
If Fink pere has definitely left, then perhaps, as one source said, ‘The holy wars, such as those against Peter Leisham, will cease.’ Others thought that young Fink might have more freedom either to spend more money on railroading, or put the existing money into different [and one would hope more productive] places.
The Plaintiffs continue to press the claim in the face of the Defendants’ motion for summary judgment. They contend that Picard v. Brennan does not apply, because, read in context, the article claims that Fink was removed for specific reasons — because he was a bad manager who misused company resources.
This claim was a pretty mealy apple when the Court first dismissed it, and it has not aged well with further discovery. Only by torturing the full text of the article beyond recognition can it be read to assert that Fink was removed for any particular reason that could give rise to defamation liability. The Plaintiffs are therefore entitled to summary judgment as to this claim as well.

Want to avoid Argentine-style debt stand-offs Buy Kazakhstans new bondsFuture of Finance
October 6, 2014
Kazakhstan is selling government bonds for the first time in 14 years , and they are the first to include new clauses meant to avoid long, expensive battles over a debt restructuring like the one that has haunted Argentina since it defaulted on $93 billion of its debt in 2001.
A quick recap: Most of Argentina’s creditors agreed to exchange their bonds for new ones worth far less—but some investors acquired Argentina’s old debt at a deep discount and refused to negotiate. Instead, they used something called a pari passu clause, which states that all bondholders must be treated equally, to convince a New York judge to rule  they deserve the full repayment .
After US courts sided with the hold-outs, Argentina refused to pay them, and has technically defaulted for second time in 13 years —and the fight is still rolling on.
To prevent another messy decade of litigation happening because of a small minority of investors in the event of a future restructuring, the International Capital Market Association this summer created a new set of voluntary alterations to future sovereign debt contracts, including a narrower definition of pari passu and reformed Collective Action Clauses that are legally binding on all holders of the bond, including those who vote against a restructuring.
The IMF’s endorsement of these rules  (paywall) this week has cleared the way for them to become the global standard.
“The potential adverse fallout globally from the default and restructuring of Argentina’s debt demonstrates the importance of having clear, unambiguous contract terms for sovereign bonds,” the ICMA’s lawyer said at the time.
Kazakhstan is the first to have adopted all of the ICMA’s recommendations into its bonds. “It is extraordinary that it is Kazakhstan,” Mitu Gulati, a law professor at Duke University, told the Financial Times . “But I think it’s a little early to do victory laps. The question is still when will a large issuer like Mexico make the changes and what will happen then?”

Go online to see your chances of getting a confirmed train ticketUpdated: October 7, 2014 01:29 IST
More informed online options for railway passengers
Renuka Phadnis
railway
If you’re travelling by train and worried that your ticket is not yet confirmed, there are several websites and mobile applications that can check your chances of getting a confirmed ticket, besides offering other railway-related services.
Last month, Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd. (IRCTC) launched the ‘IRCTC BlackBerry 10 App’, a free application that provides booking facility of tickets on phone and other services such as checking reservation status, PNR status, train schedules, routes, availability of tickets, cancellation and booking history.
Passengers’ reviews range from superlatives to scathing criticism. Some grouses are that the phone hangs, the payment page gets “stuck”, a “try again later” message appears frequently and the page times out quickly.
The “good app with lots of flaws” does not allow anyone to log in between 8 a.m. and noon.
There are two more apps (neither is officially connected with Indian Railways) providing train-related services.
Benefits
Website www.trainman.in tells a passenger whether to book a waiting ticket or not.
It also allows passengers to compare waiting tickets of various trains and the chance of confirmation of a booked ticket.
It uses three colours to indicate the probability of getting a confirmed ticket. Green indicates that the ticket will get confirmed or will be RAC; yellow is the “unreliable” zone where it is difficult to predict the ticket’s final status, and red means the ticket will not get confirmed.
Mohammed Amir, its founder, said the website has an average rate of prediction accuracy of about 82 per cent, obtained by testing three lakh actual PNRs. However, he said, there never are guarantees with any prediction. They can always turn out to be false. “That is why we have prediction chances as percentages, which gives the user an estimate of how sure we are while predicting his confirmation.”
Another website www.confirmtkt.com says it can help passengers with: predicting their ticket confirmation chances if they have a waitlist ticket, subscribing for PNR confirmation notifications, searching trains between source and destination, comparing all ticket confirmation chances for trains on a single screen, and deciding on travel options.
Via email
If a passenger’s ticket is on the waiting list or RAC and needs to be notified when the ticket gets confirmed, the passenger will get an email notification.

Govt warns Pak over ceasefire violations  says Indian armed forces  fully readyComments
Defence minister Arun Jaitley on Monday deplored the ceasefire violations by Pakistan and said the Indian armed forces were "fully ready" and are responding to each of these provocations from across the border.

He told Pakistan that it should realise that the kind of environment it was generating between the two countries was certainly not going to help in normalising relations.
Reacting to the continuous ceasefire violations, the minister said Pakistan has been trying to create tension in both the international border and Line of Control (LoC).
"This is resulting in a series of ceasefire violations as a result of which innocent civilians have lost their lives.
Pakistan must realise that the kind of environment it is generating between the two countries is certainly not going to help in normalising relations.  The onus of creating a positive environment is on Pakistan which is utterly failing to do so.
"Let everybody be assured that our armed forces and para-military forces are fully ready and they are responding to each of these provacations from Pakistan," Jaitley said.
Condemning the shelling, union home minsiter Rajnath Singh said “Pakistan should stop ceasefire violations now and should realise that the situation in India has changed”.
Read: Five dead, 29 wounded in Pak shelling on border
Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah said the targeting of civilian areas exposed the frustration of the Pakistani government after its failure to gain international attention on the Kashmir issue.
"They (the Pakistani leadership) have nothing else to speak, but only Kashmir. Whenever they go abroad, they try to raise only Kashmir issue, but every time they miserably fail to get international attention. The cross-border shelling is an indication of their frustration," he told reporters after meeting civilians injured in the shelling at the Government Medical College Hospital in Jammu.
Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said the government has given instructions to the army to reply to the ceasefire violations.
"The Army has been instructed to reply to the ceasefire violations and it is acting on the issue," Prasad told reporters.
Condemning Pakistan's actions, former external affairs minister Salman Khurshid said it is despicable that such incidents have occurred on Eid. "There cannot be anything worse than this," the Congress leader said.
Five civilians were killed and 29 wounded in firing by Pakistani forces along a stretch of the border in Jammu district on Monday, the heaviest firing between the two countries since India called off bilateral talks last month.
The latest firing is the eleventh time Pakistani troops have violated the ceasefire since October 1, a Border Security Forces (BSF) official said. This is probably the highest number of civilian deaths in a single day in shelling. Even when firing was at its highest between July and August, two people died in the 45 days shells rained down on the border.

Lab-grown penises are on the horizon  scientists sayBy Rachel Feltman October 6 Follow @rachelfeltman
As part of a project to engineer experimental erectile tissue in a lab, research fellow Hyunhee Ahn, PhD,  injects a scaffold with cells. (Wake Forest)
Men who need penile reconstruction could soon be given organs grown from their own cells in the lab, according to a team of scientists at the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine.
The research is led by Anthony Atala , director of the institute. Atala is no newbie to the lab-grown organ scene: In 2011, he gave a popular TED talk on his experiments with 3D printed kidneys. And earlier this year, he and his team announced that they'd successfully implanted lab-grown vaginas in four patients.
Now they're ready to try a similar surgery for men with damaged or missing sex organs. But how does one grow a penis? Atala starts with a donor organ, then washes it in detergent to get rid of any cells that might be rejected by the new host. After a few weeks, his team is left with a sort of "scaffold" of the original organ.
Meanwhile, cells from whatever remains of the host's original penis are cultivated in the lab, giving the team a nice supply of the different types of cells required. Once the scaffold is ready, it's seeded with these cultivated cells. Current reconstruction techniques are rudimentary in comparison — with doctors covering prosthetic implants with skin from the patient's arm or thigh.
So far, Atala and his team have had great success using the technique in rabbits, the Guardian reports , and they hope to be undergoing human trials in five years.
Unfortunately, the technique won't be suitable for female-to-male sex transition surgery. It relies heavily on the use of cells specific to the penis, Atala told the Guardian , so the host needs to have some for doctors to work with. And it's not clear yet — and probably won't be, until human trials are underway — just how functional these lab-grown organs will be.

NPR shuffles management as top content officer leaves

NPR named cable TV industry veteran Jarl Mohn as new CEO

NPR's new CEO is shuffling the management team, appointing a new deputy to  oversee daily operations and changing the direction of content strategy.
Jarl Mohn, a cable TV industry veteran who assumed the top job in July, promoted Loren Mayor, NPR's senior vice president of strategy, to be the company's chief operating officer.
Kinsey Wilson, NPR's chief content officer who was seen as the executive spearheading NPR's digital efforts, will leave at the end of the week. NPR media reporter David Folkenflik first reported about the changes on Twitter. Wilson previously worked for USA TODAY.
"Loren will manage the daily operations across the organization, enabling me to focus on areas that most immediately impact content, station relations, philanthropy and corporate underwriting, and audience development," Mohn said in a note to the staff.
Mohn joined NPR after Gary Knell left in August, 2013 to become CEO of the National Geographic Society. Paul Haaga took the job last fall on an interim basis, prior to Mohn's start.
NPR's CEO has a difficult task of balancing the interests of NPR's national expansion initiatives and of member stations that pay for programming. NPR's board members are elected by the local stations that are often skeptical of new proposals -- many of them in digital areas -- that may allow listeners to bypass their radio channels.
"Wilson's initiatives were source of anxieties for member stations; his departure underscores prickly relationship between NPR & stations," Folkenflik tweeted Monday.
Mohn said he'll be involved in strategic decisions across the organization, but Mayor will oversee strategy, digital media, member partnership and other areas of operations.
Mohn will name a new chief of news in a senior vice president role who will report directly to Mohn. Chris Turpin will remain as acting head of news during the search.
"Our priority is to continue the quality and reach of our news programming across all platforms, especially for Morning Edition and All Things Considered," Mohn said. "I will continue the practice of not being involved in day-to-day editorial decision-making and will have the same 'publisher' relationship with the SVP of News that exists at other media organizations."
Several executives who reported to Wilson will have new bosses.
Anya Grundmann, director and executive producer of NPR Music, will report to the new head of news.
Reporting to Mayor will be Sarah Lumbard, vice president of content strategy and operations, Zach Brand, vice president of digital media, and Bob Kempf, vice president of digital services.
Eric Nuzum, vice president of programming, will report to Chief Marketing Officer Emma Carrasco.
Wilson's position -- he was also an executive vice president -- will not be replaced. But Mohn acknowledged Wilson's role in growing NPR's scope of news coverage.
"Under his leadership, NPR's news and cultural coverage has flourished and been recognized with numerous broadcast and digital journalism awards," Mohn said. "Kinsey also spearheaded efforts to adapt NPR's programming to changing audience demands and to extend the organization's influence and reach."

Will take whatever retaliatory action needed on ceasefire violations: BSF5
0
Jammu: Saying that it did not expect Pakistan to carry out such an intensified shelling and firing in Jammu on the day of Eid on Monday, BSF has assured that the force will take whatever retaliatory action it has to. "Whatever retaliatory action BSF has to take, will be undertaken," Director General of BSF DK Pathak said.
"Our force is a professional force and we will respond very professionally to the Pak firing," he said. Pathak flew to Jammu from New Delhi and rushed to RS Pura border belt to chair a meeting of top officers of the Jammu Frontier to review the situation emerging in view of shelling and firing in the Arnia belt.
"The incident is not a good incident. There has been casualties, but we have responded to it," he said. "We were not expecting that they will resort to such an intensified shelling and firing on Eid," Pathak added.
"Our force is a professional force and we will respond very professionally to the Pak firing," Director General of BSF DK Pathak said.

"Every ceasefire violation has been engineered by them and we are not responsible for any ceasefire violation," he said.
In one of the worst ceasefire violations by Pakistan, five villagers were killed and 34 injured on Monday in heavy mortar shelling and firing from across the international border and Line of Control in Jammu and Poonch sectors.

Vadra land deal jibe: Modi betraying ignorance  says Congress7
0
New Delhi: After Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday raked up the issue of Robert Vadra's land deals on the election campaign trail in Haryana, Congress hit back at him claiming that he was betraying his "ignorance" of the matter.
"He (Modi) is the Prime Minister. He should not be so ignorant or else his people will mislead him," Congress general secretary Shakeel Ahmed said here.
He was reacting to Modi's remarks asking the Election Commission to take serious note of a report that the Congress government in Haryana has given clearance to a land deal between party chief Sonia Gandhi's son-in-law Vadra and DLF ahead of Assembly polls in the state.
"He (Modi) is the Prime Minister. He should not be so ignorant or else his people will mislead him," Congress general secretary Shakeel Ahmed said
#haryana assembly elections 2014 #haryana polls #narendra modi #robert vadra
Ahmed said that the news item which Modi was presumably referring to also suggests that the officers' team which overruled whistleblower IAS officer Ashok Khemka's report cancelling the particular mutation of the land involving Vadra's company had submitted its report on or before July 16,
when there was no model code of conduct in force.
"I do not know whether Modi is ignorant or doing it knowingly. How will EC take note of it when the model code came into force on September 12, when the election dates were announced," said Ahmed, the party's in-charge for Haryana affairs.
At an election rally in poll-bound Haryana today, Modi said, "They (Haryana government) know that after the elections, the son-in-law (Vadra) will not get any clearances for illegal deals. So, in between the election process, they have dared to take such a decision."
"I think Hooda was pressurised from the top (Congress leadership) to take such a decision... I hope EC will take appropriate action for any violation of the model code," Modi had said.
Ahmed, meanwhile, also alleged that the prime minister was giving erroneous figures about Haryana's position among developed states of the country.
"He is telling lies. It is unfortunate that the Prime Minister of the country is telling lies," he said.

It s very difficult out there right now
Leading Republicans press for limits on travel to prevent spread of EbolaTexas Governor Rick Perry (R). (REUTERS/Mike Stone)
Updated at 5:31 p.m.
Leading Republicans are racing to propose strict new limits on air travel to safeguard Americans against Ebola, the deadly virus that has reached the United States and left a Liberian man battling for his life in a Dallas hospital.
The latest to adopt that public position is Texas Gov. Rick Perry (R), a potential 2016 presidential candidate who is back in the national spotlight after doctors made the first Ebola diagnosis in the United States in his home state.
Unveiling a new state task force to combat infectious diseases on Monday morning, Perry called for federal officials to implement "enhanced screening procedures" at "all points of entry" to the United States and create "fully staffed quarantine stations" wherever people are entering the country.
"Washington needs to take immediate steps to minimize the dangers of Ebola and other infectious diseases," said the governor.
A pair of other Republicans called Monday for Obama to appoint a single adviser to coordinate the government's response to Ebola. Others have gone even further, calling for flight bans from West African countries and raising concerns about catastrophic scenarios. Republican strategists say it is all part of an effort to flex leadership credentials and tap into concerns Americans have with President Obama's readiness to handle crises after a series of missteps in his second term.
"Republicans are emphasizing the mishandling of the Ebola crisis by the Obama administration and tying it to the theme of government incompetence," said Republican strategist Ron Bonjean. "After a string of failures by the White House, the latest crisis over Ebola containment further underscores the need for new leadership."
Greg Mueller, a veteran of three GOP presidential campaigns, said he thinks recent lapses in security and safety have spurred Republicans to speak out about Ebola.
"We've got people walking though the front door of the White House, we've got child trafficking on the border, we've got [the Islamic State] beheading people and now you've got Ebola," he said.
After meeting with top advisers about Ebola at the White House Monday afternoon, President Obama said his administration will be "working on protocols to do additional passenger screening both at the source and here in the United States." The White House said it was not considering a travel ban.
Thomas Eric Duncan, who is fighting to survive in a Dallas hospital after being diagnosed with Ebola last week, flew from Liberia to Dallas last month. There are very few direct flights from West Africa to the united States, so Duncan changed planes in Brussels and at Dulles before arriving in Dallas -- news that has prompted concerns about air travel facilitating the spread of Ebola.
Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) and Rep. Frank Wolf (R-Va.) wrote Obama a letter Monday asking him to appoint a "single, senior advisor who will be responsible for coordinating all U.S. agencies and policies involving the international and domestic response to Ebola. They suggested Obama bring in former George W. Bush administration officials Colin Powell, Robert Gates and Mike Leavitt to "assist with this serious challenge."
Some possible Republican presidential hopefuls have focused their calls on tightening travel restrictions.
Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal (R) has called for a halt to flights from Ebola-stricken countries. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) has  penned a letter to the head of the Federal Aviation Administration with questions about what steps the agency was taking to prevent the spread of Ebola through air travel ahead of the busy holiday season. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) raised concerns in a recent radio interview  about the the possibility "a whole ship" of American soldiers could get Ebola.
The Republican calls for new measures to prevent the spread of Ebola came as a  Pew Research Center poll released Monday showed Republicans are more skeptical than Democrats about the federal government's ability to prevent an outbreak of Ebola.
"There's only so much that a state can do," said Perry.
The issue has also cropped up in several key midterm contests in states with some of the busiest international airports in the United States.
Thom Tillis, the Republican nominee for Senate in the crucial battleground state of North Carolina, last week called for U.S. officials to ban travel from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. In Michigan, Republican Senate nominee Terri Lynn Land has also called for a travel ban .
North Carolina is home to Charlotte Douglas International Airport, which saw more than 20 million passengers in 2012, according to the Department of Transportation. In Michigan, Detroit Metropolitan Airport saw nearly 16 million passengers that year.
At least one Democrat has mentioned Ebola in a campaign ad. Sen. Mark Pryor (D-Ark.) released a commercial in August attacking Rep. Tom Cotton (R) for cutting "billions from our nation's medical disaster and emergency programs."
Mark Berman contributed to this post.
Texas Gov. Rick Perry visited the Galveston National Laboratory on Tuesday. Perry said the work the lab was doing to develop treatments and vaccines for Ebola is the best way to control the spread of the virus. (AP)
Sean Sullivan has covered national politics for The Washington Post since 2012.

No  Americans arent freaking out about Ebola. Not even close.Ebola has made its way into the United States, and judging by the TV coverage, you would think people are (or should be) in full-scale panic mode.
They are not. Not even close.
A new poll from the Pew Research Center shows that just 11 percent of Americans are "very worried" about the Ebola virus infecting them or someone they know. An additional 21 percent are "somewhat" concerned. That leaves 67 percent who are either not at all concerned or "not too" concerned.
The last time a contagious disease threatened to spread in the United States was Avian influenza -- a.k.a. bird flu -- in 2005. A  Fox News poll  in October 2005 found that 30 percent were "very" concerned about its spread and 33 percent were somewhat concerned -- a total of 63 percent. (This question, though, did not ask whether people were concerned about their families being infected -- perhaps a higher bar.)
Similarly, a March  2006 poll from ABC News showed 66 percent of people were "concerned" about bird flu, including 26 percent who were "very concerned."
So it would seem there is considerably less concern about Ebola at this point.
Americans also say, 57 percent to 41 percent, that they have at least a "fair amount" of confidence in the federal government's ability to deal with the issue.
That's actually more faith than they had in the government's ability to deal with bird flu. Back then, 48 percent had faith, while 49 percent had little or none, according to Pew polling.
Concern about Ebola infecting you or someone close to you is significantly higher among blacks (47 percent "very" or "somewhat") and Hispanics (39 percent), as well as less-educated Americans (38 percent of people who never went to college). Just 22 percent of college graduates are at least "somewhat" concerned.

Eicher Motors up 9%, Macquarie sees 4-fold rise in earnings Macquarie maintains outperform rating on the stock and raised target price to Rs 13,650 from Rs 9,250 earlier as Eicher is on a growth trajectory with fast growing leisure bikes and commercial vehicle (CV) portfolio on the cusp of a cyclical recovery.
The brokerage raised Royal Enfield (RE) sales volumes estimate for CY15E to 4,35,000 from 4,25,000 and for CY16E to 5,50,000 from 5,25,000. RE sales volumes have tripled over the last three years and even now the company is adding more bookings every month than production. It expects a 45 percent CAGR in bike sales over the next three years driven by a long waitlist across models, production ramp-up post capacity expansion, dealer expansion in India (over 30 percent in CY14E) and export markets and new models launches. As per management, the new model Continental GT has been well received by the market and demand is strong. It sold 26,643 units of RE in August, up 66 percent compared to 16,062 units in same month last year while it reported a 81 percent growth in year-to-date sales (1,92,356 units). In case of its commercial vehicle (CV) business, Macquarie expects the CV industry to enter a growth phase in 2HCY14E led by a pick-up in replacement demand. "We expect Volvo-Eicher CV sales to register a 14 percent CAGR (CY13-16E) led by network expansion and increased product offerings," says the brokerage. Volvo-Eicher CV has launched the Pro range of trucks (GVW of 5T-49T) and Skyline Pro range of buses. The brokerage believes VECV is well placed to benefit from a CV demand revival. As far as its engine business is concerned, the company shipped 2,534 engine long-blocks to Volvo for deployment in Volvo%u2019s products in Europe in 2013 and increased production to 5,830 in 1HCY14. The company has capacity for 25,000 engines.
Even its JV with Polaris (to manufacture passenger vehicles) is also on track for start of production in 2015, says the brokerage. Cash generation from the RE business has supported overall cash in its balance sheet despite substantial investment (around Rs 1,800 crore since commencement) in setting up new capacity. At the end of June-14, the company had net cash of Rs 1,330 crore with cash and current investments forming 23 percent of overall assets. Macquarie feels Volvo-Eicher CV has a healthy balance sheet to support growth initiatives and investment in new products. The brokerage raised its CY14E earnings by 4 percent, CY15E by 10 percent and CY17E by 14 percent.
