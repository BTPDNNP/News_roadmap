The benchmark BSE Sensex fell over 82 points to 26,544.21 in early trade on Monday as funds and retail investors booked profits after gains in the previous session amid a mixed trend in the Asian region.
The 30-share barometer, which had gained 157.96 points in the previous session after S&P upgraded India’s outlook to stable from negative, moved down by 82.11 points, or 0.31 per cent, to 26,544.21, led by weakness in metal, PSU, capital goods, FMCG, auto and oil & gas sector stocks largely on profit-booking.
Also, the National Stock Exchange index Nifty fell by 29.75 points, or 0.37 per cent, to 7,939.10.
Brokers said apart from profit-booking by cautious participants ahead of the Reserve Bank of India’s monetary policy review on Tuesday, a mixed trend at other Asian markets influenced sentiments.
They said sustained selling by foreign funds on the domestic bourses too had its negative impact.
Among other Asian bourses, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng shed 1.18 per cent, while Japan’s Nikkei was trading 0.67 per cent higher in early trade.
The US Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 0.99 per cent higher in Friday’s trade.

Dr. Mayaram also said the government was confident of bringing down the Consumer Price Index close to 6 per cent.
The economy is moving towards a regime of lower interest rates and can see a growth rate of over 7 per cent in three years, Finance Secretary Arvind Mayaram said. “We are moving towards a regime where inflation should come down. Going forward, it must come down,” he said speaking at the anniversary programme of Madras Chamber of Commerce and Industry (MCCI) here on Monday.
However, Dr. Mayaram said he was not sure at what point the Reserve Bank of India would be comfortable, but said he was confident that interest rates should come down sooner than later due to the measures such as containing borrowings taken by the government.
The Reserve Bank of India will announce its monetary policy on Tuesday, and is expected to maintain its status quo on interest rates.
Once inflation came down, savings would go up and that would create liquidity for lending mainly to small and medium scale businesses, he added.
Dr. Mayaram also said the government was confident of bringing down the Consumer Price Index close to 6 per cent. On the economic growth front, Dr. Mayaram said the government was fully focussed on bringing the investment climate back.
“Our potential growth rate is about 8 per cent. It is going to take time, because lot of steps need to be taken to get there. In the next three years we should reach 7 per cent,” he added.

Indian Muslims will fail al-Qaeda: Modi“Terrorism in India isn’t home-grown” and Indian Muslims will “fail the al-Qaeda” because all “Indians live by a philosophy charted by Gandhi and Buddha,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi said at the prestigious Council on Foreign Relations here.
On working with the U.S. in Afghanistan, he called for a slow pullout.

Satya Nadella, chief executive officer of Microsoft, announced this on Tuesday, saying that Microsoft would enable the "burgeoning entrepreneurial experience of Indians".
In his maiden visit to India, after taking over as the CEO of Microsoft, Satya Nadella, on Tuesday, announced that the company would offer commercial cloud services — Azure and Office 365 — in the country from local data centres.
The company will set up three data centres in three cities that will be operational by the end of 2015.
“Last year, our cloud business in India grew over 100 per cent. Buoyed by that success we have now decided to offer cloud services from local data centres. So, this means we will have Azure, which is our cloud infrastructure service as well as our Office 365 service, which brings together all of our productivity and collaboration capability to the Indian market, operated out of Indian data centres,” he said.
Cloud computing services in India presented a $2 trillion market opportunity, he added.
“When you think about the cloud opportunity in India itself, it is going to be a $2 trillion opportunity. Just as in the case of mobile devices, India was able to leapfrog with the adoption of mobile devices. I believe that the cloud infrastructure, especially world-class cloud infrastructure, is going to help Indian companies, Indian Government and every Indian entrepreneur, to be able to really revitalise the productivity of this economy,” he added.
Asked about the investment into these centres, Mr. Nadella said, “I can’t give you a specific amount but as we get started you will see the scale. The initial footprint itself will be quite high.”
Microsoft India Chairman Bhaskar Pramanik said, “…the establishment of our services from local data centres, I think is the most logical move for us. It is a significant milestone in terms of the investment we have made in the country, for the citizens of India, for the businesses in India, for the small and medium enterprises, for the developer ecosystem.”

Cut longs post policy  | Top 15 rate-sensitive stocks that can return up to 49% in one yearbenchmark
(According to RBI, there…)
MUMBAI: The benchmark indices, which spiked up after the Reserve Bank of India's policy meet, pared most of the intraday gains. Banks, capital goods and metals are leading the fall.
The euphoria in the market was short-lived as reality of pause in interest rates dawned upon the participants.
The market had taken comfort from Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan's comments that CPI target of 6 per cent by January 2016 can be met even though there is significant upside risk to it.
According to the Governor, there are number of disinflationary factors underway such as lower crude prices and relatively stable rates are positive for inflation.
However there are some uncertainties on the evolvement of inflation. He said it needs to be seen how food inflation will evolve over time as headline inflation is buffeted by food inflation.
The Nifty has been facing supply pressure and finding it difficult to close past 8,000 mark. According to analysts, the chart formation looks bearish in the near term.
If the Nifty fails to close above 8,050 in the next few sessions then traders should be ready for a sharp correction. The Bank Nifty too is extremely weak and has been unable to rally. The downside here could be severe than the other indices.
"We are failing more and more to rally above 8,000. It is becoming clear that the 50-day moving average is possibly not providing the kind of support it was providing earlier. This time we need to go below the 50-day moving average and then find better support," said Ashwani Gujral, Fund Manager, ashwanigujral.com.
"People should assume some short positions. This is a good day to cut down on longs. 8000 is of becoming a stoploss to have for short positions and possibly the market needs to correct more before we can get a sustainable move," he added.
With the RBI policy out of the way, the market is set to react to global cues for direction.
A strong US dollar and unrest in Hong Kong is expected to keep global markets jittery. Indian markets will have an extended weekend due to host of festive holidays and traders would want to keep their positions light incase there is some political or financial surprise.
According to Mitesh Thacker, Technical Analyst, miteshthacker.com, the index heavyweights, which have done extremely well in the last few months, are possibly giving signals of some kind of marginal momentum breakdown.
He expects the Nifty to correct down to 7,850-7,820 unless the Nifty starts closing past 8,000-8,010 on closing basis.

EU says Ireland grants Apple illegal tax benefitsUpdated: September 30, 2014 17:48 IST
EU says Ireland grants Apple illegal tax benefits

economy, business and finance
Apple Inc. funnels the bulk of its international sales through subsidiaries in Ireland, where it benefits from low, negotiated tax deals.
Ireland appears to be granting Apple illegal tax rebates that may have to be recouped, the European Union’s competition watchdog said Tuesday as it pressed on with an inquiry into the iPhone maker’s overseas tax practices.
If the EU’s preliminary finding is confirmed over the coming months, Apple Inc. could face a repayment bill worth billions of dollars because it funnels the bulk of its international sales through subsidiaries in Ireland, where it benefits from low, negotiated tax deals.
In a letter to the Irish government published Tuesday, the 28—nation bloc’s executive Commission said the tax treatment granted to Apple “constitutes state aid” and therefore raises “doubts about the compatibility” with EU law.
EU rules forbid governments from helping individual companies to avoid undermining free market competition. The EU first announced the tax probe in June, also targeting coffee store chain Starbucks and others as part of a crackdown on multinationals exploiting tax loopholes.
The EU Commission is now requesting further documents from Ireland before making a legally binding decision on whether the rebate granted to Apple is illegal and must be recouped, wholly or partially.
The EU probe focuses on exaggerated transfer pricing, where one part of a company charges another part an inflated price for goods or services to shift profits to low—tax locations.
If Apple had to repay some taxes, the money would come as a windfall to Irish state coffers. However, fearful of losing its reputation as a business—friendly country with low corporate taxes, the Irish government is adamant that no EU rules have been breached.
The Commission said the tax deals Ireland struck with Apple in 1991 and in 2007 show “several inconsistencies” and may not comply with international taxation standards. The Brussels—based executive body also was critical of the fact that Apple’s applicable tax rate appears to have been the result of “a negotiation rather than a pricing methodology” which a “prudent, independent” tax authority should not have accepted.
Apple maintains it has not received a favorable treatment in Ireland.
“We’re subject to the same tax laws as the countless other companies who do business in Ireland,” the company said in an emailed statement. “Apple has received no selective treatment from Irish officials over the years.”
The company added that its tax payments to Ireland increased tenfold since it launched its first iPhone in 2007. In the statement, Apple also said that on a global level, “comprehensive corporate tax reform is badly needed.”
Apple’s tax practices have also attracted scrutiny in the United States, where a Senate Committee last year published a scathing report on the Cupertino—based firm’s tax schemes.
The report held up Apple as an example of legal tax avoidance made possible by the complicated U.S. tax code, estimating the firm avoided at least $3.5 billion in U.S. federal taxes in 2011 and $9 billion in 2012 by using its tax strategy.
Apple one the world’s most valuable and profitable firms sat on some $164 billion in cash and cash equivalents, with $138 billion stashed away in foreign subsidiaries, according to its latest quarterly report in June. The company estimated its effective U.S. tax rate is 26.1 percent, as opposed to the statutory U.S. rate of 35 percent, primarily because of undistributed foreign earnings.
“A substantial portion” of those foreign earnings was generated by subsidiaries organized in Ireland, Apple said in the regulatory filing, adding that “such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S.”

Future monetary policy to be inflation data-driven: Rajancentral bank
Raghuram Rajan on key policy rates: ''The medicine seems to be working...before the patient has run the full course of the medicine, do you want to take a chance and take him off the medicine?''
After presenting Reserve Bank of India (RBI)’s fourth bi-monthly monetary policy, Governor Raghuram Rajan fielded a range of questions. Edited excerpts:
Does the RBI have a level of the rupee in mind?
We are not there to protect a level. We are not trying to keep a level in mind and say this will be what we will stick the rupee at. Our inflation rate is different from the rest of the world. The real value of the rupee keeps changing. The nominal value will at some point have to adjust to that unless productivity also pulls up in the economy. So lots of forces determine the fundamental value of the rupee.
