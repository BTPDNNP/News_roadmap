(Reuters) - The addition of a mobile payments service to Apple Inc's next iPhone could help to boost sales of the larger-screen phones and claw back market share lost to mobiles running on Google Inc's Android platform.
Apple shares rose as much as 1.3 percent on Wednesday, a day after the launch of the iPhone 6 and the Apple Watch - the first new product introduced by Chief Executive Tim Cook.
At least six brokerages raised their price target on Apple's stock by as much as $16 to a high of $116, but there was also a rare downgrade to the stock.

Many on Wall Street hailed Apple Pay - the company's new wireless payment system - with Piper Jaffray's Gene Munster calling it the "star of the show" at Tuesday's gala launch.
It will allow iPhone 6 and 6 Plus users to pay for a burger at McDonald's Corp or groceries at Whole Foods Market Inc at the tap of a button, using their American Express Co, Visa Inc or Mastercard Inc bank cards.

Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, Motorola Mobility and others include similar wireless technology in many Android smartphones. But with payment systems such as Google's Wallet failing to catch on, the technology is not standard in handsets.
"On the mobile payments front, we believe the company made a major breakthrough and cracked an important and vexing issue that has plagued the industry for several years regarding customer ownership," William Blair analysts wrote in a note.
Cook, who took over as CEO from Steve Jobs in 2011, has been under pressure to launch new services and come up with larger-screen phones to counter Samsung's popular Galaxy Note phablets.
Worldwide market share of iPhones, which contribute more than half of Apple's revenue, slipped to 11.7 percent for the quarter ended June from 13 percent a year earlier, according to research firm IDC. (http://bit.ly/Vqxmts)
"Apple Pay is a feature that should help sell Apple products and provide some small help to the bottom line," BMO Capital Markets analysts said.
But Andy Hargreaves, analyst at Pacific Crest, said growth potential from the iPhone 6 was largely priced into Apple's shares. He cut his rating to "sector perform" from "outperform", becoming the first analyst since May to downgrade the stock.
Apple Watch, the company's first new product since the iPad, is tethered to the iPhone 6 models. Starting at $349, it will receive phone calls and messages, play music and serve as a digital wallet to pay for goods.
The watch, which will go on sale in the United States next year, has received mixed reactions. Fashion commentators like its clean aesthetic, while some tech writers pointed out Apple's silence over battery life.
Sony Corp, Samsung, LG Electronics Inc and Qualcomm Inc have launched smartwatches based on Google's Android Wear, without great success.
"Apple Watch is attractive, but the need for phone tethering, short battery life, and lack of compelling features for people who do not want a watch will limit the market," Hargreaves said.
Apple shares were up slightly at $98.18 in morning trading. They closed down 0.38 percent on the Nasdaq on Tuesday.

Asia arms up to counter growing ChinesemightPrint

Associated Press | Vietnam | Posted: September 11, 2014 3:35 pm
Vietnam has nearly doubled its military spending, Japan is requesting its biggest-ever defense budget and the Philippines is rushing to piece together a viable navy.
Several Asian nations are arming up, their wary eyes fixed squarely on one country: a resurgent China that’s boldly asserting its territorial claims all along the East Asian coast.
The scramble to spend more defense dollars comes amid spats with China over contested reefs and waters. Other Asian countries such as India and South Korea are quickly modernizing their forces, although their disputes with China have stayed largely at the diplomatic level.
Asian countries now account for about half of the world’s arms imports, with China leading the way by quadrupling its annual military budget over the past decade. The growth in military spending has largely kept pace with economic expansion, although it’s been pulling ahead in China, Vietnam and several other countries this year.
China’s goal is to dislodge the U.S. as the dominant power in the Pacific, said Robert D. Kaplan, chief geopolitical analyst for the U.S.-based intelligence research firm Stratfor. Among the stakes are vital shipping lanes in the South China Sea and potentially lucrative pockets of oil and natural gas under East Asian waters.
“The Chinese bet is that it can increase its military capacity in the South and East China seas faster than Vietnam and the Philippines can do so,” Kaplan said. “If China is able to move freely and exercise more control of its adjacent seas, it will become a full-fledged naval power.”
Beijing hasn’t yet caught up to the U.S., which at $665 billion a year, spends more on its military than the next eight countries combined and triple that of China, according to the Stockholm International Peace Institute, a think tank. Still, China’s spending nearly equals the total defense budgets of all 24 other countries in East and South Asia.
Drawing the most attention is China’s submarine fleet, which is projected to match U.S. numbers by 2020, at 78 vessels each. Many of the Chinese submarines will be stationed at a giant underwater base on Hainan island, which juts into the South China Sea.
China’s moves have spurred a submarine shopping spree across Asia. This year, Vietnam received the third of six submarines it ordered from Russia plus maritime patrol aircraft capable of hunting down Chinese subs. Russia is the top continued…

India fourth largest smartphone market  says...India fourth largest smartphone market, says GSMA

The study predicted that by 2020, four out of every five smartphone connections worldwide will come from the developing world.

ET Special: All you want to know about Apple iPhone 6
NEW DELHI: Smartphones will account for two out of every three mobile connections globally by 2020, said global mobile operators industry body GSMA .
The study, "Smartphone forecasts and assumptions, 2007-2020" conducted by GSMA Intelligence, a research wing of the GSMA, predicts that the number of smartphone connections will grow three-fold over the next six years.
The report puts India at the fourth slot in top 10 global smartphones markets. According to GSMA, India had 111-million smartphone connections in the second quarter of 2014, trailing leader China, US and Brazil .
The study predicted that by 2020, four out of every five smartphone connections worldwide will come from the developing world.
The developing world overtook the developed nations in terms of smartphone connections in 2011 and today, accounts for two in every three smartphones on the planet.
Asia Pacific accounts for about half of the global smartphone connections, even though smartphone penetration in the region is currently below 40%
"The smartphone has sparked a wave of global innovation that has brought new services to millions and efficiencies to businesses of every type," said Hyunmi Yang, Chief Strategy Officer at GSMA, said in a statement.
The finding points out that basic phones, feature phones and data terminals such as tablets, dongles and routers will account for the remaining three billion connections, while it excludes machine to machine from the total connections.
The GSMA Intelligence report said that rapid erosion of the Average Selling Price (ASP) of smartphones; demand for low-end smartphones and bundled smartphones by operators are driving the growth.
"As the industry evolves, smartphones are becoming lifestyle hubs that are creating opportunities for mobile industry players in vertical markets such as financial services, healthcare, home automation and transport," he said.

Obama plans air strikes against ISIS in Syria  but no ground troopsprint

President Barack Obama on Wednesday announced a broad international coalition to take on ISIS, vowing to hunt it down no matter where it was, including Syria.
“I have made it clear that we will hunt down terrorists who threaten our country, wherever they are,” he said in a speech on the eve of the 13th anniversary of 9/11 attacks.
“That means, he added, “I will not hesitate to take action against ISIL (an alternate acronym for ISIS, which is also sometimes called just IS, for Islamic State) in Syria, as well as Iraq.”
But there will be no US troops on the ground in Syria. And those already in Iraq — he is sending 475 more, he said — will advise and train local forces, not engage in combat operations.
“We will not get dragged into another ground war in Iraq.”
The ISIS operations will be modeled on those the United States has been conducting in Yemen and Somalia — taking out key terrorist, mostly of the al Qaeda, in surgical operations.
Anwar al-Awlaki, American-born chief of al Qaeda in Yemen, was killed in a drone strike in 2011. And Ahmed Godane, al-Shabaab co-founder was killed similarly last week.
The coalition would include regional Sunni powers such as Saudi Arabia, which has agreed to train Syrian rebels, and traditional US allies in Europe and Australia and Canada.
There was no word on the timing of airstrikes in Syria. “We will take action on the Syrian side of the border to degrade ISIL,” said a senior administration official.
“But we’re not going to telegraph our punches by being specific about the time and nature of the target.” They could happen, in short, whenever there is good intelligence.
And that has been a problem. An attempt to rescue American journalists James Foley, who was executed by ISIS later, and other failed in July because of poor intelligence.
Surveillance flights over Syria multiplied several fold immediately after Foley’s death to plug this intelligence gap, which, would probably yield better results now.

But the United Stated made it clear anti-ISIS operations in Syria and Iraq will not be coordinated either with Syrian president Bashar al-Assad or the Iranians, respectively.
Assad may appear strategically positioned to gain from any setbacks suffered by ISIS on account  of US strikes, but Obama administration officials said things wouldn't turn out so.
“We do not think that our efforts in Syria will provide an opening to Assad because, frankly, the areas where ISIL has a stronghold in Syria would simply not accept Assad’s rule.”
And on Iran’s role in the fight and coordinating anti-ISIS efforts with it, the official said, “we do not cooperate or coordinate military activity with Iran.”
