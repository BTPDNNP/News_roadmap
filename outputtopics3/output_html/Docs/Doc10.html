Government on Monday told the Supreme Court that it “wants re-auction of all 218 coal blocks” declared as illegal allocation but sought its indulgence to “exempt” 40 of them which are functional and ready for the end use power plants.
“Government stands by the August 25 judgement. We want re-auction of 218 coal blocks. We will be happy if we save some 40 of them which are functional or operational and ready for end use plant,” Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi said while making clear the stand of the Narendra Modi Government before a bench headed by Chief Justice R M Lodha.
However, the Attorney General said the 40 mines for which requisite clearances have been on board and are operational must not be treated with “one brush” and “can be exempted” from cancellation and re-auction, provided they meet the condition of compensating the loss of Rs 295 per tonne caused to the government and enter into a power purchase agreement at Rs 95 per tonne to make up the loss.
He said there was a need for saving 40 coal blocks from “guillotine of cancellation” as uncertainity of coal availability would affect the plants, when the country is facing acute shortage of power supply.
Rohatgi said Government was not in favour of setting up of any committee comprising its retired judges as suggested by the apex court to analyse the consequences of the verdict on the allocation which has been held as illegal.
“We don’t want any committee. If it has to go, all (coal block allocations) must go. My thought is the Government view,” Rohatgi told the bench, also comprising justices Madan B Lokur and Kurian Joseph.
While asking the Centre to file an affidavit on its stand, the bench said, “Union is very clear that auction should take place. They are very clear that all the 218 coal blocks be put under auction”.
“The allocations have been found to be altogether illegal. Therefore it (centre) wants to start from a clean slate,” the bench observed.
During the hearing, Rohatgi said like the 40 operational mines, there are six others which are “absolutely in readiness” to be operational for end use plant and if the verdict has to be strictly followed “all have to be cancelled with one stroke of brush”.

The week in EPL: Liverpool bounce back  Manchester United still in redAll eyes were on Balotelli’s return to English football after a twenty-month absence. (Source: Reuters)
Summary
With EPL matches before the international break over, indianexpress.com takes a look at talking points from EPL.
With the round of fixtures before the international break now complete, indianexpress.com takes a look at three major talking points from the weekend: -
Blast from the past
The Reds got back to winning ways on Sunday night beating Tottenham 3-0 at White Hart Lane. The Merseyside club now has a 12-0 aggregate score over the North London club in the last three games, and their performance was reminiscent of the reverse fixture last season where Liverpool ran out 5-0 winners.
Raheem Sterling was the star man once again as Rodgers tinkered with his formation leaving Brazilian, Philippe Coutinho, out of the team to accommodate new signing Mario Balotelli. All eyes were on Balotelli’s return to English football after a twenty-month absence, and the mercurial Italian put in a good shift spurning two glorious chances, but still showed a willingness to work hard for the team.
With full backs, Eric Dier and Danny Rose pushing forward in the new setup, the centre backs were left exposed. Sturridge and Balotelli exploited the space and this constantly opened up gaps for Sterling and Henderson to run into.
This game demonstrated that Liverpool is going to be a threat going forward this year even without the services of Luis Suarez. There were signs of a potential partnership between Balotelli and Sturridge; however, it is indisputable that Raheem Sterling will be a decisive player for the Anfield club this season.
Woeful run continues
Even with the British record signing Angel Di Maria in the lineup, Manchester United were unable to find the back of the net against a resolute Burnley side. The star players failed to turn up for Louis Van Gaal’s side with Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie and Juan Mata all putting in dreadful performances. Di Maria was arguably their best player in what was his baptism into English football.
After the game, Burnley manager, Sean Dyche echoed everyone’s thoughts that United were “quite easy” to play against and they lacked any real pace and penetration.
United were clumsy in their passing and are certainly lacking in confidence. There are too many gaps in defence and the players are looking lost in Van Gaal’s new system.
Toothless attack
The last kickoff before the international break saw Arsenal manage a paltry 1-1 draw against newly promoted Leicester City. With leading frontman Olivier Giroud out of action till New Year, the Gunners were unable to convert the numerous opportunities they created. It is imperative that Arsene Wenger adds a quality striker to his ranks before the close of the transfer window.
Yaya Sanogo failed to impress yet again in what was his 17th outing for the Gunners without a goal. After navigating continued…

Smriti Irani slams politicisation of Centres Teachers Day plansSmriti Irani rejected reports that the Centre was celebrating the day as 'Guru Utsav', saying it was the name of an essay competition. (Source: PTI)

Amidst a row over Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s planned interaction with students on Teachers’ Day, Human Resource Development Minister Smriti Irani on Monday said that the participation of students in the event was “voluntary”.
She also rejected reports that the Centre was celebrating the day as ‘Guru Utsav’, saying it was the name of an essay competition and wondered if those criticising her were doing it deliberately for political reasons.
She stressed that September 5, the birth anniversary of former President the late S Radhakrishnan, will continue to be celebrated as ‘Teachers’ Day’.
“This particular activity is voluntary in nature. If it is being politicised, then I would say it is regrettable,” Irani told reporters when asked about the objections raised in some states over the Centre’s directive to them to ensure students’ participation in the event.
States like West Bengal have voiced dissent over the entire exercise with its Education Minister Partha Chatterjee saying they have little time in which to make the necessary arrangements for it.
The scheduled timing of the prime minister’s speech, from 3 P.M. to 4.45 P.M. has also come under attack from parties like Congress.
Reacting sharply, Irani said, “If the prime minister of a free India does not have the freedom to interact with students, then it is ridiculous.”
As to the ‘Guru Utsav’ row, Irani said her ministry had sent a representation to all states about an essay competition under that title in their language. She claimed that over 1.3 lakh students have already taken part in the contest.
“I don’t know how it all started. Those who are commenting either don’t know the facts or are doing it wilfully for political reasons,” she said.
Modi is to give a pep-talk to about 1,000 selected students at the Manekshaw Auditorium here on September 5. The programme, which will see Modi interact with the students and take questions via video conferencing facility, will be beamed live to over 18 lakh government and private schools in the country through Doordarshan and education channels.

Supreme Court asks Mudgal committee to complete probe within two monthsComments
Summary
The Mudgal panel was given the task to conduct probe against Srinivasan and was asked to file its report by August end.
Tweet This
The Supreme Court on Monday rejected N Srinivasan’s plea for reinstatement as BCCI President saying he cannot be allowed to take up the charge till he gets a clean chit from Justice Mudgal Committee which is probing him and 12 players in IPL betting and spot-fixing scandal.
Expressing displeasure over slow speed of probe, the apex court asked the panel to complete it’s investigation within two months and also allowed it to file interim report against Srinivasan or any other office bearer who are under its scrutiny.
A bench of justices T S Thakur and F M Ibrahim Kalifulla turned down Srinivasan’s plea that he should be allowed to discharge his function as the AGM is expected to take place at the end of this month and his signature is needed for clearing the annual account of the board.
“Signing account book is not a ground. This cannot be a ground for reinstatement,” the bench said.
At the outset of proceedings, senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for Srinivasan, pleaded the court to reveal whether there was anything against him in Justice Mudgal’s interim report so that he be allowed to take up the charge of BCCI if there is nothing against him.
The bench said that no comments have been made against Srinivasan in the report but the probe is still going on and he cannot be allowed to function as BCCI President.
It said that the committee sought more time as it wants to record the statements of some players who are on England tour and also voice samples of some people need to be matched.
“We saw the report. Two months time for completion of probe does not seem realistic. The way in which it is going on, it will take five years. It’s going to be a tough task for the Committee,” the bench said, asking it to expedite the probe.
The court posted the case for further hearing on November two but allowed the committee to file interim report on any individuals if it wishes.
Justice Mudgal committee, which is conducting probe against Srinivasan and 12 prominent players in the scandal, had on August 29 filed its interim report in a sealed cover before the Supreme Court.
The apex court had on May 16 given the task to conduct probe against 69-year-old Srinivasan and 12 players to Justice Mudgal panel and asked it to file its report by end of August.
It had rejected BCCI’s proposal to conduct the probe through its own panel.
The Mudgal committee had earlier investigated the scandal and submitted in a sealed envelope its initial report in which names of Srinivasan and 12 cricketers were mentioned.
“We are of the considered opinion that the allegations against the 13 persons including N Srinivasan mentioned in the report submitted in the sealed cover should be investigated into by the Justice Mudgal Committee and the team of investigators because if a new Probe Committee is entrusted to inquire into the allegations, there is likelihood of the allegations being leaked to the public and such leakage will damage continu...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(20%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>rs cent market year india company growth prices crore ist</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(19%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>india government power percent court bank make rs companies year</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(18%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>bjp india state minister party pm government people congress modi</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(15%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>financial times company ft business share world year people million</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(10%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>september india modi minister pm times financial obama indian prime</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(5%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>october year times government oct financial rs party bjp people</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(5%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>october modi people india oct pm hong minister kong chief</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
