SpiceJet Mum on Sell-Out, Says Exploring All Options for Funds
New Delhi: Qatar Airways and Singaporean budget carrier Tigerair today announced massive limited-period discounts hoping to corner a chunk of the Indian travel market share.
While Tigerair announced a special one-way base fare of Rs 10 only to Singapore for Indian passengers to commemorate completion of decade-long operations, Qatar Airways launched a global promotional offer of up to 25 per cent savings on its tickets to over 140 destinations across the world.
Tigerair's Rs 10 one-way fare offer to Singapore would be applicable only on round trip tickets from India, under which the fare could be as low as Rs 7,499 including taxes, the airline said in a statement here.
The Qatar Airways' promotional fare tickets under its three-day 'The World is Yours' global sale would have to be bought between today and Wednesday for travel from September 25 till June 15 next year, the airline said in a statement.
The discount of up to 25 per cent is being offered for return travel in all classes for travel from India via its Doha hub, a Qatar Airways statement said, adding that there were limited seats on offer subject to availability.
The airline connects 12 cities in India via Doha to an array of destinations like Barcelona, Dallas, London, Miami, New York, Paris, Rome and several others.
In the statement, its chief executive Akbar Al Baker said, "Qatar Airways' global sale is eagerly awaited by our passengers and with up to 25 per cent discount on return fares, there will never be a better time for our customers to plan leisure or business trips."
Tigerair's tickets which can be booked till September 21 would be valid for travel commencing January 12 to March 31, 2015, and July 21 to September 22, it said.
The airline was also offering special all-in return fares starting Rs 11,999 to destinations like, Bali, Jakarta, Perth, Manila, Hong Kong, Sydney, Gold coast via Singapore. Flights to Sydney and Gold Coast would be operated in collaboration with Scoot, another Singapore-based low-cost long-haul airline, the statement said.
The offers can be availed of on Tigerair's official website from any of the five cities of Bangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad, Kochi and Tiruchirappalli. Tigerair operates total 37 weekly flights to Singapore from six Indian destinations.
Indian carrier Jet Airways also joined the fare war announcing a three-day special fare offer for all its guests "to enjoy the airlines globally renowned business class product at attractive unbeatable fares".
In a statement, a Jet spokesperson said 'The Great Premiere Experience' would be valid for travel on direct flights on the airline's domestic and international network.

NASA plans private space shuttle dealBoeing, Space X land NASA contracts

Boeing, SpaceX win private space race
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
Boeing and SpaceX have been awarded contracts to become NASA's space taxis, shuttling astronauts to and from the International Space Station, the agency announced Tuesday.
NASA ended its Space Shuttle program in 2011 after a review and amid a shift in priorities to exploring deep space, including sending humans to Mars.
Since the shuttle program was retired, NASA crewmembers have been hitching rides on Russian Soyuz spacecraft, at a cost of $70 million per seat, according to a NASA spokeswoman. The agency typically purchases six seats per year.
The contracts are worth a total of $6.8 billion. Boeing's share is $4.2 billion and SpaceX will receive $2.6 billion.
Both companies' crafts must undergo safety testing before manned flights take place. Once certified for flight, each company will launch between two and six missions, NASA said.
 
Elon Musk courts politicians with SpaceX
Boeing ( BA ) said the contract means it will build three of its CST-100 crafts at its Kennedy Space Center facility in Florida. Each craft can carry up to seven passengers.
SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said in a statement he is "deeply honored" his company was chosen. Musk also runs electric car company Tesla ( TSLA ).
NASA's partnership with the companies is part of the Commercial Crew Program. The program is intended to help private companies develop spacecraft to carry astronauts into low Earth orbit by 2017. The agency has invested more than $1.4 billion in contracts and special agreements with private companies for the two phase program.
The goal, according to NASA's website, is "to establish safe, reliable and cost-effective access to space." Once the new transportation system is up and running, NASA says it will use private spacecraft to "meet its space station crew rotation and emergency return obligations."
Boeing has already received more than $100 million in NASA funding.

Meanwhile, the SpaceX Dragon became the first commercial spacecraft to deliver cargo to the space station in 2012. The Dragon currently only carries cargo, but SpaceX says it will be able to transport humans as well.
Sierra Nevada Corp., an aerospace company based in Nevada that was also competing for the NASA contract and which has benefitted from Commercial Crew Program money, is working on the Dream Chaser, a winged spacecraft designed to fly into orbit.

As Mining Curbs Bite  India Offers Market to Glut-hit Iron OreRBI Reduces Repatriation Time of Export Proceeds
Singapore:
An oversupplied global iron ore market may find some relief from an unlikely source as former No.3 exporter India turns into a big importer due to a cutback in domestic production.
The country may ship in up to 45 million tonnes over the next three years as home-grown iron ore output falls short of domestic steel production needs, an executive at an influential industry group said.
India imported just 0.37 million tonnes of the steelmaking raw material in 2013/14, government data showed. But already JSW Steel, India's third-largest maker of the alloy, has said it will import 6 million tonnes of iron ore in 2014/15 against zero a year earlier.
"There's no option but to import to meet the shortfall. We're looking at between 10 and 15 million tonnes every fiscal year over the next three years," Basant Poddar, vice president of the Federation of Indian Mineral Industries, the only industry group for mining firms in the country, told Reuters by phone.
"The mine closures all over India, starting from Karnataka, Goa, Odisha and Jharkhand, have created a massive disruption to supply," Mr Poddar said.
Mining in the key iron ore states of Karnataka and Goa was banned in 2011 and 2012, respectively, following a crackdown on illegal mining by the Supreme Court and the government. Several mines in top producing Odisha state and in Jharkhand too were closed this year following government-imposed restrictions on the renewal of mining licenses.
While the bans have since been lifted, delays in restarting mining operations in Goa and Karnataka and the latest mine closures in the other states have limited local iron ore supply.
The disruptions have cut India's iron ore production to 152 million tonnes in the year ended March 31, from about 218 million in 2009/10, according to the Indian Bureau of Mines.
The prospect of higher demand from India comes at an opportune time for global iron ore miners, whose margins have been shrunk by a 40 per cent slump in iron ore prices this year.
Iron ore fell to $81.90 a tonne last week, its lowest since September 2009.
The bulk of India's imports may come from Australia and South Africa, said Mr Poddar, and unlikely from Brazil where shipments are usually made in big vessels. "Indian ports are not geared to handle large vessels," he said.
But the potential import volume won't be enough to absorb the total projected global surfeit. Morgan Stanley, which sees a global surplus of 79 million tonnes this year doubling to 158 million tonnes in 2015, expects the price to drop to $70.
In addition, any relief from Indian demand may be temporary, as the domestic shortage is due to government policy measures that could eventually be reversed.
Bureaucratic Route
For the present, resuming operations has been slow due to the long bureaucratic route to renew mining leases, said Mr Poddar.
Only 22 mines out of 122 that are eligible to restart in Karnataka have resumed operations, said Mr Poddar who owns Mineral Enterprises Ltd which has five mines in the state that have a combined capacity of 1.2 million tonnes but have remained shut. Mines in Goa have not reopened.
In Odisha, around a third of 56 iron ore mines are still closed and in Jharkhand, the third biggest producer in the past fiscal year, 12 out of 17 mines are shut.
India used to be the world's No.3 iron ore exporter until higher costs along with the mining bans slashed shipments by 85 per cent, or 100 million tonnes, over the past two years.
Amid the shortage in local supply, iron ore prices in India are defying the global weakness.
In Odisha, 63 per cent grade iron ore would cost about $105 a tonne, including taxes and the royalty, to export, way above the current global market price of $67-$68, said Dhruv Goel, managing partner at industry consultancy SteelMint.
But miners make a profit of $15-$20 a tonne selling the same grade to local steelmakers, said Mr Goel.
"It is certainly profitable to sell in the domestic market."

India s Infrastructure Market to Reach $6.6 Trillion by 2025: ReportRBI Reduces Repatriation Time of Export Proceeds
Mumbai: India's infrastructure market is expected to touch $6.6 trillion by 2025, which will be nearly 12.5 per cent of the Asia-Pacific, says a report.
According to consultancy firm PwC, the Asia Pacific infrastructure market is expected to grow by 7-8 per cent a year over the next decade to over $53.6 trillion by 2025 and representing nearly 60 per cent of the world total.
The increase in infrastructure spends in the country is likely to be driven by sectors like housing, telecom, healthcare, education, transportation, among others, it said.
"Overall, India's share of the Asia-Pacific infrastructure market is expected to continue to grow, reaching around 12.5 per cent or $6.6 trillion by 2025," PwC said in its report.
According to the report, transportation and utilities investments are expected to triple over the coming decade as income and travel demand will rise and the country's population will increasingly congregate in urban centres.
"The ongoing development of technology services sector, as well as demand from households, is likely to drive investment in telecommunications infrastructure. The population is expected to grow much faster than other countries in the region, which will further boost demand for infrastructure sectors serving households," the report said.
While annual healthcare investment is forecast to grow around $37 billion by 2025, education infrastructure spending will likely to reach $18.9 billion.
"The huge growth in infrastructure spending will be driven by key factors such as Asia's economic growing prominence, trade competitiveness, and the current widely recognised infrastructure deficit across the emerging markets of this region.
"Asia is now the world's primary growth engine, with China, India and Southeast Asia offering a very large consumer base and low-cost workforce, with high levels of natural resources," PwC India Leader Capital Projects and Infrastructure Manish Agarwal said

Icra Pegs Tyre Industry to Grow at 8 Per Cent in FY15
Press Trust of India | Updated On: September 16, 2014 21:15 (IST)
RBI Reduces Repatriation Time of Export Proceeds
Chennai: Rating agency Icra has pegged the domestic tyre industry to grow 8 per cent to Rs 49,300 crore during the ongoing financial year (2014-15).
"For 2014-15, ICRA expects the domestic tyre industry to grow by eight per cent to Rs 493 billion, supported by six per cent domestic volume growth, even as falling raw material prices would pressure tyre companies to pass these benefits in replacement market," the rating agency said in a statement.
The decline in natural rubber and crude oil prices would provide the requisite headroom for passing on some benefits to the consumers, it said.
Despite the pressure on realisations, for 2014-15, Icra expects "significantly" softer natural rubber prices to trickle down into margins, leading to stable and high operating margins, it said.
Tyre demand in 2013-14 estimated to have grown by a muted 1 per cent supported by two wheeler and tractor segments, even as demand from light commercial vehicle and passenger vehicle segments "faltered".
Icra expects demand for tyres to grow by 6 to eight per cent during 2014-15, contributed by truck and bus, passenger vehicle and scooter segments.
The replacement market is also expected to see demand for trucks and bus as the economic activity revives, it said.
On exports, the agency said in 2013-14 it grew by 7.5 per cent largely due to weak rupee and weaker offtake from importers like Brazil, the UAE and Philippines.
In the first quarter of this fiscal year, Icra said tyre exports in value terms was expected to remain flat due to persisting weak demand and stable currency movements.
"As demand catches up over the next 18-24 months, input costs are expected to go up, globally", it said.

If Anheuser-Busch InBev NV and SABMiller combine, it would create a massive beer conglomerate featuring some of the most recognizable brands in the world, including Budweiser and Miller.
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
One of the largest brewers in the world Anheuser-Busch InBev NV is preparing a bid to buy its rival SABMiller, according to news reports.
If true, the union would create a massive beer conglomerate featuring some of the most recognizable brands in the world, including Budweiser, Coors Light, Corona and Miller.
AB InBev ( AHBIF ) is talking to banks about financing a $122 billion bid for its rival SABMiller ( SBMRF ), according to the Wall Street Journal and other news reports.
The companies would not verify these reports for CNNMoney.
SABMiller spokesman Richard Farnsworth and AB InBev spokeswoman Karen Couck said separately that they do not comment on market speculation and rumor.
The merger reports come just days after SABMiller tried to buy Heineken ( HEINY ), but it was rebuffed by the Dutch brewer.

A malnourished girl in a hospital in Mogadishu, Somalia, rests in her mother's arms. The UN estimates that 805 million people suffer from "chronic undernourishment."
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
One out of every nine people in the world does not have enough food to eat.
An annual report from the United Nations released Tuesday estimates that 805 million people suffer from "chronic undernourishment."
The UN's Food and Agriculture Organization warned that "food-insecurity" remains "unacceptably high" in certain developing economies.
For example, more than one in four people in Sub-Saharan Africa do not have enough to eat. In Malawi, half of all children under five years of age are significantly underweight.
The situation is particularly acute in Yemen, where political and economic instability, as well as violent conflict, have made the Arab nation one of the most food insecure countries in the world.
The report says 526 million people in Asia, the world's most populous region, don't have enough to eat.
Related: Where the middle class is most unequal
Still overall, there has been improvement from last year, when the report showed that about 842 million people went hungry. Since 1990, the number of undernourished people in the world has decreased by more than 200 million.
Access to food has improved in certain parts of East Asia and South Asia, as well as Latin America and the Caribbean.
Indonesia has reduced the share of its population living in hunger by more than half since 1990, the report states. The report singles out Brazil, Bolivia and Haiti as "case studies" for improving food security.
Developing nations are close to achieving their goal of halving the number of hungry people by 2015, the report suggests, but only if world leaders stick to their commitments.
"This is proof that we can win the war against hunger and should inspire countries to move forward, with the assistance of the international community as needed," the report states.
The report comes ahead of a key summit on food security next month in Rome.

Middle-Class Incomes: Still Dead in the WaterU.S. Census Bureau
One day, there will probably be some news about middle-class incomes worth celebrating.
Today is not that day. In its big income and poverty report, the Census Bureau reported that the median household income was $51,939 in 2013, statistically unchanged from a year before. I'm thinking of a word. It begins with "stag" and ends with "nation."

Alibaba is not the Amazon of ChinaAlibaba is not the Amazon of China

Alibaba jumpstarts small fashion brand
HONG KONG (CNNMoney)
Forget what you've read, Alibaba is NOT "the Amazon of China."
The analogy has been used widely as Alibaba prepares for its IPO. But it is only partially accurate, and masks big differences in business models.
Sure, Alibaba ( BABA ) and Amazon both do business on the Internet. They both enable consumers to buy huge volumes of goods without stepping foot in a store. And both have a stranglehold on their home markets.
But that's pretty much where the similarities end. Unlike Amazon ( AMZN , Tech30 ), Alibaba does not own most of the items sold on its platforms, it does not maintain massive distribution centers, and it has only a fraction of the 132,000 employees on Amazon's books.
"Amazon and eBay are e-commerce companies, and Alibaba is not an e-commerce company," Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma said last year. "Alibaba helps others to do e-commerce. We do not sell things."
The point Ma was trying to drive home is that Alibaba excels at connecting buyers and sellers. Alibaba is not the seller.
Related: Meet four kings of Alibaba's online retail empire
The company's largest digital marketplace -- Taobao -- allows consumers to buy goods directly from small businesses. Tmall, Alibaba's other major shopping marketplace, connects larger brand retailers to consumers.
Alibaba makes money on Taobao by selling advertisements and search placement to retailers (kinda like Google ( GOOG )). The company takes a commission from the larger retailers that operate on Tmall (think eBay ( EBAY , Tech30 )).
The model means that Ma doesn't have to obsess over keeping prices low the way Amazon founder Jeff Bezos does.
The structure also makes Alibaba more of a pure Internet play, a trend reflected in the company's bottom line. Compared to Amazon, Alibaba's revenue is small (but growing faster). And investors are salivating over the company's much higher profit margins.
Investors have also been enticed by Alibaba's success at building what Ma calls an Internet "ecosystem."
The network of services allows consumers to move seamlessly between the company's online retail marketplaces and mobile apps used to process payments, buy movie tickets, call a taxi or invest in a money market fund . Alibaba even has a corporate cousin in the logistics business that handles most of the shipment...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(23%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>bjp india state minister party pm government people congress modi</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(17%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>financial times company ft business share world year people million</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(17%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>rs cent market year india company growth prices crore ist</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(17%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>india government power percent court bank make rs companies year</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(13%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>september de china chinese scotland alibaba xi la india company</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>september india modi minister pm times financial obama indian prime</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
