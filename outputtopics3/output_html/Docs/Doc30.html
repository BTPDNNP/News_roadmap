Brooklyn's Bushwick Coffee Shop is facing a firestorm of criticism Thursday, after owner Michael Avila published an anti-semitic rant on social media.
Avila posted a bizarre rant on his personal Facebook page Wednesday in which he laments the gentrification of his neighborhood spearheaded by "greedy infiltrator" Jews.
In case the sentiment of his original statement wasn't clear, Avila then went a step further, posting a screenshot of the rant on the coffee shop's Instagram account , blurring out all of the words except for "greedy infiltrators:"
In a series of follow-up comments posted by Avila on Facebook, he refers to Jewish people as a "problematic group" who, "in typical Illuminati form," have infiltrated the neighborhood "'quietly' and unfairly/greedily."
Perhaps unsurprisingly, the response to Avila's unconventional tirade has been less than enthusiastic.
"I think it's great you're being honest, @bushwickcoffeeshop," reads one comment on the shop's Instagram page. "I wish all business owners would be as honest with their views - it makes it so much easier for the customers to know what establishments to avoid."
Another, posted to Avila's Facebook page adds, "There are so many things wrong with this post, I don't know where to begin. I don't like my coffee with a side of antisemitism . It's bigots like you that are destroying Brooklyn."
NY Eater reports the shop is attempting to make amends with a series of Instagram posts featuring Jewish people he does like .
UPDATE: Thursday -- In a statement to DNAinfo New York , Avila defended his statements, saying he'd been "misunderstood," and had originally intended to condemn the people he perceived as greedy landlords.
"I'm anti-Zionism. It's about politics, it's about greed," he told DNAinfo . "I’m certainly not anti-Semitic. That would stand against everything I believe I stand for."

Ten ways to use competition to your advantageTen ways to use competition to your advantage

'A lot of people see competition as a negative, but there's always a way to leverage it to your advantage.'
QUESTION: How can I use my competition to my advantage?
Out-innovate them
“Look at what your competitors are doing and where they all have assumed the same outcome — whether that be market, product offering, etc. — and then try the opposite of what they're doing. Companies that follow will never prosper. Be the company that takes the lead and explores new territory, and you might end up taking the entire market!”

“A lot of people see competition as a negative, but there's always a way to leverage it to your advantage. One of the most effective ways of doing that is to find your competition's most glaring weakness and attack it head-on. If you can do this one aspect so well that your competition's customers simply can't ignore you, then you've already won a significant battle.”
James Simpson, GoldFire Studios
“Monitor complaints customers of your top competitors make via Twitter/Facebook, and try to glean insights from them. We launched free shipping after seeing a ton of complaints from customers about shipping charges on some of our competitors’ sites.”
Josh Weiss, Bluegala
Support the larger community
“By listening on social media, you can hear the problems customers are having with your competitors and offer solutions. While you can't offer full tech support, you can offer ideas, generalized information and, most importantly, help them switch to your product. You can jump out in front of your competition by helping people with their products directly.”
Thursday Bram, Hyper Modern Consulting
Partner with them
“I find that your competition can actually be a great partner for two reasons. First, there is often enough to go around — people usually read more than one blog or buy more than one kind of coffee. Second, no product offering is exactly the same. Highlight your differences, package your products or services together, and then share marketing costs.”
Vanessa Van Edwards, Science of People
Analyze your competitors
“Analyzing our competitors has honestly been one of the best sources of data for our business. Analyzing where they put their marketing dollars, the way they organize products on their sites, their best-selling products and site design elements they use have all helped us greatly.”
Pablo Palatnik, ShadesDaddy.com
Learn from their mistakes and successes
“Let them figure out what works and what doesn't, and learn from it — you can often avoid costly mistakes by paying attention to your competitors!”
Alexis Wolfer, The Beauty Bean
Use the advantage of multiple winners
“In a big market, there will likely be multiple winners. You can use that to your advantage. When a competitor gets press in one outlet, try and get similar press in another. This will raise the profile of the industry as a whole. Even if you wind up in second place, the pie has still gotten a lot bigger and your business will have grown.”
Wade Foster, Zapier
Spy on them with SpyFu
“SpyFu exposes the search marketing secret formula of your most successful competitors. Search for any domain, and see every place they've shown up on Google: every keyword they've bought on AdWords, every organic rank and every ad variation in the last six years. Then, use your competitors online activities to improve your own.”
Brett Farmiloe, Markitors
Use the association of professionals
“As fellow professionals, other attorneys are actually one of my best sources of clients and can be great resources for my practice and clientele. I may bring them in for a client because of a conflict with one of my other clients on a project, for extra help during an upswing in business or if the other attorney is just a better fit for the client's immediate legal needs.”

As if the negotiation of Facebook officiality and the drawn-out dance of flirty texting weren’t obstacles enough, the Internet has visited a new affliction on modern love: It’s called “digital infidelity,” and it’s probably living on your phone.
A new study by researchers at the University of Indiana found that Facebook users in relationships frequently use the site to keep in touch with “back-burners” — exes or platonic friends they know they could connect with romantically, should their current relationships go south. Men have back-burners at roughly twice the rate of women, the study found. But among both genders, the practice is widespread: On average, respondents in relationships ...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(25%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>financial times company ft business share world year people million</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(19%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>october modi people india oct pm hong minister kong chief</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(19%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>rs cent market year india company growth prices crore ist</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(15%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>india government power percent court bank make rs companies year</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(8%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>bjp india state minister party pm government people congress modi</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>september india modi minister pm times financial obama indian prime</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(5%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>october year times government oct financial rs party bjp people</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
