Retail inflation slips to 6.46 %

Providing respite to common man ahead of Diwali, falling food prices pulled down September retail inflation to 6.46 per cent, the lowest since the new series of Consumer Price Index was released in January, 2012, although experts do not see a rate cut by the Reserve Bank any time soon.
Although retail inflation, which has been on decline since July, is below the RBI target of 8 per cent by January, 2015, experts said the central bank is expected to reduce interest in the next fiscal (2015-16) only.
The overall food inflation as measured by CPI fell to 7.67 per cent from 9.35 per cent in the previous month and 11.75 per cent in September, 2013.
Retail inflation was at 7.73 per cent in August, revised downward from the earlier estimate of 7.8 per cent.
As per the government data released on Monday, CPI inflation in the vegetable basket in September fell to 8.59 per cent from 15.15 per cent in the previous month.
Inflation in fruits slowed to 22.4 per cent from 24.27 per cent in August. The price rise in protein rich items like eggs, fish and meat was slower in September against August.
“...while the RBI has become more proactive in providing liquidity to the banking system, it seems that lowering the policy interest rate will likely take place only in 2015,” said Barclays Research.ICRA Senior Economist Aditi Nayar said CPI at a series-low 6.5 per cent in September provides some optimism in light of the near-stagnation in industrial output in July-August, 2014.
In its last monetary policy, RBI had maintained status quo on interest rate citing worries on the inflation front despite industry demanding reduction.

Several leading economists have appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to continue with the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act amid apprehensions that the government might restrict the programme and not offer it adequate support.
In a letter to Mr. Modi, Dilip Abreu, Pranab Bardhan, V. Bhaskar, Ashwini Deshpande, Jean Dreze, Maitreesh Ghatak, Jayati Ghosh, Dilip Mookherjee, R. Nagaraj, Debraj Ray and others argued that despite numerous hurdles, the NREGA had achieved significant results.
The letter said: “We are writing to express our deep concern about the future of India’s National Rural Employment Guarantee Act .
“The NREGA was enacted in 2005 with unanimous support from all political parties. It is a far-reaching attempt to bring some much-needed economic security to the lives of millions of people who are on the margin of subsistence.
“Despite numerous hurdles, the NREGA has achieved significant results. At a relatively small cost (currently 0.3% of India’s GDP), about 50 million households are getting some employment at NREGA worksites every year. A majority of NREGA workers are women, and close to half are Dalits or Adivasis. A large body of research shows that the NREGA has wide-ranging social benefits, including the creation of productive assets.
“Recent research also shows that corruption levels have steadily declined over time. While corruption remains a concern, experience shows that it can be curbed, and the battle against corruption in NREGA has helped to establish new standards of transparency in other social programmes as well.
“No doubt, the programme could and should do even better. But the gains that have been achieved are substantial and amply justify further efforts to make it a success.
“Against this background, it is alarming to hear of multiple moves (some of them going back to the preceding government) to dilute or restrict the provisions of the Act… The Central Government appears to be considering an amendment aimed at restricting the NREGA to the country’s poorest 200 districts. This runs against a fundamental premise of the Act: gainful employment that affords basic economic security is a human right.
“The message seems to be that the new government is not committed to the NREGA and hopes to restrict it as much as possible. We urge you to reverse this trend and ensure that the programme receives all the support it requires to survive and thrive.”

Investment decision only after clarity on gas price: RILeconomy, business and finance
The government in September for the third time postponed a decision on raising natural gas prices. Now, it is looking at announcing a decision by November 15.
Reliance Industries has said it will make a final investment decision on producing gas from the R-Cluster discovery in the flagging KG-D6 block only after the government decides on gas price hike.
RIL and its partners BP plc of UK and Canada’s Niko Resources plan to produce about 13 million standard cubic meters per day of gas for 13 years from D-34 discovery, known as R-Cluster, in the KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 block by 2017-18.
The planned output from D-34, which is estimated to hold an in place gas reserve of 2.2 Trillion cubic feet, is equivalent to the combined current production from Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1&D3) gas field and MA field in the KG-D6 block.
In a presentation to investors post announcing its second quarter earnings, RIL said it has completed Front End Engineering Design (FEED) as well as geo-mechanical studies for the R-Cluster development. Contracting activity was underway for long lead items.
However, “clarity on gas price (is) required for FID (final investment decision),” RIL said in the presentation.
The government in September for the third time postponed a decision on raising natural gas prices. Now, it is looking at announcing a decision by November 15.
For RIL, a revision in natural gas prices was due on April 1, 2014, when the USD 4.2 per million British thermal unit rate fixed for first five years of production expired.
A panel appointed by the previous UPA government had proposed a formula which would have at least doubled the rates but the same is under review with the new government looking at moderating the increase to keep the burden on consuming power and fertiliser industry minimal.
“Clarity on gas pricing to enable achieving goal of enhanced production towards ensuring India’s energy security,” RIL said in the presentation.
RIL has so far made 19 gas discoveries and 1 oil find in the KG-D6 block. Of these, D1&D3 gas fields were brought to production in April 2009 while MA oilfield began pumping oil in September 2008.
D-34 is part of what is known as R-Cluster of discoveries. R-Cluster comprises four discoveries-D-29, 30, 31 and 34. Of these, only D-34 has so far been declared commercially viable while the Declaration of Commerciality (DoC) of others has been refused in absence of DGH prescribed tests confirming the discoveries.
Last year, the government approved RIL proposal to invest USD 3.18 billion in bringing D-34 to production.
RIL estimates that output from KG-D6 can reach up to 60 mmscmd by 2019 when all of the satellite fields are put into production.
The government has already approved USD 1.529 billion investments in four satellite fields that can produce 10 mmscmd. Investment plans for rest are under consideration.

DLF shares tank 28%  loses 7439 cr after Sebi banStock tanks 28%, DLF may have to lower prices
Vandana Ramnani , Hindustan Times  New Delhi, October 14, 2014

DLF’s shares tanked over 28% Tuesday, a day after the market regulator barred India’s biggest realtor from selling shares for three years, triggering concerns about its ability to fund projects and repay loans.
Analysts said the Securities Exchange Board of India’s (SEBI’s) Monday ruling could force DLF to lower property prices, leading to an overall correction in the National Capital Region given the company’s market leadership in the region, analysts said.
“We expect this capital-market ban to result in a meaningful price correction as DLF liquidates unsold inventory in its completed projects to generate operating cash flows,” Ambit, a brokerage firm, said in a research report.
The company, credited with building Gurgaon, commands nearly 60% market share in the glitzy Millennium City that borders the Capital.
“If it ends up selling land and development projects and ongoing projects at a discounted rate, it will have an impact on the overall real estate-market sentiment,” said a real estate consultant, who did not wish to be identified.
“DLF’s inability to access capital markets could impact its fund-raising programme,” Macquarie research said. “DLF, in this case, would have to resort to large asset sales to reduce debt in the future.”
Buyers are worried, too. “We see our projects in danger now. We doubt that they will be completed on time. People who have invested all their savings in these projects are anxious now,” said Sanjay Jain, secretary of the Capital Greens Flat Buyers Association, a DLF residential project in Moti Nagar, New Delhi.
DLF had failed to meet the 2012 deadline for the handover of flats that were still incomplete, Jain said. They are now planning to take the company to court.
DLF is India’s most indebted property developer. As of June 30, its borrowings stood at Rs. 19,064 crore, higher than the market value of Rs. 18,701.33 crore.
The SEBI blow wiped Rs. 6,000 crore off its value Tuesday when its stock plunged 28.5 % to Rs. 104.15.
The company might need to dig deep into its commercial properties put out on rent, analysts said. “The only saving grace in its portfolio are assets that earn annual rentals of more than Rs. 2,100 crore. It can always — in the worst case scenario — sell these income-producing assets to generate more than Rs. 20,000 crore which is equal to their total debt,” said another consultant on condition of anonymity.
SEBI has barred the company and six top executives, including promoter-chairman KP Singh, from accessing the securities market, choking its options to raise fresh funds.
The move came after seven years of investigation into the charges that the realtor didn’t give complete information when it went public in 2007.
In recent years, DLF has faced a welter of problems including angry lawsuits by customers upset with project delays and political controversies surrounding its alleged links with Robert Vadra, son-in-law of Congress president Sonia Gandhi.
DLF has promised to “defend itself to the fullest extent” against the accusations and said it was “confident of the vindication of its stand”.

Oil major Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited is assessing the damage caused to Visakh Refinery due to Cyclone Hudhud after shutting it down. “Inspection of various facilities is now going on by senior officials and technical experts. The refinery has been closed temporarily as a precautionary measure,” a senior official told The Hindu on Tuesday.
Most of the roofs of various facilities at the refinery had been blown away under the impact of gusty winds which lashed the coast at a speed reaching up to 210 km per hour on Sunday. The refinery has an installed capacity of 8.3 million tonne per annum and it is waiting for clearance from the Ministry of Environment and Forests for expanding to 15 million tonne.
After completion of assessment of damage, HPCL authorities will decide the date of reviving the operations. “Now the refinery is in a bad shape. We are hopeful that it will be revived at the earliest. Normalcy will be ensured within five to seven days of resuming the operations,” the official pointed out.

SCR: rail route to Visakhapatnam restoreddisaster and accident
It is estimated that SCR incurred a revenue loss of around Rs.15.6 crore during the last three days i.e,. from October 11 to 13. The authorities said commodities like imported coal, fertilizers, lime stone, cement and laterite could not be loaded due to inclement weather and disruption of rail services.

The track on the down line towards Visakhapatnam was opened for operations, and trains will be operated through this single line. SCR authorities said train No. 18520 (Lokamanya Tilak Terminus – Visakhapatnam Express) smoothly passed through the restored line at 3.45 p.m on Tuesday.
The authorities said that works on restoring the second line i.e., up line had been taken up on a war-footing, and that services were likely to be resumed on Wednesday.
Breaches occurred at several locations on the track between Elamanchili -Narsingapalli- Bayyavaram stations on this route owing to heavy rains. SCR General Manager P.K.Srivastava has been camping at the work spots since Monday and closely monitoring the progress.
