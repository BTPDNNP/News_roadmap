Gold financing company Muthoot Finance has sought capital markets regulator Sebi’s approval for raising up to Rs 400 crore through non-convertible debentures (NCDs) to support lending activities.
The issue aims to garner up to Rs 200 crore with an option to retain over—subscription of up to Rs 200 crore, as per draft prospectus filed with Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi).
NCDs are loan-linked securities issued by a company and can’t be converted into stocks. They usually carry a higher interest rate than a convertible debenture.
“Public issue by Muthoot Finance of secured redeemable NCDs and unsecured redeemable NCDs of face value of Rs 1,000 each, aggregating up to Rs 2,000 million with an option to retain over subscription up to Rs 2,000 million for issuance of additional NCDs aggregating to a total of up to Rs 4,000 million,” the prospectus stated.
The funds raised through the issue would be used for financing and lending activities and for general corporate purposes.
Muthoot Finance has already raised a total of Rs 864 crore via two tranches through NCDs route in the current fiscal (2014-15) so far.
ICICI Securities is the lead manager to the proposed issue, while Link Intime India Private Limited is the registrar.
Muthoot Finance is one of the largest gold financing company in India, with more than 4,200 branches as of June 30, 2014.

Mutual funds equity folio count expands by over 7 lakh inApr-OctEquity mutual funds added more than seven lakh investor accounts or folios in the first seven months of the current fiscal (2014-15) in view of sharp rally in the stock market.
Folios are numbers designated to individual investor accounts, though one investor can have multiple folios.
According to Securities and Exchange Board of India data on investor accounts with 45 fund houses, number of equity folios rose to 2,9917,974 at last month-end from 2,91,80,922 at the end of the last fiscal (March 31, 2014), registering a gain of 7,37,052 folios during April-October period this year.
The additions came at a time when the market was scaling new highs.
The month of April saw the first rise in more than four years. Prior to that, the equity mutual fund (MF) sector had seen a continuous closure of folios since March 2009 after the market crashed due to the global financial crisis in late 2008. Since March 2009, it has seen a closure of 1.5 crore folios.
The investor base reached its peak of 4.11 crore in March 2009, while it was 3.77 crore in March 2008.
Industry experts said that strong rally in the equity market and the consequent rise in investors’ interest led to a sharp increase in retail folios.
“There has been rise in Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) registration and a lot of close-ended schemes have been launched by mutual fund houses in the past few months and the rise in such activities are supported by a sharp surge in equity market,” Quantum Mutual Fund Chief Executive Officer Jimmy Patel said.
The addition in equity folios is in line with BSE’s benchmark Sensex surging by 25 per cent in the first seven months of the current financial year.
Moreover, mutual funds industry reported net inflows of nearly Rs 34,000 crore in equity funds in the April-September period of the current fiscal (2014-15), which helped the industry grow its folio count.
Overall, the industry retail folios surged to 3.97 crore at October-end from 3.95 crore at the end of March.

Some Mutual funds miffed as AMFI kept them in dark on MarutipanelFPI inflow in equities reaches Rs 1 lakh crore
Some mutual fund houses are piqued at being kept in the dark about setting up a committee by their industry association Association of Mutual Funds of India to discuss the common stand on Maruti’s controversial plan to set up a plant in Gujarat, industry sources said here today.
The AMFI panel has been formed to discuss Maruti’s plans to set up its Gujarat plant as a fully-owned arm of its Japanese parent Suzuki as well as take a common position on similar cases where minority shareholders’ interests are involved.
After Maruti rejected mutual funds’ demand not go ahead with the Gujarat plan and instead hold an extraordinary general body meeting later this month, the Association of Mutual Funds of India (AMFI) had set up a panel to take a common mutual fund industry position on the issue.
As many as seven MFs hold 6.5 per cent stake in the country’s largest car maker, while LIC holds 6.83 per cent.
Some fund houses felt that AMFI should have informed them about the decision to form the panel on the issue. They have contended that the committee’s decision would not be binding on them while using their voting rights.
SBI Mutual Fund, which holds some stake in Maruti-Suzuki and has been kept out of the process, has been very critical about the manner in which the AMFI board constituted the committee.
Though the talks were on among mutual fund houses about formation of the committee for quite some time, many fund houses were not informed about the decision to set up the committee, the SBI MF said.
“Normally we are informed about any such decisions taken by the AMFI. However, this time we didn’t receive any communication from the association. Once we get some mail from AMFI in this connection, we will definitely take a call on whether to raise a questions about the issue,” SBI MF Managing Director and Chief Executive Dinesh Khara told PTI.
Maruti-Suzuki’s plan to set up a car plant in Gujarat as a fully-owned subsidiary of its Japanese parent has already been objected to by seven mutual fund houses holding stakes in the car company.
A decision on the proposed plant is likely to be taken by Maruti after its forthcoming extraordinary general meeting which is likely to be held later this month. It needs to get the permission of at least 75 per cent of shareholders for investment in the plant.
LIC Nomura MF, which holds 0.04 per cent stake in Maruti, has also been kept in the dark about the decision. However, it felt that it will raise objections in case any decision is taken by the committee and which was not informed to the MF house in advance.
“Formation of a committee was within the purview of the AFMI. However, we will raise a question before the association in case any decision is taken by the committee without keeping us informed,” LIC Nomura MF Chief Executive Nilesh Sathe said.
While LIC is the single largest minority investor in the country’s largest car maker with 6.8 per cent holding, seven mutual funds hold around 6.53 per cent and domestic financial institutions hold 7.95 per cent in the country’s largest carmaker.
An official of LIC said the financial giant is yet to take a view on the Maruti-Suzuki’s plan.
“A committee is a good forum to have consultation within the industry on issues related to corporate governance. However, any decision to be taken by the committee will not be binding on us when we exercise our voting rights,” Union KBC Mutual Fund Chief Executive G Pradeepkumar said.
However, the Institutional Investor Advisory Services (IIAS) has welcomed the AMFI move.
“It’s good to know that mutual funds and institutional investors are thinking about some critical transactions and getting more active, because every single vote of mutual fund houses, big or small, will count during the EGM of the company,” IIAS Chief Operating Officer Hetal Dalal said.

Market outlook: Inflation  IIP data  cabinet reshuffle key for mkts  sayexpertsInflation data for October, industrial output numbers for September, quarterly earnings of blue-chips such as Tata Motors, ONGC and SBI, as also the first reshuffle of the Union Cabinet would dictate the stock markets trend this week, say experts.
Besides, overseas investments and movement of the rupee against the dollar would be crucial for markets.
“Movement of index in near-term will depend on upcoming IIP, CPI & WPI data and second quarter results of important companies,” said Vivek Gupta, CMT-Director Research, CapitalVia Global Research Limited.
Several blue-chips are slated to announce their earnings this week, including Tata Steel, Cipla, Tata Power, DLF, Hindalco Industries, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Tata Motors, Bharat Heavy Electricals, ONGC and State Bank of India.
Industrial production data for September would come out on Wednesday.
Inflation based on combined consumer price indices (CPI) for October would also come on Wednesday, while inflation based on wholesale price index (WPI) would be announced on Friday.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi today expanded his Council of Ministers, a move that was hailed by the industry as a further step towards faster reforms.
The benchmark BSE Sensex concluded the week at 27,868.63, showing a marginal gain of just 2.8 points.
“We expect the markets to gain medium-term support from 7,900-7,950 levels. FII flows are pretty strong in the past fortnight and their trend in the coming sessions, coupled with global cues, shall guide the market direction from this point,” said Rakesh Goyal, Senior Vice President, Bonanza Portfolio.

Deepak Parekh says stock markets not helping Indians; only FIIs making biggainsFPI inflow in equities reaches Rs 1 lakh crore
Raising concern about over-dependence of Indian capital markets on foreign institutional investors, eminent banker Deepak Parekh has said that something needs to be done to change this pattern.
“There is too much dependence on foreign institutional investors (FIIs), and I think we have exported our capital markets abroad. We have to do something to change this pattern,” Deepak Parekh told a capital markets meet organised by the ISB here over the weekend.
“Who is really benefitting from our well regulated equity markets? It is not the Indians, it is not our institutions, it is not our labour, it is not our retirees, but the FIIs,” said Deepak Parekh, Chairman of mortgage giant HDFC.
FIIs’ stakes in the Sensex companies hit an all-time high of over 27 per cent in June this year. Their holdings in the wider BSE 200 Index reached an all-time high at 24.5 per cent, as per BofA-ML’s Jyotivardhan Jaipuria.
Incidentally, HDFC as also group firm HDFC Bank are among companies with very high FII holdings.
The companies where FIIs have exhausted their permissible investment limits include Axis Bank, HDFC Bank, IDFC, IndusInd Bank, Lupin, Maruti and Titan among others. The sectors where there is still some room comprise banks, cement, auto and consumer goods.
“We all know how fickle FIIs are. They move in and out of the markets effortlessly and there is a herd instinct. History is replete with examples of how sudden reversals in capital flows can cause extensive damage and volatility to a country’s financial system,” Parekh warned.
A vocal proponent of free market, Parekh also crticised the government for using the divestment as a tool to “plug the fiscal deficit,” and said state-run firms like LIC should not take holdings in other PSUs as part of divestment programme.
He also expressed displeasure at no progress being made on the front as yet, saying bunching up of issues towards the end of the fiscal reduces market’s absorption capacity.
He also said the government has been “hanging on senselessly” with equity in many public sector companies such as BSNL and Air India as private companies have done very well in their sectors.
Alleging that investigating arms of the government like the CAG or CVC have “little understanding of valuations”, Parekh also came out strongly over action taken against civil servants under whose leaderships such stake sales happen.
He further blamed the investment bankers and promoters for being greedy and commanding higher valuations in FY08, which saw a record initial public offerings and said that this behaviour has waned investor interest later.
“The cardinal rule is that one has to leave something on the table for investors, otherwise they will completely back out of such funding,” he said, adding the number of issuances have been few even though we are in the midst of a bull-run in the market at present.

Equity market: Second timeluckyFPI inflow in equities reaches Rs 1 lakh crore
As a country, just a few months back we were in the midst of a vicious cycle of low growth, high inflation, high interest rates and low capital expansion,one feeding on the other. With consumer and business confidence improving, all these variables are now coming on to positive mode—slowly but surely.
