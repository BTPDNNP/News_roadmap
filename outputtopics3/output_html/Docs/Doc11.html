In his long road to riches, Alibaba founder Jack Ma says his inspiration has been the film character "Forrest Gump."
"I like that guy. I've been watching that movie about 10 times," Mr Ma said in an interview with a TV news channel as his Chinese online firm made its historic Wall Street trading debut on Friday.
"Every time I get frustrated, I watch the movie."
Mr Ma said the lesson he learned from the blockbuster featuring Tom Hanks was "that no matter whatever changed, you are you. I'm still the guy I was 15 years ago (when I earned) $20 a month."
Mr Ma became excited about the Internet during a visit to the United States in 1995 and wanted to find a way to bring the online world to China. In 1999, he convinced friends to give him $60,000 to start an e-commerce firm called Alibaba.
Fifteen years later, the company is an Internet giant and Ma -- a former English teacher -- is among the topmost ranks of China's super-rich, with wealth estimated at $11 billion by Forbes magazine.
Alibaba Group includes Tmall.com for business-to-consumer transactions and Taobao, China's most popular online consumer marketplace with hundreds of millions of products and services listed. (Read: Alibaba: China's Giant Online Shopping 'Crocodile' )
Mr Ma, now 50, gave up his university teaching job after discovering the Internet.
Seeing an opportunity for small businesses to buy and sell their goods online, he started Alibaba, initially running the company out of his apartment in the eastern city of Hangzhou.
"The first time I used the Internet, I touched the keyboard and I find 'well, this is something I believe, it is something that is going to change the world and change China,'" Ma said in the interview.
Compared to Steve Jobs
Ma has inspired strong devotion among his employees and users, drawing comparisons with late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs -- although he practices a more open management style.
A devotee of t'ai chi, he has made references to Chinese martial arts in both business strategy and corporate culture.
Porter Erisman, a former Alibaba employee who made a documentary about the firm, "Crocodile in the Yangtze," said: "What Silicon Valley is known for, he embodies a lot of that with Chinese characteristics -- that spirit of openness, risk-taking, innovation."
Mr Ma graduated from the Hangzhou Teachers' Institute with a major in English-language education, and went on to teach at another university in the city, where Alibaba is still headquartered.
Chinese state media have burnished his rags-to-riches story, saying his parents were poorly educated and his father depended on a monthly retirement allowance of just $40 to support the family.
Ma's success was evident after Alibaba's Taobao bested eBay in China, forcing the US auction site to largely withdraw from the country in 2006.
In characteristic language, he threw down a challenge to the world's global Internet giants in a memo sent to the company's more than 20,000 employees as it filed for the IPO. (Read: With Alibaba's Big Debut, 10 Things to Know )
"Fifteen years ago, Alibaba's 18 founders were determined to set up a global Internet company originated by Chinese people, with hopes it would become one of the world's top 10 Internet companies, a company which will exist for 102 years," he said.
On Friday, he told a TV news channel that he hopes Alibaba will one day be "bigger than Wal-Mart" and have a huge impact on the world.
"We have a dream," he said. "We hope people say in 15 years this is a company like Microsoft, like IBM."

1871 adding startup nourishment: Good Food Business Accelerator0
“The Good Food Business Accelerator aligns perfectly with 1871’s mission to foster economic and job growth by facilitating the efforts of creative entrepreneurs across every important market sector,” Tullman said in a statement announcing the program.
Slama said the accelerator will be home to as many as eight startups, which will participate in a six-month program, including the chance to pitch their companies to potential investors in March at the Good Food Financing and Innovation Conference in Chicago.
He said about 100 mentors have signed on. Among them are Big Bowl partner and executive chef Marc Bernard; Whole Foods Midwest region president Michael Bashaw; Linda Darragh, executive director of the Kellogg Innovation and Entrepreneurship Initiative at Northwestern University; and Impact Engine chairman Chuck Templeton, who founded OpenTable.
Whole Foods Market and United Natural Foods Inc., a distributor of natural and organic foods, will be “strategic partners” in the accelerator, Slama said.
Lead funding for the accelerator came from “Food:Land:Opportunity — Localizing the Chicago Foodshed,” an initiative of the Searle Funds at the Chicago Community Trust, according to a statement announcing the accelerator. Slama said the accelerator also received a $50,000 grant from the U.S. Small Business Administration.
Slama said the Good Food Business Accelerator won’t take an equity position in participating companies. He directed questions about fees to the program’s website, which said participants “will be required to pay an annual fee to FamilyFarmed based on the increase in revenue of their businesses. Without sales growth, (participants) will not pay any fee.”
Slama said the three main goals of the program will be to help participating companies fine-tune their business plan, to improve their market development and customer development strategies and to build a financing plan.

Jack Ma Becomes China s Richest PersonSebi Bars Transgene Chief, 5 Officials From Capital Markets
Shanghai: The largest stock offer in history has made Jack Ma, founder of e-commerce giant Alibaba, China's richest person with a fortune of $25 billion, an annual wealth ranking in the world's second largest economy showed Tuesday.
"It has been an amazing year for China's best tycoons despite the jitters about the Chinese economy," said China-based luxury magazine publisher Hurun Report in its annual rich list.
Mr Ma reaped more than $800 million selling shares in the company he set up 15 years ago as Alibaba listed on the New York Stock Exchange Friday, based on company filings, with the value of his remaining stake of 7.8 per cent surging to more than $17 billion by Monday.
Last year, the estimated wealth of the former English teacher turned Internet entrepreneur was just over $4.0 billion, which did not even place him in the top 20.
Alibaba's listing raised a total of $25 billion.
But only one other Alibaba co-founder, now vice president of its China investment team Simon Xie, made the rich list, Hurun Report said.
Property tycoon Wang Jianlin, whose Wanda company bought US cinema chain AMC Entertainment, dropped to second place from first last year with a fortune of $24.2 billion as the deflating of China's real estate bubble chased most developers out of the top 10.
A new face, Li Hejun of renewable energy firm Hanergy, tied for third place with $20.8 billion, alongside beverage magnate Zong Qinghou of Wahaha.
Completing the top five was Pony Ma of Tencent, operator of China's most popular instant messaging application WeChat, with $18.1 billion.
Technology commanded half of the top 10. Robin Li of China's dominant search engine Baidu was sixth; Richard Liu of Alibaba competitor JD.com took ninth, and Lei Jun of upstart mobile phone producer Xiaomi was 10th.
Rounding out the top 10 were father and son team Yan Jiehe and Yan Hao of road-builder China Pacific Construction in seventh position and another real estate mogul, Yan Bin of Reignwood in eighth.
China's real estate and infrastructure industries have been hit by the slowing economy.
The economy grew an annual 7.7 per cent in 2013, the same as in 2012 -- which was the slowest rate of expansion since 1999. Gross domestic product growth was 7.5 in the second quarter this year.
Still, Hurun Report said the number of US dollar billionaires in China hit 354 this year, up 39 from last year.

Govt withdraws NPPA s power to cap prices of non-essential drugsPrice cap relief for drug makers
BS Reporter | New Delhi Sep 24, 2014 12:50 AM IST
The National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) has withdrawn a set of guidelines issued in May, invoking a public interest clause, based on which it had reduced the prices of 108 medicines in the anti-diabetes and cardiovascular segment and promised to bring many more under price control.
The move followed a directive from the government on Friday. However, the price ceilings imposed by the regulator in July remain, as NPPA has withdrawn the guidelines and not the order.
Official sources said the government’s department of pharmaceuticals, under the ministry of chemicals and fertilizer, had sought the law ministry’s opinion on the regulator’s capping of prices of drugs that were otherwise outside price control. NPPA had invoked Paragraph 19 in the Drugs Price Control Order, 2013 — this empowered it to order a reduction in the price of medicines in “extraordinary” circumstances in the public interest.
REVISITING THE NORMS
NPPA had reduced prices of 108 medicine packs in anti-diabetes and cardiovascular segment and promised to bring many more under price control
Currently, 348 essential medicines are directly under price control
Prices of all these medicines are capped by NPPA at the average of all medicines in a particular segment with more than one per cent market share
For others, firms are free to price medicines
It appears the law ministry suggested the government  withdraw the power delegated to NPPA under this clause.
The July pricing order was seen as impacting the profit margins of major drug makers. Both domestic and multinational drug manufacturers have already approached different high vourts against the price cap order.
NPPA had, beside invoking the Para 19 clause, raised concern over large inter-brand differences in the market. It said this indicated “severe market failure”. To fill this perceived gap, it identified eight therapeutic areas with disease intensity and said if the price of any drug in these categories was more than 25 per cent higher than the most expensive medicine among the regulated products, then the price of such drugs would be c...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(28%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>september india modi minister pm times financial obama indian prime</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(26%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>india government power percent court bank make rs companies year</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(17%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>financial times company ft business share world year people million</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(13%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>rs cent market year india company growth prices crore ist</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(8%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>bjp india state minister party pm government people congress modi</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
