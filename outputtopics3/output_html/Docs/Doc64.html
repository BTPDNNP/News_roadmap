A final decision on the joint effort will be taken during talks between the two countries in October and the project will be launched in December. Asked if there was any impact of the El Nino phenomenon on the monsoon in the country, Dr. Nayak said there had been no direct impact so far.

A final decision on the joint effort will be taken during talks between the two countries in October and the project will be launched in December, MoES Secretary Shailesh Nayak said.

Asked if there was any impact of the El Nino phenomenon on the monsoon in the country, Dr. Nayak said there had been no direct impact so far, and the near normal monsoon was an indication. “Even if there is some impact, it will only be towards the year-end as forecasts so far have been near-accurate,” he said, adding that as against the prediction of 93 per cent normal precipitation in July, actual figures were 90.3 per cent.
Dr. Nayak said recent findings indicated that the polar regions had a major impact on the monsoon on a decadal scale, and the Indo-French joint initiative would study the aspect further. Explaining that total quantity of monsoon rainfall had not changed in recent decades, but there had been changes to the pattern, the MoES Secretary said low and medium weather events were on the decline, while extreme ones were on the rise.
