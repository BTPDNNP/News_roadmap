Orange is the new blackHow close is the BMW 4 Series to the Concept 4?
HIDE CAPTION
Autumn brings an avalanche of orange leaves to lawns, and with it an inexorable urge to add pumpkin flavour where it does not necessarily belong (Beer? No.).

The prettiest red car ever?
The preponderance of orange might lead one to believe the colour wends its way into car-purchase decisions, but paint supplier Axalta Coating Systems – formerly related to DuPont – does not even find enough orange on the road to merit its own categorical ranking . Instead, orange falls in an all-sorts classification called “Other”, which accounts for between 1% and 3% of sales globally.
This paucity of orange does not mean, however, that fans of marigolds, Dutch sports teams and traffic cones are not accommodated at the dealership.
Above are just 10 current models available in the bright autumnal hue. Bonus: no pumpkin flavouring was used in their creation.

New Delhi, Oct 30:  
Bharti Airtel, country’s largest mobile operator, today reported nearly three-fold jump in consolidated net profit to Rs 1,383 crore for the second quarter ended September 30, 2014 on the back of higher mobile data revenue.
The company had reported a net profit of Rs 512 crore in the corresponding period of last fiscal, it said in a statement.
The company’s total revenue rose 7.1 per cent to Rs 22,845 crore for the reported quarter as compared to Rs 21,324 crore in the corresponding period.
“Consolidated mobile data revenues at Rs 2,540 crore grew by 66.7 per cent year-on-year, contributing more than two- thirds of the incremental revenues,” Airtel said in a statement.
Airtel said for India, mobile data revenue registered a growth of 73.8 per cent y-o-y at Rs 1,805 crore, uplifted by increase in data customer base and higher usage per customer. Mobile data revenues now contribute to 14.5 per cent of mobile India revenues.
“We continue to see strong momentum in mobile data which has grown by 74 per cent in this quarter. Airtel’s pioneering 4G roll-out in 15 cities is now witnessing stronger customer acceptance,” Bharti Airtel MD and CEO (India & South Asia) Gopal Vittal said.
On the regulatory front, he said the recent TRAI recommendations on making more contiguous spectrum available in the upcoming auctions have the potential of transforming the industry.
African growth
Africa revenues grew by 6.4 per cent in local currency terms, but the US dollar appreciation depressed the reported growth to 1.9 per cent Y-o-Y, Airtel said.
Data revenues for Africa stood at $115 million with growth of 56.8 per cent and data revenues now contribute to 10.1 per cent of overall Africa revenues.
“Our robust 3G networks have supported the doubling of data volumes Y-o-Y, and we have been gearing up for much more growth. Airtel money transaction values have also crossed $1 billion a month,” Bharti Airtel MD and CEO (Africa) Christian de Faria said.
The net debt of the company increased to Rs 62,215.8 crore due to an addition of Rs 6,445 crore of deferred payment liabilities for the 2G spectrum.

Chennai, October 30:  
The BSE Sensex and the NSE Nifty soared to new highs on Thursday as the Narendra Modi Government once again displayed its commitment to reforms.
The markets also ignored the US Federal Open Market Committee’s expected announcement of the end of its multi-year asset purchases, widely known as Quantitative Easing.
The BSE Sensex surged 248 points to end at a new peak of 27,346.33, and the NSE Nifty closed at 8,169.2, up 78.75 points, or 0.97 per cent, as traders built fresh long positions on the day October derivative contracts expired on the NSE. The Nifty hit an all-time intra-day high of 8,181.55.
The sudden surge towards the closing hours also forced a lot of short position holders to square their contracts, thus helping the benchmarks rise further.
Reacting to the easing of FDI rules in realty, the stocks in this sector, including DLF, gained sharply and the realty index was the biggest gainer, by 3.44 per cent, on the BSE.

China at risk  seeks Japan aid: Ebola expertIn public hospitals in China, the level of infection control is poor.
By: Associated Press | Tokyo | Posted: October 30, 2014 3:08 pm | Updated: October 30, 2014 3:30 pm
A scientist who helped to discover the Ebola virus says he is concerned that the disease could spread to China given the large numbers of Chinese workers travelling to and from Africa.
Peter Piot, who is director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said today it’s not “rocket science” that with many exchanges between the two regions, the disease could spread.
“The concern I have is that I don’t think you can really stop people from travelling. These patients will show up in any country in the world, but China is quite vulnerable,” Piot said.
“The issue is: What is the quality, the standard of infection control? In public hospitals in China, the ones that I’ve visited, the level of infection control is very poor,” he said.
Piot said China’s controls for infectious diseases have improved and authorities have become more open about public health risks since severe acute respiratory syndrome or SARS broke out in southern China in 2002. SARS infected about 8,000 people worldwide, killing nearly 800.
Conversely, Japan has disease controls and hygiene that are up to international standards, but it needs to do more to help combat what has become not just an epidemic but a humanitarian crisis, said Piot, a board member of the Global Health Innovative Technology fund, a collaboration funded by the Japanese government, Japanese pharmaceutical companies and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.
The fund supports research into treatments for malaria, tuberculosis, dengue and other so-called neglected tropical diseases. Piot said that despite the urgency of the crisis, it was crucial that funds going to those efforts not be diverted to work on Ebola.
Treating the Ebola outbreaks as a humanitarian crisis would help overcome worries over budgetary issues, he said. Japan has pledged USD 40 million so far to help combat the Ebola outbreak, but Piot said more is needed.
“I appeal to Japan to contribute from their very rich tradition, in all senses of the word of humanitarian assistance.”
“When there is a humanitarian crisis, there is always money, and rightly so,” Piot said. “Ebola is in that category.”

US commando who killed Bin Laden to reveal identityPrint
By: Agence-France Presse | Washington | Posted: October 30, 2014 4:05 pm
The US Navy Seal commando who fired the shots which killed Al-Qaeda chief Osama Bin Laden is to reveal his identity in a television documentary next month, the network announced.
“The Man Who Killed Osama Bin Laden” will air in two segments November 11-12, with the commando recounting his rolein the raid that killed Bin Laden at his Pakistani compound in 2011.
The Navy SEAL “will share his story of training to be a member of America’s elite fighting force and explain his involvement in Operation Neptune Spear, the mission that killed Bin Laden,” the network said in a press release.
“Offering never before shared details, the presentation will include ‘The Shooter’s’ experience in confronting Bin Laden, his description of the terrorist leader’s final moments as well as what happened when he took his last breath,” it said.
The program would also offer a look at a “secret” ceremony in which the commando donated the shirt he was wearing during the mission to the National September 11 Memorial & Museum in New York City, it said.
The daring nighttime raid on May 2, 2011 saw a team of Navy SEALs in Blackhawk helicopters swooping on Bin Laden’s hideout in Abbottabad. There were no casualties among US forces, who killed Bin Laden and four others at the compound.
The operation was ordered by President Barack Obama after the CIA traced Bin Laden’s courier to the high-walled compound.

Pakistan has planned to evacuate at least 50,000 people from its southern coastal areas with cyclone Nilofar slowly moving towards it, officials said on Thursday.
The cyclone, moving at about 14km per hour speed towards Sindh may hit Pakistan Thursday night or Friday with the possibility of heavy rains in the lower parts of the province over the next two days.
Chief meteorologies Tauseef Alam told reporters in Karachi that the cyclone may pass around 250km from Karachi but its outer waves will hit the coast.
The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has said that about 50,000 people in vulnerable areas are to be ready for emergency evacuation.
All government offices and educational institutions in Karachi, Thatta, Badin, Sujawal and Tharparkar will remain closed on Friday where a cyclone emergency had been declared.
Preparations have been made to rehabilitate people in government buildings including educational institutions.
Provincial Information Minister Sherjeel Memon said emergency centres have been set up in all coastal areas and appeals were being made to residents of the areas to shift for a few days to safe locations within their districts.
The government has already asked the fishermen to stay away from the sea and those already gone to the sea were being called back.
Apart from Sindh, emergency has been imposed in coastal area of Balochistan province.
Chief Minister Dr Abdul Malik Baloch said his government had taken measures to avoid losses.
Pakistan experts said the cyclone will further weaken as it moves towards coastal areas of lower Sindh.
At present the estimated central pressure of cyclone is 996hpa and the average sustained wind speed is around 90-100 knots.
The cyclone will start weakening Thursday afternoon and is likely to hit Sindh as a cyclonic storm or depression with a wind speed of 70-80km per hour.
