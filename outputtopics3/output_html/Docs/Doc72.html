Rarely-Seen Photos Spotlight The 1970s Social Scene Of South Side Chicagoreddit
To say it was a different time is putting it lightly.
In the 1970s on Chicago's South Side, revelers in their finest packed into nightclubs, dancing the night away to the soulful music of the era while knocking back a drink or three at now-extinct blues clubs like Perv's House, Pepper's Hideout and the High Chaparral.
No one captured the scene better than Chicago photographer Michael L. Abramson . What started as a simple student project during his time at the Illinois Institute of Technology ultimately earned him a grant from the National Endowment of the Arts and catapulted him into a career as a prolific freelance photographer.
While several of the Brassai -esque shots below might look familiar -- some were included in the Grammy-nominated LP set "Light on the South Side," which featured Abramson's photography alongside music from the era -- many are being shown to the public for the very first time thanks to a new exhibition co-presented by the Museum of Contemporary Photography and the Columbia College Chicago Library .
The exhibition, titled "Pulse of the Night," comes three years after the photographer's death at the age of 62 but marks the first large-scale public show of his work since 1977.
Below, a preview of some of the work featured in "Pulse of the Night."

Business and the costs of independenceBusiness and the costs of Scottish independence
Ending the 300-year-old single market will raise prices and hit jobs
Business has finally entered the Scottish independence debate , kicked off the fence by narrowing opinion polls and panicked investors. Better late than never.
Scotland’s largest banks are reassuring their customers that – whatever the outcome – they will stay British, backed by the Bank of England, and if that means changing domicile, so be it . Supermarkets have warned of rising prices. A growing chorus of bosses is now urging the Scots to vote No. The future of Scottish business has become a battleground of the campaign.

Little guy gets last drink on House
What took them so long? Many companies clearly felt it politic to keep quiet, whether to avoid annoying customers and employees with strong views, or to dodge the rough edge of the nationalist leader Alex Salmond’s tongue. The clenched fist rhetoric of Jim Sillars’s “day of reckoning” speech – in which he threatened to renationalise BP – speaks to a virulent anti-business strand within the Yes camp.
Shocked into finding their voices, businesses have started explaining the cost of Mr Salmond’s dream. They should be still more explicit: pricier postage stamps, kettles or baked beans are not abstractions: they hurt.
The Yes campaign is riddled with economic uncertainties. No one knows what currency arrangements an independent state would adopt or whether it would be part of the EU .
The negotiations to decide the future of important Scottish business sectors, such as renewable energy and oil, will be complicated and acrimonious. No energy provider will invest more in Scotland without knowing whether UK consumers still want to buy their expensive power. The oil sector needs to know the future fiscal regime before drilling more in the North Sea. The Yes side’s contention that all will be well is based on blind assertion.
Now they have entered the fray, business chiefs need to hammer home the consequences of unravelling a British single market woven over three centuries – one whose importance to Scotland far exceeds any other. Some 70 per cent of Scotland’s external trade is with the rest of the UK – many times what it sends to the rest of the EU.
A new border will affect those who never stray over it. Take Royal Mail. Scotland is covered by the universal service provision that obliges the postal service to make deliveries at the same cost across the UK. With independence, this will go: meaning increased costs for businesses that use the post and a sting in the wallet for anyone mailing birthday cards to relatives down south.
At present many British retailers absorb the higher costs of doing business in Scotland to offer standardised prices. Sir Charlie Mayfield, chairman of John Lewis, warned last week that this will end with independence. He is not alone: Asda and Marks and Spencer say the same. Groceries cost 4 per cent more in Ireland than they do in the UK.
To be blunt, most big Scottish companies have more customers in the UK than in Scotland. Take Standard Life, 90 per cent of whose British clients are south of the border. To keep them happy, the Edinburgh-based insurer has said it will redomicile in the event of independence. While the implications of this for jobs remain unclear, in the long run it is likely to mean more operations relocating to the UK.
Mr Salmond claims independence will unleash the energy and self-confidence of entrepreneurs. Maybe so: but their first task will be to deal with the self-inflicted damage caused by replacing a highly-integrated single market with a looser relationship with Scotland’s biggest trading partner. On this point it is the Yes camp – rather than business – that chooses to remain silent.

Masters in management options are growing fastMasters in management options are growing fast
By Della Bradshaw
©Nick Lowndes
It was when Parul Dubey was studying for her electrical engineering degree in India that she read about London Business School ’s plans to launch a masters in management (MiM) degree for recent graduates.

Book review: ‘The Key’, by Lynda Gratton
Dubey had already began to question her future career. “I realised the engineering lifestyle wasn’t a good fit for me,” she recalls, so she applied to LBS for its first MiM class, which started in 2009. On graduating from LBS she got her first job, working in London for Pimco, the investment management company.
But that is not the end of Dubey’s business education story. Today, four years later, she is halfway through her two-year MBA programme at Harvard Business School.
As MiM degrees have flourished over the past decade, one of the biggest fears of business schools that run both MBA and MiM degrees has been that the MiM degree for younger students will cannibalise the market for MBAs. Dubey’s tale would suggest otherwise and her story is not unusual, says Leila Guerra, executive director of early-career programmes at LBS.
Parul Dubey, ex-London Business School
‘The case method has taught me to be a better listener. It has enabled me to put forward an argument and defend it in a class of people’
Even though LBS is just graduating its fourth class, Guerra reports that alumni from the programme have already signed up to study for MBAs at several top business schools, including Wharton, Chicago Booth, Stanford and Insead. “In 2009 the value of the MiM was really discussed in the school and by alumni,” says Guerra. “Now everyone sees the value.”
Though the growth in the European market for such degrees is beginning to plateau, there is increasing demand in Asia-Pacific, South America, Africa and even the US, the home of the MBA. Some of the country’s big-brand schools – Fuqua, Kellogg, Michigan Ross, MIT Sloan and Notre Dame – are among the 50 or so US business schools that already run MiMs, and others are looking closely at the...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(26%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>bjp india state minister party pm government people congress modi</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(21%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>rs cent market year india company growth prices crore ist</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(19%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>financial times company ft business share world year people million</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(17%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>india government power percent court bank make rs companies year</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(10%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>september india modi minister pm times financial obama indian prime</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
