Agent: Brittney Griner OK After Knife Attack In ChinaBrittney Griner OK After Knife Attack In China

WNBA star Brittney Griner felt fortunate to be OK after getting cut on the elbow in a knife attack in China.
Griner sustained a small cut when she was attacked by a man while boarding a bus after practice Monday in Shenyang. The man, who followed the players onto the bus, also stabbed one of Griner's teammates. She was wearing two jackets and wasn't injured because the knife didn't go through.
"I was thinking I was going to end up stabbed in China and if he got to us at the back of the bus, I was going to have to fight this man with a knife," Griner said in an email to The Associated Press.
The man was yelling as he chased the players onto the bus. She said he left the scene, and then returned covered in blood and was apprehended by Chinese authorities.
"The guy was clearly either mentally ill or very drunk," Griner said. "He was yelling about us hitting his wife and it was pretty clear he had no idea who we were."
The attack took place in the northeastern Chinese city of Shenyang in Leaoning province, said a report on the website of local newspaper Liaoshen Evening, which had few other details of the incident other than that the attacker was drunk.
Despite the incident, Griner said she still feels safe in China.
"The game the next day had more security than I had ever seen," she said. "There were three to four cops at every entrance. They were everywhere and the team said they were going to make sure and add more security now too."
Griner had 19 points, 11 rebounds and six blocks in Tuesday night's win over Liaoning Hengye.
The 6-foot-8 Griner plays in the WNBA with the Phoenix Mercury and helped the team win a championship this past September. She led the league with a record 129 blocks and was the WNBA Defensive Player of the Year. She also led the U.S. to a gold medal last month at the FIBA world championship.
"We are thankful Brittney and her teammates are all okay after this incident," the Mercury tweeted from their team account.
This is Griner's second season in China and first with the Beijing Great Wall.
She led Baylor to a 40-0 season and the 2012 NCAA title. She was the No. 1 pick by the Mercury in the 2013 draft.

Lincoln sales soared 25 percent in October, in part due to Jim Carrey's SNL spoof of moody McConaughey ad.
Bad is good: Spoofs mocking Lincoln's MKC ad boost sales 25 percent in October, making Lincoln unusually hip.
SOUTHFIELD, Michigan — Matthew McConaughey and Jim Carrey may have finally figured out how to make Lincoln hip.
Sales of Ford's lagging luxury line soared 25 percent last month after comedian Carrey spoofed McConaughey's moody commercials for the new Lincoln MKC sport-utility vehicle on NBC's "Saturday Night Live." The small SUV had its best sales month ever as Carrey imitated McConaughey's sotto voce musings on life as he rolls down a dark city street. The original ads began airing the previous month.
DETROIT (Reuters) - Incoming Cadillac President Johan de Nysschen - the brand's third boss in two years - faces a daunting task that his predecessors failed to complete: How to reposition General Motors Co's 112-year-old premium brand as a true competitor to BMW and Mercedes-Benz. ( Ben Klayman and Paul Lienert )
Lincoln is benefiting from the introduction of its all-new MKC , an entry in the hot small crossover segment, which has met with positive reviews by car critics. In addition to the marketing campaign, the brand has received extra attention through parodies including on the animated show "South Park,"
Carrey's satirical take on "SNL," viewed more than 7 million times on YouTube.com, caught fire in social media, giving Lincoln the kind of buzz it hasn't seen since the Kennedy administration. That buttresses Ford's multi-billion investment to try to make Lincoln relevant again, starting with models like the MKC, aimed at young strivers with a $33,995 starting price, the lowest among compact luxury SUVs.
"For a brand like Lincoln, that buzz is helping them quite a bit," John Krafcik, president of TrueCar.com and a former Ford engineering executive, said in an interview. "Jim Carrey was magnificent in his spoof. I haven't met anyone who hasn't absolutely loved that."
In the fake ads, a staple of the show since the '70s, Carrey slouches behind the wheel of an MKC, rolling thumb and forefinger as McConaughey does in one of his Lincoln ads.
"Sometimes you gotta go back to actually move forward," Carrey says in the parody that suggested the finger roll came after an act of nasal grooming. "And I don't mean go back and reminisce or chase ghosts. I mean take a big step back. Like go from winning an Oscar to doing a car commercial."
Ford has embraced the parodies, much like General Motors capitalized on the social-media sensation created last week when a nervous Chevrolet sales manager bungled his presentation of a pickup to World Series Most Valuable Player Madison Bumgarner. GM quickly tweeted the manager's ad-lib that the Chevy truck had "technology and stuff," and the automaker has since included the line in its advertising.
"It's fun to see how the team at Lincoln have decided to lean into that in a similar fashion to how the folks at Chevrolet have leaned into 'technology and stuff,' " Krafcik said. For Lincoln, landing Oscar-winner McConaughey "was impeccable timing. Everything that's happened since indicates that it was a very, very savvy move."
Ford still has a long road ahead to turn around Lincoln, still an afterthought in the U.S. luxury race, after sales fell 65 percent through last year from its 1990 peak. Lincoln had its best October in seven years, trailing Nissan's Infiniti by only 162 sales. Yet its 8,883 deliveries last month were less than a third of the 30,602 that BMW reported.
The MKC's nascent success is a small step forward for Chief Executive Officer Mark Fields' plan to revive Lincoln, best known in recent years for the Town Car, an airport shuttle for business travelers that the company no longer makes. He revealed plans in September to invest $2.5 billion in Lincoln over the next five years to introduce the brand in China and roll out eight new models by 2020. Lincoln debuted the MKZ sedan last year and p...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(27%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>financial times company ft business share world year people million</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(24%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>november year cent time crore minister rs nov government years</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(16%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>india government power percent court bank make rs companies year</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>rs cent market year india company growth prices crore ist</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>bjp india state minister party pm government people congress modi</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>september india modi minister pm times financial obama indian prime</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
