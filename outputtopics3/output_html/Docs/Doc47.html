WASHINGTON  — Average U.S. long-term mortgage rates arrested their five-week decline this week but the benchmark 30-year loan remained below 4%.
Mortgage company Freddie Mac said Thursday the nationwide average for a 30-year mortgage rose to 3.98% from 3.92% last week. It remained at its lowest level since June 2013. The rate stood at 4.53% back in January.
The average for a 15-year mortgage, a popular choice for people who are refinancing, increased to 3.13% from 3.08%.
The sustained decline in long-term rates sparked a boomlet of homeowners looking to refinance mortgages. Homeowners eager for a bargain rate fired off inquiries to lenders. Applications for "re-fi's" jumped 23% in the week ended Oct. 17 — reaching their highest level since November 2013, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.
But refinance applications fell 7% in the latest week, ended Oct. 24.
In recent weeks concern over global economic weaknesses brought market turmoil and sent investors seeking safety by pouring money into U.S. Treasurys. Higher demand drives up prices for those government bonds and causes their yields to drop. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note touched new lows. Mortgage rates often follow the yield in the 10-year note.
This week, the 10-year note rose to 2.32% Wednesday from 2.22% the previous week. The note traded at 2.29% Thursday morning.
To calculate average mortgage rates, Freddie Mac surveys lenders across the country between Monday and Wednesday each week. The average doesn't include extra fees, known as points, which most borrowers must pay to get the lowest rates. One point equals 1% of the loan amount.
The average fee for a 30-year mortgage was unchanged from last week at 0.5 point. The fee for a 15-year mortgage also remained at 0.5 point.
The average rate on a five-year adjustable-rate mortgage rose to 2.94% from 2.91%. The fee was steady at 0.5 point.
For a one-year ARM, the average rate edged up to 2.43% from to 2.41%. The fee held at 0.4 point.

Principal  director of Bangalore school arrested over rape incidentPrint
By: Express News Service | Bangalore | Posted: November 1, 2014 9:05 pm
The principal of a private school and one of the directors of the school where a six-year-old child was raped last week have been arrested by the Bangalore police on charges of negligence for allegedly not following guidelines issued by the police for the safety of children in schools.
The jurisdictional JB Nagar police in East Bangalore arrested the principal Vaijayanthi and the director of the school Pramod Arya on Saturday, the joint commissioner of police (law and order) K V Sharath Chandra said.
“The school failed to follow police guidelines for preventing sexual assaults on children. We have booked the principal and the director under the provisions of section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and section 336 (act endangering life or personal safety of others) of the Indian Penal Code,” the joint commissioner said.
The police had on Saturday morning summoned members of the management team at the school including the vice-president, the secretary, the principal and others. They were questioned by a team of police officers for a few hours before the director and the principal of the school were placed under arrest.
Hundreds of parents and members of the public gathered at the school for the third successive day since the rape incident. The parents have been demanding stringent action against the school management for allowing a Hindi teacher to continue to work in the school despite complaints about his behavior with students.
A Hindi teacher at the school Jaishankar, was arrested by the police on the basis of a complaint filed the mother of a six-year-old child. The mother of the first standard student stated in her complaint that her daughter was sexually assaulted on two occasions by the teacher.
Since the incident – the fourth reported from a Bangalore school in the last two months – the Karnataka home minister and chief minister have warned of serious penal action against schools violating guidelines issued in July this year by the Bangalore police to protect children from sexual attacks in schools.
Following the July incident of sexual assault on a child at school the police had asked schools to deploy various measures like CCTV cameras and larger numbers of female staff members to enable protection of children on school premises.
This is the second case in the last four months where the police have arrested senior management of a school in connection with a rape on school premises. In July the police had arrested Rustum Kherawala the chairman of the Vibgyor School for suppressing information regarding the sexual assault on a five year old child at the school.

Congress first list out  no JVM alliancePrint

The Congress on Saturday released its first list of 14 candidates for the Jharkhand assembly elections, retaining eight of the 14 who won in 2009.
The announcement also ended speculations about the party’s pre-poll alliance with the JVM(P). Congress leaders had conducted two rounds of talks with Babulal Marandi’s party, with one of the options on the table being for Marandi to merge his outfit and become the leader of the Congress in the state. “He thinks so highly of himself,” said a frustrated Congress functionary privy to the negotiations. The Congress will now contest from 76 seats; the ...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(21%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>financial times company ft business share world year people million</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(18%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>november year cent time crore minister rs nov government years</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(18%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>october year times government oct financial rs party bjp people</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(14%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>india government power percent court bank make rs companies year</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(12%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>bjp india state minister party pm government people congress modi</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(8%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>rs cent market year india company growth prices crore ist</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
