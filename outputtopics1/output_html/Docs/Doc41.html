The firm has now raised $300,000 from a slew of investors
Chennai-based startup company Flinto, maker of creative toys for kids, will partner with schools to enhance its revenue stream through the B2B (Business to Business) model.
The firm’s product, Flintobox, has toys for 3-7-year old children themed around topics such as wildlife, vegetables, colouring, outer space, numbers and others, aimed at boosting the creative, cognitive, social and language skills of the kids. Every month, a fresh activity box is created with a new theme and sent to subscribers.
A box comes for Rs.1,095 each and subscriptions run from Rs.2,985 to Rs.9,540 for three to 12 months.
“At present, we are focusing on the B2C (Business to Consumer) market. We will now be looking at the B2B (Business to Business) model through schools, which lay emphasis on creative activity for kids,” Arunprasad Durairaj, Co-Founder of Flinto said.
The firm has now raised $300,000 from a slew of investors led by GSF, Globevestor and Asian Ecommerce Alliance GmBH and People Group. Mr. Durairaj said with these funds, the firm would be able to expand its marketing operations and tap the school channel in the next 6-7 months.
The firm has also tied up with Sun TV Network, whereby Flinto will design 30-minute creative content for Sun’s kids’ channels. The firm now ships 1,500 boxes to 230 locations in India.
Flinto is aiming at a run rate of Rs.6-7 crore this year and increase it to Rs.15-17 crore next year.
