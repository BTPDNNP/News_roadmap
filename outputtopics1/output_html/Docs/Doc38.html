Techstars offers  equity-back guarantee  to startups in its program8
Techstars, which says it receives 6 percent equity in companies it accepts into its accelerator program, says the move aims to reassure entrepreneurs who may worry that 6 percent equity is too much to give in return for the mentorship and other benefits, including $18,000 in seed funding. The Techstars network includes five other U.S. locations, plus one in London.
TechStars Chicago managing director Troy Henikoff said some companies have expressed concern about the equity before starting the program but that none have had the same reservations once they completed the 13-week session.
“We want to be clear that we’re so confident in the value we add, that we’ll guarantee it, and you can have your equity back,” Henikoff said.
TechStars managing partner David Cohen announced the move Thursday in a blog post .

Driverless cars: Who is responsible when something goes wrong2
"The biggest stumbling block to any of these things is car security and also liability," said Gavin Ward, a spokesman for Bayerische Motoren Werke. "Those are the sort of issues that are still being worked out." The Munich-based carmaker has tested self-driving technology on the German autobahn.
Volkswagen, based in Wolfsburg, Germany, is also keeping its eye on the tactics of cyber criminals to keep a step ahead, spokesman Paul Buckett said at the demonstration in Cheltenham. Google declined to make someone available to discuss risks associated with their automotive efforts.
To limit hacker risk, autonomous cars will need "much more security" and that requires constant monitoring, said Andrew Miller, chief technical officer at Thatcham Research, which supplies data to British vehicle insurers. "As fast as people come up with software and encryption processes, the criminals come up with ways around them."
Aside from worst-case risks like remote carjacking, there's the mundane question of who's to blame in an accident when human error is no longer an issue. That could ease the burden on the driver, as the responsibility shifts to carmakers.
Because robotic vehicles don't suffer from daydreaming and fatigue, "you are going to have a lower frequency of incidents because these cars are an awful lot safer," said Murray Raisbeck, a partner at KPMG's insurance practice. "However, if something does go wrong, the severity could be an awful lot greater."
The change in liability could shift the burden of insuring against accidents to carmakers, suppliers and developers, while consumers would pay less. That might hit the motor-coverage business, which is worth $200 billion a year in the U.S., according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.
"It is difficult to be precise on what impact driverless cars will have for us, but we know there are going to be issues," said Alan Gairns, product manager for home and motor insurance at Allianz SE in Britain.

economy (general)
FIIs have helped push up Sensex by 1.45 per cent last week and is now moving above 27,000 level
Continuing their bet on the government’s reforms agenda, overseas investors have poured in nearly Rs. 9,000 crore in the Indian capital market in the first week of the month.
Net investments by foreign investors in the equity market were Rs 3,972 crore ($ 656 million) from September 1 to 5, while they infused a net amount of Rs. 5,013 crore ($ 828 million) in the debt market during the period, taking the total to Rs. 8,986 crore ($ 1.5 billion), as per the latest data.
Market analysts maintain that overseas investors (foreign Institutional Investors, sub—accounts or foreign portfolio investors) have been betting on the Indian market mainly on account of the reforms agenda of the new government at the Centre.
Also, they anticipate that inflows would continue in the coming months on slew of measures announced by the government. Since the beginning of the year, foreign investors have made a net investment of Rs 1.9 lakh crore ($ 31.5 billion) into the country’s securities market. This includes a net investment of Rs 82,307 crore in equities and Rs 1.07 lakh crore into debt market.
FIIs, the main driver of the equity market, have helped push up the benchmark BSE Sensex by 1.45 per cent last week and is now moving above 27,000 level.
The strong inflows in the recent months have taken the cumulative net investments of FIIs into India to $ 202 billion, while their investments in rupee terms is Rs 9.8 lakh crore.
This is based on the data since November 1992 when the FIIs began investing into Indian markets and includes about USD 160 billion investments into equities and further about USD 41 billion in debt markets.
From the beginning of June, FIIs (Foreign Institutional Investors) along with sub—accounts and qualified foreign investors have been clubbed together by market regulator SEBI to create a new investor category called Foreign Portfolio Investors.

If Your Nudes Leak  Vast Majority Of Americans Say It s Your FaultIf Your Nudes Leak, Vast Majority Of Americans Say It's Your Fault

The vast majority of Americans think that when you take embarrassing pictures on your cell phone -- something a fair share of Americans admit doing -- it's at least partly on you to protect them, according to a HuffPost/YouGov poll .
The new survey was conducted after hundreds of nude photos of celebrities were posted online by hackers who had apparently accessed their Apple iCloud accounts.
Famous people who rely on the security questions to protect such accounts can be very vulnerable to hacking. As security experts have noted , the wealth of personal information that is available online makes guessing, say, a celeb's birthday or the name of a childhood pet far too easy.
But most nonfamous Americans don't have a lot of sympathy, it seems.
According to the new poll, 50 percent think it's the responsibility of the cell phone owner, not the cell phone provider, to protect his or her data from hackers. Another 43 percent said both are responsible. Just 4 percent said responsibility falls only on the provider.
This wasn't an issue solely of other people's behavior. Twenty-three percent said they've taken pictures with a cell phone that they would be "embarrassed for other people to see," and 20 percent said they've taken "intimate" pictures of themselves or another person with their phones.
Those numbers were even higher among individuals under age 30 and those who own smartphones. Forty-six percent of those under 30 said they've taken an embarrassing photo with a cell phone, and 39 percent said they've taken an intimate photo. Among smartphone owners of any age, 31 percent said they've taken an embarrassing photo and 25 percent said they've taken an intimate photo.
(The new poll was conducted online, so smartphone owners may be somewhat overrepresented in the sample as a proportion of the general population. Sixty-nine percent of respondents to the HuffPost/YouGov poll said they own a smartphone, compared to 58 percent in the latest survey by the Pew Internet Project , which contacts people via landline and cell phones.)
In the HuffPost/YouGov survey, both younger respondents and smartphone owners were somewhat less likely to place all responsibility on the user for protecting private pictures on cell phones. Forty-two percent of Americans under 40, but 63 percent of Americans 65 and over, said it's the user's responsibility alone. Forty-eight percent of smartphone owners, but 54 percent of non-smartphone owners, said the same.
The HuffPost/YouGov poll was conducted Sept. 2-4 among 1,000 U.S. adults using a sample selected from YouGov's opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population. Factors considered include age, race, gender, education, employment, income, marital status, number of children, voter registration, time and location of Internet access, interest in politics, religion and church attendance.
The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls. You can learn more about this project and take part in YouGov's nationally representative opinion polling. Data from all HuffPost/YouGov polls can be found here .

IDBI, ICICI Bank Have Biggest Exposure to Jaiprakash Associates Debt
NDTV | Updated On: September 08, 2014 12:44 (IST)
Banks to Release Rs 650 Crore to ABG Shipyard Soon Under CDR Deal
Jaiprakash Associates shares rebounded nearly 5 per cent on Monday after falling nearly 30 per cent in the previous four trading sessions. Shares in the engineering and construction firm have come under pressure after one of its promoters sold 3.53 crore shares between September 1 to September 3 to "meet its requirement of funds including for social cause."
The crash in Jaiprakash Associates' shares clearly shows that investors are not too convinced by the reasons for the share sale. Also under pressure are lenders, who have significant exposure to the Group's humongous debt of around Rs 65,000 crore.
( Read the full story here )
According to Nomura, ICICI Bank, IDBI and SBI are the three largest lenders to Jaiprakash Associates Group with total exposure of Rs 12,800 crore, Rs 7,900 crore, Rs 6,400 crore respectively. IDBI's exposure is nearly 30 per cent of its FY14 net worth, followed by ICICI's is 12 per cent of its net worth. SBI's exposure is limited to 2 per cent of its net worth.
"IDBI's JPA exposure is close to the maximum prescribed regulatory limit for group exposure and is a red flag on their overall underwriting," Nomura adds.
Not surprisingly, along with JPA's shares, some of these lenders have also been under great pressure. ICICI Bank traded up today after falling for four straight sessions. IDBI shares were down for the fourth straight day today.
According to Nomura analysts Adarsh Parasrampuria and Amit Nanavati,
1) Jaiprakash Associates has standalone debt of Rs 25,000 crore, while its subsidiaries' debt stands at Rs 40,000 crore.
2) Power subsidiaries have a debt of Rs 24,000 crore. Jaiprakash Associates is in talks to sell its working hydro assets to the ADAG Group. These assets have a combined debt of Rs 8,000 crore. However, the company has Rs 17,000 crore of debt tied to its three thermal power assets of Nigre, Bina and Bara.
"Nigre is based on a captive coal mine which could get severely impacted by the recent Supreme Court judgement (on coal allocation). This is the only asset within power for Jaiprakash Associates than we consider risky," Nomura says.
3) Standalone debt: Rs 13,000 crore of debt is in Jaypee Infratech (Expressway + Real Estate), while Rs 35,000 crore debt is in the sports subsidiary (F1). Nomura considers all these assets as "risky".
The brokerage says most of these exposures are backed by hard assets and though there may be an interim cash flow mismatch, ultimate write downs should be lower.
As of 12.20 p.m., Jaiprakash Associates shares traded 4.6 per cent higher at Rs 35.35, while ICICI Bank was up 0.8 per cent at Rs 1,560.30. IDBI traded lower, down 0.3 per cent at Rs 74.70.
The broader Sensex was up 0.7 per cent at 27,214.

Coal India Assessing Reserves of Mozambique MinesYou are here: Home Corporates
Coal India Assessing Reserves of Mozambique Mines
Press Trust of India | Updated On: September 08, 2014 15:29 (IST)
New Delhi: As part of a drive to ramp up production, Coal India Ltd is assessing the reserves at its twin mines in Mozambique.
 
"A geological report is under preparation based on the outcome of the exploration programme carried out so far," Coal India said in its annual report.
 
Coal India Africana Limitada (CIAL), a subsidiary of Coal India in Mozambique, undertook explanatory activities including drilling of around 35,000 metres in the two coal blocks in the last fiscal year, it said.
 
"Around 15,000 metres of geo-physical logging has been carried out in FY'14," CIL said, adding that the coal samples were being analysed at the labs of Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) and Central Mine Planning & Design Institute Ltd (CMPDI).
 
CIAL had won a five-year licence for exploration and development of mines in Mozambique in August, 2009. Two coal blocks - A1 and A2, at Motaize in Tete Province of Mozambique, are spread over 200 square kilometres.
 
CIL had earlier said that it plans to form a panel of consultants which would help the PSU in acquiring, developing and operating coal mines overseas.
 
The coal major is eyeing assets abroad to meet the domestic demand.
 
CIL had earlier invited bids from bankers and interested parties for acquiring assets abroad.
 
The Coal Ministry had earlier said that acquisition of coal mines overseas should be done in an aggressive manner to meet the country's energy requirements.
 
In order to tide over the fossil fuel shortages, the government is also planning to import coal.
 
As of 3:06 p.m., shares in Coal India were trading at Rs 373.95 apiece on the BSE, up 0.73 per cent from the previous close.

Coal block auctions likely by end of current financial yearNew Delhi, September 8, 2014

Coal block auctions likely by end of current financial year

government departments
As the government awaits the Supreme Court’s decision on the mines allotted since 1993, the Ministry of Power and Coal is firming up plans to commence the auction process by the end of current financial year (2014—15).
The apex court will continue the hearing on Tuesday, on the fate of coal blocks allotted between 1993 and 2011. Last month, the Supreme Court had held that all 218 allocations made from 1993 to 2011 are illegal and arbitrary.
According to sources, the Ministry of Power and Coal is planning to auction the blocks, allocation of which may be scrapped by the apex court, by the end of the fiscal.
“The entire process of coal block auction will take at least 6 months,” the source said.
The consequences of declaring the allocations illegal would be considered tomorrow taking into account the investments made by companies for various projects and the procedure to be adopted for cancellation.
Of the 218 allocations, 80 were already de—allocated prior to the verdict. Of the remaining 138, 40 are operational with clear licences, while six others are ready to start operations.
The government had urged SC to spare 46 coal blocks — 40 functional ones and six which are ready to start operations.
The apex court has asked Centre, the three Associations — Coal Producers Association, Sponge Iron Manufacturers Association and Independent Power Producers Association of India — and petitioners to file their affidavits.
When asked whether his ministry is prepared to hold auctions if the apex court cancels all the allotted mines, Power and Coal Minister Piyush Goyal said yesterday, “We are ready for every scenario.”
However, he did not elaborate the timeline for coal block auctions.
SC, on August 25, held that all coal blocks allocated during the last 17 years since 1993 by various regimes at the Centre were done illegally and arbitrarily, bringing uncertainty to the fate of 218 block allocations and consequential investments to the tune of around Rs 2 lakh crore.
