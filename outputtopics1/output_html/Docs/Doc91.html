SAN FRANCISCO — Comcast CEO Brian Roberts was hoping to keep the focus squarely on new features rolling out to its cloud-based X1 service Wednesday but instead found himself addressing the hot-button issue of net neutrality.
"We're trying to work with the FCC, Congress and the administration to forge an outcome all stakeholders can live with and doesn't harm the innovation cycle," said Roberts, noting that the uncertainty over net neutrality — the notion that all content should be treated equally by Internet service providers — can ultimately stifle investment in new technologies.
Roberts' comments come on the heels of President Obama's comments Monday, in which he called upon the FCC to create rules protecting net neutrality and ensuring that "neither the cable company nor the phone company will be able to act as a gatekeeper, restricting what you can do or see online."
Obama is looking to classify ISPs as utilities in an effort to regulate their ability to provide "fast lane" access to specific content, which could create a tiered Internet where some information and videos download more quickly than others. Roberts said he favors the "transparent conversation" that has been ongoing between ISPs and the FCC as opposed to new regulations.
"For 20 years now, we've all played by a set of rules that have helped build the world we enjoy," said Roberts, whose father, Ralph, co-founded Comcast half a century ago.
Roberts also took the opportunity to address a July incident that went viral in which a customer service representative spent 18 minutes trying to talk a client out of disconnecting his service.
"I was embarrassed, disappointed and other thoughts I won't articulate. But my wife said, 'You'll be a better company for it,' and that's true, it was a teaching moment for us," says Roberts.
Turning to the company's X1 service, which is now in 5 million homes, Roberts said it was critical for broadband and entertainment providers to "behave more like (car sharing service) Uber, which changed the old way of doing things and made it better."
Two new customer-centric X1 features are aimed at the visually impaired. One is a talking guide, and the other a new remote control that you can speak into, recalling Siri- and Cortana-like conversations consumers are used to having with the smartphones. Roberts asked his remote to "Find The Godfather" and "What should I watch?" In a matter of seconds the screen lit up with answers.
Roberts said he expects his company's acquisition of Time Warner to go through in the first quarter of next year, which among other ramifications would allow Comcast access to the lucrative markets of New York and Los Angeles.
"It will be nice to have more of a national footprint," he said.

Kei Nishikori beats stand-in David Ferrer  now mustwaitKei Nishikori of Japan returns the ball during his men's singles tennis match against David Ferrer of Spain (Source: Reuters)
By: Reuters | London | Posted: November 13, 2014 11:02 pm
Japan’s Kei Nishikori surged to a three-set victory over alternate David Ferrer at the ATP World Tour Finals on Thursday and must now wait anxiously to see if he has done enough to reach the semi-finals.
The 24-year-old lost the opening set to the gritty Spaniard, a late stand-in for injured Milos Raonic, but played beautifully after that to seal a 4-6 6-4 6-1 win — his second in Group B after also beating Andy Murray.
The result was enough to guarantee six-times champion Roger Federer a place in the semi-finals even before the Swiss walks on court to face home favourite Murray in the evening session.
Should Murray win in straight sets he would top the group, but any other result would send Federer through as group winner with Nishikori runner-up and the Scot packing his bags.
Nishikori found out shortly before walking on court that Ferrer would be on the other side of the net, not the big-serving Raonic, and it took him time to adapt.
“It was really difficult to make this adjustment — they told me one hour before the match, it was tough to change tactics but I’d prepared well and I’m happy to win today,” the Florida-based world number five said.
“The third set was almost perfect.”
Near sell-out crowds at the O2 Arena had not been treated to a three-setter at the tournament before Thursday’s action but when Ferrer stepped in for a brief cameo role the likelihood was that he would provide a toe-to-toe battle.
Ferrer, beaten in nearly three hours by Nishikori in the quarter-finals of the Paris Masters, a result that scuppered his hopes of qualifying for the year-ender by right, hit back from a break down to snatch a high-quality opening set.
From then on, however, U.S. Open runner-up Nishikori showed why he has become a trailblazer for Asian tennis, unleashing his full repertoire of fiercely struck groundstrokes and silky drop shots to run Ferrer into the ground.
After converting his first set point in the second set with a backhand winner, Nishikori raced ahead in the decider against a tiring opponent who will return home around $85,000 richer for his brief appearance in London.
Earlier doubles second seeds Daniel Nestor (Canada) and Nenad Zimonjic (Serbia) beat Spaniards Marcel Granollers and Marc Lopez in a deciding set tiebreak but it was not enough to keep them afloat in the tournament after two losses.

DERC hikes power tariff by up to 7 percentPrint
By: Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: November 13, 2014 10:24 pm
Power tariff in the national capital was tonight hiked by up to seven per cent by the Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission and will come into effect from Saturday.
The regulator hiked the tariff by levying surcharge heeding to the demands of the three private power distribution companies.
According to the DERC order, the hike will be 7 per cent for consumers of BSES Yamuna Power Ltd while BSES Rajdhani customers will have to shell out 4.5 per cent extra on their electricity bills.
The hike for consumers of Tata Power Delhi Distribution Ltd has been fixed at 2.5 per cent.
“We have hiked the tariff to help power distribution companies recover their power purchase cost. The surcharge will be reviewed again in February,” DERC chairperson P D Sudhakar said.
BJP, Congress and AAP have strongly criticised the hike. Delhi BJP President Satish Upadhyay said the party will raise the issue with Union Power Minister Piyush Goyal and Lt Governor Najeeb Jung.
While hiking the power tariff by up to 7.5 per cent for domestic consumers, the DERC in July had withdrawn Power Purchase Adjustment Cost (PPAC) of around 8 per cent till October.
The regulator had introduced PPAC in 2012 to help the private power distribution companies recover additional cost on account of increase in coal and gas prices.
Delhi gets power from a number of gas and coal-based power generation plants.
The private power distribution companies, particularly, BRPL and BYPL, have been demanding significant hike in tariff, citing rise in power purchase cost.
The withdrawal of PPAC in July had resulted in marginal decline of tariff for the consumers, whose monthly consumption does not exceed 400 units.
PPAC is a surcharge given to the discoms to compensate variations in the market-driven fuel costs like additional costs on account of increase in coal and gas prices.
According to DERC figures, the private discoms operating in the city have a revenue gap of a whopping Rs 19,500 crore.
Official figures show that around 80-90 per cent of total revenue of discoms goes into purchasing power from central and state government owned entities through long-term power purchase agreement, at rates determined by the central and state regulators.
The city has seen a series of hike in power tariff in the past two years.
The tariff was hiked by 22 per cent in 2011 followed by five per cent hike in February 2012. The tariff was increased by up to two per cent in May 2012 year and again by 26 per cent for domestic consumers in July 2012.
It was hiked by up to three per cent in February last year and again by five per cent in August last.
The cost of buying power has increased primarily on account of an increase in the input prices of raw material like coal and gas, officials said.

A day before Childrens Day  Odisha boy loses arm working in maizefactoryPrint
Written by Debabrata Mohanty | Bhubaneswar | Posted: November 14, 2014 12:05 am | Updated: November 14, 2014 1:45 am
A day before the nation celebrates Children’s Day, a 12-year-old boy in Nabrangpur district lost his left arm while working in a maize processing factory.
Debi Singh Gouda, a Std VI student of Pujariguda upper primary school in Kasagumuda block of Nabarangpur, had skipped school to work at a maize processing mill in his village Nandpani for a wage of Rs 50. A day before Children’s Day, Orissa boy loses left arm while working in maize factory.
While deseeding corn, the boy’s left hand was sucked inside the machine leaving him seriously injured. He was first rushed to the district headquarters hospital at Nabarangpur and then shifted to the district headquarters hospital at Koraput. Though doctors could save his life, they had to amputate his arm. “It was too mutilated. We had no other option. But he is out of danger now,” said a doctor in Koraput.
Labour minister Prafulla Mallick said a three-member team, headed by sub-collector Parikshit Sethi, has been asked to file a report on the incident. The team on Thursday visited the school and held discussions with the boy’s family members. The district administration also lodged an FIR against the mill owner Lalan Mehta. Mallick assured that strict action would be taken against the guilty.
The district administration gave an ex-gratia of Rs 10,000 from the district Red Cross fund and Rs 5,000 from the chief minister’s relief fund to the family members of the boy.
Officials in Nabrangpur said the boy lost his father while he was a toddler. He has an elder brother and a mother. His brother and mother work as coolies, while Gouda often worked at the maize processing mill to supplement his family income.
Former Nabarangpur Congress MP Pradip Majhi demanded that the government should bear all the expenses for treatment of the boy and
immediately release Rs 5 lakh as assistance to the child’s family. He also demanded inclusion of the boy’s family under the various welfare schemes of the government and allot them a house.
In June this year, a 16-year-old boy’s right hand had to be amputated when it came in contact with a live electric wire while working as a labourer in Pradhan Mantri Grama Sadak Yojana. Yakub of MV-31 village under Kurukunda block of Malkangri district was working under a contractor in Pradhan Mantri Grama Sadak Yojana when a six-feet long aluminium rod that he was holding came in contact with the live electric wire. ...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(25%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>november year time nov people obama world president years news</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(22%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>rs india cent company market percent year bank share growth</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(18%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>times financial people police ft posted make friday source state</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(16%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>india government minister pm crore indian bjp state delhi chief</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>year times financial october news government cent rs percent time</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>december news year rs dec time images cent government feedback</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
