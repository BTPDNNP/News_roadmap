My preschooler wants to be a firefighter for Halloween. She also wants to be Elsa and a strawberry, but let's focus on firefighter. In search of the perfect costume, we went to Value Village: "Your Halloween destination for the whole family."
We quickly located a firefighter costume for boys, complete with a bright red jacket, a traditional helmet and an axe. The girls' version, on the other hand, is a skin-tight, short, shiny dress that's surely flammable. It includes a fascinator (in lieu of a helmet) never before seen on a real firefighter.
The model on the package, who looks to be about the same age as my daughter, completes the outfit with heeled, calf-high boots -- not ideal for running into burning buildings, or trick-or-treating for that matter. The costume is for children four to six and it's one of several provocative costumes for the age group.
Even the pumpkin costume for preschoolers is sexy: it's sleeveless and features a black bodice with an orange ribbon that laces up the front like a corset. I found the girls’ firefighter and the police officer costumes the most offensive, as they hung on the rack in stark contrast to the boys' versions.
The costumes are available exclusively at Value Village, according to the packaging, and are under the brand name Alterego. (Showing just how little thought went into these costumes, “firefighter” is misspelled on the packaging.)
Getting an early start on sexy
Halloween costumes that put a sexy spin on uniformed occupations (or anything for that matter) have been popular among women for years, but for little girls? I would be disappointed if my 14-year-old stepdaughter wore this little number, let alone my preschooler. (My stepdaughter is, in fact, dressing up as Rosie the Riveter.)
Dr. Janni Aragon is a feminist and an assistant professor at the University of Victoria. She's also the mother of two daughters, age 10 and 16, who both dressed up as firefighters when they were little girls. They wore the boys' version of the costume.
"The hyper-sexualization of little girls and their bodies, as a mother, really bothers me," Aragon says. "It plays into the sexualization of their bodies into their teenager years and adult life. It makes them grow up faster than they need to. Let them be little girls, have fun, be able to play in the playground and not worry about going on the monkey bars because someone's going to see their underwear. Something like this constricts their movements, which affects the way they play."
Sexist and oppressive
What kind of message do these costumes send to our girls? While the boys have costumes that look like the real thing, girls are expected to dress up in spoof ensembles, thus suggesting they can't, or shouldn't, do the real job. The costumes are not only "sexy," they're also sexist.
"The girls are acting and performing, whereas the boys are doing," Aragon says. "That's usually the case -- the boys being the active verb or the subject and little girls, or women, being the object."
Even more concerning, the costumes could put girls at risk.
"There are lots of messages about the way in which to get attention is through your body, your looks and your clothes," Aragon says. "I'm not shaming body, looks and clothes, but there's good attention and there's attention that you might not want. There's the targeting of little girls by men or older boys who think they're older because of the way in which they're dressing."
The real female firefighters and police officers
Jenny Reid, a volunteer firefighter with Langford Fire Rescue, says the costume is not only offensive to women in her field, it's also damaging to the self-esteem of little girls.
"That costume is awful and it sends the wrong message," she says. "It reinforces that there are still jobs that are off-limits to women. It's not a representation of the real job. Little girls can do whatever they want. They shouldn't be restricted. Those types of costumes put so many limitations on them. They don't build the self-esteem and confidence you need to be a firefighter or police officer."
Reid doesn't remember costumes like this when she was a kid and she's glad they weren't around. At a recent open house at the fire hall, she was happy to see boys and girls equally engaged in the activities, scaling the climbing wall and playing with the fire extinguisher and hose. It's the way it should be, she says. Boys and girls alike can aspire to be firefighters. These costumes, however, send a different message.
"I don't see how you can ignore those images if you're a small child," she says. "Girls should be wearing the same costume as the boys. I wear the same gear as the guys. (Costume makers) shouldn't be creating those kinds of divides and enforcing gender stereotypes because girls will continue to grow into them."
Victoria police Sgt. Kristi Ross says she's disappointed to see her profession being sexualized and misrepresented to young girls.
"(The costume) is telling young girls to be revealing in order to gain attention," she says. "As police officers, we're here because of our strength, our brains, our confidence and our abilities, not because of what we look like. Women are getting into these roles for the same reasons men are. They're not getting in because of how much leg they're showing."
Ross, who has a seven-year-old daughter and five-year-old son, says the costume is far from realistic: "Policewomen wear pants while they work. It's hard to chase bad guys down in stiletto heels."
Corporate social responsibility
When I returned to Value Village to speak with a manager, I struck up a conversation with a member of the sales staff in the costume department. I asked him why the boys' and girls' version of the police officer and firefighter costumes were different.
"Because society says that little girls have to be sexy and little boys have to masculine," he said wryly. "It's gross. And it's everywhere. We're not very evolved as a society. Will it ever, ever change?"
He introduced me to the manager, and she was clearly taken aback when I held up the boys' and girls' version of the firefighter costume. I told her I want Value Village to stop selling the costumes.
"Oh my gosh," she gasped, telling me when she was a little girl she was a clown, a witch and a devil. "I understand how you feel."
The manager referred me to the U.S. head office for Value Village, which goes by the brand Savers in the U.S. I have left messages, but no one has returned my calls.
Value Village is a leader in the retail thrift industry and its first core value, as listed on its website, is to "embrace honesty, integrity and ethics in all aspects of our business." I don't think selling these costumes and promoting the sexualization of children is ethical -- do you?
I'm encouraging anyone who's concerned by these costumes to call Savers/Value Village at 425-462-1515. Or tweet them @SaversVVillage . Tell them little girls are #NotATreat and we're #NotBuyingIt.
UPDATE - Oct. 20, 2014: Value Village has agreed to remove the costumes. Read their statement here .

Canadian Pacific  CSX end merger talksCanadian Pacific, CSX end merger talks

Shares of CSX ( CSX ) and Canadian Pacific ( CP ) fell Monday after the rail companies ended talks over a proposed $62 billion merger, dashing plans to create a consolidated freight-hauling giant.
No further talks are planned in the proposed tie-up that was proposed earlier this month by Calgary- and New York City-based Canadian Pacific and spurned by Jacksonville, Fla.-based CSX.
CSX is the third-largest U.S. rail company. Canadian Pacific is Canada’s second largest railroad operator. Had the two sides agreed on a deal, the merger would have surpassed the 2010 $26 billion purchase of Burlington Northern Sante Fe railroad by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway.
CSX shares closed down just over 1% Monday at $33.51. Canadian Pacific closed down more than 1.5% at $196.43.
No reason for the breakoff was announced. However, Canadian Pacific issued a statement that said “regulatory concerns appear to be a major deterrent for many railroads considering combinations.”
Nonetheless, the company added: “CP believes that given the right structure between the right players, and having thoughtful considerations and remedies to address shipper concerns, regulatory approvals are achievable.”
Canadian Pacific said the North American rail industry faces the challenges of moving more freight than ever, along with “the prospect of moving even more as oil production, crop yields and consumer demand grow alongside the economy.”
“CP is convinced that the significant problems that beset the industry now will only worsen over time if solutions aren’t put in place immediately,” the company said. “A pro-competition, customer friendly, safety-focused railway combination is one such solution that could not be ignored on its merits by regulators.”
Canadian Pacific CEO E. Hunter Harrison scheduled a Tuesday conference call to discuss railroad industry mergers and acquisitions and North American transportation policy.
“He seems to think that if the right rails got together, this might address the regulatory concerns,” David Tyerman, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity Corp. in Toronto, said in a Bloomberg News interview. “He’s not letting go and is hoping to advance the agenda.”
 

Why and how has multicultural India become racistWhy and how has multicultural India become racist?
Abhishek Saha , Hindustan Times  New Delhi , October 20, 2014

On October 15, Michael Lamjathang Haokip, a 26-year-old Manipuri youth, was attacked by a mob and asked to speak in Kannada in Bangalore. He was reminded during the scuffle that he ‘was not in China, but India’.
 
The very next day, in Delhi’s Sikanderpur area, two Naga youths were mercilessly thrashed with cricket bats and hockey sticks and allegedly told, “If you guys from Manipur and Nagaland come and stay here, we will kill you.”
 
These two incidents come close on the heels of another racial atrocity in Delhi. Last month, three African men were nearly lynched to death by a mob in the Rajiv Chowk Metro station after they objected to being photographed and commented upon by fellow commuters.
 
For a country as diversely populated as India — where a multitude of communities following different cultures inhabit greatly varied geographies, where the nuance of ‘unity in diversity’ is oft quoted and rhetorically celebrated — such blatant racial attacks are bound to evoke a number of questions, with the most basic being ‘why?’.
 
In the editorials and op-ed pieces that proliferated after Nido Taniam’s death in January and the thrashing of the Africans last month, commentators and journalists expressed their opinions taking a cue mostly from the existent cultural differences between ‘mainstream Indians’ and northeastern people, and political opportunism of Delhi.
 
However, the recent incidents of unprecedented mob violence and public lynching leave experts confused about a plausible explanation, feels Pratap Bhanu Mehta, director of the Centre for Policy Research, New Delhi.
“Racial prejudice and ignorance about people from different cultures have always existed but targeted mob violence against certain racial groups is a distinctly new phenomenon,” says Mehta.
 
Mehta adds, “I honestly do not understand what is happening — there is no social, economic or political reasons which can be directly put forward as a cause for such brutal mob violence. Such incidents defy any easy sociological explanations.”
 
He, however, says that these incidents indicate that in urban areas of India there exists a macabre fascination with violence, and that is quite disturbing.
 
But, Anjali Monteiro, professor and dean at School of Media and Cultural Studies, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai, offers a different perspective.
 
She says that the brutalities witnessed in Bangalore and Delhi stem out of the same idea of hierarchy and supremacy that the country has been bearing in its caste system for so long.
 
“The concept of ‘the other’ from which our caste system and religious fundamentalism against minorities germinates, is the same which stokes these ghastly acts against certain racial groups,” says Monteiro.
 
The ‘other’, she says, is like a variant — it can be the Dalits or people from the northeast or religious minorities — but the ‘intolerance to differences’ remains the same.
 
“There is a culture of normalisation of hierarchy in the Indian society, mainly pushed by the caste system, and such ideas of hierarchies, albeit in different contexts, are all inter-connected,” argues Monteiro.
 
A report by the Centre for North East Studies and Policy Research, Jamia Millia Islamia, last year stated that the number of youth from the northeast region in Delhi was around 2 lakh. The same survey also estimated that more than 4 lakh people migrated from the northeastern states into various metropolitan cities in India during 2005-10.  And, a recent report by a government-appointed committee reveals that in the ...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(27%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>rs india cent company market percent year bank share growth</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(21%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>news images feedback page enter october back recent service find</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(20%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>india government minister pm crore indian bjp state delhi chief</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>year times financial october news government cent rs percent time</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(10%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>times financial people police ft posted make friday source state</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(5%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>december news year rs dec time images cent government feedback</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
