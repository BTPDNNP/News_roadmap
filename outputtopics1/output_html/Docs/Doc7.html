"If you drew two circles, one for the mayor and one for Bruce, they'd definitely overlap in parts," said Kent Dauten, a managing director of Chicago investment firm Keystone Capital who has donated to both Emanuel and Rauner.
"As I travel for business nationally, a lot of business people I interact with kind of say, 'How's Obama's guy doing as mayor?' pretty skeptically and I say he's doing very well and he's very pro-business and pro-jobs," Dauten said. "And people definitely think that way about Bruce Rauner too."
Emanuel's decisions to close public schools and trim some city services have helped make him unpopular with some of the very voting groups Quinn needs to cultivate in Chicago, among them African-Americans, lower-income residents and city workers. The mayor and governor also have clashed over issues ranging from appointments at joint city-state government boards to Quinn's dim view of Emanuel-backed plans for a Chicago casino.
Those are perhaps reasons enough why the two Democrats don't share a podium more often as each focuses on improving his political standing. But Emanuel's muted campaign presence in the hotly contested race for governor contrasts sharply with his energetic effort to re-elect Obama and other Democrats in 2012.
The mayor traversed the country for his fellow Democrats, headlining fundraisers, appearing on national talk shows to defend his former boss and counterattacking Republicans in his trademark style.
Emanuel has amassed more than $8 million for the 2015 city elections, but there is little evidence he is helping Quinn keep up with Rauner's spending spree.
Emanuel spokeswoman Kelley Quinn pointed out that Emanuel contributed $50,000 to Quinn's campaign and said he "will continue his efforts to support the governor though this election."
"Mayor Emanuel believes Bruce Rauner is not right for the future of Chicago or Illinois, regardless of any personal relationship," she said in an email. "From minimum wage to gun control, and defending the rights of workers, women and gay marriage, Bruce Rauner is the wrong choice."
While Emanuel has taken his swipes at Rauner, they have fallen short of his traditional aggressiveness.
On a recent morning on the Northwest Side, Emanuel was asked if Rauner should release his full tax returns to the public — an obvious opening to take a shot at Rauner, who has been routinely criticized by Quinn as too rich and too out-of-touch to become governor.
But while Emanuel said that, yes, Rauner should release the full returns as Quinn and the mayor have done, he didn't mention Rauner by name. The mayor said only that releasing full tax returns — which Rauner refuses to do — is a political "rite of passage."
Bill Daley, the former mayor's brother and Emanuel's successor as White House chief of staff, said he doesn't think the mayor "helps or hurts" either candidate for governor. Daley said last year that Quinn could not get re-elected but dropped his own short-lived challenge to the governor.
Emanuel doesn't have a "general base of voters" that he can bring for Quinn. As for Emanuel's friendship with Rauner, Daley said, "I don't think that relationship in a campaign means diddly."
An adviser close to Emanuel said that since Rauner began his bid for governor, he and the mayor don't speak as much as they had in recent years.
The two men famously got to know each other after Emanuel left his post as a top adviser in the Clinton White House to become an investment banker. In the 21/2 years before he quit to run for the U.S. House, Emanuel earned more than $16 million, largely by brokering high-profile mergers and acquisitions, according to congressional disclosures.
One of Emanuel's biggest deals was representing Rauner's Chicago-based venture capital firm, then called GTCR Golder Rauner, in buying the SecurityLink home security unit from SBC Communications in 2001. Rauner credited Emanuel with keeping the deal alive. GTCR bought the company for $479 million and sold it less than six months later for $1 billion.

Krugman: The U.S. Is Doing Worse Than Japan
Acura combines two middling sedans into one competent model with the 2015 TLX0
This is a symptom of other nine-speed transmissions on the market, and it had us wishing for the alacrity of the dual-clutch setup in the four-cylinder TLX. Fortunately, all models come with various driving modes for the car, and leaving the TLX in Sport cured some of these ills.
Regardless of what's propelling the TLX, Acura deserves credit for making it feel hearty and comfortable over rough roads. It rides as well as anything with a German badge on it. The interior is similarly well-executed, with fine leather covering deeply scalloped seats, and soft materials stretching into every corner.
This being an Acura, the TLX gets the company's dual-screen setup in the cockpit. Wedged deep into the upper dashboard is a primary screen that displays the navigation map (if equipped) and stereo; below this is a touch screen and physical buttons to control the main screen.
Promising in theory, the system is frustrating. The touch screen doesn't do many of the functions you might expect, and it's not obvious which screen you should be looking at during which function.
Space inside this car is closer to that of the outgoing TL than the smaller TSX. Tall adults fit in the back seats without head or knee contact, but it's cozy. The trunk gobbles up plenty of luggage.
Outside, the TLX's styling is tasteful and subdued but doesn't offer much new for the brand. At least Acura wisely toned down the odd, metallic, beak-like grille that has scarred the face of previous vehicles. The brand's new design signature is now its "jewel eye" LED headlights, which are standard on all TLXs.
As mentioned, the TLX starts at $31,890 for the base four-cylinder edition. The highlights of the TLX's standard gear are the heated front seats, a moon roof, seven air bags, a touch screen stereo system, alloy wheels and the aforementioned LED headlights.
The four-cylinder version we grabbed sold for $35,920 and added the navigation system with real-time traffic, leather seats, a 10-speaker stereo system, lane-keeping assist, blind spot monitoring and forward collision warning.
At the top of the TLX heap was the loaded AWD V-6 model. For $45,595, it offers all the aforementioned add-ons plus adaptive cruise control, pre-collision braking, cooled front seats, remote start and parking sensors.
At any of those price points, the TLX sells for less than its German competitors, as well as the Lexus IS and ES and the Cadillac ATS. This could be a crucial factor in the success of this Acura, especially as prices in this sport sedan segment keep climbing.
Most of those rivals have more sport baked into them. And it's a pity Acura didn't mix the handling and power of the AWD V-6 with the shifting prowess of the base model's dual-clutch transmission.
But for straightforward luxury, it's nice to see Acura rediscover some of its mojo.

The FCC offers a middle-ground take on net neutrality. And everyone hates it.By Brian Fung October 31 Follow @b_fung

Compromise is dead in Washington — or so the conventional wisdom goes. But the Federal Communications Commission still thinks it can drive a bargain on net neutrality that pleases everyone at least a little bit.
The fight over net neutrality has largely crystallized into an ideological war. On one side, you have consumer groups who want the FCC to reclassify Internet providers as "common carriers," opening them up to heavier regulations designed to keep them from charging companies like Netflix a fee for accessing consumers. On the other side, you have industry groups who want anything but reclassification; these folks would prefer lighter regulation or ...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(25%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>year times financial october news government cent rs percent time</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(18%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>rs india cent company market percent year bank share growth</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(17%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>november year time nov people obama world president years news</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(16%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>india government minister pm crore indian bjp state delhi chief</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(15%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>times financial people police ft posted make friday source state</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>news images feedback page enter october back recent service find</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
