Pakistan players face contract crisis ahead of FIH Champions TrophyUpdated: November 19, 2014 18:02 IST

Due to financial crunch, Pakistan has decided to send their hockey team by bus to participate in the Champions Trophy.

With the FIH Champions Trophy a little more than two weeks away, the Pakistani hockey players are headed for a showdown with their national federation (PHF) over its failure to award them new contracts and non-payment of dues.
A senior player said the final straw came on Wednesday when they were informed that due to the financial crisis, the national team might have to travel by a bus from Lahore to Amritsar via Wagah border for the Champions Trophy, to be held in Bhubaneswar, as the PHF couldn’t afford the air fares and other expenses.
“The players have decided enough is enough and we will only go to India for the Champions Trophy on December 3 by air,” the player said.
He said the players were holding meetings to decide future course of action but they will start wearing black arm bands in the ongoing training camp for the Champions Trophy to convey their feelings to the PHF and government via the media.
The crisis crept up after a reception for the team by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was cancelled at the last moment.
The Prime Minister was due to host a reception for the recent Incheon Asian Games silver medallist and it was expected he would announce a special grant for hockey, which is presently going through its worst financial crisis.
“It is very disappointing that after being told the Prime Minister was going to meet us in Islamabad we learn nothing is happening,” another player said.
The PM is the chief patron of the PHF and hockey remains Pakistan’s national game.
Pakistan captain Muhammad Imran said the cancellation or postponement of the PM’s reception was a big blow to the players as they were hopeful of a positive outcome from the meeting.
“We wanted to tell the Prime Minister that he needs to save this sport from obliteration in Pakistan as it is dying,” he said.

An Uber executive's suggestion that the company should investigate the private lives of journalists has sparked a backlash against the popular car service, offering a potent reminder that tech companies are amassing detailed — and potentially embarrassing — records of users' communications, Internet traffic and even physical movements.
The controversy stemmed from remarks by Uber Senior Vice President Emil Michael on Friday night as he spoke of his desire to spend $1 million to dig up information on "your personal lives, your families," referring to journalists who write critically about the company, according to a report published Monday night by Buzzfeed. The same story said a different Uber executive once had examined the private travel records of a Buzzfeed reporter during an email...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(23%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>november year time nov people obama world president years news</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(22%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>times financial people police ft posted make friday source state</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(18%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>rs india cent company market percent year bank share growth</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(17%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>india government minister pm crore indian bjp state delhi chief</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>year times financial october news government cent rs percent time</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>december news year rs dec time images cent government feedback</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
