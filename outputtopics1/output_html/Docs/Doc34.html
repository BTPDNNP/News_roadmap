RBI Opens Door For Rate Cut Early Next Year

Mumbai: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) held interest rates steady as widely expected at a policy review on Tuesday, and said it could ease monetary policy early next year provided inflationary pressures do not reappear and the government controls the fiscal deficit.
Uneasy over India's weak recovery from its slowest phase of growth since the 1980s, the six-month-old government had been seen as favouring an early reduction in rates, but RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan said containing inflation was a prerequisite.
"What again and again we have seen in India, and outside India also, is that the way to sustainable growth is to have moderate inflation," Rajan told a news conference. (Read: What Raghuram Rajan Said at RBI Policy's Meet Today )
Forty-one of 45 economists polled by Reuters had forecast that the RBI would keep the repo rate at 8.00 per cent, while four had expected a reduction of 25 basis points.
The RBI's next policy review is in early February, and most analysts had expected the central bank would either cut interest rates then or wait until April.
"A change in the monetary policy stance at the current juncture is premature," the RBI said in its statement.
"However, if the current inflation momentum and changes in inflationary expectations continue, and fiscal developments are encouraging, a change in the monetary policy stance is likely early next year, including outside the policy review cycle."

India's benchmark 10-year bond yield fell 5 basis points on the day to 8.01 percent as investors cheered the central bank's more dovish stance.
Economy needs more than rate cut
In its statement, the RBI spoke of the need to revive capital investment, and called on the government, which will announce its budget in February, to "stay on course" to meet fiscal deficit targets. Those targets have been jeopardised by weak tax revenue growth and the slow pace in selling off stakes in state-run companies to raise funds.
Data released on Friday showed economic growth slipped to 5.3 per cent year-on-year in the July-September quarter, down from 5.7 per cent in the previous quarter. India needs far faster growth to create jobs for all the young people joining its workforce in coming years.
"Things will not pick up just because of rate cuts," said J. Venkatesan, an equity fund manager for Sundaram Asset Management in Chennai. "A strong reforms push is needed to revive economic growth. That is where the cycle had got stuck."
Helped by tumbling oil prices, India's annual consumer price inflation (CPI) slowed to 5.52 percent in October, sharply down from a peak of 11.16 per cent struck in November last year, but the RBI warned that it expected inflation to rise in December as a favourable base effect wanes.
The RBI has targeted CPI at 6 per cent for January 2016, and the central bank said risks to the target "appear evenly balanced under the current policy stance."
Dr Rajan said if that target was achieved the RBI would then aim for a longer term inflation target of 4 percent.
While there were few expectations that the RBI would cut interest rates this time, officials had told Reuters last week that Finance Minister Arun Jaitley would press Rajan for a reduction when they held a customary meeting before the policy review - though there was no confirmation that meetng took place.
The central bank is not statutorily independent from the finance ministry, but it enjoys broad autonomy in setting monetary policy, though there are plans to amend the RBI Act and incorporate a monetary policy committee that gives voting rights to officials both within and outside the central bank.

Cabinet Clears Changes to Companies Act for Ease of Doing BusinessYou are here: Home Economy
Cabinet Clears Changes to Companies Act for Ease of Doing Business
Press Trust of India | Updated On: December 02, 2014 21:31 (IST)
China December Industrial Activity Shrinks for First Time in 7 Months
New Delhi: Within months of the new Companies Act coming into force, the government on Tuesday cleared a slew of changes to this law to make it easier for corporates to do business and to ensure severe punishment for those raising illegal deposits from the public.
This would be among the first major initiatives by the government to make changes in the country's regulatory framework to improve its global ranking for ease of doing business, where India has been ranked very low at the 142nd position in the latest World Bank report.
The 14 proposed amendments, which were approved by the Union Cabinet on Tuesday evening, also include provision to ensure that frauds beyond a certain threshold would need to be mandatorily reported by the auditors to the government.
To address concerns raised by the corporates, the government has also agreed to relax a number of norms including those pertaining to related party transactions, while resolutions passed by the companies' boards would not be subjected to public inspection.
The new Companies Act, which came into force with effect from April 1 with some provisions yet to become operational, has faced stiff criticism for many provisions.
The new law, put in place by the previous government, has replaced a nearly six-decade old Companies Act, 1956, but the government has been indicating for quite some time that it would bring in necessary changes to address concerns raised by various stakeholders including corporates.
The Companies (Amendment) Bill, 2014, cleared by the Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, would now go to the Parliament to bring into effect necessary amendments to the existing Act.
The Companies Act, 2013 was notified on August 29, 2013. Out of 470 sections in the Act, 283 sections and 22 sets of Rules corresponding to such sections have so far been brought into force.
The government said in a statement that these amendments have been proposed to address issues raised by stakeholders such as chartered accountants and professionals.
To improve ease of doing business, the proposed amendments include omitting requirement for minimum paid up share capital, and consequential changes and making common seal optional, and consequential changes for authorization for execution of documents.
Besides, specific punishment will be prescribed for non-compliance to norms governing deposits taking activities. Such a provision was "left out in the (existing) Act inadvertently".
Enabling provisions are being put in to prescribe thresholds beyond which fraud shall be reported to the central government, while cases below this threshold will be reported to the audit committee of the company's board.
Disclosures for both the categories would need to be made in the board's report, the government said, while adding that this provision has been made at the demand of auditors.
Besides loans given by a company to wholly-owned subsidiaries and guarantees/securities on loans taken from banks by subsidiaries, would be exempted from the purview of related party transactions.
"This was provided under the Rules but being included in the Act as a matter of abundant caution," the government said.
In another major step, it has been proposed to replace "special resolution with ordinary resolution for approval of related party transactions by non-related shareholders".
This would address "problems faced by large stakeholders who are related parties", the government said.
Besides, related party transactions between holding companies and wholly owned subsidiaries have been exempted from the requirement of approval of non-related shareholders.
Further, the government has decided to prohibit public inspection of a company's board resolutions filed in the registry and would include provision for writing off past losses/depreciation before declaring dividend for the year.
Besides, the audit committee of a company would be empowered to "give omnibus approvals for related party transactions on annual basis".
This would also align provisions of the Act with that of the Securities and Exchange Board of India's policy.
Taking into consideration the demand of corporates, the government would rectify the requirement of transferring equity shares for which unclaimed/unpaid dividend has been transferred to the IEPF (Investor Education and Protection Fund) even though subsequent dividend has been claimed.
In addition, the winding up of companies would be heard by a two-member instead of three-member bench.
Among others, "bail restrictions to apply only for offence relating to fraud under section 447 of the Act".
Enabling provisions to prescribe thresholds beyond which fraud shall be reported to the Central Government (below the threshold, it will be reported to the Audit Committee).
Another amendment is to ensure that special courts would try only offences carrying imprisonment of two years or more so that minor violations can be taken care by magistrates.

Panel for Tax on Cash Withdrawal Beyond Certain Limit in a DayYou are here: Home Industries
Panel for Tax on Cash Withdrawal Beyond Certain Limit in a Day
Press Trust of India | Updated On: December 03, 2014 00:40 (IST)
Up to 7 No Production Days a Month Till March: Mahindra
New Delhi: A high level official panel on Tuesday proposed levying of banking transaction tax on withdrawal of cash beyond a specified limit in a day to check black money and was not in favour tax amnesty scheme.
A report by the Parthasarathi Shome Committee, appointed by the previous UPA government, suggested taxing farmers with large land holdings in addition to host of measures to widen the net.
"Taxpayers keep waiting for amnesty schemes to be announced and take advantage of these schemes to build their capital."
"Amnesty schemes also cause inequity among taxpayers, and there is no proof that they improve taxpayer behaviour among evaders. They, therefore, should not be encouraged through amnesties," said the report of Tax Administration and Reform Commission (TARC). It was the third report in the series.
Highlighting that there is no instrument at present that captures details of cash withdrawals from bank accounts, it said such information would help the I-T department widen its information base on the use of black money.
Making a case for Banking Cash Transaction Tax (BCTT), it said: "...IT Act should be suitably revised to include in its ambit cash withdrawals exceeding specified amounts in a day from bank accounts other than savings accounts."
"Alternatively, BCTT should be reinstated as an effective administrative measure."
BCTT was introduced in June 2005 to track unaccounted money and trace its source and destination, but was withdrawn in April 2009.
BCTT was levied in respect of cash withdrawals in a day exceeding Rs 50,000 in the case of an individual and Rs 1 lakh in the case of other persons.
The report further said large farmers should be brought into the tax net.
"Against a tax free limit of Rs 5 lakhs on agricultural income, farmers having income above much higher threshold income, such as Rs 50 lakh, could be taxed. This will broaden the taxpayer base," it said.
Talking about other steps to widen tax net, it said a conducive environment and tax culture should be created to encourage unorganised retailers to pay tax dues voluntarily.
The panel also recommended that wealth tax base can be increased by including intangible financial assets in the base while considerably raising the threshold and decreasing the wealth tax rate.
There has been increase in the number of non-corporate taxpayers for the categories Rs 2-5 lakh and Rs 5-10 lakh over the period 2007-12 but only a moderate fluctuation in the category below Rs 2 lakh over the same period.
Only 33 per cent of registered persons under service tax filed returns in 2012-13 and the number fell short of the previous year's figure by approximately 1 lakh. Also, more than 50 per cent of registered central excise taxpayers are not filing returns.
It also pitched for tax administration measures to improve SMEs tax compliance.

The One Question to Ask When Starting or Changing Careersreddit
I studied Art History in college. It was January of my sophomore year and I had to choose a major. Up to that point, I hadn't really liked or more accurately, felt genuinely interested in anything. There'd been the sociology and psychology lectures, the African history symposium, French, classic literature and a number of political science classes.
Nothing had really sparked my curiosity until I'd signed up for a class on Cubism the previous semester. It was a small group, maybe ten or twelve students sitting around a large table. We delved into the roots of Cubism, the birth of modern art, looking through a historical lens, a painting lens and discovering how the writers, thinkers and visual artists all influenced one another. I was rapt.
