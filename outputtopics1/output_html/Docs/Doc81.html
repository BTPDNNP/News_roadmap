"Because guess what? When we can look inside my son, who wears a continuous glucose monitor, we can also tell other things like, 'Hey, you're going to be sick tomorrow.' We know that because there are a lot of white blood cells in your body.
"Once we capture that drop of blood, there's a lot more we can tell you about you."
Livongo is an outgrowth of EosHealth, a Houston-based company in which Tullman and Lee Shapiro's venture capital fund, 7wire Ventures, invested in last year. Eos, which developed the technology, is now being folded into Livongo, whose name comes from "living on the go."
Tullman offered to draw some blood and show me how the device works. No need for a demonstration. My uncle has Type 1 diabetes. But it did make me think to call my uncle for his opinion.
"I think it's a good idea, especially for people who don't control or don't take ownership of the situation," he said. "Or minors. Kids going away to college. People who are busy and so involved in work."
One thing this device isn't going to solve is the discrepancy in pricing, which is determined by each person's health insurance policy. To win market share, the company only needs to ensure its device costs less than existing ones.
The 7wire fund has more than a 20 percent stake in the company. General Catalyst Partners, founded in Cambridge, Mass., 7wire and other venture capital firms invested $15 million into the company. The device was built in a leased facility in Silicon Valley, while the sales and business operations are out of Chicago.
"It turns out, people don't want to be more engaged in their health care," Tullman said. "If you have a chronic disease ... the last thing you want to do is spend more time focusing on it.
"We're trying to go for a more consumer experience ... having them do less."

TOPICS
Marking the twentieth anniversary of the controversial novel Lajja, a fresh English translation of the Bengali work by feminist author Taslima Nasreenn has now been published.
Translated by activist-writer Anchita Ghatak, the 20th anniversary edition of Lajja by Penguin is an updated one.
“This is like a documentary novel. There are fictional characters but is based on facts. Lajja has been a bestseller for a very long time. It has been published and translated in almost all Indian languages and also many foreign languages like French, German, Italian, Spanish, Dutch, etc,” Ms. Nasreen said.
Lajja recounts the story about the Duttas, a Bengali family living in Bangladesh and their struggles during the communal riots in 1992, which started when the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya was demolished.
A year after Lajja was published in 1993, Ms. Nasreen had to leave Bangladesh in the wake of death threat by fundamentalist outfits for her alleged anti-Islamic views.
The doctor-turned-author, who has been living in exile since then, took refuge in India in 2004 after a long stay in Europe. She stayed in Kolkata, which she called her home till 2007 when she had to be bundled out following violent protests by Muslims against her work. She stayed in an undisclosed location in New Delhi for about seven months till she left for Sweden, which granted her citizenship.
She, however, returned to Delhi and her visa, which she been getting on a continuous basis since 2004, was recently extended till August 2015.
Ms. Nasreen’s other works include Dwikhondito, Oporpokkho, Amar Meyebela and Utal Hawa and she has won a number of awards including the Simone de Beauvoir Prize in 2008 and the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thoughts from the European Parliament in 1994.

High-end condos point to rebounding market in downtown ChicagoChicago's downtown condo market rebounding
Apartment construction still hot in Chicago, but high-end units could spark condo revival
Most condo projects aimed at affluent consumers
Tuesday's ceremonial groundbreaking for a condominium building in Chicago's Gold Coast neighborhood was a long-awaited sight and sign, even if the project will have just 35 units.
The $80 million project, named 4 East Elm, is the first high-rise condo building to start marketing units on the city's Near North Side since 2007. What's more, just under half of the building, where the prices for half-floor and full-floor units range from $2.1 million to $7 million, is under contract.
Other developments are moving into the marketing phase as well: midsize, high-end projects north of the Chicago River and in the West Loop. A more affordably priced condo tower also is underway in the city's South Loop neighborhood.

Their starts are encouraging signs that the downtown condo market is rebounding after several years in which developers focused on apartment buildings.
But make no mistake, the return of for-sale development is baby step by baby step, and most of the projects cater to the less-risky, affluent consumer. Industry watchers predict it will be at least another three to four years before condo projects aimed at entry-level and midmarket buyers gain in popularity with developers and their lenders.
Apartment construction remains hot, although worries are starting to creep in that a bubble is forming. In the past four years, apartment developers have added more than 1,700 units to an area roughly bordered by North Avenue, Cermak Road, parts of the Chicago River and Ashland Avenue, and Lake Michigan, according Appraisal Research Counselors. That compares with 133 condo units in the same time.

Some downtown rental towers have seen exceptional demand, despite dizzyingly rents. Most of the units are aimed at young professionals who can't or don't want to buy but can afford rents that start at about $2,000 for small units and plush amenities.
On the opposite end of the building spectrum are some of the latest crop of condos, large lavishly appointed units with high price tags. They're catering to older, more established consumers who can pay cash or qualify for a mortgage, and are looking to move out of smaller downtown condos or are downsizing from the suburbs and want something new.
"There's always been demand for high-end, luxury units," said Jim Letchinger, president of JDL Development Corp., which next week will begin taking reservations for a 70-unit project planned for 21 W. Walton St. where prices will run from just under $2 million to more than $10 million. "It did get quiet because people weren't interested in spending money. Now the demand has come back but there's no product."
In fact, developers are finding they can't build product fast enough.
Belgravia Group Ltd., which took over unfinished West Loop projects before starting its own, has found success with larger, three-bedroom units. Despite raising its prices, its most recent project was sold out shortly after its groundbreaking.
Now Belgravia is trying to acquire a site in the city's River North neighborhood that could become home to 50 condos in a 12- to 14-story building.
"We keep getting calls all the time," said Alan Lev, Belgravia's president and CEO. "Something less than 50 units appears to be the sweet spot."
@mcn4165. Pay the Rush Limbaugh bunch no mind. They're stuck on stupid and will never be fixed.

DRW Real Estate Holdings' Convexity Properties, which is developing 4 East Elm, was nervous about putting no more than two units on a floor. But marketing partner @properties pushed for larger, more luxurious units, according to @properties co-founder Michael Golden. Originally, prices ran from $500 to $1,000 a square foot. Based on buyer interest, they now range from more than $700 to $1,200 a square foot.
A price tag hovering around $1 million is popular. Related Realty will soon start marketing a 28-unit condo project at 100 W. Huron St. where the smallest, 1,700-square-foot units will start at just under $1 million, according to Related Realty president David Wolf.
Eventually, once the apartment boom runs its course, some apartment towers possibly convert to condos, and there are enough entry-level buyers to satisfy lenders' pre-sale requirements for construction financing, lower-priced condo projects will start taking shape.
"It's a gradual process," said Gail Lissner, a vice president at Appraisal Research. "It reminds me of the '90s. Developers are testing the waters and it's very logical. You don't start out with 500 units."
For current condo owners, the market's dynamics represent a conundrum. If owners bought during the market's run-up, they may be underwater on their mortgage and unable to sell but easily able to exit their unit by turning it into a rental. If owners bought a dozen years ago or more ago, their units look dated.
"Right now, unless you have some vision and some work, (buyers) have to catch it right when it comes on the market," said Joanne Nemerovski, an agent with Berkshire HathawayHomeServices KoenigRubloff. "There's almost nothing on the market for buyers."
That lack of supply is helping push up existing condo prices. For example, during the first seven months of the year, condo sales on the city's Near West Side were down 5.2 percent from a year ago, but the median price rose 8.3 percent, according to Midwest Real Estate Data, the local multiple listing provider
"For the most part, it's a good thing that we haven't been bloated with new construction in the condo market because it has allowed for (price) stabilization," noted Matthew Farrell, managing partner of Urban Real Estate.
When like-new units do come on the market, they don't last long.
Coldwell Banker agent Samuel Ciochon on Wednesday listed a two-bedroom, two-bath condo in a 15-year-old building on Chicago's Near North Side, a unit in which the owner just completed a complete rehab. Listed for $600,000, Ciochon conducted an open house for the unit Sunday, even though the property received an offer Saturday that is now being negotiated.
"I knew it was going to sell really quickly," he said. "It'll set a new price point for the building."

Think twice next time you tailgate that new Audi in front of you; there might not be a human driving it.
Audi announced Tuesday that it is the first automaker to get a permit from the state of California to test self-driving cars on public roads. New state regulations took effect the same day specifically allowing such testing for the first time in California, per a law signed by Gov. Jerry Brown in 2012.

“Audi is a driving force behind the research taking automated driving from science fiction to pre-production readiness,” Scott Keogh, president of Audi of America, said in a statement. “Obtaining the first permit issued by the state of California shows that we intend to remain the leader in this vital technology frontier.”
The German automaker is one of many that have already started testing self-driving technology elsewhere. Others include Nissan, Mercedes-Benz, Toyota, Ford, GM; many expect to have such vehicles on the road by 2020.

Mark Mobius: Stay away from AlibabaMark Mobius: Stay away from Alibaba

Mobius: Alibaba's structure is 'dangerous'
HONG KONG (CNNMoney)
One of the world's best-known fund managers has hit out at Alibaba's corporate structure in the lead-up to the Chinese e-commerce giant's IPO on the New York Stock Exchange.
Mark Mobius, emerging market chief for Franklin Templeton Investments, cautioned that Alibaba's structure will leave shareholders with almost no influence over management -- and little legal recourse should problems emerge at the company.
He described the combination as a "very dangerous situation" for shareholders.
Analysts have expressed concern about Alibaba's structure on two fronts. The first is that the company's partners have control over the makeup of the board of directors. Shareholders are left without much of a voice.

The other concern is that Alibaba is listing as a variable interest entity (VIE). Necessary to get around China's strict foreign investment rules, the arrangement produces a complicated ownership structure that could mean major headaches for investors seeking to take legal action against the company.
"You'd have to go to a Chinese court and it would be very difficult, maybe even impossible," Mobius said. "The founders have control of the key assets of the company and if something goes wrong there's nothing you can do about it. This is the bottom line."
 
Alibaba jumpstarts small fashion brand
Alibaba's corporate structure was rejected by the Hong Kong stock exchange during initial talks about a possible listing amid worries over shareholder protections. Alibaba then went to New York where it was cleared for an IPO.
But does Alibaba's stranglehold on the Chinese e-commerce market make it irresistible? Not for Mobius, who cautioned against buying into the IPO.
"My advice for investors is to be very, very cautious and look at the fine print, and don't ... get involved in these things if [you're] not going to have any recourse," he said.
Concerns over the structure of Alibaba do not appear to have dampened investor appetite, though. On Tuesday, during its global roadshow, Alibaba increased the price range for the stock to $66 to $68 a share from $60 to $66, a sign that demand is high.

Saradha scam: Ex-Assam DGP under probe commits suicideComments
A former Assam director general of police, who was under the CBI scanner in connection with the Saradha scam, allegedly committed suicide at his residence on Wednesday.
Shankar Barua, 63, shot himself in the head minutes after being discharged from a local hospital where he was admitted for four days with an undisclosed ailment, said a police officer who did not wish to be identified.
Barua was taken ill after Sadananda Gogoi, an Assamese singer and filmmaker, was arrested by the CBI on September 12 in Kolkata for his alleged involvement in the scam.
“Doctors declared him dead. An investigation is on,” said AP Tiwari, senior superintendent of police in Guwahati. Following a post-mortem examination the body was cremated last evening.
The Saradha scam was caused by the collapse of an investment operation from the Saradha Group, a consortium of over 200 private companies that was running many unlicensed financial schemes in eastern India.
The group folded up in April last year, resulting in the loss of hundreds of crores to thousands of investors — largely from rural areas with little access to formal banking facilities.
Saradha chief Sudipta Sen suggested in a letter to the CBI last year that Barua, the then DGP of Assam police, was paid protection money through Gogoi to run the consortium’s business in the state, sources said.
The CBI raided several locations in the city on August 28, including Barua’s house, and took him to a State Bank of India branch to verify some documents.
A CBI spokesperson, however, said the agency had not launched a formal investigation against Barua. “Reports in certain sections of the media that the ex-DGP, Assam was examined by the CBI are not correct.  He had not been summoned as yet,” the official said.
Barua, a 1974-batch Indian Police Service (IPS) officer, was the director general of Assam police from July 28, 2009 to December 31, 2012. He is survived by his wife, two sons and mother.
“He was an upright and efficient police officer who discharged his duties conscientiously and assiduously,” said Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi.
The Saradha scam has turned into a major embarrassment for West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee who stands accused of trying to shield some of the beneficiaries of Saradha’s slush funds. A Rajya Sabha MP from her Trinamool Congress party is now in judicial custody and several other leaders are also being investigated in the fraud.
The probe also spread to neighbouring Assam and Odisha, where Saradha ran its Ponzi scheme and had either invested or had planned to invest heavily in a range of business, including the media.

25 Reasons Why Small Businesses Are Betterreddit
Corporate is going out of style. There, I said it. Ask any 18-25 year old where they'd prefer to work; a stuffy, corporate office or an up-and-coming, fresh new start-up. They'd choose the trendy start-up because it's more exciting, it's more interesting and of course, when you're young, you're more likely to take chances in your career.
So why should you work in a start-up and what makes this dynamic so appealing? Here are 25 reasons that I could think of in list form:
1. When working in a small business, you're not just another number on the payroll, you're part of the growth of a company meaning not only is your input absolutely necessary, it's recognised
2. Everybody knows that starting a business comes with some tough lessons. Managers of SMEs and start-ups tend to be more open to suggestions and criticisms than those of established corporations
3. Better lines of communication- that guy you've been desperately trying to get hold of isn't 10 emails and 5 missed calls away, he's at the other side of the office
4. In a start-up, you're more likely to be a jack of all trades which is as educational as it is exciting. A new job from day to day means there'd be no room for feeling bored
5. Less bureaucracy - start-ups and small businesses are of course still bureaucratic but they're not yet at the cold, unwavering level
6. You have the opportunity to see how your contribution fits into the business
7. Challenging - small businesses adapt fast
8. You're in good company - "SMEs accounted for 99.9 per cent of all private sector businesses in the UK"
9. The sky really is the limit and there are plenty of success stories to aspire to. Google, Amazon and Tesco all started out as SME's
10. Working within a smaller workforce means there's opportunity for a more diverse network. You'll be on first name, talking terms with everyone from the IT guy to the CEO
11. Many start-ups and small businesses have great, inspiring cultures that encourage education and growth across the board
12. Due to the passion for growth and learning, there is plenty of opportunity and enthusiasm surrounding exploring other departments
13. There are enhanced opportunities for promotion
15. SMEs have a high level of satisfied employees (Source: University of Kent )
16. There is an exciting range of start-ups out there so even if one doesn't fit as you imagined, there's a lot of encouraging room for improvement career-wise
17. If you have a dream of starting your own business, there's no better place to inspire, educate and motivate you than somewhere that's taking those first footsteps as and when you're working there
18. Passion for the product or service - with so few people in the team, enthusiasm is infectious!
19. Environment - it's often easier for a smaller business to look towards sustainability
20. Networking - the number of inspiring start-ups/SMEs you can connect with is huge
21. It's a very positive working environment- a recent study found that 80% of SMEs are overall optimistic! (Source: AXA )
22. It's an inspiring opportunity to be part of something brand new and it's an investment into your career!
23. There's a lot of space for fun, some start-ups allow flexible working hours and others even have office dogs!
24. Start-ups are hiring, there has never been a better time to get involved
25.  It's a valuable life experience. Not every job you have and leave can be considered as valuable in the long-term but in a start-up you learn patience, you learn to be frugal and you learn the staples of building a business. These are invaluable lessons that can be carried through

GOP congressman seeks criminal prosecution of patent office cheatingBy Lisa Rein September 17 Follow @Reinlwapo
The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in Alexandria, Va. (Alex Brandon/AP)
A senior  House Republican  is asking the Department of Justice to open a criminal investigation into reports that some federal patent examiners are getting pay and bonuses for time they didn’t work .
Rep. Frank Wolf (R-Va.), an early champion of letting federal employees work from home, said the reports of time and attendance fraud could undermine the government’s expanding use of telework.
“There must be a zero-tolerance policy for fraud and abuse,” Wolf wrote Monday to U.S. Attorney Dana Boente, the top federal prosecutor for the Eastern District of Virginia, which encompasses Northern Virginia and the Richmond and Tidewater areas.
“I believe it is important for federal prosecutors to independently review these allegations for criminal wrongdoing,” Wolf wrote. “A clear message must be sent to anyone in the government that fraudulent activity is unacceptable and will be met with punishment.”
Wolf’s referral to the U.S. attorney’s office follows a report in The Washington Post that time and attendance  fraud  are common practices for some of the government’s highly paid patent examiners, thousands of whom work from home.
The Post reported on the findings of an internal investigation done by six officials at the Alexandria-based U.S. Patent and Telework office after  whistleblowers  complained that some of their colleagues routinely cheated on timesheets. The whistleblowers said some examiners collected bonuses for work they didn’t do, and described a cult...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(28%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>september news china india feedback images chinese enter back sep</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(25%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>rs india cent company market percent year bank share growth</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(16%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>times financial people police ft posted make friday source state</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(16%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>india government minister pm crore indian bjp state delhi chief</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>year times financial october news government cent rs percent time</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
