Tirupati, December 11:  
Andhra Pradesh has asked consultancy firm KPMG to come up with a report on what needs to be done to make it easy to do business in the State.
Inaugurating the 12th edition of the infrastructure summit organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry here today, Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu said he had asked KPMG to submit the report within two months, after studying all the problems. The idea was to speed up all clearances and make it easy to do business in Andhra Pradesh.
You name any best practice in the world, Andhra Pradesh must have it, he said.
The theme of this edition of the infrastructure summit -- Summinfra – is “building sustainable smart infrastructure.” Over the next two days, the conference will discuss what constitutes a smart city and how to build a smart city.
While Prime Minister Narendra Modi had outlined his idea of having 100 smart cities in the country, Chandrababu Naidu said his dream was to have a “smart Andhra Pradesh.” Towards this end, he was discussing with various people, including delegations from other countries, on what needs to be done.
Andhra Pradesh would have a modern capital, two or three international airports and a few smaller airports. He wanted to create a optical fibre corporation that would ensure high speed last mile connectivity to every household in all the villages, for them to become knowledge hubs.
The Chief Minister said Andhra Pradesh had natural advantages in a long coastline with a couple of deep water ports. He would strive to create a few more ports, develop roads to the hinterland and also develop inland waterways, both for commerce and tourism.
Chandrababu Naidu said he would invite NGOs, companies, NRIs to adopt one village each and then would ask officers to go and provide the management bandwidth in these villages so that each one of them developed. It was not necessary to have only smart cities; smart villages and towns were just as important, he said.
