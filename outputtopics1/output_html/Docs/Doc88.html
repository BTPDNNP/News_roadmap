Melissa Gilberts got jokesBy Helena Andrews September 13 Follow @helena_andrews

It’s been 32 years since the final episode of the pioneer drama “Little House on the Prairie,” but that doesn’t stop folks who wished they grew up in Walnut Grove (come on, admit it) from peppering actress Melissa Gilbert with questions about what life was like on a 19th century farm.
Yeah, here’s the thing: She has no idea.
“Actually that would make me a couple hundred years old. I know I look it sometimes,” joked Gilbert, repeating a line she’s delivered nearly as many times when fans (especially the young ones but not always) confuse her with Laura Ingalls, the precocious character she played from age 9 until 19.
For about an hour on Saturday, Gilbert entertained more than 100 “Little House” heads with one-liners that belied the family-friendly wholesomeness of the show with which she is inextricably linked. The crowd arrived at the National Archives with umbrellas and the actress’s new book, “My Prairie Cookbook,” in hand and got a lot more than the standard author-answers questions program.
Gilbert’s first target? Herself.
She said of her recent move from Los Angeles to small town Michigan, “I’m tired, at 50, of trying to be a size 2. And now my forehead can move!”
Gilbert even shared a tale most actresses of a certain age would take to their graves: A stranger once said to her, “You know you look just like Melissa Gilbert, before she had all that work done on her face.” Ouch. And also, hilarious.
Next up on the chopping block was actor Sean Penn, whose father Leo directed three episodes of “Little House” in the mid 1970s.
“Sean Penn was one of the first people to pass out on set because of the heat,” said Gilbert. “I could take him on in a sauna. Man that came out wrong.”
Who knew “half pint” had so many punch lines?

Jumping red light Get slapped with 15 000 fine under proposed traffic lawComments
Soon, motorists caught speeding, driving drunk or jumping red lights may not get away with a light fine and a few stern words from the traffic cop.
The punishment would get harsher as the gravity of the offence increases — a Rs. 3-lakh fine and not less than seven years in jail for causing the death of a child; Rs. 5 lakh in penalty and three months in jail for a manufacturing fault in a vehicle; a Rs. 1-lakh fine for driving an unregistered vehicle.
All these and more are part of the new draft Road Transport and Safety Bill, 2014 unveiled by the road transport ministry on Saturday. The ministry has proposed hiking penalties three-to-50-fold  and other stringent action that includes suspension or cancellation of driving licence.
In the draft bill, speeding invites a fine of Rs. 5,000 to Rs. 12,500 — up from the existing Rs. 400-1,000 — and suspension of licence for up to eight weeks depending on how much you have exceeded the speed limit. For instance, the steepest fine is for going 40kmph over the speed limit.
Driving under the influence comes with a fine of Rs. 15,000 (currently Rs. 3,000) and a jail term of up to a year. But a second offence will lead to permanent loss of licence and up to two years in jail. The penalty is especially harsh for school bus drivers — Rs. 50,000 in fine and a three-year jail sentence.
Along with the fines and jail terms, drivers below 25 years stand to lose their licence for three months.
The punishment for jumping a red light is Rs. 5,000-15,000 in fine and one-month licence suspension. Similarly, you pay Rs. 5,000 for not wearing a seat belt.
India has one of the highest road fatalities in the world with 137,576 deaths reported last year. In the same period, Delhi recorded 7,566 accidents that killed 1,820 people. The bill aims to bring down such fatalities by 200,000 in the first five years and increase GDP by 4%.
Apart from the fines and imprisonment, motorists will be awarded penalty points for every traffic violation. Collecting 12 penalty points means losing your driving licence for a year.
The draft includes several new features in keeping with the times — fines for manufacturing faults, for instance, come in the wake of incidents of cars catching fire and vehicle recalls by auto firms.
“The bill, after it is cleared by cabinet, will be tabled in Parliament during the winter session. The proposed changes were long due as the last time the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 was amended was in 2001, and since then many provisions related to offences and penalty have ceased to have any punitive effect,” said a ministry official.
Our new act gives emphasis on E-governance to bring in transparency in the transport sector

A Highway Traffic Regulation and Protection Force has been proposed while a motor accident fund would be set up to provide compulsory insurance to all road users. A pan-India road accident emergency access telephone number to alert and access emergency services is also in the works.

Four straight callers to ESPN 980 say they switched from the Redskins opener to the NatsBy Dan Steinberg September 14 Follow @dcsportsbog
(By Jonathan Newton / The Washington Post)
The Redskins-Texans game attracted one of the smallest local television ratings in Washington  of any NFL opener in any NFL city . And anecdotally, some local sports radio hosts sensed a similar lack of buzz in their own medium.
The lack of buzz already in week 2 for the Redskins is amazing to me. Sure expectations are muted as a whole. But I still expected more.

Cannot believe there is so little interest in the Redskins.
— danny rouhier (@funnydanny) September 12, 2014
Those hosts work for 106.7 The Fan, though. Surely over at ESPN 980, it’s business as usual, with fans wanting only to talk and think about the Redskins. Right? RIGHT?
Well, Steve Czaban and Al Galdi took calls on the ratings issue Thursday afternoon. Four straight callers — four straight! — told the Redskins’ flagship station — a Dan Snyder property — that they had switched off Washington’s home opener in favor of the Nats. Then a giant fissure ripped through the sky, and Ken Beatrice, Bram Weinstein, Tod Castleberry, and the disembodied voice of John Riggins were sucked into a vortex filled with life-sized burgundy an...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(26%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>rs india cent company market percent year bank share growth</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(20%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>india government minister pm crore indian bjp state delhi chief</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(16%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>times financial people police ft posted make friday source state</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(15%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>true post false september comments news canvas watcher top display</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>september news china india feedback images chinese enter back sep</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>year times financial october news government cent rs percent time</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
