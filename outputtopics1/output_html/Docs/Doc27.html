Major ports handle more cargo in November

Backed by coal and fertilizers, 12 major ports in India handled 48.55 million tonnes of cargo during October 2014 against 43.98 million tonnes in the corresponding period last year.
Barring Haldia Dock Complex and New Mangalore Port Trust, all the other ports recorded a growth of 5.33 per cent against 4.64 per cent in October 2014.
The total cargo handled by these ports from April to November 2014 touched 384.59 million tonnes against 365.11 million tonnes for the year-ago period.
Though the Shipping Ministry had set a target of 604.45 million tonnes of cargo for 2014-15 for the major ports, the current output is less than two-third of actual target. Going by the current trend, Kamarajar Port (formerly Ennore Port) and Mormugao Port might hit the target ahead of schedule. As the port sector has been recording average monthly growth of about 50 million tonnes, it might not be easy to surpass the target, say industry observers.
During the eight-month period, Mormugao Port, Kamarajar Port and V.O. Chidambaranar Port posted double-digit growth of 22 per cent, 16 per cent and 10 per cent, respectively. Compared with the previous month, there was a tremendous variation in the cargo handled by Kolkata Dock System, Chennai Port Trust and Kandla Port.
On the container front, these ports handled 5.3 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) against 4.9 million TEUs, marking an increase of 8.3 per cent. The growth in other cargo was 12 per cent. The variation in import of petroleum, oil and lubricants compared to the previous month was 1.36 per cent.
Iron ore was handled by six major ports. There was a 29 per cent drop in iron ore volume handled by the ports of Kolkata, Paradip, Visakhapatnam, New Mangalore and Mormugao during November. Kandla saw an increase of 16 per cent in its iron ore handling.

Sinking bond yields likely to ease banks  stressSinking bond yields likely to ease banks' stress

The sustained rally in Indian bond prices has offered bankers a reason to celebrate. They, specially public sector ones, are expected to make hefty profits from treasury operations in the current (October-December) quarter, as bond yields continue to fall on hopes of a policy rate cut early next year. On Thursday, the benchmark 10-year government bond yield dipped below 7.88 per cent intra-day, the lowest since July 15 last year.
Analysts believe many state-run banks will be tempted to cash this opportunity and book treasury profits, to cushion the impact of slow interest income growth on earnings. For some quarters, interest income growth has been slowing. Loan growth moderated to 10 per cent in the September quarter. Treasury profits will also help banks make up for the deficit provisions for non-performing assets and employee pensions.
“Banks having a higher proportion of securities in the AFS (available-for-sale) category will benefit most. We expect these to report 15-17 per cent rise in profit before tax if they choose to book the entire gains in this quarter itself,” Nitin Kumar, an analyst with brokerage Prabhudas Lilladher, said. He expects lenders like Canara Bank, Punjab National Bank and Oriental Bank of Commerce to report healthy gains in treasury operations.
However, such gains will not necessarily translate to improved net profit. The declining bond yields provide a good opportunity for public sector banks to cover their provision deficits,” said an analyst with an investment bank. Also, not all bankers are willing to book capital gains by selling securities in this current quarter. Many prefer to wait, as bond yields are expected to fall further.
“The decision will vary from bank to bank and depend on the level of stress and urgency to improve provision coverage, etc,” said an executive in charge of treasury operations at a mid-sized private bank.
But bankers admit even if they don't sell securities, the stress on earnings will ease, as almost all are expected to see a reversal in mark-to-market (MTM), revaluing  at current price provisions on investment in government securities. It is almost certain banks will have near-zero provisions for investment in government securities. Provisions on MTM losses will be reversed, helping earnings.

11:40 a.m. update: We’re watching some snow showers on radar from roughly Frederick to Baltimore (and to the northeast). They are trying push southeast, but meeting some resistance. There’s a chance (30-50 percent, highest north) locations from the Beltway and points north see some flakes early this afternoon, but with temperature well above freezing, they would be of the conversational rather than sticking variety. South of the Beltway, the chance of snow is ...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(28%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>december news year rs dec time images cent government feedback</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(19%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>rs india cent company market percent year bank share growth</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(18%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>times financial people police ft posted make friday source state</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(18%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>india government minister pm crore indian bjp state delhi chief</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(8%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>year times financial october news government cent rs percent time</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
