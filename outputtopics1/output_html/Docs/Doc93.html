Posted: December 8, 2014 3:48 am | Updated: December 9, 2014 7:43 pm
A day after he allegedly beat up and raped a 27-year-old woman who had hired his vehicle, police Sunday evening arrested Uber driver Shiv Kumar Yadav from a remote village in Mathura.
Earlier in the day, police issued a notice to the managing director of Uber services under Section 161 of the CrPC to join the investigation and explain the security lapses. The company will be held liable for negligence, officials said.
Confirming Yadav’s arrest, Deputy Commissioner of Police, North Delhi, Madhur Verma said, “He had locked himself up in a small room in Anand Van, a village in Mathura 2 km from Chanderpuri Mohalla, his residence. More than 12 teams had been working to apprehend him for the past 24 hours and one of the teams finally traced Yadav with the help of local intelligence on Sunday evening. He will be brought to Delhi and produced in court.”
According to sources, soon after allegedly raping the woman and dropping her home in North Delhi, Yadav had fled to Chanderpuri Mohalla. After the news about the rape broke, the 32-year-old reportedly told his wife they would have to leave Mathura.
The 27-year-old alleged victim, who works in a finance company in Gurgaon, had approached the police early Saturday morning.
“We raided his house where he stayed with his wife and two daughters and a son, but he had fled by then. His family was questioned about his whereabouts but they did not reveal anything. We were then told he was hiding in a gurdwara in the village. Several places were raided, several leads were collected but we could not reach him,” police said.
It was only Sunday evening, after police had announced a reward of Rs 1 lakh for anyone giving any information on Yadav’s whereabouts, that a person approached them with a tip-off, said ACP, Kotwali, Devesh Kumar and ACP, Operations, Subhash Tandon.
“The informer told us that Yadav was hiding in Anand Van. A team immediately left for the location. Yadav saw us and started running. He entered a house and locked it from inside, and started throwing things around to stop us. Police however broke open the door and apprehended him around 7 pm,” a source said.
After apprehending the driver, the team took his photograph and sent it to senior officers so that they could match it with the photograph of Yadav they had.
No verification, no GPS: Police
According to Madhur Verma, DCP (North), the driver and the vehicle involved in the incident were part of Uber’s newly-launched low-cost cab-booking service. Police have listed some norms and guidelines that may have been flouted:
# The driver did not undergo the mandatory police verification, and a background check was not conducted by the company.
# He did not have a driving licence issued by the Delhi Transport Authority, which is recommended for those engaged in driving cabs in the capital.
# Instead of a mandatory GPS system, the only link with the driver was an application that he had downloaded on the phone he was using.
“Every violation by Uber will be evaluated and we will go for legal recourse,” said DCP (North) Verma, saying police would take legal advice before opting to press a criminal or civil case.
Uber has faced critical news coverage over its driver screening in the United States, and has apologised for comments by an executive who suggested “digging up dirt” on journalists investigating the firm.
That has not stopped the San Francisco-based firm from raising investment that values it at $40 billion, reflecting the perceived potential of its expansion into high-growth markets like India.
Uber said in a statement on Sunday that it had suspended the driver following the allegations, in line with company policy, and have provided the authorities with “all relevant details,” such as driver, vehicle and trip information.
“Safety is Uber’s highest priority and in India, we work with licenced driver-partners to provide a safe transportation option, with layers of safeguards such as driver and vehicle information, and ETA-sharing to ensure there is accountability and traceability of all trips that occur on the Uber platform,” said Evelyn Tay, an Uber spokeswoman.

RJD president Lalu Prasad Yadav and SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav all set to establish familytiesBy: Press Trust of India | Lucknow |
Posted: December 6, 2014 9:33 pm | Updated: December 7, 2014 8:01 pm
After having joined hands with each other politically, SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav and RJD president Lalu Prasad Yadav are all set to establish family ties. Lalu’s youngest daughter Raj Laksmhi is marrying Mulayam’s grandson and MP Tej Pratap Singh, sources said.
Lalu and his wife Rabri Devi, both former chief ministers of Bihar are coming to Lucknow on Sunday to perform a pre-engagement ceremony. The event will start with a ‘shagun’ ceremony at Mulayam’s residence, they said.
Lalu and Rabri would be accompanied by their son Tejaswi, eldest daughter Misa and other relatives, sources said.
On Mulayam’s side, CM Akhilesh Yadav, SP national general secretary Ram Gopal Yadav, senior cabinet minister Shivpal Singh Yadav and other family members would be present. A grand ring ceremony is scheduled in Delhi on December 16.
The two Yadavs are in the forefront of consolidation of opposition forces, bringing six constituents of the erstwhile ‘Janata Parivar’ under the banner of one party.
These parties include SP, Janata Dal (Secular), Rashtriya Janata Dal, Janata Dal (United), Indian National Lok Dal and Samajwadi Janata Party.

More US troops than planned to stay in Afghanistan:HagelBy: Associated Press | Kabul |
Posted: December 6, 2014 10:08 pm
U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said Saturday the United States will keep as many as 1,000 more troops in Afghanistan than planned for the first part of 2015.
At a news conference at the presidential palace with President Ashraf Ghani, Hagel said the original plan to cut U.S. troop levels to 9,800 by the end of this year had been abandoned, but not because of a recent surge in Taliban attacks.
Hagel said the U.S. will keep up to 10,800 troops for the first few months of next year and then restart the drawdown, which is scheduled to reach 5,500 troops by the end of 2015.
The U.S. decided to keep additional forces in the country temporarily because planned troop commitments by U.S. allies for a NATO train-and-assist mission starting in January have been slow to materialize.
President Barack Obama “has provided U.S. military commanders the flexibility to manage any temporary force shortfall that we might experience for a few months as we allow for coalition troops to arrive in theater,” he said. “But the president’s authorization will not change our troops’ missions, or the long-term timeline for our drawdown,” he added.
On his final visit to Afghanistan as U.S. defense secretary, Hagel said with striking optimism that he believes Afghans will successfully put down a surge in Taliban attacks in the capital and stabilize the nation.
Hagel arrived in Kabul on a previously unannounced trip one day after Obama declared he would nominate one of Hagel’s former deputies, Ashton Carter, to succeed Hagel, who resigned under pressure on November 24.
In an interview with reporters traveling with him from Washington aboard a military aircraft, Hagel was in a reflective mood about America’s longest war. He recalled arriving in Kabul in January 2002 as a member of a congressional delegation when security was so dicey that the lawmakers arrived under cover of darkness and left before dawn. Hagel at the time was a Republican senator from Nebraska.
The Taliban, which had ruled Afghanistan since 1996, were forced from power in late 2001 just weeks after a U.S.-led invasion prompted by the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
But they recovered gradually after the U.S. shifted its military focus to Iraq in 2003, and by 2008 the U.S. was conceding that the war in Afghanistan was stalemated. Hagel, on his fourth trip to Afghanistan as defense secretary, said it should not be surprising that the Taliban are still able to launch significant attacks in the capital.
“The Taliban are going to continue to have pockets of resurgence, and it’s predictable that they would do everything they possibly could to disrupt” the new Afghan government under Ghani and Chief Executive Officer Abdullah Abdullah, Hagel said.
The Taliban clearly are aiming continued…

Ex-Noida Authority Chairman Yadav Singh on blackmoney SITradarBy: Press Trust of India | New Delhi |
Posted: December 6, 2014 10:26 pm
Controversial Noida Authority official Yadav Singh, accused of amassing illegal wealth, has come under the scanner of the Special Investigation Team (SIT) on blackmoney as it on Saturday asked the CBDT to share information with ED so that money laundering charges could be pressed against him and his associates.
SIT Chairman Justice (retd) M B Shah and Vice-Chairman Justice (retd) Arijit Pasayat held a meeting and reviewed the case with CBDT officials led by Chairperson Anita Kapur and I-T officers from the investigations directorate in Lucknow who had carried out extensive raids last month on Singh’s premises and a number of companies with which his wife is believed to be associated with.
After the meeting, the SIT asked the Director General (I-T investigations) Lucknow to share information of this case with the Enforcement Directorate so that Yadav could also be investigated under the criminal provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).
The SIT, according to sources, has taken this case of alleged tax evasion seriously and it suspects generation of a huge amount of illegal funds in the capital, in which the I-T department has already seized huge cash and is scrutinising voluminous documents of real estate projects being executed by Yadav in the national capital region.
According to an official statement issued by the Finance Ministry, the SIT after the meeting, also asked Kapur to personally monitor the probe in the case.
I-T searches on the premises of Yadav and his wife last month had led to the recovery of huge cash, two kg gold and diamond jewellery even as the department has brought under its scanner over a dozen bank accounts of the duo and private firms operated by them.
“As the search (on Singh) is being conducted by Director General Lucknow, it was directed that Chairperson CBDT would monitor the search, seizure and further appropriate proceedings against Yadav Singh and other connected persons.
“DG and search officer (of the case) shall convey the information to the Director of the Enforcement Directorate to take appropriate action and to investigate the matter further from the angle of money laundering. Thereafter, SIT would further monitor the investigations,” the statement said.

Champions Trophy Hockey: Germany grab last-gasp winner to downIndiaBy: Press Trust of India | Bhubaneshwar |

Goalkeeper P R Sreejesh’s magnificent effort went in vain as Olympic champions Germany scored a late goal to beat hosts India in their opening Pool B match of the Champions Trophy at a packed Kalinga Stadium.
If not for Sreejesh, the margin of defeat for India could have been higher as the Kerala custodian made innumerable number of saves to keep India in the match.
But an error of judgment in the final minute of the game cost Sreejesh and India, a point, as Florian Fuchs was quick to pounce on the opportunity and score the winner.
Sreejesh rushed to tackle an onrushing Fuchs but he mistimed his jump and then the German striker kept his cool
and turned the ball around Sreejesh before putting it into the net with a reverse hit just 34 seconds from the final hooter.
It was tipped as the most high-profile match of the evening but it was the Germans, who dominated the proceedings and created chances galore.
The Indians played well in patches but it was their defence, which felt the heat of continuous raids from the Germans, who had the better share of chances in the first quarter.
The reigning Olympic champions earned two quick penalty corners inside the opening 10 minutes, the second of which resulted in a penalty stroke for the Germans as the umpire thought the flick struck on rushing S K Uthappa’s hand. The Indians immediately objected and went for the referral which they won.
In the final minute of the opening quarter India got a golden chance to take the lead when they earned their first penalty corner of the match but Gurjinder Singh’s grounded flick was saved by Nicolas Jacobi in the German goal.
The two teams kept up the pace and created chances in the second quarter but it was Germany who had the better share of exchanges.
Sreejesh lived upto his reputation and denied the Germans on at least two occasions in the second quarter.
He first denied Christopher Ruhr’s try before he kept at bay Martin Zwicker’s forehand shot from top of the circle in the 25th minute to keep a clean slate at the breather.
The Germans came out attacking after the change of ends and secured their third penalty corner soon but once again they found a rock in front of Indian goal in Sreejesh. The Indian custodian made an acrobatic save to keep away Moritz Furste’s powerful high drag-flick.
India mounted some good attacks but their forwards, especially Ramandeep Singh and Nikkin Thimmaiah fizzled out once inside the striking circle. Both the strikers looked poor in their anticipation and reflex.
Sardar too had a chance to break his goal drought when Dharamvir Singh’s pass found him alone inside the circle but the Indian skipper failed to gather the ball with an onrushing continued…

Discarded veterans -- Kamran Akmal and Shoaib Malik -- and suspended off spinner Saeed Ajmal have been named in Pakistan’s preliminary squad of 30 players for the World Cup 2015.
Ajmal has made the squad despite being suspended from bowling in international cricket by the International Cricket Council since September this year.
“Saeed has been retained because there is still a month before teams have to submit their final 15 member squads to the ICC,” a PCB official said.
“Saeed is in the process of working to correct his action and he has already shown a lot of improvement in his modified action. He will soon be sent for an official test to confirm whether he can resume bowling in international cricket,” the official said.
The selectors have also kept their options open for wicketkeeper Kamran and Malik who have been out of favour since appearing in the World Twenty20 Cup in Bangladesh.
They have retained left arm pacer Junaid Khan in the preliminary squad although he is still struggling to recover from a knee injury.
Junaid, one of Pakistan’s leading bowlers before he had to returned home midway through the Australian series from the UAE, has been advised a rigorous rehabilitation process to recover from the knee problem.
Chief selector Moin Khan said while announcing the preliminary squad that Junaid holds immense potential and promise to perform in any conditions.
“The most positive aspect is that some of our foremost proven talents have overcome physical issues and are raring to be given an opportunity,” he said in a statement.
Participating countries have to finalise their 15-member squads for the World Cup by January 7, 2015.
Pakistan preliminary squad:
