UGC member attacks Smriti IraniAfter Christmas in school holiday row, Narendra Modi govt backtracks
University Grants Commission (UGC) Member M M Ansari yesterday hit out at HRD Minister Smriti Irani accusing her of “abruptly” discontinuing mid-session teaching of German language in Central schools and said her tenure so far as been “far from satisfactory”.
He said he was not bothered about the possible fallout of his open outburst against Irani as “everyone is concerned about the performance of the Ministry but nobody is talking about it”.
The minister’s office refused to comment on his allegations.
Ansari said she has failed to announce a single scheme or measure that will strengthen the education sector or carry out institutional reforms that will impact the quality of education.
“All that she has done is announcement of new institutes and scholarship programmes that are discriminatory in nature and will further burden the system facing shortage of faculty and quality.
“Judging by her performance, nothing much is happening….it has been far from satisfactory,” he said.
In this context, he recalled a statement by Irani during the row over her educational qualification that the country will judge her by her performance.
Ansari, who had earlier been critical of the way the Ministry directed University Grants Commission (UGC) to rollback the controversial ‘four year undergraduate programme’ of Delhi University, maintained that a similar stand was taken to discontinue the German programme mid-session.
“You could have done it (to discontinue) but it has to have its own timings,” he said, underlining the difficulties faced by students following the decision.

Investor wealth grows 10 times in a decade
Market capitalisation of all listed companies on Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), Asia first stock exchange, reached historic milestone of Rs. 100 lakh crore-mark on Friday for the first time.
The landmark level was reached in early morning trades when the market capitalisation (m-cap) touched Rs.100.01 lakh crore. However it slipped marginally below that level to close at Rs. 99,81,572 crore.
The benchmark 30-share Sensitive Index (Sensex) closed at 28693.99 with a gain of 255.08 points or 0.90 per cent. It touched an intra-day high of 28822.37, a record high surpassing the previous high of 28541.96 on November 24.
This achievement is a reflection of India's growth potential as seen from the foreign investor’s perspective as well as the competitiveness of Indian entrepreneurs to manage world class organisations, said Ashishkumar Chauhan, MD & CEO, BSE.
“How do we use stock market as a tool for catalysing industrial activity and create 30 crore new jobs over the next 20 years. Job creation is the most pressing issue India needs to resolve in the next 20 years. Stock markets can play a huge role in job creation”, said Mr. Chauhan, while talking to The Hindu.
“It has taken India and BSE 140 years to reach this milestone of Rs.100 lakh crore market capitalisation. However, given India's potential, the country should be able to achieve multiple times Rs. 100 lakh crore market capitalisation in time to come. In that sense, India has a long way to go on the path of job creation and wealth creation” Mr. Chauhan added.
