Written by Sreenivas Janyala | Hyderabad | Posted: November 2, 2014 5:21 pm
The involvement of election managers of several political leaders in a spurious liquor racket is being investigated after a CID investigation
found that campaign agents had placed orders for several truckloads of spurious and cheap liquor to be distributed to voters in Kadapa,
Chittor, Anantapur, Nellore, Prakasam and Guntur districts during the general and local body elections in April and May this year.
The State Excise Department had seized some consignments of spurious liquor and booked several cases during the elections. However, they were unable to trace the origin of the cartons of liquor as they had changed several hands before being smuggled into Andhra Pradesh.
“In order to know the source of the non-duty paid cheap liquor and to catch the main suppliers, the Andhra Pradesh Government had ordered a
CID inquiry and the all the spurious liquor cases were transferred from Excise Department to CID. The CID took over 32 such cases and
during the investigation found that the cheap liquor originated in Goa and was transported through Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Pondicherry into AP by interstate bootleggers operating in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka.
The consignments changed hands several times and truck drivers also changed frequently,’’ an official said. A Special Investigation Team of CID arrested Rajendra Nirmal Kumar of Bengaluru, who they claim is the kingpin of interstate liquor suppliers, and works on commission basis. Kumar confessed to having sent 10 truck loads of spurious liquor and was helped in procuring and transporting it from Goa by Krishna Swamy of Chennai and Parthasaradhi Suresh of Pondicherry.
Kumar claimed that the liquor was ordered by agents of political parties during the elections. Kumar was produced before a court in
Nellore on Friday and remanded into police custody.
“Kumar is involved in 10 out of 11 cases of Nellore district. He also admitted that the spurious liquor was manufactured in certain distilleries
located in Goa. He conspired with suppliers and commission agents in Chennai and Pondicherry and supplied truckloads of illicit liquor to
political leaders in AP during elections,’’ an official said.
The CID unit at Tirupati also arrested E Vijay Kumar, a Prohibition and Excise Department sub-inspector posted at Chittor, and Govind
Sankaraiah, a retired Excise Department Head Constable, and a bootlegger B Srinivasulu Reddy of Rayachoti, Kadapa district.
The Excise officials connived with the main suppliers and also helped the bootlegger B Srinivasulu Reddy procure two truckloads of liquor, each
truck carrying 600 cartons, from Goa and Bengaluru which was distributed through liquor shops in Rayachoti in Kadapa. The Election
Commission had declared that 1.44 crore litres of liquor was seized in undivided Andhra Pradesh during the elections.

Scotland to become independent within 20 ye...Scotland to become independent "within 20 years", says defeated nationalist leader

In September, 55 per cent of Scots voted to reject independence in a historic referendum after Britain's three main UK-wide parties promised to grant greater devolution to Scotland in the event of a "No" vote.
ET SPECIAL:
Save precious time tracking your investments
LONDON: Scotland will break away from the United Kingdom within 20 years, the defeated leader of the Scots nationalists predicted on Sunday, after a poll showed a majority of voters would back independence if another referendum were held today.
In September, 55 per cent of Scots voted to reject independence in a historic referendum after Britain's three main UK-wide parties promised to grant greater devolution to Scotland in the event of a "No" vote.
But in a surprise poll on Saturday, 52 per cent of those asked said they would now vote for a breakaway.
Disagreements over how much more power Scotland will get and over separate proposals to stop non-English lawmakers voting on matters that concern England in the British parliament have clouded the referendum's aftermath, with the Scottish Nationalist Party (SNP) accusing other parties of backsliding.
Alex Salmond, the SNP's outgoing leader who unsuccessfully spearheaded the independence campaign, said on Sunday the desire for change was so strong, even among those who voted no, that independence was now inevitable.
Asked if he thought Scotland would become independent in the next 10 or 20 years, Salmond said "Yes".
"The destination is set. But the number of stops along the way and the exact timetable I think that's to be determined," he said. "It will actually be determined by the Scottish people."
The SNP lost the referendum but has bounced back and its ratings remain high. A poll last Thursday showed 52 percent of voters planned to vote for the pro-independence party in a UK-wide election in May next year.
By contrast, the opposition Labour party, which campaigned against independence, faced a wipe-out in its traditional stronghold of Scotland, the same poll showed, raising doubts about the left-leaning party's ability to unseat Prime Minister David Cameron's Conservatives.
With the May 2015 election shaping up to be the closest in modern British political history and neither Cameron's Conservatives nor Labour currently looking like they can win an outright majority, the winner may need to rely on support from other parties.
Salmond on Sunday ruled out a coalition with the Conservatives saying there was "no chance whatsoever" of such a tie-up. He said an alliance with Labour was "unlikely" but said circumstances could change.
ANOTHER REFERENDUM?
Nicola Sturgeon, who will take over as SNP leader from Salmond, said widespread distrust of promises of greater Scottish devolution coupled with a desire for change were fuelling a continued appetite for full-blown independence.
"There is a very, very strong mood for change in Scotland," Sturgeon told Sky News.
"If you take the 45 percent of people who voted yes in September and add to that the many people who voted no but did so on the promise of significant more powers for the Scottish parliament then what you have is a majority, arguably a very strong majority in Scotland for substantial change."
Sturgeon has hinted her party might push for another independence referendum as early as 2017 if a European Union membership referendum promised by Cameron takes place and results in a British EU exit.
Most Scots would like to remain inside the 28-nation bloc but Euroscepticism is on the rise in England where the anti-EU UK Independence Party (UKIP) won its first seat in parliament last month.
That sets the stage for a potential political and constitutional tussle if different parts of the United Kingdom vote in different ways in an EU membership referendum which could reopen the Scottish question.
Given that less than two months have passed since Scots rejected independence by a 10 point margin after a lengthy campaign some of the SNP's opponents believe it is getting ahead of itself.
"Listening to the political debate in Scotland in recent weeks, it's as if the referendum result had turned out on a yes vote," Jim Murphy, a Labour lawmaker in the British parliament and a candidate to lead the party in Scotland, said.
"It was a two-horse race. It wasn't even close, there were two million people and more that voted no in the referendum, and yet the horse that lost that two-horse race has spent the last six weeks parading round the winning enclosure."

Nicolas Anelka stunner gives Mumbai City FC 1-0winBy: Press Trust of India | Mumbai | Posted: November 2, 2014 9:57 pm
A stunning goal from Nicolas Anelka helped Mumbai City FC to pip Kerala Blasters 1-0, in their Hero Indian Super League (ISL) match at the D.Y. Patil stadium, in Mumbai on Sunday.
A foul from Ishfaq Ahmed on Jan Stohanzl earned the hosts a free kick in the 44th minute and Anelka was quick to capitalise.
The former Chelsea star’s strike curled above the defensive wall to the left post with a helpless goalkeeper, Sandip Nandy, diving in a desperate attempt.
Anelka, who had missed the first three matches due to suspension, showed his class and also earned the much needed three points for his side.
The hosts looked like a new side in the second half, rejuvenated by their one goal lead. They attacked well, seemed eager to add a few more goals to their tally and came close to achieving it a few times.
Mumbai had the chance to double the lead in the 58th minute when Stohanzl skied the shot and frittered away the golden opportunity.
Indian forward Subash Singh was also guilty of missing a sitter in the 74th minute. Anelka did everything right to beat the three defenders and feed the ball to Singh who shot it over the cross bar.
Anelka seemed desperate to make up for the lost matches and the French striker came close to adding to his tally by going solo in the 86th minute and the goalkeeper blocked it.
Moritz found the ball on the rebound but couldn’t slot it home.
The 35-year old had another opportunity a minute later but Moritz squandered the chance inside of the box and went wide.
The hosts looked to increase their lead even in the dying moments of the game when Nadong Bhutia hit the top bar, a few seconds before the close of the match.
Kerala marquee player and coach David James opted to sit out this match and handed over the custodianship to Nandy.
Anelka got his first shot in the match in the 17th minute through a short pass from Andre Moritz but the tepid effort from the former EPL player didn’t yield any result as Kerala goalkeeper Nandy blocked it.
The Sachin Tendulkar-owned team, playing their fifth straight away game, attacked well and comfortably penetrated in the other side threatening to score goals in the first half.
Kerala came close to slot the ball home in the 24th minute but Czech defender Pavel Cmvos denied the visitors the opportunity with a header, sparing the hosts some anxious moments.
They did not relent and kept dominating the proceedings.
The visitors got five corners in the first half but couldn’t capitalise on it and failed to break the deadlock.
Mumbai City FC next host Delhi Dynamos on November 5, while Kerala Blasters play their first home game on November 6 against FC Goa.

Rand Paul knocks Christies bully demeanorBy Sean Sullivan November 2 Follow @WaPoSean

Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) took a swipe Sunday at New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R), a potential opponent for the GOP presidential nomination, saying the governor's "bully demeanor" may not be received well outside his home state.
Paul's remarks marked the latest flare-up in a long-running feud with Christie. It comes as both men are seen as likely bets to run for the White House in 2016.
"I think this sort of bully demeanor may go over well in certain places," Paul said Sunday on CBS's "Face the Nation" after viewing a clip of Christie in a heated exchange. But, he added: "I grew up in the South, and we are 'yes, ma'am' and 'no, sir' and a little bit more polite."
Paul said there was a time when he thought, "You know what, when he stands up and says things boldlym that's kind of good — he's not taking any flak. But there can be too much of that, too."
The Kentucky Republican concluded: "I think there is a resurgence of people who want a little more civility and discourse."
Paul and Christie are have clashed publicly on policy and governing style during the last year and a half.
Asked about his 2016 plans, Paul said he is still considering running and will make a final decision "some time in the next six months."

The remarkably small number of competitive House races  explained in maps and chartsBy Philip Bump November 2 Follow @pbump
In 72 hours, it will be over. Or, not "over," really, given that a number of races (including key races in Louisiana and Georgia) are likely to go to run-offs, but, for most of the country, the Great Midterm Election of 2014 That No One Paid Attention To will have ended.
In most of the country, it already is.
The most recent ratings analysis by the good people at Cook Political Report puts very few House seats into play. We've mapped them below; if it isn't dark red or dark blue, it's (maybe) up for grabs. Click districts that are lighter colored to see who's contesting the seat. If you can find any. (Want to find the closest toss-up race to you? Here you go .)
Or, to put a finer point on it, the number of seats in each category.
Over the course of the election cycle, Cook's ratings -- which go from "likely" wins by a party to "lean" seats that will probably be kept to "toss-ups" -- has shifted toward the Republicans, as you might expect. ( Here's more explanation of this graph.)
There will be surprises; there always are. But in most parts of the country, Tuesday will come and go exactly as could have been predicted 12 months ago.
