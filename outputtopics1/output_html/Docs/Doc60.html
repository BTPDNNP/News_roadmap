To increase growth in the eurozone, countries "need to increase their competitiveness," said Andreas Dombret, a member of the executive board of Germany's Bundesbank, during an interview in Chicago. He claims that eurozone requirements imposing debt-cutting rules and reforms are working, although unpopular, in countries with high unemployment.
"Austerity worked well in Spain," despite unemployment of about 25 percent for the general population and 50 percent among youths, he said. Countries such as Portugal and Spain are not in recession, he added. "We are back to growth," but the remaining question is: "Is this growth enough to overcome unemployment?"
Currently, Italy and France are balking at eurozone requirements to make cuts in their national budgets so they meet debt thresholds. They claim that with much of Europe on the verge of recession, it is not the time to make government cuts that will leave more economic distress. Technically, a country can be fined by the other countries as a group if one fails to meet debt limits.
Meanwhile, while investors would like to see the calming effect of a European Central Bank QE program, some of the angst showing up in the stock and bond markets lately arose because "the market has been very skeptical that it would be possible to assemble the majority necessary to proceed with a broader QE program," said Citigroup analyst Hans Lorenzen.
Investors on Tuesday were encouraged that perhaps a full-scale QE program will eventually happen because of reports that the European Central Bank is considering buying corporate bonds. That's not the same as buying government bonds, which is controversial in Europe and is what the U.S. Federal Reserve does with Treasurys. But some analysts think that the ECB is inching its way toward quantitative easing through first steps such as buying covered bonds and asset-backed securities.
The goal in those programs is to relieve pressure on banks and to stimulate lending at a time when lending has been limited and consequently blamed for holding back growth.
Andrew Bosomworth, Pimco head of portfolio management in Germany, wrote on the Pimco website Tuesday that "QE can sooth the Eurozone's problems, but not solve them. The Eurozone needs to get its debt to sustainable levels through economic growth."
Bond buying and interest rate cuts, he said, "potentially kick other big problems down the road without solving them." And while low rates are supposed to help individuals and businesses borrow, "low interest rates aren't working," he said. "Low interest rates only work if people are borrowing money," and he notes they've been preoccupied with paying off loans rather than borrowing more.
Dombret anticipates that upcoming stress tests of European banks will help free up money for lending. Banks preparing for the test, which will be announced Oct. 26, have been building up capital so they would be financially healthier and able to deal with the stress of a major recession. Once the results of the tests are made public, he thinks, confidence in the banks will rise.
"The most important thing is tough stress tests," he said.
Some analysts are warning investors that the lull in the stock market this week could give way to volatility as investors anticipate and see which banks are strong and which are not.

Its All About Gratitudereddit
I love this time of year. Not only is Southern California festive and bedecked with Christmas lights, but people just seem to be in a better mood all around. I like to believe that it's because we're all thinking about the coming Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays, or, if you celebrate Hanukkah, the upcoming Festival of Lights.
No matter what, however, there never seems to be enough time to prepare. That's why I've introduced meditation into my daily routine. I find that it calms me and makes me more focused. It doesn't have to be anything fancy, or involve chanting a mantra, or twisting oneself into weird body positions. After I have my coffee in the morning I make time to sit for a few minutes and clear my mind. If it's a day I'm working out with my trainer, I do that after I meditate.
I've been aiming for twenty minutes a day, but sometimes it's only five or ten. I've also decided not to stress about it if I don't reach my goal of twenty minutes each day. We need to take care of ourselves, and the last thing I want to do is get on my own case about something that's supposed to help me de-stress!
How about the times when I find that I can't turn off my chattering mind which insists on my thoughts interrupting the silence? In that case, I'll make a concerted effort to count my blessings and give thanks. Especially right now as we're all getting ready for the Thanksgiving holiday, this seems more than appropriate. There have been many recent studies about how beneficial it is for us to write down a daily gratitude list.
