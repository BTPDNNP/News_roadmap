This December, the queues leading up to the Mumbai Film and Comic Con (MFCC) will get longer with fan boys and girls clutching on to their Sherlock and Doctor Who merchandise. Mark Gatiss, co-creator and writer for these popular series on BBC, will be a special guest at MFCC, to be held at the Bombay Exhibition Centre in Goregaon East from December 19-21.
Jatin Varma, founder of Comic Con India, says, “We were in touch with BBC for a year and wanted to invite someone from the Sherlock team, because of the massive following it enjoys in India. A few months ago, they confirmed that Mark is available during these dates, and also very excited to visit the country and meet his Indian fans.”
Gatiss was a part of the comedy sketch troupe The League of Gentlemen, and went on to write for the modern television revival of Doctor Who. Later with Steven Moffat, he created and produced BBC’s Sherlock, a modern-day adaptation of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes. He also played Mycroft Holmes, Sherlock’s astute and influential brother. Next year, he will join Game of Thrones as the character Tycho Nestoris.
In a statement released by MFCC, Gatiss says, “Stage Two of World Domination complete!’I’m thrilled to be coming to India, a country I’ve always wanted to visit, and I can’t wait to meet all the Doctor Who and Sherlock fans in Mumbai.”
Varma says the British actor-writer-producer will attend all three days of the Comic Con “He will be part of two sessions; one on his work, and the other dedicated to Sherlock.” MFCC is also planning a special screening of Doctor Who with Gatiss.

U.S. Companies Now Stashing $2 Trillion Overseas
Shorter term for undertrial who forgedorderPrint
Written by Kaunain Sherrif | New Delhi | Posted: November 19, 2014 1:18 am
In November 2013, Metropolitan Magistrate Anuj Aggarwal received a request from Rohini Jail authorities to review its March 2012 order — permitting undertrial prisoner Virender to use sport shoes, leather belt, a wrist watch with chain, carry bag and a diary. While reading the request, the magistrate realised that the order was forged and directed police to register an FIR.
After investigation was carried out, a trial court, relying heavily upon forensic report, held Virender guilty under IPC Section 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating) and sentenced him to seven years rigorous imprisonment. The convict then moved the sessions court to challenge this order.
However, a sessions court on Monday, while upholding the conviction of Virender, reduced his sentence from seven years to three by diluting the charge of forgery to that under IPC Section 474 (possessing forged document.
Meanwhile, the author of the forged document has still not been traced.
Virender, who is in his 20s, is facing trial in other cases including murder, attempted murder and robbery. According to the prosecution, on November 22, 2012, Virender, who was lodged in Rohini jail, was found wearing sports shoes, chain, wrist watch and a belt. Asked for an explanation by the assistant superintendent of the jail, he presented a court order which permitted him to use the articles.
Suspecting the document to be forged, the assistant superintendent forwarded it to the court for review after which it was found that the magistrate, whose signatures and stamps were used on it, had never passed such an order.
Reducing Virender’s jail term, the sessions court on Monday said the forensic opinion did not nail down the accused as the author of the forged order of the court.
“There is nothing on record to substantiate the theory of criminal conspiracy. The forensic opinion also does not nail down the accused as author of the forged order of the court, and therefore, the trial court should not have held him guilty under Section 468 of the IPC,” Additional Sessions Judge Manoj Jain said.

Telework abuse hearing: A serious problem

The Commerce Department inspector general Tuesday described a culture at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office that “has deemphasized time and attendance rules in favor of production goals.”
Inspector General Todd J. Zinser, speaking at a joint House hearing on fraudulent practices uncovered last year by an internal review team of patent officials, told lawmakers that “based on the evidence we have seen so far, I do not think abuse has reached a systemic level.”
But he called various practices that allow patent examiners to collect bonuses, overtime and salaries for work they did not do “nonetheless a serious problem.”
“It would be extremely easy for large numbers of the PTO workforce to cheat on their time if they want to do so.”
“Senior leaders need to ensure they do not minimize the problem,” Zinser said.
He urged the agency to adopt all of the recommendations in a 32-page report that documented multiple practices that allow patent examiners to game the system. The report followed allegations by four whistleblowers of fraudulent practices, but it was watered down by top patent officials , who submitted a review half the length to Zinser’s office, which had requested an investigation.
Zinser said the patent office should “recognize and reward” the six executives who wrote the report “for their courage.”

Encrypting Web site traffic could become easier next yearBy Andrea Peterson November 18 Follow @kansasalps
No, this is not what encryption looks like. (Kacper Pempel/Reuters)
Your online activities are only protected from prying eyes if the sites and services you're using are encrypted -- a process noted in many browsers with a little lock icon in the URL bar. But not every Web site is encrypted.
A new project could make it easier than ever for Web site administrators to provide a basic layer of security to its visitors. Mozilla, Cisco, Akamai, Electronic Frontier Foundation, IdenTrust and researchers at the University of Michigan have formed a nonprofit organization, the Internet Security Research Group [ISRG], that will offer free, automated "security certificates" for Web sites starting next year.
A security certificate verifies the authenticity of a site offering an encrypted connection. The Web address of such sites start with “https” rather than “http” and the Internet traffic that travels through such connections can be read only by the sender and its intended recipient.
But the certificates can be cumbersome to obtain and set up. "Today, if you try to add encryption and security to a Web site, it takes many hours for even skilled administrator to figure out how to get, install and configure the correct certificate," according to EFF's Peter Eckersley. The Let's Encrypt certificate will take 20-30 seconds to install and will be free when it launches next year, he said.
ISRG aims to shift the majority of the Web's traffic to encrypted sites. Currently, only a small percentage of Web sites are encrypted by default, although years of advocacy by groups like EFF have convinced many big name sites to make the shift, says Eckersley. Developers at the New York Times recently  challenge d  news organizations to encrypt their sites by default by the end of 2015.
EFF and University of Michigan researchers were working on an automated security certificate system when they learned of a similar project at Mozilla. They decided earlier this year to combine the projects and create the Let's Encrypt technology.
ISRG will spend the next few months making sure the security of the system is as close to "bulletproof" as possible, said Eckersley. "Certificate authorities have the entire fate of the Internet in their hands and they can't afford to make mistakes because it leaves Web sites vulnerable," he says.
In the past, fraudulent security certificates have been the been at the center of some major cybercrimes. In 2011, an Iranian hacker gained access to a company that issues security certificates and created fraudulent certificates that allowed him to impersonate Gmail, and intercept traffic of some 300,000 Iranians .
EFF has been working on efforts to expand the encryption of Web traffic for years. It developed a browser extension called HTTPS Everywhere that forces Web sites to make an encrypted connection when it's available. But that encrypted connection is only available if the Web site already has a security certificate -- the problem that Let's Encrypt is attempting to solve.
"The system of certificates that underpins the Web is a vast and often dysfunctional bureaucracy," Eckersley said.
Fixing that problem would make the Web secure for all users.  "If you're looking at an unencrypted HTTP Web site, your communications are vulnerable to account hijacking, identify theft, many forms of surveillance, interference and modification of the pages you're looking at. All of these problems are widespread and happen every day. With HTTPS the barriers for those who want to spy on your browsing or mess with your traffic are much higher...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(28%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>november year time nov people obama world president years news</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(22%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>times financial people police ft posted make friday source state</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(18%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>india government minister pm crore indian bjp state delhi chief</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(15%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>rs india cent company market percent year bank share growth</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(8%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>year times financial october news government cent rs percent time</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
