3,000 people from airline and tourism industry to descend on Chicago.
Many of the world's top airline and airport officials will descend on Chicago this weekend for a global conference that city officials say will be among the largest economic development events of the year for the city and the region.
Chicago officials expect about 3,000 people in the airline, airport and tourism industries to attend the annual World Route Development Forum, so named because it's partly a networking event where officials talk about adding airline routes to different airports.

Representatives from about 300 airlines, 800 airports and 200 tourism authorities around the world are expected to attend the 20th event, at McCormick Place, being held in the United States for only the second time.
Speakers include Jim Compton, chief revenue officer of Chicago-based United Airlines; Scott Kirby, president of American Airlines, and Tim Clark, CEO of Emirates airline.
Hosting the conference serves the dual purpose of showcasing the city to an international audience and attracting air travel routes to Chicago's O'Hare and Midway airports, which could ultimately lead to more route choices for Chicago fliers and even lower airfares, officials said. It also supports Mayor Rahm Emanuel's often-stated goal of attracting 55 million visitors per year to Chicago by 2020 and being among the top five U.S. cities in international tourism.
"This is the premier aviation business-to-business conference," said Chicago Department of Aviation Commissioner Rosemarie Andolino, who has attended other World Route conferences around the world in recent years. "It's a great opportunity for us."
The economic benefit of hosting the conference goes beyond the four-day event that starts this weekend.
"Any time you get exposure to literally every airline in the free world … I just think it strategically aligns with that goal that we've set," said Don Welsh, CEO of the city's tourism agency, Choose Chicago. "This gives us a great opportunity to target those airlines providing service from different parts of the world that align with growth markets for Chicago, i.e., China."
Last year, the World Route conference was held in Las Vegas, and was deemed a success by economic development officials there.
"Expanding air service is a long-term process, and being a host city raised our profile and helped further our discussions with the airlines," said Cathy Tull, senior vice president of marketing for the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority.
Since being named host city for the 2013 conference, Las Vegas added more than 120 weekly flights with an estimated annual economic effect of $454 million, not including gaming, she said. "Today, we continue to have constructive dialogue about expanding our air service in the future," she said.

3 tips to turn your passion into a career3 tips to turn your passion into a career
'What do you want to be when you grow up?'

Some of the passions we had as a child aren't going to translate into adulthood very well. But when they do, give yourself the opportunity to explore them.

Don't let fear hold you back. As long as you put in the work and the time, you've already reached success.
As a kid growing up, you always get asked the question “what do you want to be when you grow up?” And, you probably gave your share of creative answers — astronaut, teacher, firefighter…the list goes on and on.

Then at some point in your life, probably around your teens, reality starts hitting you. You start thinking about going to college, getting a job and making a living. That’s when we start pushing our biggest passions and dreams aside so that we can create a life for ourselves.

What if we held onto those dreams for just a little bit longer?
Obviously, some of the passions we had as a child aren’t going to translate into adulthood very well (not everyone can live on Sesame Street). But when they do, give yourself the opportunity to explore them.
Don’t let fear hold you back
When it comes to making real life decisions, we are often fearful and tend to go with whatever is the surest bet. It is difficult to take risks because of the possibility of failure. But at the same time, you never know what amazing things can happen. Don’t let fear hold you back. As long as you put in the work and the time, you’ve already reached success.
Know the difference between a job and a career
A job and a career are two very different things. A job is something you do to make a living right now. A career is that, plus more. It’s something you want to cultivate, hone and perfect. It’s something you can see yourself doing long-term, even for the rest of your life. While you may be making a good living from your job, is that how you want to be spending your time?
Do what you love
Not everyone is fortunate enough to do what they love. But at least once, give yourself the opportunity to pursue it. Whether you fail or succeed, you know that you have at least tried.
As the saying goes, do what you love and you’ll never work a day in your life.

Alleged Inside Traders Ate Post-It Notes  Napkinsreddit
John Le Carré is unimpressed. If you're going to use spycraft to conduct insider trading, at least use it properly.
Last week, a Brooklyn man named Frank Tamayo, 41, pleaded guilty to Securities and Exchange Commission charges that he had been the middleman in an insider-trading scheme that the SEC had first alleged back in March.
According to the SEC, Tamayo helped two other men - Steven Metro, then a clerk at the Simpson Thacher law firm, and stockbroker Vladimir Eydelman, formerly of Oppenheimer and Morgan Stanley - pull off a plot that seemed clever, but also hilarious.
Metro regularly passed trading tips gleaned from his law firm's files on to Eydelman, according to the SEC, but the two men never met. Instead, according to prosecutors, Metro would meet Tamayo for coffee and show him the ticker symbol of a stock he wanted Eydelman to buy. Tamayo would then allegedly meet Eydelman at the clock in Grand Central Terminal and show him a post-it note or a napkin with the ticker symbol on it and walk away.
