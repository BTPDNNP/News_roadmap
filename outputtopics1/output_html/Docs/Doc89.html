Q. I sit on a town house community association board. I am aware that for condominium associations, unit owners are entitled to attend board meetings but do not have the right to speak during the board meeting. Does the same rule apply for community associations?
A. Pursuant to Section 1-40 of the Common Interest Community Association Act (CICAA), owners in a community association are also entitled to attend the open portion of board meetings to observe the meeting but may not disrupt or speak while the board is conducting business.
However, unlike the requirements in the Condominium Act, Section 1-40 of CICAA requires that community association boards reserve a portion of the board meeting for comments by owners. The duration of the owner comment session, and when it occurs during the board meeting, is within the sole discretion of the board.
Q. Lenders for condominium unit purchasers commonly ask the association to provide them the percentage of the units that are owner/rental occupied. Should the answer to that question be based on the addition of all the rented units' percentage in the common elements or the number of units leased divided by the total number of units?
A. Lender questionnaires for contract purchasers of condominium units request the percentage of unit owner/rental occupancy as a part of the lender's risk assessment for the loan. The proper method to calculate such percentage for that purpose is to divide the number of leased units by the total number of units.

New IT Jobs Set to Fall by 50% in Four Years: CrisilGovernment May Make PAN Must for Registering Charitable Trusts
New hirings in the IT sector are likely to drop by 50 per cent over the next four years, according to a report by Crisil. The prediction is extremely negative for lakhs of engineering students across the country as the IT sector has traditionally been the biggest employer in the private sector.

More than 7 lakh engineering students graduate every year. In fiscal 2013-14, Crisil estimates IT hiring at 1.05 lakh and says the number could come down to a mere 55,000 by 2017-18. The IT sector currently employs 31 lakh people or 24 per cent of total private sector jobs in the organised sector. The sharp slowdown will therefore impact the overall hiring sentiment in the economy.
IT jobs growth is slowing down because margins in the $118 billion outsourcing industry are under pressure. Frontline IT companies such as TCS, Infosys and Wipro earn nearly three fourth revenues from North America and Europe, where growth is still anemic. As a result, clients are asking companies to cut costs. (Read: What Infosys Results Signal for IT Graduates, Campus Hiring )
Since employee salaries account for the biggest cost component for IT companies, domestic outsourcers are reducing bench strength, improving employee utilisation rates and reducing other operational costs, Crisil says. In 2013-14, employee cost accounted for over 60 per cent of total cost of IT companies.
"Companies will run very tight ships because of which incremental employment will be curbed," Crisil says.
The report says Indian companies are increasingly looking to maintain a leaner bench by adopting just-in-time hiring to improve utilisation rates. The current utilisation (or productivity) rate stands at 80 per cent and Crisil expects it to go up by 500 basis points in the medium term. A 100-basis-point improvement in utilisation impacts the employee growth by 105 basis points, the report says.
Companies are gradually migrating towards fixed price contracts, which eliminate the need for maintaining a large workforce for billing purposes. Such contracts weigh on hiring as revenue per employee goes up, Crisil notes.
Finally, Indian companies are planning strategies to move further up the value chain towards services such as consulting and software products, Crisil says. These services are currently dominated by global majors (such as Accenture, IBM), who have higher revenue per employee despite comparable employee bases.

The only 5 things you should have in your walletHere Are The Only Things You Should Have In Your Wallet
By Sarah Schmalbruch | Business Insider –  Thu 23 Oct, 2014 7:34 PM IST
Flickr / Leeber Time to do some work on your wallet.
Your wallet should be an organizational tool, not a catch-all. 
If yours is bulging with month-old receipts, random gift cards, and every single credit card you own , it may be time for a little process of elimination.
Recently, the Today Show aired a segment  that focused on the items you should carry in your wallet as part of their Take Charge Of Your Life series.
Here's what they designated necessary to keep close, plus a few extra items you might want to have on hand.
1. The main forms of ID you use
The Today Show says your driver's license or photo ID should always have a place in your wallet in case of an emergency or any situation where someone needs to verify your identity.
It's a good idea to carry your health insurance card as well, for doctors' appointments or in case of an emergency.
Keep your social security card at home or in a safe deposit box at a bank — there's a greater chance of someone stealing it if you carry it on you.
2. Debit, credit, and loyalty cards
There's no need for more than one debit card in your wallet, explains the Today Show, and you should try to limit yourself to two credit cards in case your wallet is lost or stolen . Identifying the one or two credit cards that give you the most rewards will encourage you to use those more often, benefitting you in the long term.
Retail credit cards, however, are better off left at home unless you're planning on hitting that store specifically, since they have a higher interest rate than most other credit cards.
If there's a store loyalty card (not a credit card) you use frequently — like one from your grocery store — you might want to carry that, too. If not, most stores will allow you to give your phone number instead.

The Today Show also says that it's always a good idea to have a little cash in your wallet, for a tip , for an emergency, or for the odd cash-only purchase. If you're ever caught in a cash-only situation without any cash, you might end up paying $2.50 or $3.00 to use an out of network ATM .
4. Your work ID 
If you use an ID or a badge to get into the building where you work, it makes sense to keep that in your wallet, since you use it regularly.
5. A transportation card
Anyone who has ever missed the subway fishing around for their MetroCard or CharlieCard might want to move it from the bottom of their purse or briefcase to their wallet. If you take public transportation to and from work, you'll want to have your card handy.

Global GDP growth is unlikely to rebound significantly in the next two years, as a gradual slowdown in the Chinese economy and structural impediments to growth in the euro area, Brazil and South Africa continue to weigh on economic activity, says Moody's Investors Service in its quarterly Global Macro Outlook report. For the G20 economies as a whole, the rating agency expects GDP growth of around 3% in 2015 and 2016, after 2.8% in 2014.
"Most factors that have weighed on global GDP growth in 2014 will remain in place in the next two years, including the gradual slowdown in China," says Marie Diron, a Moody's Senior Vice President and author of the report. The latter has led to a very sharp deceleration in its imports and has dampened export growth globally. "Moreover, structural deficiencies in some countries and regions - including the euro area, Brazil and South Africa - are als...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(24%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>rs india cent company market percent year bank share growth</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(23%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>november year time nov people obama world president years news</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(15%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>india government minister pm crore indian bjp state delhi chief</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(15%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>times financial people police ft posted make friday source state</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(12%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>year times financial october news government cent rs percent time</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
