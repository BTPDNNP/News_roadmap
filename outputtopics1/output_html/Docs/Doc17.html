Actor Rajnikanth on Sunday said he was 'glad' to see AIADMK chief J Jayalalithaa back in her Poes Garden residence after being granted bail in a graft case and wished her good health and peace.
"I am very glad to have you back in Poes Garden. Praying for good times for you. Always wishing you well for good health and peace," he said in a letter to the former chief minister.
In the letter released by the AIADMK headquarters, he also wished Jayalalithaa Happy Deepavali.
Incidentally, the Tamil icon also resides in the same Poes Garden area.
Press release by AIADMK
Meanwhile, Union minister for women and child development Maneka Gandhi also wrote to the former chief minister, hoping to see her "formally back at the helm of administration again."
Expressing her support and sympathy with Jayalalithaa, who stepped out of a Bangalore jail on Saturday after the Supreme Court granted her bail in an illegal assets case, Gandhi said she would be happy to do anything "to make this time less onerous."
"You have been through a great deal of suffering in your life and it is remarkable how you have always managed, through discipline and courage, to overcome the odds against you," she said in the letter released by AIADMK.
Gandhi told Jayalalithaa she was sure "this time will be over soon and we will see you formally back at the helm of administration again."     
Saying Jayalalithaa had done "remarkable things" for Tamil Nadu, Gandhi wished good health for the 66 year-old leader, adding she had "many admirers across the country."
Jayalalithaa was granted bail by the Supreme Court in the Rs. 66.65 crore disproportionate assets case on Friday and was released from the Parappana Agrahara prison in Bangalore on Saturday

Easy Rider chopper sells at auction for $1.35 million; is it the real one'Easy Rider' chopper sells at auction for $1.35 million. But is it the real one?

A motorcycle reportedly featured in the film 'Easy Rider' has been sold for what auctioneers say was $1.35 million.
The Profiles in History auction house did not identify the buyer with Saturday night's winning bid for the "Captain America" red, white and blue, chromed-out chopper.
Spokeswoman Sabrina Propper said bidding was fierce for the Harley-Davidson that the house said was ridden by Peter Fonda in the 1969 counterculture cult movie.

More than one version of the bike was built but according to the auction catalog, the one that sold was the only one to survive.
According to the catalog, it was used in the climactic crash sequence at the end of the film and restored by Dan Haggerty, who had a bit part in the film and vouched for its authenticity. Fonda, who played Wyatt and rode the bike in the movie, also vouched for its authenticity, according to the auction house.
The seller, Michael Eisenberg, also has a letter from the National Motorcycle Museum in Anamosa, Iowa, which displayed the bike for 12 years, saying Eisenberg's is the only surviving "Captain America" bike.
But another collector, Gordon Granger of Texas, says he owns the authentic chopper and also has a certificate signed by Haggerty to prove it.
Haggerty acknowledged to the Los Angeles Times this week that he authenticated and sold two "Captain America" bikes.
Now Haggerty says just one of the bikes is legitimate, and it's Eisenberg's - the one sold by the auction house.
For his part, Fonda says he has no idea which bike is the real one.
"There's a big rat stinking someplace in this," the 74-year-old actor, who co-wrote "Easy Rider," told the Times.
Eisenberg, a Los Angeles real estate agent and collector of Hollywood memorabilia, bought his chopper earlier this year from John Parham, a Midwestern motorcycle parts magnate who had purchased the bike from Haggerty 12 years earlier.

Haggerty did not deny that he also signed Granger's authenticating documents. He now says he signed something that simply was not true.
"That was my mistake," Haggerty said. "It's not the real bike."
Granger, furious about the auction, insists he owns the genuine article.
"They know damn well they don't have the real bike," Granger said. "I own the original remaining "Captain America" bike. The one to be auctioned is a replica."
The chopper features a forward-angled front wheel and handlebars, fishtail exhaust pipes and a teardrop-shaped gas tank where the movie's protagonists stashed their cash. It was designed with input from Fonda who insisted on it being decorated with the American flag.
The catalog says the bike - which was sold by Michael Eisenberg - was restored by Dan Haggerty.
But Gordon Granger of Texas says he owns the authentic chopper and also has a certificate from Haggerty.
Haggerty has acknowledged that he authenticated and sold two "Captain America" bikes.
But he said before the sale that just one was legitimate - Eisenberg's.

5-yr-old Indian reaches Everest Base Camp; claims world recordComments
As snowstorms lashed Nepal’s Himalayan region few days ago, a five-year-old boy from New Delhi and his father stayed indoors at a small lodge in Pheriche, a village in the Everest region located 4371 meters above sea level.
They were worried that the mission that they had set out to accomplish could get jeopardized midway. But the weather cleared two days later and they set out again towards their goal.

On Friday, Harshit Saumitra, a Class 1 student of GD Goenka School in New Delhi, reached the Everest Base Camp (5364 m), becoming arguably the youngest person to complete the difficult trek.
It took the child 10 days to cover the distance of 62km trek, many sections of which were covered by 5-7 inch of snow from the snowstorm caused by the tail-end of cyclone Hudhud.
“I felt very good. I unfurled the tricolor at the Everest Base Camp,” said Harshit at a press meet here after his return from the trek. He also climbed the Kalapathar (5550 m) peak located near the EBC.With this feat the child overtakes the record set by Aaryan Balaji, a seven-year old Indian boy who had reached EBC and Kalapathar peak in May 2012.
“We were worried that Harshit might experience altitude sickness. But he didn’t face any problem,” said the child’s father Rajeev Saumitra, a mountaineer who had reached the peak of Mount Everest (8848 m) last year.
The family plans to register the feat in record books like the Guinness World Records and the Limca Book of World Records by submitting the necessary proofs.
Harshit who climbed Rohtang Pass (3930 m) before attempting EBC has his eyes set on climbing Mount Kilimanjaro (5895 m) in Africa next and plans to attempt Mount Everest (8848 m) in a few years.
