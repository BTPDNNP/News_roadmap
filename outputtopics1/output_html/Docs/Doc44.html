All stock brokers and depository participants shall prominently display basic information... About the grievance redressal mechanism available to investors
 
 
In order to strengthen grievance redressal mechanism for investors, SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India) has asked stock brokers and other market intermediaries to display in their offices contact details of their CEOs, compliance officers and of the regulatory authorities.
"It has now been decided that offices of all stock brokers (its registered sub-broker and unauthorized person) and depository participants shall prominently display basic information... About the grievance redressal mechanism available to investors," SEBI said in a circular on Thursday.
Stock brokers and depository participants would have to provide contact details (email address and phone numbers) of their compliance officers, as also of CEO/ Partner/Proprietor, so that an investor can approach the right authority for his or her grievance redressal, SEBI added.
Stock brokers and depository participants are also required to provide contact details of stock exchanges like BSE, NSE, MCX-SX as well that of depositories (NSDL and CDSL), who can be approached by the investors in case they are not satisfied with the response of the stock Broker or depository participant.
The intermediaries would have to take necessary steps to implement the provisions of this circular and ensure its full compliance in respect of all its offices within 60 days from the date of this circular, SEBI said.
