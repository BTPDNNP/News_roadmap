DoT for commencing spectrum auction from Feb23The government expect to raise a minimum of Rs 9,355 crore from the auction of three sets of available spectrum.

Spectrum auction for mobile services is expected to start from February 23, a few days later than suggested by a ministerial group, according to official sources.
The inter-ministerial group, formed to work out modalities for the next round of auction, had suggested February 3 as the date for starting the biddings.
Sources said the government is also mulling auctioning some amount of 3G spectrum along with radiowaves in three sets of spectrum band — 800 Mhz (used by CDMA operators) that is lying unused, alongwith 900 Mhz and 1800 Mhz being used by Airtel, Vodafone, Idea Cellular and Reliance Communication for 2G services across the country.
The government expect to raise a minimum of Rs 9,355 crore from the auction of three sets of available spectrum. Besides, the sources said that it expects to further raise Rs 5,000 crore from auction of 3G spectrum in the 2100 Mhz band, provided the Defence Ministry vacates it.
Telecom Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad met Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar yesterday to discuss the vacation of 3G spectrum. Though Prasad did not share whether the 3G radiowaves will be available for auction, he said that the matter will be resolved very soon.
In a presentation to Prasad on November 13, DoT officials have shared February 23 as proposed date to commence bidding process for airwaves and payment of final price within 10 days from the date bidding round end.
“The notice inviting application (NIA) as per suggested time line will be issued on December 26,” an official source said.
The NIA is main document of spectrum auction which carries all details of radiowaves being put for sale, rules, price etc and is legally binding on both government as well as bidders.
The sources said an internal DoT committee is also examining recommendation of Telecom Regulatory Authority of India on auction of 700 Mhz — the most expensive frequency band available for telecom services.
DoT is expected to finalise auctioneer, agency which will operate spectrum auction process, tomorrow.

Indonesian police criticised over discriminatory virginitytestsWomen applying to join the force in the world's most populous Muslim-majority country have to undergo the virginity test. (Source: AP photo)

Human Rights Watch on Wednesday urged Indonesia’s national police to halt “discriminatory” virginity tests for women applying to join the force in the world’s most populous Muslim-majority country.
The rights group said women applicants are required to be both unmarried and virgins, and the virginity test is still widely used despite the insistence of some senior police officials that the practice has been discontinued.
In a series of interviews with HRW, young women — including some who underwent the test as recently as this year — described the procedure as painful and traumatic.
The women told how they were forced to strip naked before female medics gave them a “two-finger test” — a practice described by HRW as archaic and discredited.
“I don’t want to remember those bad experiences. It was humiliating,” said one 19-year-woman who took the test in thecity of Pekanbaru, on western Sumatra island, and whose identity was not disclosed.
“Why should we take off our clothes in front of strangers? It is not necessary. I think it should be stopped.”
Nisha Varia, associate women’s rights director at HRW, described the tests as “a discriminatory practice that harms and humiliates women.
“Police authorities in Jakarta need to immediately and  unequivocally abolish the test, and then make certain that all police recruiting stations nationwide stop administering it.”
The tests contravene the police’s own guidelines on recruitment and violate international human rights to equality, non-discrimination and privacy, HRW said.
Police did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
While senior police have insisted in recent years that virginity tests for female applicants have been stopped, HRW said a posting on the force’s own website this month noted that female applicants must undergo the procedure.
Women currently make up about three per cent of the 400,000-strong force, HRW said, but added the police had launched a drive to increase the number of female officers.
Society is deeply conservative in parts of Indonesia and some still value female virginity highly.
The issue hit the headlines last year, when the education chief of a city sparked outrage by suggesting that teenage schoolgirls should undergo virginity tests to enter senior high school.

Dhoni s stand on Meiyappan contradicted by Mudgal reportPrint

Indian skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni’s stand that Gurunath Meiyappan was a “mere cricket enthusiast” supporting Chennai Super Kings has been contradicted by the Justice Mudgal IPL probe committee report.
The report, which was partly made public on Monday, has said that investigations have confirmed that Meiyappan was a team official of a franchisee (Chennai Super Kings).
Dhoni, who had appeared before the committee, had maintained that Meiyappan, BCCI President-in-exile N Srinivasan’s son-in-law, was not an official of CSK.
In its first report submitted to the Supreme Court, the Mudgal committee had stated “representatives of India Cements, who appeared before the committee, contended that Mr Meiyappan had no share holding in India Cements and hence cannot be considered as an owner of CSK.
“Further, Mr M S Dhoni, Mr N Srinivasan, and officials of India Cements took the stand that Mr Meiyappan, had nothing to do with the cricketing affairs of Chennai Super Kings and was a mere cricket enthusiast supporting CSK,” the report stated.
When contacted, Justice (Retd) Mudgal, who headed the committee, declined comment, saying that the matter was sub-judice.
“I cannot speak on these matters since it is sub-judice,” he said.
In the final report, which was released, the committee said that Meiyappan was “frequently meeting Individual 2 in his hotel room. This strengthens the conclusion of the committee that Individual 1 (Meiyappan) was in close touch with Individual 2.”
“Thus the committee is of the view that due to the scientific evidence of voice-matching and testimony of the security personnel, recorded by the investigating team, the finding about the betting activities of Individual 1 and that he was a team official stand confirmed,” the committee said in its findings.

What plunging gas prices mean for your walletWhat plunging gas prices mean for your wallet

Lower gas prices is like a tax cut for consumers. (AP)
The gas pump is a friendly place these days, not the graveyard for one’s disposable income it once was. With the price of a barrel of oil cratering to levels not seen in almost four years under the weight of weak demand and a plethora of supply now that the U.S. is a key oil producer, U.S. consumers are getting what amounts to a tax cut at the gas pumps.
Oil prices have dropped nearly 30% from the spring peak, and wholesale gas prices are now at a near four-year low, according to Wells Fargo. West Texas Intermediate Crude fell 0.5% to $75.64 Monday.
Every 10-cent decline in retail gasoline prices unlocks nearly $3 billion for the consumer to spend on other goods and services, according to Gina Martin Adams, senior analyst at Wells Fargo. She notes that in the past 12 months U.S. consumers have spent $357 billion filling their tanks with gas.
The national average price for a gallon of regular gas on Monday was $2.885, according to AAA. That’s down from $2.893 Sunday and $2.927 a week ago. A month ago, a gallon of regular fetched $3.144. The nearly 26-cent drop in the past month equates to roughly $7.8 billion in freed-up cash for consumers to either buy other stuff or pay down debt.
So what types of stocks benefit most from falling gas prices? On the consumer staples side, food and beverage stocks tend to fare well. But, industrials, especially airlines and air freight, “may offer the best way to take advantage of lower energy prices,” says Adams.

Narendra Modi arrives in Fiji  first by a PM in 33yearsPrint
Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived in Fiji on Tuesday night for a day-long visit.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived in Fiji on Tuesday night for a day-long visit, the first by an Indian premier to the country in 33 years, during which he will hold bilateral talks with his counterpart Frank Bainimarama.
Modi arrived here from Melbourne on board a special Indian Air Force plane on the last leg of his three-nation 10-day tour after a hectic four-city Australia visit.
Earlier last week he had visited Myanmar to attend the East Asia and the ASEAN summits.
During his visit here, Modi will hold bilateral talks with Bainimarama, address the Parliament and also meet leaders and representatives of 12 Pacific Island nations.
Referring to his visit to Fiji, before leaving India, Modi had said it will be his privilege to visit this country soon after the return of democracy in September this year.
“We also owe them a debt of gratitude for hosting our scientists on the island in support of our Mars Mission. I am excited about visiting Fiji as also with the opportunity I will have of meeting leaders and representatives of 12 Pacific Island nations,” he had said.
The last Indian Prime Minister to visit the Pacific island nation was Indira Gandhi in 1981.
Out of the 849,000 population in Fiji, 37 per cent people are of Indian-origin. Many Indians arrived in Fiji as indentured labour in the 19th century.
On the eve of Prime Minister Modi’s arrival here, his Fijian counterpart Bainimarama yesterday said the visit is an opportunity for his country to further strengthen its position as a regional leader.
Soon after Modi’s visit, Chinese President Xi Jinping will also visit the Pacific nation.
“The opportunity for us not only to welcome these leaders to Fiji and host the leaders of our island neighbours – further strengthening our regional position – but to showcase Fiji,” he said at the Heads of Missions Consultations here.
Noting that the visits are symbol of Fiji’s new status in the global community, Bainimarama said, “There’s undoubtedly a strategic component to these visits –- India and China as emerging global powers wanting to also have more of a presence in the Pacific. But they are also coming because they regard Fiji as important.”
Bainimarama said Fiji and India have a long-standing close ties of friendship and “Prime Minister Modi recognises the great historical link and wants to help us develop our nation in a range of ways which we will discuss”.
Fiji and India have 135 years of historical and friendly relations and a formal diplomatic relation was established in 1970.
Modi is due to return home on Thursday morning.

Indian-American Neha Gupta wins prestigious childrens peaceprizePrint
Neha Gupta, an 18-year-old Indian-American, won the presigious International Children's Peace Prize.

Neha Gupta, an 18-year-old Indian-American, won the presigious International Children’s Peace Prize for her work to help orphans in India and other vulnerable children.
Gupta won the award whose last year’s winner was Malala Yousufzai, who went on to win this year’s Nobel Peace Prize.
Gupta from Philadelphia became the first ever American to be awarded the Children’s International Peace Prize in The Hague, Netherlands.
She was awarded the prize by Nobel Peace Laureate Desmond Tutu at a ceremony in The Hague.
The prize is awarded annually to a child, anywhere in the world, for his or her dedication to children’s rights.
Gupta began her astounding work when she was just a child herself, visiting her parents’ native place India nine years ago.
Carrying out a family tradition of celebrating birthdays by delivering gifts to orphans, she was struck by the condition these children were living in.
Last week, in an interview to ABC News, Gupta said: “The place was just really in shambles. I didn’t want to accept these things. These are things i wanted to fix.”
She moved to fix them quickly, any way that she could.
Back home in Pennsylvania, she made a bold move, deciding to sell all of her toys to raise money for the orphans she had met in India.
“We just put it out on our driveway and people came, bought things and it turned out to be such a successful event,” Gupta said.
“From that one event we raised USD 700 and I’ve wanted to keep going,” she said.
Gupta kept going, selling crafts door to door and collecting corporate donations in her father’s SUV.
Nine years later, now an 18-year-old college student, she runs Empower Orphans, a global charity that has raised USD 1.3 million.
The organisation reaches orphans in the US and abroad, helping to build classrooms, buy books, equip computer labs, pay for health exams, supply water and buy sewing machines to empower other young women to start their own businesses.

Hidden Camera Shows Well Hotel Maids CleanEmail
When you check into a hotel room, you assume the maid has cleaned everything, including changing the sheets and disinfecting the bathroom. But a hidden camera investigation revealed that may not always be the case.
The Rossen Reports team booked rooms for two nights at some of the most popular hotel chains and rigged them with cameras (all three of the hotels were in northeastern New Jersey). In each case they put soda in the glasses, threw towels on the bathroom floors and made the rooms looked used before calling to have housekeeping make them up, as well as prominently displaying the card requesting...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(28%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>november year time nov people obama world president years news</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(21%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>times financial people police ft posted make friday source state</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(20%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>india government minister pm crore indian bjp state delhi chief</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(18%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>december news year rs dec time images cent government feedback</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(8%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>rs india cent company market percent year bank share growth</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
