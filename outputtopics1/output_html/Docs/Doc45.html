Shasun Pharmaceuticals to merge with Strides ArcolabUpdated: September 29, 2014 22:55 IST
Shasun Pharmaceuticals to merge with Strides Arcolab
Sanjay Vijayakumar
5:16 share swap ratio proposed for the merger
Chennai-based Shasun Pharmaceuticals will amalgamate with Bangalore-based Strides Arcolab to form a vertically integrated larger pharma company.
The proposal was approved the boards of the two companies on Monday.
Under the scheme of amalgamation, Shasun shareholders will get five Strides shares for every 16 shares held by them in Shasun.
Shasun shareholders will own 26 per cent of the combined firm.
The deal will see the creation of a combined entity with a revenue of over Rs.2,500 crore.
The combined entity will also figure among the top 15 listed pharma firms.
Based on the share swap ratio, Shasun is valued at Rs.1,230 crore based on its closing price of Rs.195.75 on Monday.
Pipeline of products
In a joint statement, the two companies said the combination would result in significant de-risking of operations with the combined entity having 12 manufacturing facilities and a pipeline of over 100 products.
Strides, it may be recalled, sold its injectable drugs business to Mylan for $1.6 billion last year.
In July, it acquired 74 per cent stake in Bafna Pharmaceuticals’ branded generic unit for Rs.48.1 crore.
Value creation
“Today’s proposed combination with Shasun accelerates our strategy and growth prospects by creating a larger scale, fully integrated, leading Indian pharma company with multiple growth drivers and synergies that will allow for enhanced profitability and more efficient use of our combined infrastructure and enhanced value creation opportunities for the combined shareholder group,” said Arun Kumar, Founder and Group CEO of Strides Arcolab, in a statement.
“Strides and Shasun bring complementary strengths and shared values of developing products and market opportunities across geographies, and the combination accelerates both scale and scope,” a release quoted Abhaya Kumar, CEO and Managing Director of Shasun, as saying.
Post the merger, the present promoters of Shasun will be categorised as promoters of the combined entity, along with the existing promoters of Strides. The transaction is expected to close by June 2015. It is, however, subject to all regulatory approvals.
SeQuent Scientific, a group company of Strides Arcolab, has a 5.82 per cent stake in Shasun.
Shares of Strides Arcolab rose 9.20 per cent to close at Rs.701.95 on Monday. Shasun shares were down marginally to close at Rs.195.75 on the BSE..

Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman denies India was a deal breaker on trade facilitation at WTO
Chennai, September 29:  
Commerce and Industry Minister Nirmala Sitharaman today said that she strongly objected to some countries alleging that India was a deal breaker at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) as it was only trying to take care of its poor while being fully committed to honouring the agreement reached at the Bali Ministerial meet.
Assurance to corporates
Addressing a section of Chennai’s corporate and diplomatic elite at the third ‘Breakfast with BusinessLine’ at the Park Sheraton Hotel & Towers in Chennai, Sitharaman assured businesses that changes in the Companies Act to smoothen processes will be announced during the Winter Session of Parliament.
“We have gone through in great detail to see how best to remove the biggest thorns in the Companies Act that have been upsetting everybody. About 90 per cent of the work has been done,” she said.
To address specific problems faced by industry, more expert groups on the lines of the one formulated on bringing more clarity to India’s intellectual property rules will be set up by the Government, she said.
‘Breakfast with BusinessLine’ is an informal forum for Chennai’s business and diplomatic community to exchange ideas and share concerns with eminent people from different fields.
Explaining India’s position on its on-going fight with several developed country members at the WTO over the implementation of the trade facilitation agreement, Sitharaman said that the Government never said no to it and was in fact carrying out trade facilitation procedures independently.
The Minister added that India just wanted to be sure that when it subsidised its poor farmers, countries won’t say that it was distorting trade and then drag it to dispute. “What is trade distorting when I am feeding my poor,” she asked.
Retrospective issue
On the retrospective tax amendment issue and the Vodafone case, the Minister said that there was not much that the Government could do as the arbitration process was on.
“We have made our case very clear that we will not go on that route (of retrospective taxation) at all. But to remove that with one brush stroke is also not possible. There are legal implications to it,” she said.
Answering queries on changes to the new Companies Act, the Minister said one had to wait as Parliament was in session and some of the notifications had to be announced there.
“Even after that, if industry feels there is a need to make amendments, we are open to that,” she said.
Industrialists had expressed worries over some provisions of the new Companies Act such as rules concerning related party transactions, non-banking financial companies and cap on the number of audits that can be carried out by an auditor. Some clarifications on the Act have already been made by the Government, but the industry is looking for more.
Vibrant IPR regime
Highlighting the need for a ‘vibrant’ intellectual property regime, Sitharaman said the new IPR policy being framed by the Government will bring more clarity to the Act and lay down the roadmap for the future.
She said the Government would promote R&D for drug manufacturers in the country and also provide them with funds for innovation. She also stressed the need for faster patent registrations so that India could benefit from technology transfer.
To address various problems that businesses have to face on a daily basis, Sitharaman said the Commerce Ministry will form a small sectoral group advisory board.
“I will invite many of you to help us form small groups in the Ministry. And keep advising us saying where we have to do things a bit rapidly,” she said, adding this had already been done for IPR.

NHTSA reviewing new Toyota Corolla unintended-acceleration claims0
Ruginis and her husband, Bob, have met with Kelley’s staff to discuss their Corolla’s crash, said Sean Kane, the president of Safety Research & Strategies, the firm that reviewed the collision data.
"The Toyota monitor has an obligation to address safety and whether Toyota is accurately addressing it," Kane said.
Toyota examined the car, gave it a test drive and reviewed the information from the event-data recorder and decided there was nothing wrong with the vehicle.
Ruginis had previously had the Corolla repaired for both the floor-mat and gas-pedal recalls but reported the vehicle still had a history of “briefly surging.” She said it happened two to four times a month.
In the five seconds before the June 8 crash into the Jeep, the data recorder in the Corolla indicated that the accelerator pedal was untouched, the brake pedal was depressed and the speed of the car and engine power increased, Kane said. He said that was evidence of unintended acceleration.
“When we look at this data we see that this problem has not gone away,” Kane said.
However, Toyota said information from the data recorder shows that Ruginis was not braking until just a fraction of a second prior to the collision.
Last year, an Oklahoma City jury found that faulty electronic systems caused a Camry sedan to suddenly accelerate and crash, killing one woman and injuring another.
Toyota, however, has maintained that there was no electronic flaw that might cause its cars to accelerate unexpectedly.
A 10-month investigation, conducted primarily by NASA engineers, found no evidence that electronic defects or software code errors could have caused the thousands of sudden-acceleration incidents reported over the last decade. That review blamed the incidents on the same mechanical issues identified by Toyota.
