P-Note Investments Climb to 3-Month High at $36 Billion in SeptemberSpiceJet Shares Hit Air Pocket, Sink 14%
New Delhi: Investments into domestic shares through participatory notes (P-Notes) hit a three-month high of Rs 2.22 lakh crore (about $36 billion) in September.
P-Notes are mostly used by overseas HNIs (High Networth Individuals), hedge funds and other foreign institutions, to invest in Indian markets through registered Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs), while saving on time and costs associated with direct registration.
According to the data released by Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), the total value of P-Note investments in Indian markets (equity, debt and derivatives) increased from Rs 2,11,499 crore in August to Rs 2,22,394 crore at the end of September.
This has reached highest level since June, when the cumulative value of such investments stood at Rs 2,24,248 crore.
Investment through P-Notes grew in September after declining for two successive months.
Besides, the value of P-Notes issued with derivatives as underlying, stood at Rs 1,02,224 crore at the end of last month.
The quantum of FII investments through P-Notes climbed to 10.7 per cent last month from 10.3 per cent in August.
Till a few years ago, P-Notes used to account for more than 50 per cent of the total FII investments, but their share has fallen after Sebi tightened the disclosure norms and other regulations for such investments.
P-Notes have been accounting for mostly 15-20 per cent of total FII holdings in India since 2009, while it used to be much higher -- in the range of 25-40 per cent -- in 2008. It was as high as over 50 per cent at the peak of Indian stock market bull-run during a few months in 2007.
FIIs, the key drivers of Indian markets, pumped in a net amount of more than Rs 5,100 crore ($845 million) in the domestic equity market last month, while they poured in nearly Rs 16,000 crore ($2.6 billion) in the debt market in September.

Arun Jaitley Sees Better Growth in Second Half of FY15
Reuters | Updated On: October 30, 2014 18:27 (IST)
New Delhi: India's economy is expected to do better in the second half of the fiscal year to March 2015, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said on Thursday, adding that he expected to hit his revenue target.
Asia's third-largest economy is battling the longest spell of sub-par growth since 1980s.
However, the after-glow of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's election victory nearly six months ago helped the economy grow 5.7 per cent in the first quarter of the current fiscal year, its fastest pace in two-and-a-half year.

McDonald s to remake U.S. operationsA franchise association is again speaking out against an opinion issued by the National Labor Relations Board's general counsel in July, asking that he disclose how he concluded that franchisers should be considered joint employers in labor disputes at franchised outlets. ( Jessica Wohl )
"In some of our markets, the reality is that we haven't been changing at the same rate as our customers' eating-out expectations or, more specifically, their expectations of us at McDonald's. So we're changing," CEO Don Thompson said during a conference call Oct. 21.
Andres oversees operations of more than 15,500 McDonald's locations in the United States and Canada. He returned to McDonald's after a two-year absence to take over the McDonald's USA president role from Jeff Stratton.
McDonald's said it would create four U.S. zones: Northeast, South, Central and West, allowing it to become "more nimble.''

"ManServants" are not hookers. They are not escorts. They are not gigolos.
Dalal Khajah and Josephine Wai Lin -- the two women behind the freshly launched, completely real San Francisco business that sends attractive men to do the bidding of (mostly) female clients for an hourly rate -- would emphatically like you to know this.
"The Ladies" of ManServants (not my embroidery --"The ladies" is their shared email address) emphatically wanted me to know this when they made nervy, cautious arrangements for me to experience their "signature service" in the American citadel of sex work and absurd technological enterprise.

Enter the PlayMatrixreddit
Long ago, in the dark times of broadcast-only TV, there was limited children's programming: a few shows sufficed for all kids. With the arrival of multi-channel cable, kids channels brought the opportunity for age-targeted program blocks, fostering two dimensions of consideration: content and age.
The Internet added interactivity to the equation, and now the pace of change is accelerating -- mobile, tablets, wearable technology, increasing interaction between digital and physical play. With each new dimension, the considerations multiply for anyone creating content, products or experiences for kids, and they recombine in new and unique combinations.
That's how PlayCollective came to develop the "PlayMatrix" -- six primary factors that combine in different ways to define and distinguish kid-centric development. Think of it as a Rubik's Cube or, as I called a similar concept when writing for the Fred Rogers Center, a "Rubric's Cube."
The PlayMatrix can be formative or diagnostic. It's an essential development tool, but can also be used to reverse engineer a struggling concept to find misalignments.
The PlayMatrix also applies to essential research. In fact, it's perfectly designed to frame many questions we need to answer right now, as we transition from research models developed for understanding TV to gain insight into kids' digital, interactive, mobile immersive world.
The six elements are :
Audience -- for what age and stage are you developing your concept? In the monolithic era, too often something was aimed at "2 - 99."
Pedagogy is the philosophy or method that guides your storytelling or instructive approach. Telling parents what you believe about how your target audience grows and learns, and how you've incorporated that into your work, is far safer and more honest than predicting or promising learning outcomes.
Platform goes beyond technology. Books, art supplies, toys and play in the "real world" are platforms, too!
Form factor is distinct from platform, though in some ways a subset. Developing for a smartphone is different from a tablet is different from an eReader is different from a laptop. Console controller games are different from motion-based games are different from portable games are different from game apps. Similar distinctions occur in physical toys and game, too.
Content is perhaps the most obvious -- the stories you're telling, the curriculum you're teaching, the themes woven into play.
Context is the who, when, where, why and how of play: indoor or outdoor, site specific
Since Rubik's Cubes are all about aligning the correct sides and edges, it's no surprise that the most interesting research questions occur at the intersection of two or more PlayMatrix elements. For example, at the intersection of context, content and pedagogy and with growing interconnection between home and school, how do kids play differently with the same content in a classroom versus free play?
