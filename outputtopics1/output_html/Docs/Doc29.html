Any revision in Cut in gold import duty unlikely before Budget import duty is unlikely to take place before the Budget and there is no proposal as of now to reduce the 10 per duty, a finance ministry official said.
“On import duty (on gold) there is no decision at the moment. Import duty whatever has to be done will form part of the Budget. At the moment there is no proposal to reduce import duty on gold,” the official said.
There has been widespread expectations of reduction in customs duty on gold due to the improved current account deficit situation. The Commerce Ministry has also been pitching for a cut in import duty on the precious metal.
General Budget for the coming fiscal is generally announced on the last working day of February.
Earlier this week, RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan had also said that there were some requests to change the duty structure (on gold) and that government will view and take a decision on it.
The then government in 2013 had increased import duty on gold to 10 per cent following rising current account deficit (CAD) mainly due to import of gold.
Speaking about the removal of 80:20 restriction, the official said it is enough to ease the problem of gold availability and this will curb the problem of smuggling that was taking place.
Besides, the CAD situation is fairly comfortable and therefore there was no need to continue with it, the official added.
The 80:20 gold import curbs were put in place in August 2013 to curb high gold inflows that was leading to widening CAD.
Last month, the government decided to scrap this scheme as it was creating distortions.
Under this scheme, at least 20 per cent of the imported gold had to be mandatorily exported before bringing in new lots.
The surprise move came at a time when the industry was actually expecting more curbs on imports of gold, which is seen as an unproductive asset-attracting household savings away from the financial markets.
“The decision to scrap the 80:20 scheme is a reasonable one and let us see how it plays out. I think the fact that we have a substantial fall in crude imports means that we have some room to sustain an expansion in another import,” the RBI Governor had said.
The governor had said the decision to withdraw the scheme was taken by the government and RBI involvement was just to advise it on the same as there were some debates about the 80:20 scheme and the distortion it was creating.
It can be noted that gold imports jumped 280 per cent to USD 4.17 billion in October.

Shares of cigarette companies jump up to 10% onbourses'Our land rejuvenation model has brought prosperity to Indian farmers': William D Dar, ICRISAT
Shares of cigarette companies such as Godfrey Phillips and ITC surged as much as 10.4 per cent following reports that a Health Ministry proposal to ban sale of loose cigarettes is likely to be put on hold.
ITC jumped 5.67 per cent to Rs 383.60 on the BSE, becoming the top gainer amongst the 30 Sensex components.
Shares of Godfrey Phillips surged 10.38 per cent to Rs 650 and VST Industries zoomed 6.52 per cent to Rs 1,991.60.
A Health Ministry proposal to ban sale of loose cigarettes is likely to be put on hold following objections by some MPs, including some Union ministers, and farmers associations against taking drastic regulatory steps.
At a meeting called by Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu, Health Minister J P Nadda assured the MPs that he will look into all issues pertaining to tobacco and arecanut growers and industry before taking any policy decision.
India is the second-largest tobacco producer in the world and its export earns the country foreign exchange over Rs 6,000 crore annually.

The benchmark Sensex today bounced back to end with a gain of 120 points and Nifty jumped 26.75 points after rising to new lifetime high on the back of heavy buying in ITC shares on buzz that the government will not ban sales of loose cigarettes.
Global cues were also supportive. Asian and European stocks surged on talk of global monetary stimulus ahead of a European Central Bank policy meeting that could move closer to expanded monetary easing.
ITC, the most influential stock in 30-share BSE Sensex, jumped 5.44 per cent to over six-month high on speculation that government will put on hold its proposal to ban sales of loose cigarettes. Shares of other cigarette makers like Godfrey Phillips and VST Industries also rose in 2-6 per cent range.
The Sensex, which had retreated from record highs by falling over 251 points in the previous three sessions, opened today on a strong footing. It quickly soared to day’s high of 28,808.78. However, profit-booking at higher levels forced it to pare gains and closed at 28,562.82, up 120.11 points, or 0.42 per cent.
On similar lines the 50-share National Stock Exchange index Nifty, after scaling a new peak of 8,626.95 in early trade, closed at 8,564.40, up 26.75, or 0.31 per cent. Intra-day, the gauge breached its earlier record of 8,623 reached on December 1.
Persistent foreign capital inflows into equity market also boosted the market sentiment. Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) bought shares worth net Rs 391.07 crore yesterday.
Besides ITC, Sensex constituents Sesa Sterlite, Cipla, ICICI Bank, Hindustan Unilever, HDFC Bank, SBI, Axis Bank, HDFC and Bajaj Auto notched up moderate gains.
Sectorally, the BSE FMCG index gained the most by rising 3 per cent, followed by Banking index 0.76 per cent, Capital Goods index 0.40 per cent, Metal index 0.29 per cent, Auto index 0.13 per cent and Power index 0.06 per cent.
Buying activity also witnessed in smallcap and midcap stocks. The BSE Small Cap index rose 0.31 per cent and the BSE Midcap index gained 0.25 per cent.
Most Asian indices rose. “Chinese shares soared to multi year highs amidst steep rise in financial and oil shares and on the back of expectations of further economic stimulus measures,” said Hiren Dhakan, Associate Fund Manager, Bonanza Portfolio.

SAIL share sale floor price fixed at Rs 83; may fetch Rs 1 700crDirect equity set to top FDs as biggest asset class in FY15: Report
Government’s five per cent stake in steel giant SAIL will be sold at a floor price of Rs 83 per share tomorrow, which can raise Rs 1,500-1,700 crore for the exchequer in the first disinvestment under the new regime.
“Government expects to garner Rs 1,500 crore to Rs 1,700 crore from SAIL disinvestment. Floor price will be Rs 83 and retail investors will get a discount of 5 per cent,” an official said after a meeting on SAIL disinvestment in the Finance Ministry.
The SAIL offering would be the first PSU share sale under the new government, which targets to raise Rs 43,425 crore through share sales in various state-owned firms during the ongoing fiscal.
Retail investors would get a discount of 5 per cent to the bid price in the SAIL offering.
The floor price of Rs 83/share indicates a 2.75 per cent discount to the closing price of SAIL scrip that ended 0.35 per cent down at Rs 85.35 on the BSE.
The sale of 5 per cent stake, or about 20.65 crore shares, of SAIL at the current market price would fetch the exchequer about Rs 1,700 crore.
As much as 10 per cent of the offered shares has been reserved for retail investors, who can buy shares worth up to Rs 2 lakh in the share sale. A minimum of 25 per cent of the issue size would be reserved for mutual funds and insurance companies.
The Cabinet had in July 2012 approved a 10.82 per cent stake sale in SAIL. Accordingly, the first tranche of disinvestment of 5.82 per cent was completed in March 2013.
The government has lined up a host of PSUs to pare its holdings. The disinvestment plan includes 5 per cent stake sale in ONGC, 10 per cent in Coal India and 11.36 per cent in NHPC.
HSBC Securities, Deutsche Equities, J P Morgan India are among the six merchant bankers advising the SAIL stake sale.
While the new government assumed power in late May, there have been no PSU share sale so far in the current fiscal. During the previous 2013-14 fiscal, government has raised Rs 1,500 crore from sale of SAIL shares while the entire disinvestment proceeds stood at over Rs 16,000 crore.

The government has decided to put 18 additional coal blocks up for e-auction scheduled in February, taking the total number of coal blocks on sale in the first phase to 92 blocks.
“We will now be putting 18 more blocks up for auction in addition to the 74 announced earlier,” Coal Secretary Anil Swarup said, adding the step was taken as sufficient number of coal blocks was not available for the power sector.
Out of the 92 coal blocks to be allotted and auctioned in the first phase, 57 mines would be given to the power sector. Of the 57 blocks, 23 would be put for auction, while 23 would be considered for allotment to States, the Secretary explained.
The tender document for the auction, he said, was likely to be released on December 22. He was speaking to reporters at a workshop organised by the Federation Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI).
The Supreme Court had in September cancelled the allotment of 204 mines allotted since 1993, terming them ‘arbitrary and illegal’.
The government had last month announced auctioning of 74 blocks in the first phase, stating that the auctions would begin on February 11 and mines would be allotted only to specified end-users. The government had also made it clear that the number of mines a company could bid would be capped to avoid monopoly.
Further, Mr. Swarup said the Coal Ministry was working an electronic platform where “we will house all the problems and then take it up with the stakeholder.” The platform should be up in 15 days.
The issues flagged on the platform will include, land as well as related R&R issues and delay in obtaining forestry and environmental clearances, among others.
