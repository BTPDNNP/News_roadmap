Continuing their record-setting streak, markets on Tuesday hit new highs with the BSE Sensex scaling another peak of 26,949.08 and the NSE Nifty soaring to 8,047.80 in opening trade on sustained capital inflows buoyed by positive economic data.

Amit Shah asks BJP workers to wipe out Congress from KeralaAmit Shah asks BJP workers to wipe out Congress from Kerala
Vinson Kurian
BJP President Amit Shah
Thiruvananthapuram, Sept 2:  
BJP President Amit Shah has exhorted party men in Kerala to work towards wiping out Congress from the State in line with Narendra Modi’s larger message for the country.
Only this can rid the country of Congress and its vote bank politics once and for all, he told a well-attended public meeting in Thiruvananthapuram during his first visit to the State.
FIGHTING FIT
There is a need for the party to strengthen here just as it is in Assam, West Bengal, Odisha and Telanagana, Shah said to the enthusiastic crowd.
He also vowed to shape up the party to fighting-fit in all States, including Kerala, during his stewardship.
He wanted Kerala to produce winning candidates in the next Lok Sabha elections who would form the bulwark of the party and the Government at the Centre.
The winning streak should be set up right from here, he said in reference to the party’s creditable performance in the last polls where it led in many city corporation wards.
ACTION PLAN
Shah also declared that the party would not anymore contest just for the sake of doing it; it will fight it out to register a clear and resounding win.
He expressed confidence that the party would be able to successfully contest all coming elections, starting from those to the local self-government bodies.
“We already have an action plan in the making,” Shah said. He wanted the party cadres to intensify the current process of distribution of memberships.
From November 1, the Kerala formation day, the cadres must launch a door-to-door campaign to publicise the Modi Government’s governance agenda and achievements.
SHOCK AND CONCERN
Expressing shock and deep concern over the murder of an RSS functionary at Kathiroor in Thalassery, he said the party would take on rivals at both the ideological and legal planes.
He also criticised the Congress and Left Governments in the State which have outdid each other in setting the clock back on the State’s growth potential.
Also, one has rivalled the other in playing vote bank politics to the hilt. The result is for all to see – creaking infrastructure, bleeding economy, and surge in corruption.
Party sources said Shah did not entertain any request by a rival faction seeking removal of V Muraleedharan, President of the State unit.
But he issued a stern warning for the State unit at large to close ranks and work for victory in the forthcoming polls to the local bodies and later the Assembly.
