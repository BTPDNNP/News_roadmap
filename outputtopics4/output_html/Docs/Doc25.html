Google denies link-removal requests "when there is a public interest in doing so."
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
Turns out it's not so easy to be "forgotten" on Google after all.
Google ( GOOGL , Tech30 ) released data Friday on the link-removal requests it's received in Europe following a ruling on the so-called "right to be forgotten."
The European Court of Justice ruled in May that people worried about their privacy can ask Google and other search engines to remove sensitive links from their search results. But search engines can decline the requests if they believe the links in question are in the public interest.
Google said Friday that it had received 144,954 requests so far involving 497,695 URLs. Of that total, it has removed only 42%, keeping 58% in its results.

"In evaluating a request, we will look at whether the results include outdated or inaccurate information about the person," Google said .
"We'll also weigh whether or not there's a public interest in the information remaining in our search results -- for example, if it relates to financial scams, professional malpractice, criminal convictions or your public conduct as a government official."
Google gave a few examples of the types of requests it's received so far.
In Germany, a rape victim asked Google to remove a link to a newspaper article about the crime. That page no longer appears in search results for the individual's name.

But in Switzerland, a finance professional who asked Google to remove more than 10 links on his arrest and conviction for financial crimes had his request denied.
The removal process remains controversial , with free speech advocates complaining that the court ruling places too much power in the hands of search engines.
Individuals whose requests are denied by Google can request that local data protection authorities review the decision. Google says it is "working to create a channel" for appeals by webmasters whose links are removed from search results.

It’s a huge week for earnings reports. You can bank on it.
Three monster U.S. banks – JPMorgan Chase (JPM) , Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) kick things off on Tuesday. These banks have worked off much of the mortgage mess. But they’re still contending with lower trading volume. Analysts see JP Morgan reporting 3% lower adjusted earnings of a $1.38 a share. Wells Fargo has been the darling of the banking world. Analysts see its earnings rising 3%.
Put NetFlix (NFLX) on your watch list Wednesday. Investors love the video streamer’s subscription model. The stock is up nearly 30% this year. That gives this stock a P-E – are you ready for this – of 137 times its past earnings. Is this a normal? Investors will demand huge profit growth. Analysts are calling for profit to jump 73%. It had better – or that P-E looks a tad rich.
eBay (EBAY) also reports Wednesday. Expect investors to be listening for more about the PayPal spin-off.
On Thursday – Delta Air Lines (DAL) – gets into the earnings lineup. The stock – like many airlines – is up huge this year. 22% to be exact. Investors have legit worries. Higher fuel costs and traffic hits due to Ebola are concerns. Profit is seen falling 16%.
Folks. Put on your seatbeats and expect some turbulence.

(In a statement late Monday…)
MUMBAI: India's largest builder DLF, which has been in the centre of a political storm for its alleged dealings with Robert Vadra, has now received a body blow from the capital market watchdog Sebi. DLF, its Chairman KP Singh, some members of the promoter family and a few senior executives have been barred from dealing in stocks and securities for three years by Sebi.
The regulatory action stems from the DLF management's failure to disclose material information to investors during the firm's maiden equity offer in 2007. The Sebi order dated October 10 was uploaded on the regulator's website well after trading hours on Monday when realty stocks such as DLF and Unitech fell 4% while others like Sobha Developers, Godrej Properties and Phoenix Mills rose.
