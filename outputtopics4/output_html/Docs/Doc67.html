Goodell's original two-game suspension of Rice for the February incident with his then-fiancee, far milder than penalties for drug use, reflected a pattern of worrying more about players and teams' stake in their well-being. His subsequent announcement of harsher punishments for domestic abuse cases, a move Goodell conceded in a note to owners was because he erred in the Rice case, still had enough wiggle room to render the tough talk moot.
What's more, the idea that the league, or anyone else, needed to see the clip of Rice's actual knockout punch that TMZ posted Monday to know what led to an unconscious woman, now his wife, being dragged from an elevator is an insult to common sense.
Monday night's TV ratings for ESPN's NFL double-header — the opening blowout down 21 percent from a year ago and the nightcap up marginally — offer no clear sign whether fans have reservations about supporting the league.
But the league and its sponsors have no reservations about supporting Goodell, who did not move to suspend Rice indefinitely until the latest tape led the Baltimore Ravens to cut him from the team, abruptly withdrawing its unabashed support of the one-time star.
"I know our commissioner has taken some heat," Kraft said Tuesday on "CBS This Morning." His remarks came during an appearance that had been scheduled ostensibly to celebrate the network's slate of Thursday night NFL games, a simulcast with the league's cable channel for which Goodell's office managed to squeeze $275 million plus production costs from the broadcaster.
"The way he's handled this situation himself, coming out with the mea culpa in his statement ... and setting a very clear policy how we conduct ourselves in the NFL, I thought was excellent. Anyone who's second-guessing that doesn't know him."
Or they don't know him the way the owners do.
This is the same Goodell who, testifying at a Capitol Hill hearing not so long ago, was so determined to avoid acknowledging a connection between football head injuries and debilitating brain diseases and dementia that many likened it to tobacco companies' efforts to dismiss a link between smoking and cancer. In time, the NFL would reach a settlement with former players. It was unavoidable, and arguably still not enough.
At some point, maybe even at long last now, the NFL will wake up to the paradox of courting female fans while not seeming sufficiently disturbed by incidents such as the Rice case, slow to respond and ineffectual when it does.
"I don't want to get in the role of law enforcement or things I don't understand," Kraft said about the lack of urgency with Rice. "The good news is, people did the right thing when the visual — when you see that visually, it's just such a turnoff — and I hope a great lesson to people everywhere (is) that this isn't going to be tolerated."
When the owners say it and mean it, you can count on Roger Goodell to do it.

Upgrading Indian rockets for future Mars missions

AP Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO)'s Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV D5) with an indigenous cryogenic engine carrying GSAT-14 communication satellite lifts off from the Satish Dhawan Space Center in Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh.

For future missions, ISRO will have to turn to the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) and GSLV Mark III that can lift much heavier spacecraft than the PSLV.
After the stunning success of its very first shot at Mars, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) will need to take those capabilities forward, despatching bigger, and more advanced spacecraft in the years to come. That, in turn, requires rockets that can carry such probes on the first leg of their journey and place them in orbit around Earth.
For its first attempt with the Mars Orbiter, ISRO turned to the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV), a rocket with an impeccable track record. Initially, it seemed that this launcher would not be powerful enough for the task and every aspect of the mission had to be carefully optimised in order to make that possible, according to V. Adimurthy, the space agency's senior adviser for interplanetary missions. He led a study team whose 2011 report laid out how India could send ...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(28%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>rs company cent india october growth market year ist global</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(20%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>financial times india company percent share rs ft coal shares</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(15%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>year cent market rs bank month sales high growth years</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>modi pm people september minister chief october india de prime</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(10%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>india modi bjp indian minister billion president party china state</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>year financial people day government minister times modi cent women</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(5%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>november people times financial minister state government police friday chief</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
