Yahoo (YHOO) is under pressure by a key investor to merge with AOL. The change could be very profitable for Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer.
As is the case at most companies, Yahoo has a plan in place to pay executives including CEO Mayer in the case there is a change of control. At Yahoo, the payoff kicks in if there’s a change of control at the company and the executive loses a job within a year of the change.
Yahoo is under fire by activist investor Starboard for spending money on capital expenditures, but not getting any results in earnings or profit. Shares of Yahoo have moved higher this year, but primarily because the media company is holding billion of dollars worth of shares in Chinese e-commerce company, Alibaba.
To be sure, there’s no done deal nor even confirmation there could be one. Neither AOL nor Yahoo are talking about any combination. Shares of both companies are up sharply on the speculation. Yahoo stock is up $1.64 to $40.60 and AOL is up $1.34 to $44.45.
But if there were to be a change, Mayer would stand to haul in millions: $164 million to be exact.
The first part of the Yahoo change-in-control payout would be an an award of two years of base salary, which for Mayer would be $2 million. Her base salary in 2013 was $1 million. She would also get reimbursement for the expenses to find another job, up to $15,000. Yahoo estimates Mayer’s total cash several in a change-of-control would be $4.7 million.
Medical and dental plan coverage would continue for up to 24 months. But perhaps the most lucrative aspect of the windfall is the accelerated vesting of all stock options, restricted stock and other stock-based award.
All told, Mayer stands to bring in $164.6 million in cash severance plusstock and option acceleration if there’s a change of control at the company. The company’s filing states:

NCP colluded with BJP to impose Prez rule in Maha:ChavanPress Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: September 28, 2014 7:58 pm
Blaming NCP for severing ties with Congress, former Maharashtra Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan has alleged that Sharad Pawar’s party “colluded” with BJP for getting the state placed under President’s rule.
“The NCP demanded that the Chief Minister’s post be shared, according to which each party will have its chief minister for two-and-a-half years. Earlier, it was the party getting the maximum number of seats that got the chief ministership,” he told news channel CNN-IBN in an interview.
Chavan said the alliance ended on the grounds of demand for chief ministership and claimed that NCP leader and state’s former Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar put a pre-condition seeking to contest 144 of the 288 Assembly seats in the state, according to a release issued by the channel.
He alleged that NCP “colluded” with BJP to overthrow the state government just a few days before the Assembly polls.
“A game plan was worked out between BJP and NCP to pull the plug of the state government and the Governor will then recommend President’s Rule in the state,” he said.
Congress and NCP have been running the government in Maharashtra for the last 15 years but their alliance broke up last week over issues particularly seat-sharing between them.

(Panneerselvam's elevation…)
CHENNAI: Within hours of being elected as leader of AIADMK Legislature Party, O Panneerselvam was today invited by Tamil Nadu Governor K Rosaiah to form a government.
According to a Raj Bhavan communique, Panneerselvam, who was Finance Minister in J Jayalalithaa's ministry and represents Bodinayakanur constituency in the state Assembly, met Rosaiah and submitted a letter and the resolution passed by the AIADMK legislators who chose him unanimously, a day after the party supremo was jailed in a graft case.
"Consequently, His Excellency the Governor has invited him to form the Ministry," it said without divulging details.
Panneerselvam's elevation comes a day after J Jayalalithaa was disqualified as MLA following her conviction in the Rs 66.65 crore disproportionate assets case by a Bangalore special court.
She was sentenced to four years in jail.
