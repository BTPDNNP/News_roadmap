Three years ago this week , Zuccotti Park in downtown Manhattan went from being a place bored office workers went for a cigarette break to the center of Occupy Wall Street.
Today the protesters are long gone, and the public disgust with the financial system that the movement inspired and embodied has faded. But Occupy's effects live on, in the way we talk and think about the American economy, and in the continued work of a core group of activists.
Occupy gained prominence and a following by focusing its efforts on concrete space, but its most obvious legacies are largely ambient and linguistic: Today, 45 percent of Americans are dissatisfied with their ability to get ahead by working hard . In 2008, just 31 percent felt the same way. The ubiquity of the phrase "99 percent" spiked with Occupy’s protests. And it’s hard to argue that the enduring, derogatory use of “ the 1 percent ” is not the group’s doing.
Introducing Americans to a dramatically different way to talk about inequality is a big achievement. And while much of the change over the past six years in how Americans view the rewards of work is due to the recession (hello, falling household incomes ), giving that shift a way to express itself is impressive.
Where you won’t find Occupy’s legacy is in American attitudes toward banks. Despite its initial aim, Occupy did not spark continued, mass disgust with the financial industry among the U.S. public. A Gallup poll shows that American’s now have net positive view of banks:
Occupy Wall Street may have had a short-term effect: From mid-2011 to mid-2012, Americans' already negative view of banks got marginally worse. The drop was not sustained, and its size was very minor compared to the drop caused by the global financial crisis.
How American’s feel about banks isn’t really even the best way to judge Occupy. Its goals were always both bigger (changing the dialogue about the American economy) and smaller (specific policy proposals and concentrated activism) than just getting people upset at one industry. Occupy could be the rhetoric of the 99 percent and the 1 percent (or 0.1 percent), and it could be Occupy the SEC with a scalpel-sharp 325-page, 301-footnote comment letter on the Volcker Rule.
The wonkier legacy of Occupy can be seen in things like a Senate hearing Wednesday afternoon called “Who is the economy working for? The impact of rising inequality on the American economy.” Or the determined, complex work of Strike the Debt, which just bought and canceled $3.9 million in debt from students of a for-profit college. Since 2012, it has wiped out $15 million in medical debt.
Occupy’s legacy being about something other than the banks may be for better. Popular outrage against the financial system -- as cathartic and necessary as it was -- may have outlived its use a vehicle for change. Credit to Occupy Wall Street for building more durable forms of activism at the height of its popularity. Occupy’s real but limited success shows just how hard a fight they picked.

Gun Store Names Rifle Barrel After Obama But Can t Spell His Namereddit
A California gun store is selling a rifle attachment named “Obama’s Blaster" to mock the president's support for stricter gun control laws.
In a post on its website dripping with sarcasm , Ares Armor described the nearly foot-long upper portion of an AR-15 assault rifle as a way to thank President “Barrack” Obama for being “the firearms industry spokesman and salesmen of all time.”
The jab references the surge in gun purchases that occurred after Obama and lawmakers pledged to crack down on firearm sales following the Sandy Hook gun massacre of 20 elementary school children and six adults in 2012. Nearly two years later, the gun run has only recently started to subside.
The post compares Obama to Marvin the Martian, a helmeted alien character from the Looney Tunes cartoon who is hellbent on destroying the Earth using an apocalyptic ray gun called the Illudium Q-36 Explosive Space Modulator. With Earth eliminated, Venus would be the consecutive planet to Marvin's home, Mars.
“Much like Marvin, Barry is believed to be an alien and also was in position of an Illudium Q-36 explosive space modulator,” Ares Armor wrote, referencing Looney Tunes as well as the “birther” conspiracy theory that the president is a Kenyan immigrant. “Unfortunately for us, Barry believes that the United States is not only blocking his view of Venus, but is also blocking his social and political views with our pesky Constitution.”
A minute-long video displays the features of “Obama’s Blaster.”
Ares CEO Dimitrios Karras told The Huffington Post that he was "the jerk who came up with it all." He began selling the item last month to drum up some attention for the store and tease friends who support the president's stance on gun control. Karras, 29, said the store has been flooded with threatening phone calls and messages.
A woman who called Ares Armor said she was reporting the business to the Secret Service.
"Apparently I'm a crazy redneck that's out in the middle of nowhere and I'm off my rocker and I never would have done this to insult President Bush," said Karras, noting that he voted for Obama in the 2012 election. "It's a joke, it's funny. People need to take it down a notch and take themselves a little less seriously -- not everyone out there is a crazy white racist."
So far, he said, the store has sold hundreds of Obama's Blasters, now discounted to $550 from $690.
The blurb on the barrel’s product page continues with its puzzling Looney Tunes analogy, suggesting that Obama's Blaster could have prevented Bugs Bunny when he stopped Marvin from destroying the Earth.
“Luckily, after 2,000 years of research and when he was finally ready to use the Illudium Q-36 explosive space modulator to destroy the Constitution and the United States, Bugs Bunny saved the day and destroyed this device,” reads the post. “If good ol’ Barry had been in possession of a ‘blaster’ such as this, maybe things would have been different for Bugsy.”
For good measure, the gun tacked on a parenthetical postscript to remind readers that “Barrack” -- yes, the store twice misspelled the president’s first name -- doesn’t actually endorse the product.
Karras, who served as a Marine in Afghanistan and Iraq, told HuffPost that he intentionally misspelled the name to be "semi-disrespectful."
"A lot of this stuff is literally meant to rile up my friends on the left side of the fence," Karras said.
The White House did not immediately return a call requesting comment Thursday morning.
This isn't the first time the gun industry has taken aim at Obama. Last year, California-based Zombie Industries was forced to pull a zombie target mannequin made to look like Obama from its booth at the National Rifle Association's convention in Houston. A paper target resembling the president, however, remains on sale for $50 per 100-pack.

Alibaba founder Jack Ma s success taleAlibaba mega IPO caps founder Jack Ma success tale

HONG KONG (AP) — When Jack Ma founded Alibaba 15 years ago he insisted the e-commerce venture should see itself as competing against Silicon Valley, not other Chinese companies. That bold ambition from a time when China was still a corporate backwater has been vindicated this week by Alibaba completing a mammoth sale of shares to investors in the U.S. and elsewhere.
Charismatic by the gray standards of Chinese CEOs, the elfin Ma is nicknamed "Crazy Jack" and is seen as China's version of Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos or Bill Gates. Ma used his entrepreneurial wits to build up an e-commerce giant in stark contrast to the state owned companies that became behemoths because of Communist Party policies and ties to the political elite.
The initial public offering, which will raise as much as $25 billion, cements his position as one of China's richest people. Ma will reap $867 million by selling 12.75 million shares and will still retain a nearly 8 percent stake worth $13.1 billion based on the $68 a share price that Alibaba announced Thursday. The shares start trading in New York on Friday.
A former English teacher who flunked his college entrance exam twice, Ma founded Alibaba in his apartment in 1999 with 17 friends. He wasn't shy about his global ambitions, telling them in an early meeting that year that "our competitors are not in China but in America's Silicon Valley," according to a scene in the recent documentary "Crocodile in the Yangtze." He said that when it comes to software and information, "Chinese brains are ...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(20%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>financial times india company percent share rs ft coal shares</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(16%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>india modi bjp indian minister billion president party china state</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(16%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>year cent market rs bank month sales high growth years</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(15%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>modi pm people september minister chief october india de prime</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(13%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>september rs pm people true government post company sep india</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>year financial people day government minister times modi cent women</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
