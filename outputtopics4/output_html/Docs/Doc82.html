Video: Career Builder offers a roundup of the craziest excuses employees have given for calling out sick, including one who said they had a casserole in the oven, and another who reported that they accidentally got on a plane.
Faking a cough sounds so boring compared to these sick day excuses. CareerBuilder released its 2014 roundup of the year's most unbelievable excuses bosses have heard from employees. If they're to be believed, American workers got into some serious hijinks this year.
Here are the top excuses from their representative sample of 2,203 hiring managers and HR professionals across companies:
10. Employee just put a casserole in the oven.
9. Employee’s plastic surgery for enhancement purposes needed some "tweaking" to get it just right.
8. Employee was sitting in the bathroom and her feet and legs fell asleep. When she stood up, she fell and broke her ankle.
7. Employee had been at the casino all weekend and still had money left to play with on Monday morning.
6. Employee woke up in a good mood and didn't want to ruin it.
5. Employee had a “lucky night” and didn’t know where he was.
4. Employee got stuck in the blood pressure machine at the grocery store and couldn't get out.
3. Employee had a gall stone they wanted to heal holistically.
2. Employee caught their uniform on fire by putting it in the microwave to dry.
1. Employee accidentally got on a plane.

While these could give you a stitch in your side from laughing, faking a sick day is no joke. One in four employers have caught an employee faking a sick day by checking his or her Twitter or other social media feeds. And one in five have fired a worker caught in a lie.

More than half of middle-class Americans say they plan to save more for retirement "later" to make up for not saving enough now.When it comes to retirement savings, 'later' is a bad word
Kelli B. Grant CNBC

Procrastination can pay for last-minute sports tickets or 11th-hour holiday  bargains. But when it comes to retirement savings? Bad idea.
More than half of middle-class Americans say they plan to save more for  retirement "later" to make up for not saving enough now, according to a new  Wells Fargo survey. Worse, many aren't saving at all—34 percent of the 1,001  adults surveyed aren't currently setting money aside for retirement and 20  percent have no retirement savings. The median balance among savers is $20,000,  down from $25,000 last year.

Don't procrastinate when it comes to saving for retirement. Save early, save often.
"That's a big problem," said Joe Ready, director of institutional retirement  and trust for Wells Fargo. "You're already not saving enough, so you're kicking  this empty can down the road."
Postponements can make a big difference in your final account balance. By  Ready's calculations, a 25-year-old who saves $100 per month until he retires at  65, with a 6.5 percent annual return, would have accumulated more than $225,000.  Wait until age 40 to start those contributions, and the balance would be a much  slimmer $75,000.
"I don't know how much of this is survival and [how much is] the mindset that  they'll be able to catch up over their career trajectory," said Lazetta Rainey  Braxton, a certified financial planner in Baltimore, Md. Of course, the basic  advice is to save more, but strategies can vary depending on which of those two  categories you fall into.

Consumers who don't feel like they have any wiggle room in their budget to  save for retirement will benefit from analyzing their cash flow and looking for  areas to cut back. "It's pretty basic. Either you increase your income or  decrease your expenses," said Rainey Braxton. Even small amounts can add  up over years of compounding—especially with advantages like a 401(k) employer  match.
Although consumers expressed concerns over balancing savings and regular  monthly bills, survey results indicate there's some fat to be cut: 56  percent said that "later" they would cut splurges such as spa treatments and  jewelry to save more for retirement, and 55 percent would dine out less  frequently. Half also said they would postpone big purchases like a home  renovation or car.

Consumers who have concrete expectations of having more disposable  income in a few years—say, after a college-bound child's final tuition payment  or once they've moved up the career ladder—still need to plan. Later  contributions have less time to grow, meaning you'll need to contribute more to  have the same ending balance as if you'd started today.
