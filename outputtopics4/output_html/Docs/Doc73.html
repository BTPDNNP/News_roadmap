At the same time, wind generators might take issue with hourly measurements. That's because wind generators typically run at night along with nuclear plants. Neither emit carbon dioxide. That means that if carbon reductions were measured by the hour, wind generators wouldn't get much credit for displacing carbon emissions. Nuclear plants would be at a disadvantage for the same reason.
"If you have a lot of nuclear plants and someone else has a lot of coal plants and they average those two, the nuclear provider is subsidizing them," said Adam Riedel, an attorney specializing in environmental and energy law at Manatt, Phelps & Phillips. In other words, benefits for cutting carbon "will accrue to the coal plant because for all intents and purposes the nuclear plant has no emissions," Riedel said.
Solar power generators, however, might favor hourly measurements. Why? Because the grid turns to solar power when demand for power is at its highest. At that point, generating plants fueled by coal, oil and natural gas would be operating and emitting carbon dioxide. So, solar producers conceivably could receive credit for displacing carbon emissions.
No matter what system of measurement is devised, someone will be unhappy, Riedel said.
The federal EPA faces a June 2015 deadline for finalizing its proposal for carbon cuts and it would be up to states to decide how to reach the mandates.
The goal is to cut 30 percent of emissions from 2005 levels by 2030. That's why much attention will focus on how the Illinois Commerce Commission deals with the issue, ahead of the state legislature, which is expected to begin putting together a framework for implementing the carbon rule in the spring session.
"If implemented correctly, the smart grid will lead to greenhouse gas emission reductions," said David Kolata, CUB's executive director. "But measuring and quantifying it is important particularly with the EPA carbon rules coming up."
ComEd spokesman John Schoen said the utility has been working with CUB "on the complex question of how to better measure greenhouse gases." Exelon, ComEd's parent company, did not respond to a request for comment on the measurement proposal.
Publicly sharing the carbon footprint of the electricity grid hour by hour and providing incentives to power producers and consumers to make choices to cut those emissions "will make all the difference in the world," Barbeau said. "People wait in line for a penny cheaper gas across the street, but we don't pay attention to that same penny when it comes to our electricity usage."
At least one state is out front in bringing consumers into the decision-making.
Maryland recently implemented a system that financially rewards consumers for powering down during times when a carbon-polluting power plant would normally have to switch on to meet electricity demand.
Baltimore Gas and Electric, a utility owned by ComEd's parent, Exelon, alerts customers by email or text that demand is high and gives them a credit on their bill if they use less electricity than they normally would on a similar day.
Karl R. Rabago, executive director of the Pace Energy and Climate Center at Pace Law School, said it might not be worth the effort to create a measurement system that forces regulators to determine exactly which power plant is turned on or off at every second of the day because of carbon-cutting policies.
"It may be entirely possible for me to control my toaster with my iPhone and determine how that changes my carbon emissions, but I don't want to do that," Rabago said.
Alex Laskey, president and co-founder of Opower, which provides cloud-based software to the utility industry, said most consumers want someone else, most likely their utility, to make decisions that cut emissions. He said most people don't want to be involved. "At the moment, there's very little consumer demand for this," Laskey said.
Jeff Saad, senior project architect and associate principal at Perkins and Will in Chicago, helps create sustainable buildings that encourage greener behavior among occupants. The program his buildings participate in determines carbon emission reductions by looking at the average power mix across the state, not by the hour.
His concept is based on changing the way people interact with their environment by comparing their behaviors to their counterparts at comparable buildings.
"It's about modifying people's behavior," he said.

Transferring property to children can get complicated0
If you buy and sell, you may have to pay a double recordation/transfer tax. Many states do have exemptions for transactions between parent and child, but even then, there are logistics to deal with. You will have to transfer a house to your son; you cannot add his wife to the title without paying the tax. Once he gets title, he will then have to add his wife to the title. And the same procedure would apply for your daughter.
Another concern, which you mentioned. If you sell the properties to your children, they will not get the benefits of the stepped-up basis. That's a tax provision whereby the value of the property when you die becomes the tax basis of the persons who inherit from your estate. This may not be a real problem if the kids qualify for the up-to-$500,000 exclusion of gain by owning and using the house for two out of the five years before it is sold.
