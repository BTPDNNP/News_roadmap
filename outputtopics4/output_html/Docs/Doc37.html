Sangh Parivar readies itself to take on ruling AIADMK
Faced with an uphill task of taking on the ruling AIADMK in the local bodies by-elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party-Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh combine is going full throttle with its campaign.
The by-polls to the local bodies, including for Mayors of three Corporations, will be held on September 18.
Sources in the BJP said meetings of local workers in the regions going to the polls were being completed. The BJP is planning to hold mega public meetings in “crucial” Corporations and municipalities such as Coimbatore and Ramanathapuram.
“In Coimbatore, we are looking forward to holding a National Democratic Alliance (NDA) rally, inviting leaders of all alliance partners,” a senior leader told The Hindu.
The DMDK, the MDMK and the PMK have pledged their support to the BJP.
The party’s campaign would focus on the alleged irregularities in the local bodies and civic issues.
“For example, we have a continuing campaign in Coimbatore, titled ‘100 wards 100 issues,’ highlighting the civic problems faced by the people,” the leader said.
Significantly, the BJP’s local units are working in coordination with the foot soldiers of the party’s ideological parent — the RSS — in many of these local bodies.
A source said 400-500 RSS ‘sevaks’ were roped in for election work in the Corporations and municipalities going to the polls. These persons will have three to four more persons under them for the campaign.
“The RSS workers are efficient in door-to-door campaigning,” the source said. Teams have also been formed to identify and report cases of money distributions. But leaders currently into the campaign said most of the voters believed that supporting the ruling party in a by-poll would be beneficial. Hence, it was necessary to meet the voters several times to talk them into backing a non-AIADMK candidate.
Also, given that the State BJP is anticipating a visit by national president Amit Shah in September, it wants to put up a strong show in the by-polls.
AIADMK campaign
On the other hand, the AIADMK is streets ahead in poll preparations, with Ministers and senior party functionaries involved in intense campaigning in all the places. Chief Minister Jayalalithaa will undertake a three-day tour of the Tuticorin, Tirunelveli and Coimbatore Corporations, from September 12, to campaign for the AIADMK candidates.

CM or not  Uddhav wants to run govtCM or not, Uddhav Thackeray wants to run state government
HT Correspondent , Hindustan Times  Mumbai, September 07, 2014
First Published: 22:36 IST(7/9/2014) | Last Updated: 11:33 IST(9/9/2014)
Uddhav Thackeray wants to run the next government in Maharashtra, even if he isn’t chief minister. That is assuming the Shiv Sena-BJP alliance comes to power.
 
A day after the Shiv Sena chief said in Nanded that bagging the chief ministership wasn’t his top priority, his party leaders insisted that the Sena hadn’t given up its claim to the post. They said Uddhav would directly or indirectly control the new government.
 
“Why should the Sena let go of the chief minister's post if we get more seats. And Uddhavji is our choice for chief minister,” said a senior Sena leader, requesting anonymity.
 
Asked on Sunday whether he had decided to give the chief minister’s post to the BJP,  Thackeray said his statement on Saturday was misreported. "Please listen to my statement again so that it is not misreported again. Being chief minister is not my dream or priority. My top agenda is to provide all the facilities that people in this state need."
 
Thackeray’s remarks on Saturday had created a stir among Sena workers and leaders, who have been projecting him as Maharashtra’s next CM.
 
Sena spokesperson and MP Sanjay Raut said Thackeray would lead the government from the front. “Maharashtra’s CM will be from the Shiv Sena,” Raut said.
 
There has been a logjam over seat distribution between the Sena and the BJP. After Thursday’s meeting between Thackeray and the BJP president Amit Shah, there appears to be an understanding that the seats will be shared more or less equally. If so, the party that wins more seats will stake claim to the CM’s post.
 
A Sena MP said the Sena-BJP would first come out with lists of candidates sure to win and then talk about those facing tough fights. “There is no number game for now. We will come out with lists on the basis of ability to win,” the MP told HT.

Rupee up 2 paise in early tradeUpdated: September 4, 2014 10:12 IST
Rupee up 2 paise in early trade
PTI
foreign exchange market
The rupee strengthened by two paise to 60.47 against the dollar in early trade on Thursday at the Interbank Foreign Exchange market on sustained foreign funds inflow amid increased selling of the American currency by exporters and banks.
The rupee had closed 19 paise higher at 60.49 against the dollar in Wednesday’s trade on weakening of the US currency amid reports of Russia and Ukraine agreeing to a ceasefire and continuing rise in local equities and sustained foreign funds inflows.
Forex dealers said increased selling of the American currency by exporters and banks supported the rupee but a lower opening of the domestic equity market and dollar’s rise against other currencies overseas restricted the gains.

Three reasons to stay in HK property stocks

Hong Kong property stocks have enjoyed a healthy run this year and according to analysts at Citi Research, the sector could benefit from further upside.
Home prices in the special administrative region`s market are among the world`s most expensive, with prices more than doubling since 2008 as buyers capitalized on low interest rates, and developers have been reaping the benefits.
Share prices of the city developers have surged in tandem; the industry`s stocks are up 19 percent year-to-date on average and hovering at 18-month highs.
"We believe the sector is just at the midpoint of its re-rating run," said Ken Yeung and Oscar Choi, real estate analysts at Citi Research in a note published on Thursday, flagging Henderson Land, Sino Land, SHKP and CKH  as their toppicks.
In the note, Yeung and Choi highlighted three main sweet spots set to spur property stocks higher this year.
Firstly, the Hong Kong government`s fast-tracking of pre-sale consents by allowing developers to sell property before it`s completed, should provide developers with a sales boost, they said. Also, the move by the government to accept lower land premiums, especially for larger sites for fewer bidders, is seen as beneficial for developers.
Finally, the Citi Research analysts said another encouraging factor was the reduced likelihood of further policy restrictions.
In recent years, Hong Kong authorities have rolled out a series of curbs to cool frothy housing prices. In 2012, for example, three new property taxes were rolled out in quick succession, including a 15 percent tax on foreign buyers which was meant to deter speculators from mainland China.
But property prices have continued to defy restrictions, hitting another record high in June. That`s prompted speculation that more curbs could be in store, although Citi analysts doubt it will be the case.
"Although home prices have reached record highs, the government will find it difficult to impose more demand-side curbs this time," said the analysts, who argued that end-user demand remained extremely strong.
"Property agencies have told us that 80 percent of the recent transactions were by end-users," the analysts added.
But analysts at research house CLSA have offered an opposite view on the sector, warning investors in a note published this week to take profit on developers.
"There area lot of bad signs. For example, people with the most money are not that interested and the people who are buying lower price properties are moving in, this is usually a red flag," she said.
"This is because the higher end of the market is the smart money - people who have invested multiple times, while at the lower end of the market are much less-experienced home buyers, who are attracted by price cuts. And we all know developers cut prices when the market is weak," she said, noting that this situation last occurred during the global financial crisis.
Denis Ma, head of research at JLL`s Hong Kong office, is also cautious on the sector noting that the sale volumes in recent months have been driven by developer discounts.
"There`s definitely more talk about heightened policy risk coming through as one thing this government doesn`t want to see are rising property prices," he added.
"There is a lot of supply coming on in the second half. So the rally we are seeing at the moment is pent up demand and that`s going to run its course and put a bit more pressure in the second half. We see prices falling between 10-15 percent for the full year of 2014," he added.

Investing.com - Investing.com - U.S. stock futures pointed to a lower open on Friday, ahead of upcoming U.S. jobs data as growing expectations that the Federal Reserve is growing closer to raising interest rates weighed on U.S. equity markets.
Ahead of the open, the Dow 30 futures pointed to a 0.33% fall, S&P 500 futures signaled a 0.37% decline, while the NASDAQ 100 futures indicated a 0.26% slump.
Investors were looking ahead to the latest U.S. employment report, due later on Friday, for further indications on the strength of the recovery in the labor market, a key factor in deciding the future path of monetary policy.
On Thursday, the ADP nonfarm payrolls report showed that the private sector added less jobs than expected in August.
Another report showed that the number of people who filed for unemployment assistance in the U.S. last week rose more than anticipated last week to 302,000.
Clothing retailers were likely to be in focus, as Gap Inc (NYSE:GPS) plunged 5.56% in late trading after posting sales below analysts' estimates for August.
Michael Kors Holdings Limited (NYSE:KORS) saw shares retreated 3.37% in extended trade after saying it is holding a secondary sale of 11.6 million shares behalf of Sportswear Holdings Ltd., its largest shareholder.
The energy sector was also expected to be active after a U.S. judge said on Thursday that BP (NYSE:BP) had been "grossly negligent" with regards to the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Shares in the oil and gas major gained 0.53% pre-market, after diving nearly 6% on Thursday.

Japan seeks exemption from MAT for its cos in India
Special Correspondent
economy (general)
Japan has asked India to “at once” exempt Japanese manufacturers operating in India from withholding and Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT).
Minister, Embassy of Japan, Isomata Akio, on Thursday, asked for this country-specific concession. He said he was raising the demand in view of Japan’s commitment to pledging investments worth Rs.2-lakh crore in India over the next five years.
