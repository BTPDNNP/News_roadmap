Relax

Fed day, the eight times a year Wall Street braces for the Federal Reserve’s regularly scheduled announcement in case it shows the central bank is planning something that could shake up U.S. financial markets, is fast approaching.
But at least based on what has happened so far under new Fed Chair Janet Yellen, investors have reason to relax.
Every six weeks the Fed’s open market committee meets to discuss monetary policy, and after the meeting it releases a statement. Roughly every other meeting the Fed chief then holds a press conference.
What those carefully worded paragraphs in the announcement say — or don’t say — about the economy and interest rates have the potential to immediately roil financial markets.
The same is true with what comes out of the press conference, if there is one.
This coming Wednesday is the next announcement and press conference following the FOMC’s two-day meeting.
Now, there’s obviously no telling exactly what the Fed or Yellen will say and how Wall Street will react that day.
But it’s easy enough to look at the reaction to recent FOMC announcements.
The FOMC has met four times since Janet Yellen took over as head of the Fed.
And the overall move in the stock market at the end of the day following those announcements was pretty boring.
The worst reaction was a 0.7% drop in the Dow Jones industrial average on March 19th. The best reaction was a 0.8% gain in the Standard & Poor’s 500 on June 18th.
But combine all four days, and on average the market ended almost dead even, with the Dow  down less than 0.1%, and the S&P up 0.1%.
However, it’s worth pointing on that on April 30th following that announcement the Dow closed at its first record of the year. And on June 18th after the next meeting the S&P notched its 20th record close of 2014.
Just remember, one of the golden rules on Wall Street is that past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Chennai Port shelves plan for container terminalUpdated: September 13, 2014 00:54 IST
Chennai Port shelves plan for container terminal

As per the new proposal, the project cost is scaled down to Rs.365 crore from Rs.475 crore.
The Chennai Port Trust (ChPT) has dropped its earlier plan of constructing container terminal at Jawahar Dock and instead opted for multi-cargo berth.
As per the new proposal, the project cost is scaled down to Rs.365 crore from Rs.475 crore. The multi-cargo berth is designed to handle 10 million tonnes per annum of cargo, instead of 0.8 million Twenty-foot Equivalent Units (TEUs) of containers.
A decision to this effect was taken by the ChPT following a lukewarm response it received from the Request for Qualification (RFQ) bidders for conversion of coal berth into container terminal.
Till three years back, the Jawahar Dock handled coal. It was suspended following a directive from the Madras High Court.
Later, coal and iron ore was shifted to Ennore’s Kamarajar Port.
Talking to The Hindu, a ChPT official said: “We have made some structural changes to our original plan, and removed key aspects from the scope of work. We have floated tenders calling for RFQ and the interested parties have to submit their proposals within 45 days. The successful bidder has to deploy four mobile harbour cranes.”

LIC Housing Finance sees pick up in disbursementsUpdated: September 13, 2014 00:55 IST
LIC Housing Finance sees pick up in disbursements
Special Correspondent
financial and business service
LIC Housing Finance Ltd (LICHFL) is expecting a strong growth in the current fiscal in the wake of a pick-up in disbursements, particularly in the individual loan category.
“We have seen a pick-up in disbursements in most of the regions of the country, and expect a healthy growth during this fiscal,” Sunita Sharma, Managing Director & CEO, LICHFL said here on Friday.
The company hopes to end the current fiscal with a growth of 20 per cent in its loan book. In 2013-14, it grew by 16 per cent.
She said the company was still offering loans at 10.10 per cent, among the lowest in the industry, for individual borrowers, who accounted for a major portion of its disbursements. Significant portion of its individual borrowers are middle-income salaried class people. The average loan size in individual borrower segment is about Rs.19 lakh.
Ms. Sharma said LICHFL’s net interest margin (NIM) would improve during this fiscal aided by reduced cost of borrowings and higher disbursements in LAP (loan against property) portfolio, among others.
The company intends to increase its reliance on low-cost NCDs (non-convertible debentures) and reduce its sourcing from banks, which accounted for 25 per cent of its borrowings as of March 31, 2014. It aims to reduce bank borrowing share to 20-21 per cent by the end of this year.
With this move, LICHFL expects the cost of funds to come down gradually, resulting in improvements in NIM.
It also expect the share of LAP portfolio, which gets higher margins, in the overall loan book to rise to high single digit from four per cent in Q1.

Seven persons, including two women, from Mizoram were arrested under Madhya Pradesh Freedom of Religion Act for allegedly offering money to a labourer to convert to Christianity in Badwah, Khargone district, late on Friday.
In a complaint, Sunil Prajapati, 42, said he was offered Rs one lakh to convert and was told that he would find peace in Christianity. While the Badwah police claimed that Sunil was the complainant, another version said local activists of the VHP and Bajrang Dal took up the matter with the police.
In-charge of Badwah Police Station V S Parihar told The Sunday Express that besides the seven accused from Mizoram, the police were also looking for three local persons who helped the missionaries in their attempt to convert more people.
Parihar said the accused were active in the region for nearly a month and a half and the local people were under an impression that they were teachers in a Christian school. The police are yet to approach the authorities of the educational institution to verify if they were indeed teachers. He said those arrested were sent to judicial custody on Saturday.

Photographer and blogger Brandon Stanton of the globally popular 'Humans of New York' blog and Facebook page was in Delhi on Friday and the humans of Delhi just couldn't get enough of him.

"For those of you in Delhi who want to say hello, I'll be in Central Park, Connaught Place at 6pm" — this post by Stanton on his Facebook page resulted in a crowd of more than a thousand people by 5pm.
Stanton, wearing a blue shirt, a colourful stole and an infectious smile, started by telling how he takes pictures of random strangers and gets them to tell him their incredible stories. "I always approach them from the front and take their permission before taking photographs," he said.
Brandon Stanton: The 'human of the world'
When he first started taking pictures of people in New York in 2010, he didn't always seek permission but does so know since the page and blog have become very popular.
Stanton is on a two-month world tour in partnership with the United Nations since August this year and has already visited Iraq, Jordan, Congo, Kenya, Uganda, South Sudan and Ukraine before arriving in India. His Indian sojourn began with a trip to Jammu, where his first click was that of a grandfather sitting on a cot with his grandson. The post says 'We are praying for the souls of our ancestors'.
Delhi was his next pit stop and he visited the India Gate lawns and then Central Park in Connaught Place.
As the crowd swelled, Stanton said he will take a group picture and asked everyone to gather for the photograph. It was then that a few Delhi Police personnel arrived at the spot, and started asking who he was and why a crowd had gathered. As they asked "Who is he with?", the crowd responded almost in unison — "He is with all of us!"

Things went a little out of control from there as Stanton started running towards his car, and the crowd began running after him with many girls screaming "Brandon we love you!". The melee attracted even a larger number of onlookers who had no idea about what or who they were looking at.
"A fire has broken out in the Palika Bazaar," said a man in the crowd and soon people were looking over their shoulders to locate the smoke and the fire. Many in the crowd whipped out their mobile phones to take pictures of the 'celebrity' and mobbed the car Stanton had gotten into.
 "Arre bhai kaun aaya hai? Salman Khan hai kya? (Who is it? Is it Salman Khan?)," asked one, only to get this gem of an answer: "Bata rahe hain Bradman aaya hai (They are saying Bradman has come)."
There was unruly behaviour too as some men tried to grope girls in the crowd. Some miscreants were caught and beaten up on the spot. Finally, around 6.10pm, Stanton's car managed to move out.
'Thanks to all of you who came to the meet-up in Delhi. It went about as well as a spontaneous meet-up could possibly go. Amazingly, we were able to have a pretty organised, calm speech. Until the very end, of course, when we ran from the police', said Stanton's post in the Humans of New York Facebook page.
