After having joined hands with each other politically, SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav and RJD president Lalu Prasad Yadav are all set to establish family ties. Lalu’s youngest daughter Raj Laksmhi is marrying Mulayam’s grandson and MP Tej Pratap Singh, sources said.
Lalu and his wife Rabri Devi, both former chief ministers of Bihar are coming to Lucknow on Sunday to perform a pre-engagement ceremony. The event will start with a ‘shagun’ ceremony at Mulayam’s residence, they said.
Lalu and Rabri would be accompanied by their son Tejaswi, eldest daughter Misa and other relatives, sources said.
On Mulayam’s side, CM Akhilesh Yadav, SP national general secretary Ram Gopal Yadav, senior cabinet minister Shivpal Singh Yadav and other family members would be present. A grand ring ceremony is scheduled in Delhi on December 16.
The two Yadavs are in the forefront of consolidation of opposition forces, bringing six constituents of the erstwhile ‘Janata Parivar’ under the banner of one party.
These parties include SP, Janata Dal (Secular), Rashtriya Janata Dal, Janata Dal (United), Indian National Lok Dal and Samajwadi Janata Party.

More US troops than planned to stay in Afghanistan:HagelBy: Associated Press | Kabul |
Posted: December 6, 2014 10:08 pm
U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said Saturday the United States will keep as many as 1,000 more troops in Afghanistan than planned for the first part of 2015.
At a news conference at the presidential palace with President Ashraf Ghani, Hagel said the original plan to cut U.S. troop levels to 9,800 by the end of this year had been abandoned, but not because of a recent surge in Taliban attacks.
Hagel said the U.S. will keep up to 10,800 troops for the first few months of next year and then restart the drawdown, which is scheduled to reach 5,500 troops by the end of 2015.
The U.S. decided to keep additional forces in the country temporarily because planned troop commitments by U.S. allies for a NATO train-and-assist mission starting in January have been slow to materialize.
President Barack Obama “has provided U.S. military commanders the flexibility to manage any temporary force shortfall that we might experience for a few months as we allow for coalition troops to arrive in theater,” he said. “But the president’s authorization will not change our troops’ missions, or the long-term timeline for our drawdown,” he added.
On his final visit to Afghanistan as U.S. defense secretary, Hagel said with striking optimism that he believes Afghans will successfully put down a surge in Taliban attacks in the capital and stabilize the nation.
Hagel arrived in Kabul on a previously unannounced trip one day after Obama declared he would nominate one of Hagel’s former deputies, Ashton Carter, to succeed Hagel, who resigned under pressure on November 24.
In an interview with reporters traveling with him from Washington aboard a military aircraft, Hagel was in a reflective mood about America’s longest war. He recalled arriving in Kabul in January 2002 as a member of a congressional delegation when security was so dicey that the lawmakers arrived under cover of darkness and left before dawn. Hagel at the time was a Republican senator from Nebraska.
The Taliban, which had ruled Afghanistan since 1996, were forced from power in late 2001 just weeks after a U.S.-led invasion prompted by the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
But they recovered gradually after the U.S. shifted its military focus to Iraq in 2003, and by 2008 the U.S. was conceding that the war in Afghanistan was stalemated. Hagel, on his fourth trip to Afghanistan as defense secretary, said it should not be surprising that the Taliban are still able to launch significant attacks in the capital.
“The Taliban are going to continue to have pockets of resurgence, and it’s predictable that they would do everything they possibly could to disrupt” the new Afghan government under Ghani and Chief Executive Officer Abdullah Abdullah, Hagel said.
The Taliban clearly are aiming continued…

Ex-Noida Authority Chairman Yadav Singh on blackmoney SITradarBy: Press Trust of India | New Delhi |
Posted: December 6, 2014 10:26 pm
Controversial Noida Authority official Yadav Singh, accused of amassing illegal wealth, has come under the scanner of the Special Investigation Team (SIT) on blackmoney as it on Saturday asked the CBDT to share information with ED so that money laundering charges could be pressed against him and his associates.
SIT Chairman Justice (retd) M B Shah and Vice-Chairman Justice (retd) Arijit Pasayat held a meeting and reviewed the case with CBDT officials led by Chairperson Anita Kapur and I-T officers from the investigations directorate in Lucknow who had carried out extensive raids last month on Singh’s premises and a number of companies with which his wife is believed to be associated with.
After the meeting, the SIT asked the Director General (I-T investigations) Lucknow to share information of this case with the Enforcement Directorate so that Yadav could also be investigated under the criminal provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).
The SIT, according to sources, has taken this case of alleged tax evasion seriously and it suspects generation of a huge amount of illegal funds in the capital, in which the I-T department has already seized huge cash and is scrutinising voluminous documents of real estate projects being executed by Yadav in the national capital region.
According to an official statement issued by the Finance Ministry, the SIT after the meeting, also asked Kapur to personally monitor the probe in the case.
I-T searches on the premises of Yadav and his wife last month had led to the recovery of huge cash, two kg gold and diamond jewellery even as the department has brought under its scanner over a dozen bank accounts of the duo and private firms operated by them.
“As the search (on Singh) is being conducted by Director General Lucknow, it was directed that Chairperson CBDT would monitor the search, seizure and further appropriate proceedings against Yadav Singh and other connected persons.
“DG and search officer (of the case) shall convey the information to the Director of the Enforcement Directorate to take appropriate action and to investigate the matter further from the angle of money laundering. Thereafter, SIT would further monitor the investigations,” the statement said.

Hyper-competition bad for telecom industry: ...Digital India
(Piyush Goyal, who was part…)
NEW DELHI: Asking government to take steps to rectify the structure of telecom industry, Vodafone India's chief Marten Pieters today said it is not possible for 10-11 operators to survive in the market.
Speaking during a panel discussion, Pieters also said that the government is taking a "backseat" on this issue of competition -- a charge which was immediately rejected by Union Minister Piyush Goyal who said at the same event that it was not the government's job to restrict competition.
Pieters, who said government needs to rectify the telecom industry structure to make initiatives like Digital India and smart cities a success, clarified that he was not against competition but felt that 'hyper-competition' has proved to be counterproductive for the industry.
"...the government is not responsible for our profits but it is responsible for the industry structure because it (telecom) is a heavily regulated industry... If the digital India agenda and the smart cities which the government is talking about and where we are all very supportive, if that needs to happen than you have to fix this problem, one way or the other," he said at the 'India Economic Conclave'.
Asserting that it was not possible for 10-11 telecom operators to survive in the market, Pieters said, "The industry structure is wrong, you need to rectify the industry structure... I have many discussions with the government... I think the government is taking too much, in my view, a backseat in this competitive issue."
Power and Coal Minister Piyush Goyal, who was part of the same panel, however said it was not the government's job to restrict competition to take care of the interests of the existing players.
"I think it's a little unfair to say that if one has boarded the train, the government should not allow others to board the train... So, I beg to disagree that its government's job to restrict the competition and take care of interests of existing players," Goyal said.
Pieters, immediately, clarified he is not asking to restrict competition, but he felt that giving six new licenses some years ago was not well thought through by the government, as the impact of that step has not been good overall.
"Of course competition is good, but hyper competition is counterproductive in this industry," Pieters added.
Across the globe, Vodafone India head said, usually there are 3-5 telecom operators in a country and the financial health of the fifth one is not very great. Its only the top two operators which make good profits, he claimed.
Pieters had earlier also said telecom industry in India was in a mess and it was a result of the thinking that more the competition, the better it is.

Former Union minister Arun Shourie talks about the ‘impenetrable fog’ that surrounds those who assume office and how the media makes it more dense.
P Vaidyanathan Iyer: What do you think about the government and the buzz around PM Narendra Modi’s style of functioning?
I don’t want to use harsh words but the  consensus seems to be that when all is said and done, more is said than done. I am sure sincere efforts are being made and they may yield results, but as Akbar Allahabadi said, ‘Plateon ke aane ki awaaz toh aa rahi hai, khaana nahin aa raha (The  plates’ sound can be heard but the food is not coming)’.
Harish Damodaran: Why is the food not coming?
In every government, including this one, the focus is on announcing new schemes. Each scheme adds a task to the hands of the government/state. People in office think their marks will depend on the number of schemes they have announced. Yet, in spite of all the talk, we do not attach importance to the State — its functioning, personnel, institutions, rules, etc. With the kind of personnel any government in India chooses for institutions, doe...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(31%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>december government rs year cent oil india minister dec police</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(26%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>november people times financial minister state government police friday chief</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(14%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>india modi bjp indian minister billion president party china state</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(8%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>year cent market rs bank month sales high growth years</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>financial times india company percent share rs ft coal shares</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>year financial people day government minister times modi cent women</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
