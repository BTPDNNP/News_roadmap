A US business advocacy group on Friday said that concrete action is needed to remove longstanding Indian trade and investment barriers even as it appealed to President Barack Obama to take up the issues with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Washington next week.
"Prime Minister Modi has declared India 'open for business'. But to reboot a troubled and under performing bilateral commercial relationship, he must translate promising rhetoric into real results," said Alliance for Fair Trade with India (AFTI) co-chair Linda Dempsey.
"Manufacturers remain hopeful positive progress can be achieved. We will be watching for outcomes that can put US-India trade and investment ties on a positive track and establish the foundation for a balanced and mutually beneficial partnership," Dempsey said after AFTI sent a letter to Obama urging action on the issues it raised.
Welcoming Modi's visit, AFTI noted his positive statements and early steps aimed at improving India's business climate, and urged Obama to prioritise action to strengthen intellectual property protection and enforcement in India and to remove Indian trade and investment barriers harming a wide range of US industry sectors from manufacturing, entertainment, and agriculture to telecom, solar energy, biopharmaceuticals, and semiconductors.
"Thus far, however, the new Indian government has pursued troubling policies of its own. In particular, the government abrogated the commitment India made at the World Trade Organization Ministerial in Bali in December, 2013 and thereby blocked the implementation of a global trade facilitation agreement agreed to unanimously by all 160 members of the WTO , a move that threatens to undermine the global rules-based trading system," the letter said.
"The new Indian government has also raised tariffs and imposed burdensome new testing requirements on information and communication technology products from the US and other countries. These actions send perplexing and contradictory new signals about India's role in the global marketplace," it said.
"Your meeting with Prime Minister Modi later this month is a critical opportunity to press for concrete action and real results that can drive economic growth in both our countries," the letter said addressing Obama.
"If the Prime Minister is serious about an economic reform agenda that would give India and the US a chance to reinvigorate bilateral trade and investment ties and build a deeper and more reciprocal commercial relationship, we stand ready to work with you and his government in that endeavour," said the letter.
"The Prime Minister's recent focus on establishing a uniform IP policy is a promising step toward reversing policy choices that have consistently undermined IP rights in the past," said Mark Elliot, co-chair of AFTI and executive vice president of the US Chamber of Commerce's Global Intellectual Property Centre.
"In his meeting with Prime Minister Modi, the opportunity is ripe for President Obama to foster an open dialogue on how both nations can advance shared innovation and leverage mutually beneficial investments essential to our economic growth," he said.

Rupee recovers by 19 paise on strong equitiesForex update: Rupee recovers 19 paise on strong equities, at 61.15 against US dollar

Breaking its four-day falling trend the rupee recovered by 19 paise to close at 61.15 against the Greenback following a smart rebound in the domestic equity market amid late dollar selling by exporters and some banks.
However, a firm dollar against other currencies overseas and sustained capital outflows capped the rupee rise to some extent, a dealer said.
At the Interbank Foreign Exchange (Forex) market, the domestic currency opened lower at 61.46 a dollar from previous close of 61.34 . During the day it declined further to an intra-day low of 61.62, the lowest level since August 8, 2014 when it had touched 61.74.
Forex dealers attributed fall in the domestic unit to continued dollar demand from importers, mainly oil refiners to meet their month-end needs as also weakness in local stocks.
Later, fag-end dollar selling by exporters and some banks and recovery in local equities pulled it back to a high of 61.00 before concluding at 61.15, revealing a rise of 19 paise (or 0.31 per cent). In last four sessions, it had plunged by 53 paise (or 0.87 per cent).
The dollar index was up by 0.14 per cent against its six major global rivals.
Pramit Brahmbhatt, Veracity Group CEO said, "Today Rupee traded volatile, in the first half it traded weak taking cues from strong dollar but in the second half local equities which opened on a weak note then recovered and closed in green as global rating agency upgraded India's credit outlook from negative to stable, which helped Rupee to gain and appreciate."
The benchmark Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) Sensex was down by nearly 248 points in afternoon trade, but later bounced back as ratigns agency Standard & Poors (S&P) upgraded the country's credit ratings and settled up by 157.96 points (or 0.60 per cent)
Meanwhile, Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) pulled out US $68.21 million on Thursday as per data released by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi).

Red tape binds mars India s space flightsRed tape mars India's space flights

As India celebrated becoming the first Asian nation to reach Mars , S.M. Vaidya, head of business at conglomerate Godrej's aerospace division that made the spacecraft's engine and thruster components, sounded surprisingly downbeat.
The mission was, indeed, a major achievement, he said, and one of which the state-run Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) should be proud.
But a single trip to Mars was not enough to sustain a promising yet relatively small industry, he added, and ISRO should be doing more to foster it.
"Unless they fly more, they will not buy more from us," Vaidya told Reuters, shortly after news broke on Wednesday that Mangalyaan, Hindi for "Mars craft", had entered into orbit around the Red Planet about 10 months after launching.
"How many Mars missions are you going to have?"
India's successful mission, completed on a shoestring budget of $74 million, has boosted its prestige in the global space race and, back on Earth, raised the profile of Indian companies involved in the project.
But Godrej and some other firms are frustrated at what they say is the slow execution of projects and lack of government support, which are hampering India's efforts to compete with China and Russia as a cheaper option for launching satellites.
ISRO did not reply to questions for this article.
The Mangalyaan was built in 15 months with two-thirds of its parts manufactured by domestic firms such as Godrej & Boyce and India's largest engineering company, Larsen & Toubro.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said he wants to expand India's 50-year-old space programme. The government has increased funding for space research by 50 percent to almost $1 billion this financial year.
But the programme is still small, and the small number of launches limits the growth potential of private companies that supply them.
Between 2007 and 2012, ISRO accomplished about half of its planned 60 missions, government data showed. The government cited "development complexity" as the reason for the delay in some missions.
Between 2012 and 2017 the target is 58 missions. The agency has completed 17 missions so far, and ISRO did not say why the number remained low.
Some company executives and experts do not see that changing any time soon, with the absence of heavy rocket launchers, too few launch facilities and bureaucratic delays hampering growth.
MARS MEANS MORE FOR SOME
Larsen & Toubro, which manufactured motor casings and the antenna for Mars probe, is more positive about working with the ISRO, saying it has opened doors to other commercial opportunities.
Space projects have helped enhance its expertise in other sectors such as defence and aerospace, including missile technology and welding, said M. V. Kotwal, president of L&T's heavy engineering division.
"Volumes of business (from ISRO) have been relatively small, of the order of $40 million over the last five years, but the technological fallout in terms of high-precision manufacture has been considerable," Kotwal told Reuters.
L&T has been working with ISRO for over four decades and between 1-5 percent of its heavy engineering division's revenues come from ISRO.
Godrej wanted to explore opportunities with U.S. and European space programmes after its success in India, but Vaidya said government-to-government clearances posed a hurdle.
"We don't want to be only dependent on ISRO," he said.
Now Godrej plans to shift focus from space technology to the aviation export industry, catering to the likes of Boeing Co (BA.N) and Airbus and trimming ISRO's contribution to their aerospace business to 40 percent from 70 percent currently.
HANDFUL OF LAUNCHES
India's space programme began in the early 1960s and the country has launched 30 Indian and 40 foreign satellites.
The programme developed mainly after Western powers imposed sanctions following India's first nuclear weapons test in 1974.
Still, it remains a small player in a global space industry estimated to be worth more than $300 billion a year.
India performs only a handful of launches annually, compared with 20 or more carried out by the United States, Russia and China, according to the Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses (IDSA), a defence ministry think-tank.
ISRO has struggled to develop heavier launchers to put larger payloads into space, which could attract more business from foreign nations and help it compete.
Progress slowed in the 1990s when, under U.S. pressure, Russia refused to transfer cryogenic engine technology to India that could have helped develop a heavier capacity Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV).
After spending over a decade developing the complex engine, India successfully launched its first GSLV powered with an indigenous cryogenic engine earlier this year.
"They have to make that (GSLV) reliable ... we need three or four launches to claim it is efficient," said Mayank Vahia, a scientist at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research.
Vahia recommended that ISRO allowed private companies more freedom to develop space technologies, saying the organisation was excessively conservative.
"ISRO needs to put more faith in the industry to deliver the kind of technology they want," he said.
ISRO said last year it planned to bring in the private sector to produce Polar Satellite Launch Vehicles (PSLVs) within five years, allowing it to focus on research.
Ajay Lele of the IDSA said the privatisation of programmes with a proven track record, such as the PSLV, should have started sooner.
Space startups also complained about the lack of state support.
Susmita Mohanty, head of Earth2Orbit (E2O), said India lacked the kind of support given in the United States, such as NASA's Small Business Innovation Research programme which offers funds for research and development of technologies that fulfil its needs.
"With the new pro-business government in Delhi, we are hopeful that we can put the spotlight on 'space commerce', not just 'space diplomacy'," she told Reuters via email.

Gold has witnessed the biggest rise since June 20 this year when it had gained Rs 605 to Rs 28,625 per ten grams.

As regulators and the government seek to provide greater safeguards for foreign and domestic investors, the stock exchanges will soon put in place a new framework to provide guidance to listed companies on making right disclosures, Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) CEO Ashish Kumar Chauhan said.
This will enable the companies understand beforehand what kinds of disclosures they are required to make for investors to take informed decisions and help remove ambiguities and avoid unnecessary trouble for companies at a later stage, Chauhan said.
"One thing I would like to assure the international investors is that the Indian regulatory framework today is at the forefront of modern thinking about investor protection and investor rights," Chauhan told PTI in an interview in New York.
The BSE CEO, who is in the Big Apple to participate in various business events planned in the backdrop of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's five-day visit to the United States, also said that the capital markets regulator Sebi (Securities and Exchange Board of India), the Ministry of Finance and the Corporate Affairs Ministry have strived in the last six months or so to ensure that investors' rights are protec...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(45%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>modi pm people september minister chief october india de prime</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(17%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>india modi bjp indian minister billion president party china state</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>year cent market rs bank month sales high growth years</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(8%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>november people times financial minister state government police friday chief</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>financial times india company percent share rs ft coal shares</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
