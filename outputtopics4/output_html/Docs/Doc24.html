Boulder Brands BDBD   tumbled 24% to $9.62 Wednesday after the food products marketer said third and fourth quarter earnings would be lower-than-expected.
The Colorado-based company, which owns several health foods lines, including leading gluten-free brand Glutino,  “faced a number of headwinds” during the third-quarter, according to CEO Stephen Hughes,  including larger-than-expected declines in sales of its Smart Balance margarine substitute, which continues to pressure gross profit margins.
Boulder, scheduled to formally post earnings Nov. 6, says it expects third-quarter earnings of 8 cents a share, down from prior guidance 10 to 12 cents. Revenue is expected to come in at $134 million, 13% above year-ago results, but below consensus estimates of $142 million.
The news came a day after Mario Gabelli’s Gamco Investors funds  disclosed that it had boosted its Boulder Brands stake about 50%, to 4.51 million shares. Gamco now holds a 7.4% stake in the company. It accumulated about 2.7 million shares in 2013 at an average price of about $12.
Boulder Brands briefly touched a $8.72, 52-week low earlier Wednesday.  Despite being an often-mentioned takeover target, shares have been market laggards for much of 2014, falling 46% from April’s $17.94 peak.

Samsung s Virtual Flame cooktop swaps fire forSamsung's Virtual Flame Cooktop Swaps Fire for LEDs
Feast your eyes on the Samsung Virtual Flame induction cooktop.
Keith Barry
October 22, 2014
American consumers are understandably freaked out by induction cooktops . Because they use magnets to directly heat pans, the cooktops themselves don't get hot.
Without the dancing flame of a gas burner or the comforting glow of an electric coil, induction seems cool and distant—like the love interest in a Raymond Chandler novel.
That's why Samsung's latest Chef Collection induction range uses LED lighting embedded in the cooktop's surface to mimic the visual feedback that gas offers. When the pan heats up, the lights glow brighter. When the pan cools down, they dim.
"When we analyzed induction cooking, we found that consumers are more comfortable with clear visual cues that show they are controlling the heat level," said Kevin Dexter, Samsung's Senior Vice President of Home Appliances for the U.S. market.
Samsung's Virtual Flame glows in accordance with how hot your pots and pans get.
It's somewhat ironic that consumers demand visual feedback, as it's merely a byproduct of indirect cooking's inefficiency. Still, generations of home chefs have learned to cook with their eyes.
Virtual Flame debuts on the NE58H9970WS, part of Samsung's Chef Collection . It includes many of the features we've lauded on previous Samsung ranges—including the Flex Duo divided cavity, and the Guiding Light control panel. It's already on sale, with an MSRP of $3,699.

The unemployment rate is below 5% in 15 states, with North Dakota leading at 2.8%.
But there’s more slack in the labor force than the Federal Reserve knows , says Bank of America, especially if you define slack as “people working in jobs they’re vastly overqualified for.”

Buybacks have far outpaced revenue growth for the U.S. stock market in the modern age and these three companies – IBM, McDonald’s and Coca-Cola — are emblematic of what that looks like as the fairy dust begins to wear off. 
Third Point LLC, a hedge fund, wants Amgen to break itself in two, using the faddish argument that narrowly focused companies outperform.  (Remember when it was good to be diversified?) Amgen is up 24.7% this year, including dividends, clobbering the S&P 500 and edging out the average biotech fund, Morningstar says.
Federal regulators have completed their overhaul of rules for mortgage lending , omitting a mandatory amount for a down payment, making it easier for borrowers to buy a home, but also easier for them to lose money.

Panic selling rarely pays off — except for the investors buying stocks from those who are doing the panicking. And that pattern repeated again in October.
There are five stocks in the Standard & Poor’s 500, including oil company Chesapeake Energy (CHK), carrier Delta Air Lines (DAL) and computer chipmaker Xilinx (XLNX) that have jumped 15% or more from their beaten-down levels on Oct. 15, 2014. And get this — you should have known about two of the five stocks ahead of time had you paid attention to the analysts and America’s Markets. Both Delta and Xilinx were stocks that analysts saw as opportu...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(26%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>year financial people day government minister times modi cent women</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(24%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>year cent market rs bank month sales high growth years</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(18%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>financial times india company percent share rs ft coal shares</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>november people times financial minister state government police friday chief</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>rs company cent india october growth market year ist global</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>india modi bjp indian minister billion president party china state</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
