He was once a valuable part of ABC's "Good Morning America," but today, Sam Champion has no love for the network morning show genre.
"Morning television is getting to the point where I need a costume malfunction moment," the Weather Channel anchor told HuffPost Live in a Thursday interview. "It's getting ... to a hysteria of everything's gotta be flashing all the time."
And while the loud antics are of concern to the "AMHQ" co-host, so are the content offerings.
"Let's just say, on any given day if you're watching a network morning show, I'm going to find a cast of the 'Housewives,' I'm going to find a 'Dancing' star, I'm going to find a musical concert, I'm going to find shopping," he explained. "That's morning television.  But it isn't, and it shouldn't be."
Champion's "AMHQ" program will be focusing on "stories you're not going to find in mainstream media." He went on to say that "the audience wants to see [those] more."
"I think you want to be smarter when you walk out the door," he said. "So let's talk about things that will impact you."

Wholesale inflation drops to 5-year low of 1.77%India's wholesale price inflation dropped to a five year low of 1.77% in October over continuing decline in food prices, including vegetables.
The Wholesale Price Index (WPI) based inflation was at 2.38% in September and 7.24% in October 2013.
As per data released by the government on Friday, the food inflation fell to a nearly two-and-half year low of 2.7%.
Food inflation is on decline since May. The sharp drop in WPI inflation, which fell for the fifth month in a row, came at the back of retail inflation declining to a record low of 5.52% in October.
The rate of price rise in onion contracted 59.77% as compared to a contraction of 58.12% in September.
In case of vegetables, the contraction was 19.61%, while in protein rich items of egg, meat and fish it was 2.58% in October.
During the month, inflation in potato stood at 82.11%, against 90.23% in the previous month.
Inflation in manufactured products, like sugar, edible oils, beverages and cement, fell to 2.43% in October as against 2.84% in the previous month.
The August WPI inflation was revised higher to 3.85% from 3.74% earlier, the data said. Inflation in the fuel and power segment which include LPG, petrol and diesel declined to 0.43 % as compared to price rise of 1.33% in September.
The Reserve Bank which maintained status quo in interest rate since January, will come out with the monetary policy review on December 2. The RBI factors in retail inflation while formulating its monetary policy.
Slowing inflation builds case for RBI rate cut 
The decline in both retail and WPI inflation for October, coupled with improvement in industrial output for September, will put pressure on the RBI to lower interest rates to boost growth.
An uptick in manufacturing and capital goods pushed industrial output to a three-month high of 2.5% in September. Industry has been demanding easing of interest rates to boost growth, which has slumped to 4.7% in 2013-14.
The economy is estimated to grow in the range of 5.4-5.9% this fiscal.
Friday's data comes days after consumer price inflation had dropped to 5.52 percent in October, below the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) 6 percent target for January 2016.
"With inflation at or under 6 percent we think RBI is likely to face pressure to ease, not just from the government, but also from RBI's own policy committee," said Devika Mehndiratta, a senior economist at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd in Singapore.
She expects retail inflation to hit a low of close to 4 percent in November, opening up an opportunity for a 25 basis points interest rate cut in the second quarter of 2015.
Indian businesses have been pleading for a cut in interest rates, which are among the highest in Asia, to stimulate consumption in a domestic demand-driven economy.
Consumer goods output - a proxy for consumer demand that drives 60 percent of India's economy - has grown in just two of the last 21 months. It fell an annual 4.0 percent in September.
The RBI is meeting on Dec. 2 to review policy, having kept its key repo rate steady at 8.0 percent since January.
A Reuters poll last month had shown that economists expected rates to be held unchanged until well into next year, due to worries that price pressures would revive once a favourable base effect fades out and food prices rise after a poor summer rains.
Bond traders are betting on one of the biggest interest rate reductions among major emerging markets once the rate cutting cycle begins.
The 10-year benchmark bond yield had dropped 36 basis points since Oct. 1 until the last session on hopes of a rate cut.

New Tyranny of Silence book: Danish Cartoon Crisis editor weighs what hed change -- and what he would notBy Michael Cavna November 14 Follow @comicriffs
EDITOR’S NOTE: One of the more ignorant things I occasionally hear people say in my line of work is that a certain artwork is “just a cartoon.” If they had any understanding of the hot thunderclap power of a single image upon the brain’s hard-wiring, they would instead say warily, “Oh my, it’s a CARTOON.” This interview reminds of the potential potency, for good or ill, for right or wrong, of a distilled still image.

AMID THE MURDER threats and security alerts and thrown axes, Flemming Rose is not, he says, confrontational by nature.
Rose is best known as the Danish newspaper editor who — in reaction to what he saw as increasing self-censorship by visual and verbal artists — nearly a decade ago commissioned 12 cartoonists to express their thoughts about Islam and freedom of expression. Rose, then the culture editor of Jyllands-Posten, saw this not as a provocative stunt, he says, but rather as an act of journalism.
His 2005 commission of these works — including the most socially incendiary: Kurt Westergaard’s depiction of a Muslim wearing a bomb-like turban — would ignite the “Cartoon Crisis,” as Rose terms it, capitalized. These cartoons would lie near the cultural center of a maelstrom of international events within several years, including protests and attacks in such hot spots as Libya and Nigeria, and upon Danish embassies, and more than 100 deaths.
