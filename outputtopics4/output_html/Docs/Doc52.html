The storm is moving medium fast, about 2.5 million mph (4.02 million kph), meaning the soonest it could arrive is early Friday
A strong solar flare is blasting its way to Earth, but the worst of its power looks like it will barely skim above the planet and not cause many problems.
It has been several years since Earth has had a solar storm of this size coming from sunspots smack in the middle of the sun, said Tom Berger, director of the Space Weather Prediction Centre in Boulder, Colorado, U.S.. The flare on the sun barely hits the “extreme” on forecasters’ scale, but with its worst effects missing Earth it is only looking “potentially strong” at most when it arrives at Earth as a solar storm, he said.
So while the power grid may see fluctuations because the storm will cause changes in Earth’s magnetic field, it won’t knock power systems off line, Mr. Berger said. It may cause slight disturbances in satellites and radio transmissions but nothing major.
The storm is moving medium fast, about 2.5 million mph (4.02 million km/hr), meaning the soonest it could arrive is early Friday. But it could be later, Mr. Berger said.

Chicago among least expensive cities for car insurance  study saysDetroit has most expensive car insurance rates in the country, study says
Charlotte, N.C. has the cheapest car insurance rates in the nation, study shows
Chicago is among the least expensive cities for car insurance according to a new study released Thursday.
The Chicago metro ranked fifth-least expensive, with car insurance costing 16 percent less than the national average according to the report. It trails Charlotte, which has the cheapest, according to the study by insuranceQuotes.com, which ranks the 25 largest U.S. metropolitan areas. 
The most expensive car insurance can be found in Detroit where drivers pay on average, 165 percent more than the national average. The Motor City, is followed by New York City, Miami and Los Angeles.
Most cities with high auto insurance rates are densely populated, have heavy traffic and higher crime rates, according to Laura Adams, senior insurance analyst at insuranceQuotes.com.
"The fact that Chicago has (comprehensive) public transportation may help keep the number of cars off the road, leading to fewer claims," she said. 
The only thing this proves is that you can use selective interpretation of numbers to prove anything you want.
