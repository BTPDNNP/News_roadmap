"If you drew two circles, one for the mayor and one for Bruce, they'd definitely overlap in parts," said Kent Dauten, a managing director of Chicago investment firm Keystone Capital who has donated to both Emanuel and Rauner.
"As I travel for business nationally, a lot of business people I interact with kind of say, 'How's Obama's guy doing as mayor?' pretty skeptically and I say he's doing very well and he's very pro-business and pro-jobs," Dauten said. "And people definitely think that way about Bruce Rauner too."
Emanuel's decisions to close public schools and trim some city services have helped make him unpopular with some of the very voting groups Quinn needs to cultivate in Chicago, among them African-Americans, lower-income residents and city workers. The mayor and governor also have clashed over issues ranging from appointments at joint city-state government boards to Quinn's dim view of Emanuel-backed plans for a Chicago casino.
Those are perhaps reasons enough why the two Democrats don't share a podium more often as each focuses on improving his political standing. But Emanuel's muted campaign presence in the hotly contested race for governor contrasts sharply with his energetic effort to re-elect Obama and other Democrats in 2012.
The mayor traversed the country for his fellow Democrats, headlining fundraisers, appearing on national talk shows to defend his former boss and counterattacking Republicans in his trademark style.
Emanuel has amassed more than $8 million for the 2015 city elections, but there is little evidence he is helping Quinn keep up with Rauner's spending spree.
Emanuel spokeswoman Kelley Quinn pointed out that Emanuel contributed $50,000 to Quinn's campaign and said he "will continue his efforts to support the governor though this election."
"Mayor Emanuel believes Bruce Rauner is not right for the future of Chicago or Illinois, regardless of any personal relationship," she said in an email. "From minimum wage to gun control, and defending the rights of workers, women and gay marriage, Bruce Rauner is the wrong choice."
While Emanuel has taken his swipes at Rauner, they have fallen short of his traditional aggressiveness.
On a recent morning on the Northwest Side, Emanuel was asked if Rauner should release his full tax returns to the public — an obvious opening to take a shot at Rauner, who has been routinely criticized by Quinn as too rich and too out-of-touch to become governor.
But while Emanuel said that, yes, Rauner should release the full returns as Quinn and the mayor have done, he didn't mention Rauner by name. The mayor said only that releasing full tax returns — which Rauner refuses to do — is a political "rite of passage."
Bill Daley, the former mayor's brother and Emanuel's successor as White House chief of staff, said he doesn't think the mayor "helps or hurts" either candidate for governor. Daley said last year that Quinn could not get re-elected but dropped his own short-lived challenge to the governor.
Emanuel doesn't have a "general base of voters" that he can bring for Quinn. As for Emanuel's friendship with Rauner, Daley said, "I don't think that relationship in a campaign means diddly."
An adviser close to Emanuel said that since Rauner began his bid for governor, he and the mayor don't speak as much as they had in recent years.
The two men famously got to know each other after Emanuel left his post as a top adviser in the Clinton White House to become an investment banker. In the 21/2 years before he quit to run for the U.S. House, Emanuel earned more than $16 million, largely by brokering high-profile mergers and acquisitions, according to congressional disclosures.
One of Emanuel's biggest deals was representing Rauner's Chicago-based venture capital firm, then called GTCR Golder Rauner, in buying the SecurityLink home security unit from SBC Communications in 2001. Rauner credited Emanuel with keeping the deal alive. GTCR bought the company for $479 million and sold it less than six months later for $1 billion.

Krugman: The U.S. Is Doing Worse Than Japankrugman: the u.s. is doing worse than japan
Acura combines two middling sedans into one competent model with the 2015 TLX0
This is a symptom of other nine-speed transmissions on the market, and it had us wishing for the alacrity of the dual-clutch setup in the four-cylinder TLX. Fortunately, all models come with various driving modes for the car, and leaving the TLX in Sport cured some of these ills.
Regardless of what's propelling the TLX, Acura deserves credit for making it feel hearty and comfortable over rough roads. It rides as well as anything with a German badge on it. The interior is similarly well-executed, with fine leather covering deeply scalloped seats, and soft materials stretching into every corner.
This being an Acura, the TLX gets the company's dual-screen setup in the cockpit. Wedged deep into the upper dashboard is a primary screen that displays the navigation map (if equipped) and stereo; below this is a touch screen and physical buttons to control the main screen.
Promising in theory, the system is frustrating. The touch screen doesn't do many of the functions you might expect, and it's not obvious which screen you should be looking at during which function.
Space inside this car is closer to that of the outgoing TL than the smaller TSX. Tall adults fit in the back seats without head or knee contact, but it's cozy. The trunk gobbles up plenty of luggage.
Outside, the TLX's styling is tasteful and subdued but doesn't offer much new for the brand. At least Acura wisely toned down the odd, metallic, beak-like grille that has scarred the face of previous vehicles. The brand's new design signature is now its "jewel eye" LED headlights, which are standard on all TLXs.
As mentioned, the TLX starts at $31,890 for the base four-cylinder edition. The highlights of the TLX's standard gear are the heated front seats, a moon roof, seven air bags, a touch screen stereo system, alloy wheels and the aforementioned LED headlights.
The four-cylinder version we grabbed sold for $35,920 and added the navigation system with real-time traffic, leather seats, a 10-speaker stereo system, lane-keeping assist, blind spot monitoring and forward collision warning.
At the top of the TLX heap was the loaded AWD V-6 model. For $45,595, it offers all the aforementioned add-ons plus adaptive cruise control, pre-collision braking, cooled front seats, remote start and parking sensors.
At any of those price points, the TLX sells for less than its German competitors, as well as the Lexus IS and ES and the Cadillac ATS. This could be a crucial factor in the success of this Acura, especially as prices in this sport sedan segment keep climbing.
Most of those rivals have more sport baked into them. And it's a pity Acura didn't mix the handling and power of the AWD V-6 with the shifting prowess of the base model's dual-clutch transmission.
But for straightforward luxury, it's nice to see Acura rediscover some of its mojo.

NEW YORK (AP) — Major U.S. stock indexes are back at record highs after a turbulent month.

The Dow Jones industrial average rose 194 points, or 1.1 percent, to close at an all-time high of 17,390 Friday. The Standard & Poor's 500 reached its own record, climbing 23 points, or 1.2 percent, to 2,017.
The Nasdaq rose 64 points, or 1.4 percent, to 4,630.
Japan's benchmark index soared 5 percent to its highest level since 2007.

Minnesota Restaurant Drops  African  From Name Because Of Ebola PanicKellita Whisnant, the owner of an African restaurant in Minnesota, says Ebola panic has gotten so intense in her neighborhood that she had to change the name of her eatery from MaMaTi's African Kitchen to MaMaTi's Kitchen and Deli.
The Liberian-born 35-year-old has already taped over the word "African" in the Brooklyn Park restaurant's sign.
"It was pretty emotional for me. I didn't think it would be," Whisnant told The Huffington Post on Friday afternoon.

Whisnant said she has added new items like Philly cheesesteaks and burritos to her menu, in an effort to attract customers who may associate the African food she usually serves with the virus. She said that the Ebola anxiety has gotten so bad that people have dropped into the restaurant asking whether it was under quarantine or if anyone in there had Ebola.
Earlier this month, Whisnant told The New York Times that business had slowed drastically at the restaurant over Ebola fears . Sales have dropped by 50 percent since the summer when the Ebola crisis worsened in Africa, she told local Fox affiliate KMSP , because people are afraid of catching the virus through food.
Whisnant said she spoke to a friend who heard someone calling her food "Ebola shit."
So far the name change hasn't helped much, Whisnant said. But she's hopeful.
"God don't put us through anything we can't handle," she said.
The panic Whisnant is describing is unfounded. Ebola only spreads through direct contact with the bodily fluids of a symptomatic infected person , and not through food. While there have been a few isolated cases in the U.S., nearly 5,000 people have died of the virus in West Africa since March, according to the World Health Organization .

Bharti Softbank Acquires 36.5% Stake in ScoopWhoop
Press Trust of India | Updated On: November 03, 2014 12:15 (IST)
SpiceJet Pilots Flocking to Other Airlines: Report
New Delhi: Bharti Softbank, a joint venture company of Bharti Enterprises and Japan-based Softbank Corporation, on Monday said it has acquired 36.5 per cent equity stake in entertainment media startup ScoopWhoop.
Though the company did not disclose value of the deal but industry sources said it is worth Rs 10 crore.
"...that it has acquired equity stake in ScoopWhoop Media Private Limited (ScoopWhoop) through BSB Portal Limited," Bharti Softbank (BSB) said in a statement.
BSB Portal Limited is a joint venture of BSY Pte. Ltd, which is a JV between BSB and Yahoo Japan Corporation.
"The partnership will combine the strengths of both - i.e., content creation for Indian youth by ScoopWhoop and mobile-optimised technology platform and distribution by BSB for Indian consumers," the company said.
ScoopWhoop is an India focused entertainment media startup that creates and curates content that gets shared through social networks.
Its website and mobile application clock approximately 20 million monthly page views and have over 8 million unique visitors each month.
Over half of all the page views are accessed via smartphones, underlining the strong mobile play.
"About a half of India's population are under 25 years old and the use of social networks with smartphones is growing rapidly among this segment. We believe the partnership offers immense synergies for both parties to create great content experience for India's mobile internet population," BSB Portal Limited CEO Madhu Nori said.
India is the world's second largest mobile market with over 900 million subscribers. A vast youth population and a fast growing economy are expected to drive data usage on mobiles with the proliferation of 3G and 4G services and increasing smartphone penetration.
According to the GSMA, India will become the second largest mobile broadband market globally within the next four years with 367 million mobile broadband connections by 2016.
"We are really happy with what we have achieved in the last one year since we started ScoopWhoop in August 2013, but we also know that we have a long road ahead," ScoopWhoop co-founder and CEO Sattvik Mishra said.

Flipkart  Snapdeal Emerge Favourites in Campus PlacementsSpiceJet Pilots Flocking to Other Airlines: Report
E-tailors such as Flipkart, Snapdeal and Amazon have emerged as the new favourites among thousands of engineering and B-Schools graduates looking for their first placement, a survey by industry body Assocham has found.
More than 71 per cent of respondents in the survey, carried among 500 students from various campuses including the prestigious Indian Institute of Managements (IIMs), showed an inclination towards the fast-growing e-commerce sector as compared to traditional sectors such as FMCG, telecom and real estate.
The shift towards the e-commerce sector shouldn't come as a surprise. Companies such as Flipkart and Snapdeal, flush with new funding and on a high on the back of record sales, are offering between Rs 10 lakh to 25 lakh in annual salaries to 20-somethings passing out of engineering and MBA colleges, the survey has found.
That's miles ahead from competition, which is still stuck in a pay bracket of Rs 4 lakh to Rs 7 lakh on an average, Assocham says.
This year, salaries offered by e-tailors are on an average 15-45 per cent higher as compared to last year, the survey notes. Assocham secretary general DS Rawat says e-tailors have hired 65 per cent more freshers this season as compared to last year.
Assocham expects India's e-commerce sector to add 5 lakh to 8 lakh new jobs in three to five years.
These companies have also gone big on hiring interns for summer placements. According to media reports, companies such as Snapdeal have offered stipends of more than Rs 50,000 per month for summer interns.
Factors driving the hiring boom:
Assocham says the e-commerce industry has experienced unprecedented growth with its total revenue increasing over 60 times between 2010 and 2014. Consulting firm Technopak estimates the size of the domestic e-tailing industry to soar from current $2.3 billion to $32 billion by 2020.
The spectacular growth over the years and future potential has attracted huge investments in the e-commerce sector. Snapdeal, India's third biggest e-tailor founded four years ago has raised about $1 billion this calendar year alone. Its bigger rival Flipkart became the first internet company to raise $1 billion this July.
Analysts say fresh funding will help these e-tailors expand quickly in a country with the world's third-largest internet user base, but relatively underdeveloped e-commerce.

Tribune Publishing hires former WSJ exec Michael Rooney as first chief revenue officer
Tribune Publishing has named veteran media sales executive Michael Rooney to the newly created position of chief revenue officer, the company announced Monday.
Rooney, who most recently served as chief revenue officer for The Wall Street Journal, will head up national sales and marketing efforts for Tribune Publishing beginning Nov. 10. He will be based out of New York and will report to Tribune Publishing CEO Jack Griffin.

"We are privileged to have someone of Michael's expertise and stature join the company as our first-ever chief revenue officer," Griffin said in a statement. "Michael is a proven and well-recognized leader with a significant track record of helping companies diversify their portfolio and grow their revenue base."
The appointment of Rooney fills the void left by Bob Fleck, Tribune Publishing's former executive vice president of advertising, who shifted last week to become publisher and general manager of 38 suburban Chicago newspapers bought for the Chicago Tribune Media Group from the rival Sun-Times Media.
The new position of chief revenue officer reflects Rooney's broader responsibilities, and the importance of developing and diversifying revenue under Griffin. Rooney will look to boost declining national advertising revenues for Chicago-based Tribune Publishing, which includes the Chicago Tribune, Los Angeles Times and eight other daily newspapers.
