Major ports handle more cargo in November

Backed by coal and fertilizers, 12 major ports in India handled 48.55 million tonnes of cargo during October 2014 against 43.98 million tonnes in the corresponding period last year.
Barring Haldia Dock Complex and New Mangalore Port Trust, all the other ports recorded a growth of 5.33 per cent against 4.64 per cent in October 2014.
The total cargo handled by these ports from April to November 2014 touched 384.59 million tonnes against 365.11 million tonnes for the year-ago period.
Though the Shipping Ministry had set a target of 604.45 million tonnes of cargo for 2014-15 for the major ports, the current output is less than two-third of actual target. Going by the current trend, Kamarajar Port (formerly Ennore Port) and Mormugao Port might hit the target ahead of schedule. As the port sector has been recording average monthly growth of about 50 million tonnes, it might not be easy to surpass the target, say industry observers.
During the eight-month period, Mormugao Port, Kamarajar Port and V.O. Chidambaranar Port posted double-digit growth of 22 per cent, 16 per cent and 10 per cent, respectively. Compared with the previous month, there was a tremendous variation in the cargo handled by Kolkata Dock System, Chennai Port Trust and Kandla Port.
On the container front, these ports handled 5.3 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) against 4.9 million TEUs, marking an increase of 8.3 per cent. The growth in other cargo was 12 per cent. The variation in import of petroleum, oil and lubricants compared to the previous month was 1.36 per cent.
Iron ore was handled by six major ports. There was a 29 per cent drop in iron ore volume handled by the ports of Kolkata, Paradip, Visakhapatnam, New Mangalore and Mormugao during November. Kandla saw an increase of 16 per cent in its iron ore handling.

Sinking bond yields likely to ease banks  stressSinking bond yields likely to ease banks' stress
Somasroy Chakraborty | Kolkata Dec 11, 2014 09:35 PM IST
The sustained rally in Indian bond prices has offered bankers a reason to celebrate. They, specially public sector ones, are expected to make hefty profits from treasury operations in the current (October-December) quarter, as bond yields continue to fall on hopes of a policy rate cut early next year. On Thursday, the benchmark 10-year government bond yield dipped below 7.88 per cent intra-day, the lowest since July 15 last year.
Analysts believe many state-run banks will be tempted to cash this opportunity and book treasury profits, to cushion the impact of slow interest income growth on earnings. For some quarters, interest income growth has been slowing. Loan growth moderated to 10 per cent in the September quarter. Treasury profits will also help banks make up for the deficit provisions for non-performing assets and employee pensions.
“Banks having a higher proportion of securities in the AFS (available-for-sale) category will benefit most. We expect these to report 15-17 per cent rise in profit before tax if they choose to book the entire gains in this quarter itself,” Nitin Kumar, an analyst with brokerage Prabhudas Lilladher, said. He expects lenders like Canara Bank, Punjab National Bank and Oriental Bank of Commerce to report healthy gains in treasury operations.
However, such gains will not necessarily translate to improved net profit. The declining bond yields provide a good opportunity for public sector banks to cover their provision deficits,” said an analyst with an investment bank. Also, not all bankers are willing to book capital gains by selling securities in this current quarter. Many prefer to wait, as bond yields are expected to fall further.
“The decision will vary from bank to bank and depend on the level of stress and urgency to improve provision coverage, etc,” said an executive in charge of treasury operations at a mid-sized private bank.
But bankers admit even if they don't sell securities, the stress on earnings will ease, as almost all are expected to see a reversal in mark-to-market (MTM), revaluing  at current price provisions on investment in government securities. It is almost certain banks will have near-zero provisions for investment in government securities. Provisions on MTM losses will be reversed, helping earnings.

Will oppose Muslim reservation by Telangana govt: PraveenTogadiaBy: Press Trust of India | Sangareddy |
Posted: December 11, 2014 9:04 pm
Senior VHP leader Praveen Togadia on Thursday said his organisation will oppose any move by the K Chandrasekhar Rao-led Telangana government in providing 12 per cent reservations to Muslims.
Addressing a ‘Virat Hindu Sammelan’ here on the eve of the golden jubilee celebrations of VHP, Togadia, who is international president of the organisation, said the party will take legal recourse if the state government comes up with any such move.
“VHP will oppose any move by the state government for providing 12 per cent reservations to Muslims and will take legal recourse if needed,” Togadia said.
Providing of reservations to Muslims was one of the promises made by Rao’s Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) in its poll manifesto in April.
Togadia also appealed to Hindus to eradicate untouchability and maintain unity “to save the religion”.
“Each and every Hindu should maintain cordial relations with SC/ST’s and upper and lower castes should share common kitchens,” he said.
Raking up the issue of “love jihad”, Togadia said VHP was not against “pure love”.
“Love jihad is not pure because Hindu girls are converted to Islam after their marriage but in no case any Muslim boy gets converted to Hinduism.. This is clearly the ‘love jihad’ and we are against it,” Togadia said.
He said that construction of the temple of Lord Ram in Ayodhya is the matter of “self respect” to Hindus.
VHP national president G Raghava Reddy and regional president Rama Raju also spoke on the occasion.

How the U.S. Can Sustainably Become the World s Top Economy Againreddit
China has overtaken the U.S. as the world's top economy. But in taking a few examples from China, as well as investing in jobs that stay in America and taking steps to insure economic stability for the majority of American workers, the U.S. can come out on top again. And we can do it without having to decimate working people or the environment.
Much of the growth China has experienced is through Chinese urban centers becoming more connected than ever due to China's investments in high-speed rail (HSR). Since 2008, China has built 6,800 miles of track for their HSR systems, allowing, for example, the 820-mile distance between Shanghai and Beijing -- roughly the same distance as between Chicago and New York City -- to be covered in just five hours, for less than the cost of a plane ti...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(27%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>december government rs year cent oil india minister dec police</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(16%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>financial times india company percent share rs ft coal shares</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(14%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>year cent market rs bank month sales high growth years</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>india modi bjp indian minister billion president party china state</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>rs company cent india october growth market year ist global</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>year financial people day government minister times modi cent women</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>november people times financial minister state government police friday chief</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
