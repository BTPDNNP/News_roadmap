Government on Monday told the Supreme Court that it “wants re-auction of all 218 coal blocks” declared as illegal allocation but sought its indulgence to “exempt” 40 of them which are functional and ready for the end use power plants.
“Government stands by the August 25 judgement. We want re-auction of 218 coal blocks. We will be happy if we save some 40 of them which are functional or operational and ready for end use plant,” Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi said while making clear the stand of the Narendra Modi Government before a bench headed by Chief Justice R M Lodha.
However, the Attorney General said the 40 mines for which requisite clearances have been on board and are operational must not be treated with “one brush” and “can be exempted” from cancellation and re-auction, provided they meet the condition of compensating the loss of Rs 295 per tonne caused to the government and enter into a power purchase agreement at Rs 95 per tonne to make up the loss.
He said there was a need for saving 40 coal blocks from “guillotine of cancellation” as uncertainity of coal availability would affect the plants, when the country is facing acute shortage of power supply.
Rohatgi said Government was not in favour of setting up of any committee comprising its retired judges as suggested by the apex court to analyse the consequences of the verdict on the allocation which has been held as illegal.
“We don’t want any committee. If it has to go, all (coal block allocations) must go. My thought is the Government view,” Rohatgi told the bench, also comprising justices Madan B Lokur and Kurian Joseph.
While asking the Centre to file an affidavit on its stand, the bench said, “Union is very clear that auction should take place. They are very clear that all the 218 coal blocks be put under auction”.
“The allocations have been found to be altogether illegal. Therefore it (centre) wants to start from a clean slate,” the bench observed.
During the hearing, Rohatgi said like the 40 operational mines, there are six others which are “absolutely in readiness” to be operational for end use plant and if the verdict has to be strictly followed “all have to be cancelled with one stroke of brush”.

Smriti Irani slams politicisation of Centres Teachers Day plansSmriti Irani rejected reports that the Centre was celebrating the day as 'Guru Utsav', saying it was the name of an essay competition. (Source: PTI)

Tweet This
Amidst a row over Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s planned interaction with students on Teachers’ Day, Human Resource Development Minister Smriti Irani on Monday said that the participation of students in the event was “voluntary”.
She also rejected reports that the Centre was celebrating the day as ‘Guru Utsav’, saying it was the name of an essay competition and wondered if those criticising her were doing it deliberately for political reasons.
She stressed that September 5, the birth anniversary of former President the late S Radhakrishnan, will continue to be celebrated as ‘Teachers’ Day’.
“This particular activity is voluntary in nature. If it is being politicised, then I would say it is regrettable,” Irani told reporters when asked about the objections raised in some states over the Centre’s directive to them to ensure students’ participation in the event.
States like West Bengal have voiced dissent over the entire exercise with its Education Minister Partha Chatterjee saying they have little time in which to make the necessary arrangements for it.
The scheduled timing of the prime minister’s speech, from 3 P.M. to 4.45 P.M. has also come under attack from parties like Congress.
Reacting sharply, Irani said, “If the prime minister of a free India does not have the freedom to interact with students, then it is ridiculous.”
As to the ‘Guru Utsav’ row, Irani said her ministry had sent a representation to all states about an essay competition under that title in their language. She claimed that over 1.3 lakh students have already taken part in the contest.
“I don’t know how it all started. Those who are commenting either don’t know the facts or are doing it wilfully for political reasons,” she said.
Modi is to give a pep-talk to about 1,000 selected students at the Manekshaw Auditorium here on September 5. The programme, which will see Modi interact with the students and take questions via video conferencing facility, will be beamed live to over 18 lakh government and private schools in the country through Doordarshan and education channels.

Pak Army Chief meets Sharif; reports say asked PM to step downSupporters of anti-government Muslim cleric Tahir-ul-Qadri chant slogans during a protest close to Prime Minister's home in Islamabad, Pakistan on Monday, Sept. 1, 2014. (Source: AP)
Summary
Both the government and military issued separate denials, dismissing the claims of army asking PM to step down as "baseless".

Fresh controversy erupted after Pakistan’s powerful Army Chief on Monday met Premier Nawaz Sharif to discuss ways to resolve the deepening political crisis with media reports claiming that the embattled Prime Minister was advised to step down during the meeting.
After TV channels reported that Army Chief General Raheel Sharif has advised Prime Minister Sharif to step down, both the government and military issued separate denials, dismissing the claims as “baseless”.

Duniya TV reported that Gen Sharif has asked the Prime Minister to resign for a temporary three-month period as demanded by protesters to let an independent commission probe alleged rigging in last year’s general election.
Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf chairman Imran Khan and Tahir-ul-Qadri of the Pakistan Awami Tehreek have been demanding that Sharif should step down for a limited period so that claims of rigging can be investigated.
A government spokesperson immediately denied and denounced rumours broadcast on TV channels. The spokesperson termed the rumours “baseless” and “fake”. Military spokesperson Major Gen Asim Bajwa also denied the reports, tweeting, “News of #Army #Chief asking #PM to resign or going on leave is baseless.”

Prime Minister Sharif’s daughter Maryam Nawaz Sharif also dismissed the news reports as misinformation”. The Army Chief and the Prime Minister discussed the prevailing security and political situation, a senior leader of Sharif’s Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) told PTI.
Gen Sharif also informed the Premier about yesterday’s meeting of Corps Commanders. “The Prime Minister affirmed that no decision against the Constitution of the country and the will of Parliament will be taken,” the PML-N leader said.
Reaffirming “support to democracy”, the army yesterday reviewed with “serious concern”, the existing political crisis and the violent turn it has taken, resulting in large scale injuries and loss of lives.
The generals, who have ruled Pakistan for more than half of its history since independence from Britain in 1947, said that the “situation should be resolved politically without wasting any time and without recourse to violent means”.
Khan wants the PML-N government’s ouster over alleged rigging in last year’s poll which his party lost, while Qadri wants to bring a revolution in the country. Both the leaders are agitating since August 14.
