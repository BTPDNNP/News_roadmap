SAN FRANCISCO — Comcast CEO Brian Roberts was hoping to keep the focus squarely on new features rolling out to its cloud-based X1 service Wednesday but instead found himself addressing the hot-button issue of net neutrality.
"We're trying to work with the FCC, Congress and the administration to forge an outcome all stakeholders can live with and doesn't harm the innovation cycle," said Roberts, noting that the uncertainty over net neutrality — the notion that all content should be treated equally by Internet service providers — can ultimately stifle investment in new technologies.
Roberts' comments come on the heels of President Obama's comments Monday, in which he called upon the FCC to create rules protecting net neutrality and ensuring that "neither the cable company nor the phone company will be able to act as a gatekeeper, restricting what you can do or see online."
Obama is looking to classify ISPs as utilities in an effort to regulate their ability to provide "fast lane" access to specific content, which could create a tiered Internet where some information and videos download more quickly than others. Roberts said he favors the "transparent conversation" that has been ongoing between ISPs and the FCC as opposed to new regulations.
"For 20 years now, we've all played by a set of rules that have helped build the world we enjoy," said Roberts, whose father, Ralph, co-founded Comcast half a century ago.
Roberts also took the opportunity to address a July incident that went viral in which a customer service representative spent 18 minutes trying to talk a client out of disconnecting his service.
"I was embarrassed, disappointed and other thoughts I won't articulate. But my wife said, 'You'll be a better company for it,' and that's true, it was a teaching moment for us," says Roberts.
Turning to the company's X1 service, which is now in 5 million homes, Roberts said it was critical for broadband and entertainment providers to "behave more like (car sharing service) Uber, which changed the old way of doing things and made it better."
Two new customer-centric X1 features are aimed at the visually impaired. One is a talking guide, and the other a new remote control that you can speak into, recalling Siri- and Cortana-like conversations consumers are used to having with the smartphones. Roberts asked his remote to "Find The Godfather" and "What should I watch?" In a matter of seconds the screen lit up with answers.
Roberts said he expects his company's acquisition of Time Warner to go through in the first quarter of next year, which among other ramifications would allow Comcast access to the lucrative markets of New York and Los Angeles.
"It will be nice to have more of a national footprint," he said.

A day before Childrens Day  Odisha boy loses arm working in maizefactoryPrint

A day before the nation celebrates Children’s Day, a 12-year-old boy in Nabrangpur district lost his left arm while working in a maize processing factory.
Debi Singh Gouda, a Std VI student of Pujariguda upper primary school in Kasagumuda block of Nabarangpur, had skipped school to work at a maize processing mill in his village Nandpani for a wage of Rs 50. A day before Children’s Day, Orissa boy loses left arm while working in maize factory.
While deseeding corn, the boy’s left hand was sucked inside the machine leaving him seriously injured. He was first rushed to the district headquarters hospital at Nabarangpur and then shifted to the district headquarters hospital at Koraput. Though doctors could save his life, they had to amputate his arm. “It was too mutilated. We had no other option. But he is out of danger now,” said a doctor in Koraput.
Labour minister Prafulla Mallick said a three-member team, headed by sub-collector Parikshit Sethi, has been asked to file a report on the incident. The team on Thursday visited the school and held discussions with the boy’s family members. The district administration also lodged an FIR against the mill owner Lalan Mehta. Mallick assured that strict action would be taken against the guilty.
The district administration gave an ex-gratia of Rs 10,000 from the district Red Cross fund and Rs 5,000 from the chief minister’s relief fund to the family members of the boy.
Officials in Nabrangpur said the boy lost his father while he was a toddler. He has an elder brother and a mother. His brother and mother work as coolies, while Gouda often worked at the maize processing mill to supplement his family income.
Former Nabarangpur Congress MP Pradip Majhi demanded that the government should bear all the expenses for treatment of the boy and
immediately release Rs 5 lakh as assistance to the child’s family. He also demanded inclusion of the boy’s family under the various welfare schemes of the government and allot them a house.
In June this year, a 16-year-old boy’s right hand had to be amputated when it came in contact with a live electric wire while working as a labourer in Pradhan Mantri Grama Sadak Yojana. Yakub of MV-31 village under Kurukunda block of Malkangri district was working under a contractor in Pradhan Mantri Grama Sadak Yojana when a six-feet long aluminium rod that he was holding came in contact with the live electric wire. Yakub was first admitted to a privat...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(30%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>year financial people day government minister times modi cent women</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(18%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>year cent market rs bank month sales high growth years</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(14%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>november people times financial minister state government police friday chief</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>rs company cent india october growth market year ist global</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>financial times india company percent share rs ft coal shares</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>india modi bjp indian minister billion president party china state</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
