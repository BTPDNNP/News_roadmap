While there may not be much room for the already elevated valuations across Asia-Pacific markets (ex-Japan) to expand further, returns in 2015 will be driven by earnings growth improvement, says Goldman Sachs.
In its portfolio strategy for the coming year, the foreign brokerage lists India as one of the overweight markets as it expects it to deliver the highest EPS growth (18% for FY16) among its Asia-Pacific (ex-Japan) counterparts.
Correspondingly, it pins a year-end target of 9,500 for the 50-share Nifty, depicting 11% gains from the current levels.
Adjusting for exchange rate moves and dividend yield, India is seen delivering 13% of the total returns in US dollar terms in 2015, lower than Taiwan (20%) and China (17%), which are also assigned overweight allocations. Indonesia, the recently upgraded market by Goldman, is seen delivering returns similar to India.
While India’s market valuations, at one-year forward earnings multiple of 17.1, look expensive compared to history as well as peers, the brokerage expects global fund flow and interest of domestic investors to support the market momentum.
“With emerging market and Asia ex-Japan mutual fund maintaining overweight of 435 bps and 665 bps on India, investors question us whether India is a crowded trade,” said Timothy Moe, chief Asia-Pacific regional equity strategist.
However, global funds and ex-US funds that collectively account for more than 60% of the $967 billion equity mutual fund pie maintain relative underweight of 40 bps on India compared to benchmark MSCI index and may drive the next round of inflow, added Moe.
Goldman has assigned an overweight allocation to banks, technology and industrial sectors even as it noted that the first two traded at elevated valuations compared to last five years. Collectively, these two sectors are seen accounting for nearly 40% of Goldman’s FY16 EPS growth estimates for the MSCI India universe.
Besides a turnaround in the interest rate trajectory and a reversion in GDP growth to 6.5%, increasing clearances and tapering doing-business blockages are also seen helping a recovery of the banking space as corporate cash flows improve.
Interestingly, even after terming PSU reforms, fuel reforms and coal-auctioning among the preferred themes or areas of opportunity in 2015, the foreign brokerage has assigned a market-weight allocation to the energy sector where it expects FY16 EPS to grow 14%.
While autos, materials and utilities have also been assigned market-weight, consumer staples, healthcare and telecom space have been allocated underweight compared to the benchmark MSCI index.

Pvt bankers offload personalpositionsDirect equity set to top FDs as biggest asset class in FY15: Report
At a time when the Bank Nifty is hovering near record highs, top executives of private lenders have decided to profit from this rally and trim their personal holding in their respective banks, according to  corporate filings with the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE).
As BSE Bankex emerged as the second best performing sectoral index, having rallied as much as  65% compared to 35% gains clocked by the benchmark Sensex, an increasing number of top executives have encashed some of their equity holdings. Collectively, twelve executives of four private lenders together have sold shares worth over R100 crore in the last one month.
ICICI Bank witnessed the highest sale by executives with over 4 lakh shares sold since the beginning of November. Even IndusInd Bank witnessed sale of 3.5 lakh shares in the period. Largest private lender by market value HDFC Bank, housing loan major HDFC and third largest private lender Axis banks each saw sale of over 2 lakh shares during the same period. All of these private sector lenders have rallied anywhere between 60% to 85% this year.
Besides a general shift towards the banking space on hopes of an economic revival, the latest RBI monetary policy in which the central bank indicated a turnaround in the interest rate early 2015 have also added to the momentum in the banking stocks.
While shares of ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and IndusInd bank all touched their life-time highs on Thursday, HDFC Bank, and HDFC had already touched that milestone on November 28,2014.
KV Kamath, the non- executive chairman of ICICI Bank sold shares worth R32.75 crore in two tranches of  1 lakh shares each in the first week of November.
Shikha Sharma, MD & CEO of India’s third largest private lender Axis Bank sold shares on November 10 and 14 worth R3.26 crore.
Between November 12 and December 1, Romesh Sobti, the managing director of IndusInd Bank along with other two colleagues Ramesh Ganesan and Sanjeev Anand together sold shares valued about R10 crore.
Filings with the bourses, part of the disclosures under Sebi (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations show that selling of shares accelerated in the last 30 to 45 days.
