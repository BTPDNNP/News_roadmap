Shubert Organization buys off-Broadway complex...and
versions
NEW YORK (AP) — The Shubert Organization, Broadway's largest landlord, has extended its off-Broadway reach by buying the lease for the five-theater complex New World Stages.
The move announced Tuesday gives the Shubert Organization more flexibility as it shepherds shows to off-Broadway or readies them for Broadway homes. It gives Shubert about 1,900 new seats to fill, with cheaper labor costs than Broadway. No terms were disclosed.
The organization owns and operates 17 of Broadway's 40 theaters, the off-Broadway Little Shubert and the Forrest Theatre in Philadelphia. It also owns the ticket-seller Telecharge.
New World Stages, which is located at Manhattan's West 50th Street and has four tenants including "iLuminate" and "The Bubble Show," was bought from Stage Entertainment, a leading European producer that recently gambled and lost putting on "Rocky" on Broadway.
New World Stages has lately emerged as a place where some fading Broadway shows have found new life, including "Million Dollar Quartet," ''Avenue Q" and "Peter and the Starcatcher." The five theaters range in size from 199 to 499 seats, and the Shubert Organization said all current shows will continue.

Fracking to be permitted in GW National Forest...and
versions
NORFOLK, Va. (AP) — Environmentalists and energy boosters alike welcomed a federal compromise announced Tuesday that will allow fracking in the largest national forest in the eastern United States, but make most of its woods off-limits to drilling.
The decision was highly anticipated because about half of the George Washington National Forest sits atop the Marcellus shale formation, a vast underground deposit of natural gas that runs from upstate New York to West Virginia and yields more than $10 billion in gas a year.
The federal management plan reverses an outright ban on hydraulic fracturing that the U.S. Forest Service had proposed in 2011 for the 1.1 million-acre forest, which includes the headwaters of the James and Potomac rivers. Those rivers feed the Chesapeake Bay, which is the focus of a multibillion-dollar, multistate restoration directed by the Environmental Protection Agency.
A total ban would have been a first for America's national forests, which unlike national parks are commonly leased out for mining, timber and drilling. But some environmentalists were pleased that at least some balance was struck between energy development and conservation.
"We think the decision shows the Forest Service listened to the local community," said Sarah Francisco, leader of the Southern Environmental Law Center's national forests and parks program. "The vast majority of the forest is protected in this decision."
With both sides lobbying hard, Virginia's Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe told his climate change panel in September that federal officials had assured him fracking was off the table. "I won't allow it as long as I'm governor," he said.
But the final word rested with Ken Arney, a regional Forest Service manager. And by Tuesday afternoon, well after the decision was announced, the governor wasn't commenting.
"We think we've ended up in a much better place, which is we are allowing oil and gas drilling," said Robert Bonnie, the undersecretary for national resources and environment at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the Forest Service.
"From a policy perspective, the Forest Service allows fracking on forest lands throughout the country. We didn't want to make a policy decision or change policy related to fracking," Bonnie told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.
The new plan eliminates the potential for oil and gas leases on 985,000 acres where they could have been granted, and permits drilling only on 167,000 acres with existing private mineral rights and 10,000 acres already leased to oil and gas companies. The private mineral rights are scattered throughout the forest, which hadn't updated its management plan since 1993.
This lobbying fight was mostly over principle, since no energy company has wanted to actually drill on the land they're leasing, Bonnie acknowledged. "The economic value of these reserves is very low. We've had very little interest on oil and gas on the forest," Bonnie said.
Also, more environmental analysis and public comment would be encouraged before any drilling is approved, the Forest Service said.
Fracking enables the extraction of oil and gas from otherwise marginal shale deposits by injecting water mixed with chemicals and sand or gravel deep underground at extremely high pressure.
Environmental groups fear the drilling and its waste could pollute mountain streams that directly provide drinking water to about 260,000 people in the Shenandoah Valley. Another 2.7 million people in Northern Virginia and Washington get part of their drinking water from the forest.
"The risks of fracking are well documented, from water, air and climate pollution to the industrialization of special places," Glen Besa, director of the Sierra Club's Virginia chapter, said in a statement.
"Unfortunately, these risks remain for the existing leases in the forest.  While the leases may be low value, they are certainly high risk."
Opponents also argued that the trucks, wells and other infrastructure that would come with gas drilling are incompatible with the forest's primary attractions of hiking, fishing, hunting, camping, tourism and its abundant wildlife. The forest includes a section of the Appalachian Trail and attracts more than 1 million visitors annually.
The American Petroleum Institute maintains that hydraulic fracturing can be done safely and without risk to groundwater, but the science has not been conclusive.
"Natural gas is an enormously versatile fuel that helps power our nation's economy. Horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing is helping to unlock the tremendous economic and job creation benefits that Virginians, and all Americans, need and want," Virginia Petroleum Council Executive Director Michael Ward said in a statement.

Japan recession could slow some US companies... 
MATTHEW CRAFT | November 18, 2014 05:12 PM EST | Associated Press
NEW YORK (AP) — Japan has slipped back into a recession for the second time in two years. That could mean more trouble for a range of U.S companies and industries that count on the country for sales.
Best known as an exporter of cars, gadgets and comic books, Japan is also a key consumer of U.S. goods and services from name-brand companies. Japanese customers take a shine to diamonds from Tiffany, strap on handbags from Coach, and ride choppers from Harley-Davidson.
"If the Japanese economy continues to shrink, it has a big impact on other countries," says Sheila Smith, senior fellow for Japan studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. "It's not like some isolated economy. Having a strong and vibrant Japan is important for everybody."
On Tuesday, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced steps aimed at keeping the downturn from getting worse. Abe postponed another hike in the national sales tax and called for national elections next month. An increase in that sales tax earlier this year has been widely blamed for the most recent slump.
Here's a brief look at the economic ties between the U.S. and Japan, the world's third-largest economy, as well as the American businesses that could be hardest hit by the recession.
SIZE: Japan ranked as the fourth-largest trading partner for the U.S. last year, with $204 billion in goods passing between the two countries, according to the U.S. Trade Representative's office. Even though Japan sells more to the rest of the world than it buys, it's still a top destination for U.S. exports, after Canada, Mexico and China.
FROM JET PARTS TO PORK: What does Japan buy from the U.S.? A wide variety of things, starting with chemicals and transportation equipment. Last year, sales of medical instruments to Japan totaled $8 billion and aircraft totaled $7 billion, according to the USTR. Japan spent $3.3 billion on American pork and beef.
EXPOSED: The companies with the most to lose from an ailing Japan include insurers and luxury retailers. Coach and Tiffany & Co. rely on Japanese customers for more than 10 percent of their sales. Adobe Systems, the software company, generates a similar share of its sales from Japan.
THAT DUCK: At the extreme end sits Aflac. It's essentially a Japanese company based in Columbus, Georgia. In its most recent quarter, 74 percent of its revenue came from selling insurance and generating investment income in Japan.
DRAG ON BAGS: Coach, the maker of luxury handbags, reported that its Japanese sales sank 7 percent in its latest quarter. Victor Luis, the company's CEO, told investors on a conference call that the decline reflected the "continuing impact" of the country's higher consumption tax. Factor in the weaker yen, and Coach's overall sales in Japan as measured in U.S. dollars fell 12 percent.
HOGS: Harley Davidson, which gets a tenth of its revenue from Japan, said Japanese sales of its rumbling motorcycles slumped 7 percent in the three months ending in September.
UNPLEASANT SURPRISE: Japan's government said Monday that the country's economy shrank 1.6 percent between July and September, the second straight quarterly decline — a common definition of a recession. The slowdown surprised most economists, who had expected Japan to expand at a 2 percent rate after shrinking 7 percent in the previous quarter.

6 Steps for Making Tough Business Decisionsreddit
Is there anything more important to the success of a company than decision making? And is there any other process that occurs so often in a company that is accomplished so haphazardly?
The decisions that are made, from the boardroom and the corner office on down, dictate the direction that the company goes. Yet, decision making may be the only area of a company that doesn't have a clear structure or process for maximizing quality. Think about it. Sales, marketing, finance, and research and development all have formal procedures in place to ensure that their outputs are both effective and efficient.
