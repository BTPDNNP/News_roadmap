“It’s an ‘and’ world, not an ‘or’ world,” Coleman said. “Some people prefer email (requests from charities to donors). Others prefer a phone call or a letter.”
Coleman emphasized that platforms like his give users access to their “donor portal” when it’s convenient to them.
“People are doing a lot of activity when they have a few moments to relax,” he said.
Steve MacLaughlin, director of product management for Blackbaud, a South Carolina-based fundraising consultant, said online giving remains a small percentage of overall donations — about 10 percent — but that it’s growing quickly. Charitable giving over the last 12 months was up by about 4 percent, but online grew at almost 13 percent, he said. MacLaughlin attributed the surge primarily to the growing use of mobile devices.
MacLaughlin said he sees online charitable giving growth as more evolutionary than revolutionary, meaning successful companies take proven ideas and make them work better with technology.
Jason Franklin, executive director of Bolder Giving, who also teaches philanthropy at New York University, said the broad array of online communications channels presents a challenge to fundraisers. He spoke from the perspective of a charity, saying: “The challenge is: How do I share the right information and tell my story and generate excitement, when you hear from me so much more often?”

Turing Biographer On The True Story Of Genius s Tragic DeathAlan Turing's Biographer On The Truth About The Troubled Genius And His Tragic Death

Andrew Hodges, author of the Alan Turing biography on which The Imitation Game was based
Sixty years after his tragic death, the brilliant English mathematician Alan Turing (1912-1954) has come back to life, if only virtually, in the new movie The Imitation Game .
The movie spotlights Turing's work as a codebreaker during World War II. That's a logical choice given his success in cracking a key German naval code known as Enigma.
The feat, which is believed to have shortened the war by at least two years and saved millions of lives, led Winston Churchill to say that Turing had made the single biggest contribution to the Allied victory over the Nazis.
But if cracking Enigma was Turing's most tangible achievement, his greatest scientific legacy is his earlier theoretical work in the field now known as computer science. So says Andrew Hodges (pictured above), the author of "Alan Turing: The Enigma," the newly republished 1983 Turing biography on which The Imitation Game was based.
"The thing that really singles him out is his theoretical work in the 1930s, published at the end of 1936 [in his famous paper On Computable Numbers ], in which he brought up this idea of the universal Turing machine," Hodges says in a recent interview with The Huffington Post's senior science editor, David Freeman (podcast link above). "And he said, rather tantalizingly, we can now invent a machine...and that really is the generalized idea of the computer as we now know it."
(Story continues below image.)

Ultimately, the computer visionary and cryptanalyst--who was gay--broke not only the Enigma code but also the legal code of post-war England, which criminalized sexual contact between men. Turing was convicted of gross indecency in 1952. Two years later, in the aftermath of harrowing estrogen treatments intended to curb his sexual impulses, he died of cyanide poisoning.
Some have argued that the poisoning was accidental . But Hodges said it was a suicide he had carefully planned to minimize the emotional pain felt by his survivors.
"He'd been using cyanide in this home chemistry experiment," Hodges, a mathematician at the Wadham College, Oxford University, says in the interview. "And I have no doubt at all that this experiment was there as a cover which allowed people, especially his mother, to believe that it was an accident."
Turing received a posthumous royal pardon on Dec. 24, 2013.

Rupert Murdoch Pretty Sure All Egyptians Are Whitereddit
Rupert Murdoch took to Twitter Friday to defend the casting of white actors in the upcoming Ridley Scott film "Exodus: Gods and Kings," which stars Christian Bale as Moses and is set in Egypt.
"Moses film attacked on Twitter for all white cast," tweeted Murdoch , who, through 21st Century Fox, will distribute the film. "Since when are Egyptians not white? All I know are.”
Following an onslaught of backlash on Twitter , Murdoch continued to dig himself even deeper:
Everybody-attacks last tweet. Of course Egyptians are Middle Eastern, but far from black. They treated blacks as slaves.

Okay, there are many shades of color. Nothing racist about that, so calm down!

Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen’s Bahujan plank can change elitist intolerance towards Muslims
Poverty, stigma, exclusion, violence are terms that come up during discussions on the status of Dalits. Recently, however, these have come to better describe another community: Muslims. Exclusion from higher education, government jobs, violence and normalised social disgust affecting Indian Muslims has generated enough scholarship. The state has also recognised their exclusion.
Both the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) claim to be concerned about the welfare of Muslims as long as Muslims do not claim their rights as Muslims. Both parties prefer them to be docile recipients of their concern — even the Narendra Modi government may not stop the subsidy for Haj. However, they expect Muslims to not take pride in their Muslimness, or link their citizenship claims to Muslimness, even as Hindus have done so...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(25%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>december government rs year cent oil india minister dec police</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(18%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>year cent market rs bank month sales high growth years</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(18%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>financial times india company percent share rs ft coal shares</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>year financial people day government minister times modi cent women</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>rs company cent india october growth market year ist global</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>india modi bjp indian minister billion president party china state</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>november people times financial minister state government police friday chief</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
