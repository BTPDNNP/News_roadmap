Researchers have shown that money transactions via Bitcoin network do not protect user's IP address and it can be linked to the user's transactions in real-time.
The team demonstrated that only a few computers and about 1,500 euros (Rs 1,15000) are required to reveal the IP address behind each transaction.
Bitcoin is the "new money" - minted and exchanged on internet.
Faster and cheaper than a bank, the service is attracting attention from all over the world.
"It is hard to predict the future, but some people think that Bitcoin could do to finance what the internet did to communications," said professor Alex Biryukov, who leads digital currency research at the University of Luxembourg.
The Bitcoin system is not managed by a central authority as it relies on a peer-to-peer network on the internet.
Anyone can join the network as a user or provide computing capacity to process the transactions.
In the network, the user's identity is hidden behind a cryptographic pseudonym, which can be changed as often as is wanted.
Transactions are signed with this pseudonym and broadcast to the public network to verify their authenticity and attribute the Bitcoins to the new owner.
New findings showed that Bitcoin entry nodes, to which the user's computer connects in order to make a transaction, form a unique identifier for the duration of user's session.
This unique pattern can be linked to a user's IP address.
Transactions made during one session, even those made via unrelated pseudonyms, can be linked together.
With this method, hackers can reveal up to 60 per cent of the IP addresses behind the transactions made over the Bitcoin network.
"This analysis combined with previous research on transaction flows shows that the level of anonymity in the Bitcoin network is quite low", Biryukov noted.
The paper was recently presented at the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security.

Six years after 26/11  Pakistan has not changed its waysThe sixth anniversary of 26/11 attacks

Washington, Nov.25 (ANI): On the sixth anniversary of 26/11 attacks, India faces primarily two kinds of jihadist terror threats. One, as a society, it is witnessing the birth of self-radicalizing Muslim youth who are attracted to the jihadist call of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) led by Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi. This radicalization can be countered by India's vibrant democracy, pluralism and alert parents.
On November 22, National Security Advisor Ajit Doval told a conference in New Delhi that 5-6 youth recently showed "inclination" to join the ISIS but their parents were first to contact the security agencies in preventing them from doing so. Doval's optimism must be encouraged.
Second, as a state, India faces a very old-and-new jihadist threat from Pakistan. In September, Al-Qaeda leader Ayman Al-Zawahiri announced the establishment of Al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS).
The nature of 26/11 and 9/11 attacks reveal interesting characteristics. Both appear to have been planned by a single person or organization. On 9/11, the jihadists launched airborne invasions of U.S. cities.
On 26/11, they launched seaborne invasion of Mumbai. They used GPS technology to guide planes and boats to reach their targets. This pattern was demonstrated for a third time on September 6 when the AQIS attempted to take over Pakistani frigate PNS Zulfiqar in order to use it to attack US and Indian warships on the high seas.
The three attacks - 9/11, 26/11 and September 6 - indeed reveal a deep connection between Al-Qaeda and the Pakistani military's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). On November 22, Home Minister Rajnath Singh, speaking a few hours before Ajit Doval, said in Delhi: "Terrorism in India is fully Pakistan-sponsored. Pakistan says non-state actors are involved. But is ISI non-state actor?"
Although led by Arab terrorists, Al-Qaeda is fundamentally a Pakistani organization; it was formed in Pakistan in 1988; it is from Pakistan that it spread to the Middle East. Al-Qaeda is practically a branch of the ISI, which views itself as the ideological guardian of the Islamic state of Pakistan: both Al-Qaeda and the ISI share the same ideological objective - establishment of the Islamic Caliphate, with the only difference being that ISI wants Pakistan to be the...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(19%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>rs company cent india october growth market year ist global</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(18%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>december government rs year cent oil india minister dec police</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(17%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>year cent market rs bank month sales high growth years</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(15%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>financial times india company percent share rs ft coal shares</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>india modi bjp indian minister billion president party china state</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>year financial people day government minister times modi cent women</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(8%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>november people times financial minister state government police friday chief</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
