Health system megamerger shakes up Chicago's hospital market.
Advocate Health Care and NorthShore to combine into 16-hospital health system in Chicago.
The biggest hospital merger in Illinois in recent years has been announced.
Two of Chicago's largest hospital systems on Thursday approved plans to combine, creating a 16-hospital, $6.8 billion system that promises to change the competitive landscape of health care in the Chicago region.
Advocate Health Care, the state's largest hospital system, and NorthShore University HealthSystem, the dominant hospital chain in the North Shore suburbs, said Thursday they will merge to create Advocate NorthShore Health Partners in a deal that's expected to close in early 2015.
The blockbuster deal is the largest hospital merger in Illinois in recent years, a trend set in motion by the federal Affordable Care Act and fueled in part by declining hospital patient volume and tighter finances.
It will create the 11th-largest nonprofit health system in the country and by the far the largest in Illinois, with more than 45,000 employees and 4,438 hospital beds.

"This is a huge win for Advocate. It's an incredible coup to lock up NorthShore. It's a great market and it's a great system," said Jordan Shields, a vice president at Juniper Advisory, a Chicago-based investment bank that provides merger and acquisition services to hospital systems.
The deal, Shields said, "is going to shake people. What this does is change the gravity in the metropolitan area."
Combined, the new health system will serve an estimated 3 million patients a year at more than 350 facilities including hospitals, clinics, doctors' offices and outpatient centers.
Both health systems' boards voted unanimously this week to approve the deal, which also will unite two of the region's largest medical groups, giving Advocate NorthShore more than 2,000 employed physicians.
The deal still requires approval from the United Church of Christ, which is affiliated with Advocate; the Federal Trade Commission; and state regulators.

Under terms of the merger, both health systems will contribute six members of a 12-member board of directors. Jim Skogsbergh, president and chief executive officer of Advocate, and NorthShore CEO Mark Neaman will be co-CEOs of the combined enterprise.
The agreement calls for Neaman to step aside after two years, leaving Skogsbergh as the lone chief executive. The new organization's 11-person executive team will include leaders from both systems.
"These are two great organizations coming together, and we intend to see it continue to grow and be successful in the future," Skogsbergh said. "For patients, it means better health outcomes, a safer hospital environment, lower costs and improved access."
The decision by Advocate, which booked just under $5 billion in revenue in its most-recent fiscal year, and NorthShore, which reported $1.8 billion in revenue, to combine represents a continuation of the consolidation of the Chicago hospital market and reflects growing pressure on hospitals' finances that has nudged longtime competitors to pair up.
Even after the deal is completed, the new system will control less than 25 percent of the local health care market, which remains fragmented compared with other metro areas, despite a spate of mergers in recent years. Skogsbergh said the two systems anticipate the FTC will review the proposed transaction but are confident the deal will be approved.
A merger of this magnitude, however, is a major shake-up in the Chicago market that will force competing hospital systems and insurance companies to re-evaluate their businesses.
"This will probably trigger another set of consolidations; it's bound to occur," said Michael Sachs, chairman of Sg2, a Skokie-based health care consulting firm.
The deal represents a consolidation of market power for Advocate, particularly in the northern suburbs, which have a prized demographic of well-paying customers.

It also will allow the health system to broaden its geographic coverage, a key component in creating larger, more integrated networks of hospitals and physicians that executives believe will help lower costs and improve patient care.
The merger also will enhance Advocate's buying power with suppliers and market clout with insurers at a time when hospital patient volumes are declining and payments from government and commercial insurance are under pressure.
Skogsbergh said the enhanced geographic spread that the NorthShore merger offers was a prime consideration in Advocate's decision to pursue the combination because it would position Advocate as a more attractive network for insurance companies and employers.
NorthShore, with its historically strong balance sheet and four acute-care hospitals in Evanston, Skokie, Glenview and Highland Park, was among the most-coveted systems in Chicagoland.
This is a huge win for Advocate. It's an incredible coup to lock up NorthShore. - Jordan Shields, a vice president at Juniper Advisory
The mostly wealthy North Shore suburbs it serves are lucrative for health care providers because they boast large concentrations of patients with commercial health insurance coverage, which tends to pay better than government programs like Medicare and Medicaid.
Further, it is widely recognized as a well-run, efficient enterprise. Those factors made it an appealing partner for Advocate.
Skogsbergh acknowledged the potential for layoffs because of "a fair amount of redundancy across the two organizations."
"As we eliminate and reduce that redundancy, we'll reduce costs," he said. "Both organizations are aggressively managing costs today. If we reduce our workforce, it will be (primarily) through normal attrition and turnover."
Both systems intend to maintain their teaching relationships: NorthShore's with the University of Chicago and Advocate's with the University of Illinois, Midwestern University and Rosalind Franklin University. NorthShore also intends to maintain its clinical relationship with Minnesota-based Mayo Clinic. Advocate has a similar arrangement with Houston-based MD Anderson Cancer Center that will not be renewed.
NorthShore has been locked in fierce competition with Northwestern Medicine, which completed a merger Sept. 1 with Cadence Health, a two-hospital system in the western suburbs.
Northwestern, which recently announced plans to overhaul its Lake Forest Hospital, continues to push deeper into the northern suburbs. It has opened a series of health clinics between its flagship hospital, in Chicago's Streeterville neighborhood, and the northern suburbs in an attempt to broaden its reach and serve patients closer to where they live.
Northwestern declined to comment.
Neaman and Skogsbergh had been talking about a potential partnership for several years, but it wasn't until Neaman brought the issue to the table a few months ago that the talks gained traction.
With all of the changes in health care, "it became very apparent that we needed partners who could help us with things that we don't do as well ourselves," Neaman said, pointing to Advocate's deep experience in managed care, its broad geographic reach and its larger scale. "We thought the time was right, so we said, 'Let's go for it.'"
