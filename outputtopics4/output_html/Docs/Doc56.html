5 Guilt-Free Ways to Make Sure You Use All Your VacationEmail
America, take a vacation! A new Oxford Economics report shows that Americans are only using 77 percent of their paid time off. It’s gotten so bad that the number of unused vacation days has racked up to its highest level in 40 years. Workers say they’re worried about being seen as the office slacker. And in a world of layoffs, they’re also worried about keeping up with colleagues and bosses who don’t take all their vacation days. 
Take planning your play just as seriously as you plan your work, says productivity trainer and Work to Live speaker Joe Robinson.
Video: A new study by Oxford Economics reveals that American workers are essentially working for free almost one week per year.
“We don’t plan our time off, we don’t plan our leisure. We think the only thing that matters is performance and output,” said Robinson. Ironically, research shows that workers who take breaks, whether 10 seconds on an assembly line or 10 days in Cabo, increase their overall productivity when they return. Reaction times can go up as much as 40 percent.
And for those who feel like taking a vacation is stealing from the company in some way, know this: Vacations weren’t invented by employees. The vacation tradition was started in the 1920s and '30s  by employers who found giving their workers a week or two off during the year increased overall productivity.
Robinson offered these handy tips to workers:
Plan your vacations for the entire year in January
At the beginning of the year, discuss with others when the peak periods of work are. Figure out when everyone else is going to be gone. Plan your vacation days in the lulls between and give everyone as much notice as possible.  “Then it’s locked in and it’s much harder to have it not happen,” said Robinson.
Set up “I’ll cover you” arrangements with co-workers
In Europe they have a strategy they call “cross-training” where various people you work with are trained in pieces of your work, and vice versa. That way everyone can cover for each other during vacation and sick days. 
Take a trip, not a guilt trip
Ignore any dirty looks you think you’re getting, which are mainly just projected fear. “Guilt is just manipulation sent by other people,” said Robinson. “I don’t think living your life is anything to be embarrassed about."
Remember: Vacations make you a strong worker
“The body needs to replenish its mental resources,” said Robinson. “If we stay in work mode, we never get to have those resources go up again."
Use ‘em or lose ‘em
Understandably, people who don’t take all their vacation days act that way in part because they're worried about getting laid off — so-called “defensive overworking.”  But that’s the wrong strategy.
“People need to realize that people who don’t take vacations get laid off just as much as people who do,” said Robinson. “It’s your best time to live fully and freely."

Quarantined nurse writes about her treatment due to Ebola concernsBy Nia-Malika Henderson October 25 Follow @niawapo
A nurse who is quarantined in a Newark hospital after arriving from West Africa where she treated Ebola patients, said that she is “scared for those who will follow me,” and that the United States must treat returning health-care workers better.
The governors of New York, New Jersey and Illinois on Friday ordered that health-care workers returning from Ebola stricken countries in West Africa must be quarantined for 21 days. The measures were put into place after a doctor returned from West Africa was confirmed to have the deadly virus .
In a letter published in the Dallas Morning News , Kaci Hickox, who has tested negative for Ebola, detailed her treatment at the airport and then a hospital after she returned from Sierra Leone. She writes of long delays and a situation where “no one seemed to be in charge.”
“I am scared about how health care workers will be treated at airports when they declare that they have been fighting Ebola in West Africa,” Hickox wrote. “I am scared that, like me, they will arrive and see a frenzy of disorganization, fear and, most frightening, quarantine.”
Hickox arrived Friday afternoon and told immigration officials that she had been in Sierra Leone. She was then questioned about her work there, which included watching a 10-year-old girl die of the disease during a month long stay.
“I was tired, hungry and confused, but tried to remain calm,” she wrote. “My temperature was taken using a forehead scanner and it read a temperature of 98. I was feeling physically healthy but emotionally exhausted.”
Four hours later, she had a temperature of 101 according to the forehead scanner, and she was escorted by eight police cars to the University of Hospital in New York. Doctors there took her temperature again and found no fever.
The symptoms of Ebola can take up to 21 days to show up, and as long as someone is not showing any symptoms, like fever, vomiting and diarrhea, they are not contagious.
Several lawmakers have called for an outright travel ban, yet health officials have said that such a ban would limit the flow of much needed support to West Africa. Yet there are similar concerns that a mandatory 21-quarantine could discourage health care workers from traveling to Africa.
“We need more health care workers to help fight the epidemic in West Africa,” she wrote. “The U.S. must treat returning health care workers with dignity and humanity.”

Housing Prices Remain Stable in SeptemberIndian Realty Market Sees $4.5 Billion Investment During January-September: CBRE
New Delhi: Housing prices remained largely stable during the last month across the country's seven major cities while supply dipped marginally, according to property consultant CBRE.
"After recording an improvement in sentiments in August, the residential market saw a marginal dip in fresh supply of housing units during September," CBRE South Asia CMD Anshuman Magazine said in 'India Realty Market Update' for September.
The consultant tracks real estate market of seven cities - Delhi-NCR, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Pune, Hyderabad and Bangalore.
The consultant said the new project launches will increase over the next few months on the back of festive season, a revival in economic sentiments, and tax incentives introduced by the new government.
"Prices remained stable across most locations, barring central locations in Chennai, which saw 8-10 per cent rise over price points in August," CBRE said.
The home-buyer demand continued to remain focused on mid- end and high-end projects.
In the organised retail space, CBRE said the rental values remained stable across major markets in all leading cities, with the exception of Mumbai's Linking Road, which saw a decline of 3-4 per cent over the previous month.
On office segment, CBRE said the office market reported signs of improvement in the quarter ended September 2014, with the conclusion of numerous transactions towards the consolidation and expansion requirements of major corporate occupiers.
"Leasing activity remained upbeat with Bangalore, Delhi National Capital Region (NCR), and Mumbai leading the absorption of office space," it added.
IT/ITeS sector continued to account for a major portion of the commercial office space absorbed during the month.
"More than 30 per cent of the entire transacted space was led by domestic firms, such as Airtel, Aditya Birla Group and Tech Mahindra. Prominent corporates from the US and Eurozone also accounted for a large share of the transaction activity during September," CBRE said.
Similar to previous months, CBRE said the back-office operations were a leading driver of office space demand, with almost 90 per cent of the leased space in September meant for housing either back-office operations or a combination of back-office and front-office operations of various corporates.
