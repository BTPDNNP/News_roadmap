It's "go time" if you're planning to retire in 2015, or even in the next few years.
As millions of baby boomers flip the switch from gainfully employed to living off their savings, the financial decisions they face are countless and complex.
They must convert their nest egg into income, for starters, and manage their withdrawal rate to ensure they don't outlive their savings.

It's "go time" if you're planning to retire in 2015, or even in the next few years.
They must also determine when to begin claiming Social Security and whether their asset allocation still reflects their long-term goals and tolerance for risk.
In short, the months leading up to retirement are when the rubber meets the road.
"The preretiree should begin to establish a budget based upon actual spending during the last 12 to 18 months of employment," said Neil Brown, a certified financial planner with Burkett Financial Services. "They should record their expenses and determine if this is a reasonable amount, given their soon-to-be disappearing paycheck." 
To stress-test your budget, he suggested practicing living off an amount equal to your guaranteed sources of retirement income for at least six months, including pensions, Social Security, annuities or—for the lucky few—trust funds.
Mind the gap
In the expense column, don't forget to include car loans, credit card bills, property tax, mortgage payments, groceries, gifts, entertainment, gas and insurance premiums. And allow plenty of wiggle room for what will likely be your biggest cost during retirement: health care.
Video: Whether you’re planning to retire next year or in ten years, Money magazine’s Donna Rosato shares her tips, including downsizing your home and living on less money.
Fidelity Benefits Consulting estimates that an average 65-year-old couple with traditional Medicare insurance coverage who retires this year will need $220,000 to cover medical expenses through retirement. That does not include costs associated with nursing-home care.

Whatever gap exists between your guaranteed sources of income and your monthly expenses is the amount you'll need to generate from your personal accounts.
That may require taking greater risk in your investment portfolio or lowering your withdrawal rate and living on less.
Financial advisor Paul Zemsky, chief investment officer for multi-asset strategies at Voya Investment Management, said the nearly retired should resist the urge to become too conservative with their portfolios.
With medical advances today, retirees may well live 30 years or more in retirement and thus need to continue investing for growth to protect against inflation and longevity risk (the risk of outliving your savings).

But with rock-bottom interest rates keeping bond yields painfully low, they may need to consider fixed-income alternatives to balance their portfolio, he said.
"Bond yields are at the lowest level that most retirees have seen in their lifetime," Zemsky said. "At a time when millions of Americans are entering retirement eligibility, the markets are not providing as many income opportunities."
Zemsky currently recommends high-yield alternatives including dividend paying stocks, managed payout funds (which seek to provide retirees a stable income) and master limited partnerships, or MLPs, which invest in slow-growth, relatively stable U.S. energy firms, such as those that operate oil and gas pipelines.
Taxes are an important consideration, as well, when developing a retirement budget, said Bob Adams, a certified financial planner with Armstrong Financial Planning.
Read More 5 tips for lowering tax bite
Many retirees fall into a lower bracket when they stop collecting a paycheck, which can favorably impact their future retirement income.
Others may find that the required minimum distributions from their individual retirement account, which begin at age 70½, are sufficiently sized to bump them back up into  higher tax-rate territory —or even indirectly subject them to the new 3.8 percent Medicare surtax.
Video: TODAY financial editor Jean Chatzky offers advice on how to live comfortably in retirement, suggesting waiting until you’re 70 to collect Social Security benefits.
Retirees should factor in such tax changes well in advance, said Adams.
As you cross the threshold into retirement, you'll also want to ensure that your nest egg is well insulated.
Read More The 4% rule is broken
Brown, at Burkett Financial Services, suggests fortifying your cash reserves so you aren't forced to sell stocks into a down market to meet your income needs.
While those still working are generally advised to keep three to six months' worth of living expenses in an interest-bearing account, Brown suggests new retirees keep between 24 and 36 months of expenses in high-quality short-term bonds, money market funds, certificates of deposit and cash.
Your Plan B
If you can't make ends meet during the trial run, your choices are simple: Either lower your fixed expenses or work longer.
Retirees should rid themselves of credit card balances and other high-interest debt before they quit work, but they can potentially stretch their savings further by eliminating life insurance coverage—generally not needed after the kids are grown—keeping one car instead of two, cutting back on cable television and downsizing to a smaller home.
Read More Refinance your mortgage now
If your house has appreciated significantly, you might also consider a reverse mortgage, which enables homeowners age 62 and older to convert part of their equity into cash.
Instead of making monthly payments to the lender, as per a traditional mortgage, the lender makes payments to the borrower throughout their lifetime. You need not repay the loan until you leave the house or pass away.
But be forewarned: If you fail to keep up with utilities, homeowners insurance and real estate taxes, the bank can foreclose on your home.
Ultimately, the best way to cover any savings shortfall is to continue working, Brown said, noting that working can include part-time gigs or consulting jobs.
Read More Market's rigged? Get real
A few extra years on the job will not only give your tax-deferred savings tools more time to benefit from compounded interest but also enable you to supplement your 401(k) plan and individual retirement account with larger catch-up contributions.
Importantly, postponing your retirement may enable you to delay Social Security benefits, as well, which is your last, best opportunity to compensate for undersaving, Adams said.
The size of your Social Security check increases by a certain percentage for each month you delay taking benefits beyond your full retirement.
Read More Risk gets no respect today
For example, those entitled to a $1,000 monthly benefit at full retirement age of 66 would collect only $750 per month at age 62. By postponing until age 68, they would receive $1,160 monthly, and by waiting until age 70, they would receive $1,320.
Lastly, working until at least the age of Medicare eligibility, 65, can have a profound impact on your future expenses.
Fidelity estimates that couples who opt to retire this year at age 62 will spend an additional $17,000 per year—or $271,000 throughout retirement—to cover costs associated with private health insurance premiums. 
That you want, or planned, to retire at a certain age is not reason enough to leave your employer. Only when your savings are sufficient, and you've tested your nest egg to be sure, is it safe to walk away.
"The transition into retirement is an emotional one and should not be underestimated," Adams said. "Before deciding to retire, be sure you fully evaluate your financial ability to do so."

Chris Rock: There d Be Riots If People Knew What Being Rich Was Really Likereddit
"If poor people knew how rich rich people are, there would be riots in the streets," Chris Rock said in a recent interview with New York magazine.
The multi-millionaire comedian pointed out that poor people would be particularly shocked if they knew all the perks rich people get for being rich.
"If the average person could see the Virgin Airlines first-class lounge, they’d go, 'What? What? This is food, and it’s free, and they… what? Massage? Are you kidding me?'" he said.
If you have never flown Virgin Airlines first class (or first class at all, for that matter), these lounges of which Rock speaks are where "Upper Class passengers" can kick back with some "amazing food, fantastic facilities and a chilled out atmosphere," according to the Virgin website . At London Heathrow Airport, the Virgin lounge has a spa and showers.
Virgin Atlantic didn't respond to The Huffington Post's requests for comment.
Lavish air travel is just the start. Rich people often get paid to wear jewelry. They get paid to lose weight .
They're given free laptops and TVs . They also get paid thousands of dollars to just show up at clubs.
They get gift bags just for attending big award shows, bags filled with goodies worth $20,000 -- which is more than a full-time minimum wage worker earns in a year. Their kids' birthday parties have corporate sponsors .
The divide between the haves and the have-nots is nothing new in America, but in recent decades that gap has been getting wider as the middle class shrinks and the very richest Americans keep getting richer. Meanwhile, economists are warning that the world is heading toward Gilded-Age levels of inequality unless we do something to stop it. It's already worse than most of us realize.

Martin  Aston Martin headlines new Bond film  SpectreAston Martin's lineup is as robust as it's ever been, with three sports cars and a four-door coupe. The brand's next generation of sports cars will start showing up in 2016. ( David Undercoffler )
“I’m really excited and thrilled to be able to say we have continued the 50-year relationship with Aston Martin  which began right at the very beginning of this franchise,” said Director Sam Mendes at a cast announcement. “Together we have worked on designing a new car.”
The David Brown 10 will most likely get grand touring style from the DB9, but with a Vanquish-performance side. The 2013 Vanquish has a lightweight carbon fiber body wrapped around a 5.9-liter V-12 engine. The DB10 will have spy weapons.

100 years of Aston Martin: What to expect next0
Ford got out of the exotic car game in 2007 when it sold nearly its entire stake in Aston Martin to several investment groups that now own 62.5% of the company. Private equity firm Investindustrial owns the remaining 37.5%, which it bought in April. Global sales in 2012 were around 3,800 vehicles, according to the company.
Yet despite the relative robustness of Aston Martin's current lineup, the brand appears to be on the cusp of a new chapter. It has squeezed as much life as possible out of the platform that underpins all of its current models. And Aston Martin's styling, while among the most handsome on the road today, has evolved as much as it can over a decade.
So what does the future hold? The company is mum on salient details about its next products, saying only that we'll start seeing the next generation of sports cars in 2016. And they will be sports cars. Unlike Porsche and Lamborghini, Aston Martin will follow Ferrari's lead and resist the temptation of sport utility vehicles. So do not expect to see James Bond fording any rivers in a boosted Aston Martin.
"It's important to know that our core is sports cars," said Julian Jenkins, president of Aston Martin of the Americas. "That's our focus, and that's what you'll continue to see."
This is despite rumors that a recent technical partnership with Mercedes-Benz would yield an SUV. That partnership, which is expected to be finalized by year's end, gives Mercedes a small ownership in Aston Martin. In return, the German automaker will supply the "base architecture" for a new line of V-8 engines and transmissions, and access to in-car electronics such as navigation systems.
For now, Aston Martin's lineup of the Vantage, DB9 and Vanquish will remain the brand's core sports cars (the four-door Rapide S is the sole outlier here). We recently took a spin in each of the coupes to see the fruits that 100 years of building sports cars can bear.
V-8 Vantage
This is Britain's answer to Germany's Porsche 911 Carrera S. With a similar price tag and roughly equal power, the V-8 Vantage is the gentleman's alternative to the Porsche.
Though its styling hasn't changed since 2006, expect favorable attention from the valet, even in exotic-laden Los Angeles. Its compact, purposeful design mirrors its character on the road; never superfluous, always capable. It's also friskier than its 3,600-pound curb weight might indicate.
Inside, the car's interior and ergonomics are beginning to show their age. The dashboard — shared with the DB9 and the Rapide S — has way too many tiny buttons. The Garmin Navigation system looks and acts as if it's using a dial-up modem.
This base Vantage we tested uses a 4.7-liter V-8 that makes 420 horsepower and 346 pound-feet of torque. Our $125,000 tester came with a six-speed manual transmission. A seven-speed automated manual gearbox is optional.
Though it's been with us since 2006, and a Porsche 911 probably will beat it around a track, the Vantage is still an incredibly compelling way to drive well and look good. What else do you need an Aston Martin to do?
DB9
Do not mistake the DB9 for a true sports car. With a 4,000-pound curb weight, this $200,000 grand tourer prefers meandering curves to tight apexes. As a daily driver, it's a demure chariot with stunning sex appeal. It will liven up some if you step on its tail, but in a refined, subdued way.
Though it shares the same interior foibles as the V-8 Vantage, the DB9's biggest drawback is its transmission. With rapid-firing dual-clutch gearboxes commonplace on exotic competitors, the DB9's automatic felt a bit slow, even in sport mode. Fortunately, drivers can expedite the process with large paddles on the steering wheel.
Despite sharing a chassis and name with the DB9 that debuted a decade ago, Aston gave this model a healthy update in 2013. Key changes included a more powerful V-12 engine and a refreshed face with a more crisp look.
The new 5.9-liter V-12 now makes 510 horsepower and 457 pound-feet of torque, and pushes it to the rear wheels via a six-speed automatic gearbox. And oh what a sound it makes; if they're lucky, owners of this car will live near a tunnel to amplify all that delicious noise. Imagine a thousand angry trombones.
The model we tested rang in at $208,000. If your hedge fund returns are subpar this year, save yourself the $5,400 and skip the interior carbon fiber trim. There are faster cars for the money, but you're going to be hard-pressed to find something with more panache. It's a worthy trade-off.
Vanquish
The pinnacle of Aston's lineup, the Vanquish can be considered a louder, lighter version of the DB9. All-new for 2013, the Vanquish coupe and convertible wrap a lightweight carbon fiber body around a massive V-12 engine.
Horsepower from the 5.9-liter V-12 engine checks in at 565, while torque is 457 pound-feet. A six-speed automatic transmission is your only choice, and is also this car's biggest downside. The Vanquish deserves better, especially with a price tag near $300,000. But sport mode in this car seems better programmed than in the DB9.
Despite being a grand tourer by pedigree and weighing around 3,800 pounds, this car is agile in the mountains with a confident, neutral feel through turns. The steering tells you everything, and the standard vented carbon ceramic brakes keep a tight rein on all that weight.

Indian IT Services market rises to $3.76 bn in H1 2014:IDCDirect equity set to top FDs as biggest asset class in FY15: Report
According to International Data Corporation (IDC) the IT services market in India witnessed an year on year growth of 7.4% in 1H CY 2014 over 1H CY 2013, to reach a value of Rs 2,28,262 million ($ 3.76 billion).
Overall political and economic uncertainty has had an impact on project-based services in the first half of 2014 with few infrastructure deals being signed. Support services saw a quiet period in terms of growth in 1H CY 2014 with organizations looking at cost cutting measures and holding on their hardware and software refresh.
The market grew by 6.9% over 1H CY 2013. Spending on the system integration and IT consulting services also registered a growth of 6% and 6.6% respectively, which was quiet slower than the 2H 2013 owing to decrease in spend on infrastructure projects.
Outsourcing services continued to be the fastest growing macromarket seeing a growth of 8.8% in 1H CY 2014 over 1H 2013. Large outsourcing deals are being broken into smaller sizes, as companies prefer to work with more than one vendor. Companies not only manage to get a good pricing advantage, but also access to niche technology vendors.
“Cost pressures are driving the adoption of managed and data center services among small and medium enterprises as they now realize the advantage of utilizing IT systemsin an OPEX model,” said Sachin Chaturvedi, Senior Analyst – IT Services, IDC.
IBM continued to lead the market and managed to command the IT Services market in India in H1 2014, though they struggled to grow in 1H 2014 as competition intensified from vendors such as TCS, Wipro and HCL Technologies.
Wipro was placed second in H1 2014, where they maintained steady growth, especially in financial services and telecom sectors in India. They are expecting that the new government will boost Indian IT services market growth.
“Implementation of Social, Mobile, Analytics and Cloud (SMAC), big data and other emerging technologies will result in significant investment in new IT infrastructure by both private and public sectors in the coming 2 or 3 years. Service providers are now looking at optimising resources for their customers to offer them a leaner organisational infrastructure, ” said Chaturvedi.
While spending in the government sector was sluggish, BFSI fared well with investments in enterprise data warehouse, analytics, CRM etc, driven by competition to catch up with the private sector banks and branch expansion. With the national manufacturing policy in place there is a demand for SCM, CRM, ERP, product life-cycle management in this sector.

Shares of Mangalore Chemicals and Fertilizers Ltd (MCFL) surged over 15 per cent on industrialist Saroj Poddar-led Zuari group’s decision to spend upto Rs 282.19 crore to buy over three crore shares in the UB Group firm through a new open offer.

IPO-ready Uber amasses $1.2 bn  valued at $40bnFalling rouble and oil roil stock, currency markets
Uber wants to be the world’s private driving service. Now the company is amassing the war chest to do it. The start-up closed a new $1.2 billion round of financing on Thursday, with investors valuing the company at a staggering $40 billion.
That puts a new mountain of cash on top of the $1.5 billion that Uber had already raised. And it may collect even more: Uber may eventually sell an additional $600 million in stock, and it is working with Goldman Sachs to sell, potentially, another $1 billion in debt to some of the Wall Street firm’s wealthy private clients.
Uber’s ascent is one of the most rapid by a start-up in years. Five years ago, Uber was just an app that allowed customers to summon a private car with the push of a smartphone button. Since then, it has surged in growth to surpass even other members of Silicon Valley’s exclusive 11-digit club — start-ups whose valuations exceed  $10 billion.
With the additional money, Uber is setting itself up for what its investors hope will be the next mammoth initial public offering, following in the footsteps of Facebook and the Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba.
The new money, however, comes in the face of a rash of fierce criticism about the company’s approach to users’ privacy. While people briefed on the fund-raising process said that the recent controversy did little to diminish enthusiasm among investors, Uber acknowledged on Thursday that it had more growing up to do.
Raising yet more cash is another step in Uber’s plan to become the world’s premier logistics service, capable of transporting people to places they want to go as quickly and seamlessly as possible. The company has also signaled its ambitions to be a one-stop shop for delivering anything, anytime, anywhere — even groceries — perhaps one day rivaling t...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(30%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>december government rs year cent oil india minister dec police</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(17%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>financial times india company percent share rs ft coal shares</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(15%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>year cent market rs bank month sales high growth years</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(12%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>rs company cent india october growth market year ist global</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(10%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>india modi bjp indian minister billion president party china state</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>november people times financial minister state government police friday chief</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>year financial people day government minister times modi cent women</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
