Jumping red light Get slapped with 15 000 fine under proposed traffic lawComments
Soon, motorists caught speeding, driving drunk or jumping red lights may not get away with a light fine and a few stern words from the traffic cop.
The punishment would get harsher as the gravity of the offence increases — a Rs. 3-lakh fine and not less than seven years in jail for causing the death of a child; Rs. 5 lakh in penalty and three months in jail for a manufacturing fault in a vehicle; a Rs. 1-lakh fine for driving an unregistered vehicle.
All these and more are part of the new draft Road Transport and Safety Bill, 2014 unveiled by the road transport ministry on Saturday. The ministry has proposed hiking penalties three-to-50-fold  and other stringent action that includes suspension or cancellation of driving licence.
In the draft bill, speeding invites a fine of Rs. 5,000 to Rs. 12,500 — up from the existing Rs. 400-1,000 — and suspension of licence for up to eight weeks depending on how much you have exceeded the speed limit. For instance, the steepest fine is for going 40kmph over the speed limit.
Driving under the influence comes with a fine of Rs. 15,000 (currently Rs. 3,000) and a jail term of up to a year. But a second offence will lead to permanent loss of licence and up to two years in jail. The penalty is especially harsh for school bus drivers — Rs. 50,000 in fine and a three-year jail sentence.
Along with the fines and jail terms, drivers below 25 years stand to lose their licence for three months.
The punishment for jumping a red light is Rs. 5,000-15,000 in fine and one-month licence suspension. Similarly, you pay Rs. 5,000 for not wearing a seat belt.
India has one of the highest road fatalities in the world with 137,576 deaths reported last year. In the same period, Delhi recorded 7,566 accidents that killed 1,820 people. The bill aims to bring down such fatalities by 200,000 in the first five years and increase GDP by 4%.
Apart from the fines and imprisonment, motorists will be awarded penalty points for every traffic violation. Collecting 12 penalty points means losing your driving licence for a year.
The draft includes several new features in keeping with the times — fines for manufacturing faults, for instance, come in the wake of incidents of cars catching fire and vehicle recalls by auto firms.
“The bill, after it is cleared by cabinet, will be tabled in Parliament during the winter session. The proposed changes were long due as the last time the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 was amended was in 2001, and since then many provisions related to offences and penalty have ceased to have any punitive effect,” said a ministry official.

A Highway Traffic Regulation and Protection Force has been proposed while a motor accident fund would be set up to provide compulsory insurance to all road users. A pan-India road accident emergency access telephone number to alert and access emergency services is also in the works.

Red carpet welcome awaits Modi inUSEncouraged by the steps taken by the Modi government in its first 100 days, the Obama Administration sees an India that is of great strategic significance and can act as a stabilising force in the entire Asia Pacific region.
PTI | Washington | Posted: September 14, 2014 7:56 pm
The Obama Administration is leaving no stone unturned to woo Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his maiden visit to the US which is expected to take the strategic bilateral relationship to the next level and unleash the potential of economic and trade ties.
The administration here is gearing up to give a red carpet welcome to Prime Minister Modi when he arrives in Washington on September 29 from New York where he would attend the annual General Assembly session of the United Nations.
The discussion between Modi and Obama over two days in Washington is expected to result in taking the bilateral relationship to the next level in terms of defense and strategic ties, co-operation in the field of space and counter-terrorism and unleash the potential of economic and trade ties, sources familiar with the preparations told PTI.
On September 29, Obama is likely to host Modi for a small working dinner, which is rarely accorded to a visiting foreign leader.
The maiden meeting between the two leaders on September 29 would help Obama and Modi to know each other and prepare the ground for the next day’s meeting at the White House.
Soon after his electoral victory, Obama had called Modi to congratulate him and invited him to visit Washington.
Thereafter the two leaders have not spoken over phone, but there has been an exchange of letters between the two.
Obama, who of late has been tied up on the foreign policy front over developments in the Middle East –- Syria, Iraq, Iran, Israel-Palestine and Ukraine — is looking forward to meeting Modi and exchange views on international issues of concern.
Encouraged by the steps taken by the Modi government in its first 100 days, the Obama Administration sees an India that is of great strategic significance and can act as a stabilising force in the entire Asia Pacific region.
A strong and prosperous India, US officials argue, is in the best interest of the United States.
India, US officials say, under Modi would play a key role not only in South Asia, but also in South East Asia.
In fact, India-US relationship has been identified as one of the top four priorities by both Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry this year, officials said.
Kerry and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel met Modi in New Delhi in quick succession this summer. The meetings generated excitement in the US as well.
“The two leaders will discuss a range of issues of mutual interest in order to expand and deepen the US-India strategic partnership. They continued…

Staying unplugged from the rest of the world is unimaginable, but the Jammu & Kashmir deluge has made the nightmare of being lost and going incommunicado a reality for many of us.

The almost blanket week-long telecommunication and power outage in the flood-hit state has left the rest of the nation feeling equally powerless. People have gone crazy calling, messaging and mailing everyone they know in the state for news about people they know and people they don’t.
Things are no different in Jammu & Kashmir. The fact that there’s no network does not stop people from constantly trying to call, tweet, text or mail. And in areas where power is restored intermittently, the first thing people do is rush to recharge their cellphones, laptops and tablets, again knowing they couldn’t use them.

Staying unplugged leaves us powerless, and here’s why: Twitter, Facebook and email are more addictive than cigarettes and alcohol. A study of 205 people aged 18 to 85 in the German City of Wurtzburg found that sleep and sex were the two things people most long for during the day, but it was the urge to keep connected was the hardest to resist. The study found that the urge to stay on top of social media, email and work was stronger than the need to smok...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(27%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>september rs pm people true government post company sep india</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(20%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>year cent market rs bank month sales high growth years</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(15%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>financial times india company percent share rs ft coal shares</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(13%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>india modi bjp indian minister billion president party china state</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>rs company cent india october growth market year ist global</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(8%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>year financial people day government minister times modi cent women</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(5%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>november people times financial minister state government police friday chief</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
