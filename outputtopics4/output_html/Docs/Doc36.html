New Delhi: Alarmed over the Indian government’s proposed amendments to the MGNREGA Act, development economists from India and abroad have written an open letter to the Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking an assurance against any possible dilution or restriction of the provisions of the job scheme.
Introduced in February, 2006, the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), promises 100 days of employment every year to each household in the rural areas.
Appreciating the support that MGNREGA provides to crores of vulnerable and poor rural families, the petitioners argue that scheme had wide-ranging social benefits including creation of jobs and various productive assets (like water reservoirs and check dams).
The gains achieved have been substantial and amply justify further efforts to make it a success, the letter said.
Acknowledging that corruption has been a long standing problem in implementation, the petitioners optimistically said that the malaise could be curbed. Quoting a research, the petitioners said corruption levels had steadily declined over time.
“For instance, official estimates of NREGA employment generation are very close to independent estimates from the second India Human Development Survey. While corruption remains a concern, experience shows that it can be curbed, and the battle against corruption in NREGA has helped to establish new standards of transparency in other social programmes as well,” the letter argues.
The petitioners lamented that wages had been frozen in real terms, and long delays in wage payments had further reduced their real value. The letter alleged that MGNREGA's initial provisions for compensation in the event of delayed payments had also been removed.
“The labour-material ratio is sought to be reduced from 60:40 to 51:49 without any evidence that this would raise the productivity of NREGA works. For the first time, the Central government is imposing caps on NREGA expenditure on state governments, undermining the principle of work on demand,” the letter said.
The petitioners have also highlighted that the Central Government’s proposed amendment aimed at restricting the NREGA to the country's poorest 200 districts runs against a fundamental premise of the Act-gainful employment that affords basic economic security is a human right.
The development economists expressed in their petition that even India's relatively prosperous districts are unlikely to be free from unemployment or poverty in the foreseeable future. The letter was signed by prominent economist including Jayati Ghosh, Jean Drèze, Reetika Khera V. Bhaskar, Dilip Abreu andPranab Bardhan.

Don t succumb to Ebola  hysteria   urges Obama as panic growsDon't succumb to Ebola 'hysteria', urges Obama as panic grows

US President Barack Obama urged against "hysteria or fear" Saturday in the face of a growing Ebola crisis, as the United Nations spoke of an "encouraging" response to its funding appeal.
The worst-ever outbreak of the deadly virus has so far killed more than 4,500 people, mainly in three West African nations at the epicenter of the outbreak: Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.
Obama's warning came a day after the World Bank warned the battle against the disease was being lost and as the US president named an "Ebola czar" to coordinate Washington's response.
A UN appeal for nearly $1 billion to fight the spread of the disease has so far fallen short, but a spokesman told AFP more money was coming in daily.

Out of $988 million requested a month ago, the UN said Saturday $385.9 million had already been given by a slew of governments and agencies, with a further $225.8 million promised.
"It has been encouraging to see the amount and the speed with which these amounts have been committed," said Jens Laerke, spokesman for the UN's humanitarian office (OCHA).
"To be honest, I don't recall during my time at OCHA that we have had such a response within a month for a billion-dollar appeal."
Nevertheless, Laerke said, this wasn't a sign the need for donations had passed.
"Nobody's smiling in this crisis, so I'm not going to go out and clap my hands and say everything is going fine, because it's not," he told AFP.
   
Panic growing
Meanwhile, as panic grows even far from the outbreak's epicenter, Obama counseled patience and perspective.
"This is a serious disease, but we can't give in to hysteria or fear -- because that only makes it harder to get people the accurate information they need. We have to be guided by the science," Obama said in his weekly address to the nation.
Friday saw a number of false alarms in the United States as fears grow, including at the Pentagon, where an entrance was closed after a woman vomited in a parking lot. US authorities later found no evidence that she had contracted Ebola.
"We have to remember the basic facts," Obama said Saturday.

The United States -- where a Liberian man died from Ebola on October 8 and two American nurses who treated him have tested positive -- was not seeing an "outbreak" or "epidemic," Obama stressed.
More "isolated" cases in the country were possible, he conceded. "But we know how to wage this fight."
The US president played down the idea of a travel ban from West Africa.
"Trying to seal off an entire region of the world -- if that were even possible -- could actually make the situation worse."
Travelers from affected regions would simply change their travel plans to evade screening, he said, making Ebola even harder to track.
   
'Losing the battle'
Obama's call for calm was in stark contrast to World Bank chief Jim Yong Kim, who warned Friday: "We are losing the battle."
He blamed a lack of international solidarity in efforts to stem the epidemic.
"Certain countries are only worried about their own borders," he told reporters in Paris, as leaders in Washington and beyond grapple for a coordinated response to the outbreak.
Airports in several countries, including in the United States, have launched enhanced health checks in a bid to stop the spread of Ebola, although health experts -- including in the US -- have expressed doubts about their effectiveness.
France on Saturday started carrying out health checks on Air France passengers arriving from Guinea, where the epidemic began in December, while a union of the airline's flight attendants called for a halt in flights from Conakry altogether.
The United States, Britain and Canada have already launched screenings at airports for passengers from Ebola-ravaged zones. The EU is reviewing the matter.
As of October 14, 4,555 people have died from Ebola out of a total of 9,216 cases registered in seven countries, the World Health Organization says.
Symptoms of Ebola include fever, headache, diarrhea, vomiting and in some cases bleeding.
Even if a person is infected, the virus can only be passed on once symptoms appear and only through direct contact with their bodily fluids, such as mucus, semen, saliva, vomit, stool or blood.
There is no licensed treatment or vaccine for the contagious disease, but several countries are trying to develop an effective vaccine.

Modi govt deregulates diesel: Six key things you want to know about the reform pushComments
The Centre announced on Saturday that it would lift controls on diesel pricing with immediate effect in a move that led to an immediate fall in pump prices of nearly 6%. Here are six things you want to know about the move.
People agree that market-determined diesel prices free of administrative control would cut subsidies.
The cut
Diesel price goes down Rs. 3.37 with immediate effect
Why it's big?
# The government has deregulated diesel prices
# Now, oil companies will fix pump price of diesel according to crude price costs
# Diesel price will go up if crude prices rise; will fall in crude becomes cheaper
# Petrol price is already market-determined and change every fortnight
How was it earlier?
# The government fixed diesel price
# Oil companies often used to sell diesel at a loss
# The government used to subsidise oil companies to cover for this loss and keep retail diesel prices low
What led to it?
# Global crude oil prices have fallen to $84 a barrel, a fall of nearly 25% in the last six weeks
# This has helped oil companies to fully wipe out the losses on diesel price
# Since January 2013, diesel rates have cumulatively risen by Rs. 11.81 a litre in 19 instalments
# Rates of diesel were last raised on August 31 after which losses have dipped

What's in it for you?
# Fuel bills will come down or rise depending on crude oil prices
# Diesel price, like that of petrol, will likely change every fortnight
# Deregulation will push private companies like Essar and RIL to open fuel stations
# Consumers will have more choice; competition will keep prices in check
Why is fuel deregulation important?
# Market-determined fuel prices would cut subsidies
# Lower subsidy bill will help govt cut taxes on petro products
# This will help offset the shocks when global crude prices shoot up

All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary Digvijaya Singh said on Saturday that either Prime Minister Narendra Modi should keep his promise to bring black money back from abroad or step down from his post.

Talking to the media at his residence in Bhopal, Singh said Modi had promised during Lok Sabha elections that he would bring back the black money and give Rs. 3 lakh to every citizen of the country.
"As he had promised to people, he should bring back the black money and if not to every person, he should give Rs. 3 lakh to every such person who is not an income tax payee," said Singh.
He said Baba Ramdev and Narendra Modi misled people of the country by saying that a huge amount of black money has been stashed in banks abroad.
In reply to a query on the Centre not being able to disclose the names of those who had stashed black money abroad, he said, "This is what we were saying. Until there is an agreement between two countries and there are changes in law and rules of those (foreign) countries, this cannot happen."
He admitted that black money stashed in foreign banks is a big issue and it should be brought back to the country.
Talking about RSS agenda on Ram temple, he said they had nothing to do with Ram temple. "Kursi hi unka Ram Mandir hai," he said.
On Madhya Pradesh Professional Examination Board (MPPEB) exam scam, he said the matter is pending in high court and the chief justice is monitoring the case. He also said income tax department's raid on two influential people revealed names of beneficiaries who included ministers, government officials and BJP and RSS leaders.
